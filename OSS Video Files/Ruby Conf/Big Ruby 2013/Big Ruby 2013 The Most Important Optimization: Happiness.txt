Title: Big Ruby 2013 The Most Important Optimization: Happiness
Publication date: 2020-01-28
Playlist: Big Ruby 2013
Description: 
	Metaprogramming. It's awesome, right? Powerful? Maybe a little scary?

Let's kick things up a notch. If writing code that writes code is powerful, what's hacking the life of the programmer writing the code? That's got to be an 11 on the meta-meter. At least. We'll talk about some of the bad assumptions we've made, lies we've bought into, and why we have the most awesome job ever.

00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:36,069
important optimization happiness I want

00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:39,030

clicker here so you can tell I'm really

00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:47,649
an old hat at this really alright so

00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:51,099
first off how many of you all are happy

00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:52,300
right now yeah pretty happy is it just

00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:54,640
because you're at big Ruby column for

00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,110
you just happy in general and do you

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,319
know it is the other question because if

00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:02,110
you do you know what's next right oh

00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,789
nice awesome all right so you start it

00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,649
off the day with clapping and now I've

00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:08,319
actually tricked you into both hugging

00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:12,010
me and giving me applause early so so

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:14,200
that's really awesome thank you so I'm

00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:16,420
with livingsocial I live socially if you

00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,770
would like to live socially with me we

00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:21,459
can chat afterwards I'm going to hang

00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:23,350
around till tomorrow morning we're

00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:25,970
hiring

00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:27,680
so I wanted to ask you guys I mean I

00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,240
have some really good news my new year's

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,860
resolution is going phenomenally right

00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,230
now because my new year's resolution was

00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:36,710
to speak and I think I'm doing that

00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:38,390
right now so now I've got basically 10

00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:41,500
months I guess to screw around I don't

00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:45,380
have to do anything up success already

00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:46,850
the the bad news about that is this is

00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:52,370
my first time ever giving a full-length

00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:53,690
talk so there is a not negligible chance

00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:56,690
that things could go wrong in a

00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:58,430
spectacularly horrible fashion and well

00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:01,370
I guess that could be interesting too I

00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:02,840
suppose so I've been a little bit

00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,190
nervous about this talk actually and

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,410
it's not because I don't have something

00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:09,200
to say I i feel like i could probably

00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:11,810
talk to you without these slides but i'm

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,310
going to stick with him anyway but when

00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,500
i started working on the slides i called

00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:17,600
my folks and i was reminded of one very

00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:23,480
important thing apparently i have one

00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:25,250
fan and she i'm not sure about my mom

00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,780
the way that she gives compliments your

00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,710
interesting to listen to you shouldn't

00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,540
worry you're interesting to listen

00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,950
shouldn't say you're a good speaker she

00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,440
said you're interesting to listen to and

00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:37,100
i'm not sure not entirely sure how to

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,080
take that I hope she's right um so you

00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,270
might be asking is this really necessary

00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,770
is this talk really necessary and I I

00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:45,020
sure hope so because otherwise i'm about

00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:46,970
to waste 40 minutes of your lives but i

00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:50,210
would say that it's a reasonable

00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:52,880
question to ask because people kind of

00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:55,130
naturally seem to think you know they

00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,390
have happiness kind of under control

00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:58,340
right they take stock of their lives

00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,959
this it got a pretty piece in life i'm

00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,360
pretty happy and we kind of think we

00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:07,610
naturally do the things that make us

00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:10,730
happy and I don't know for me personally

00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:13,070
I guess I have to tell a story really to

00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:17,420
explain this so this is me five years

00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:20,120
old my parents got an Atari 2600 for us

00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:22,490
which rocked which dates me as well and

00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,310
I love I mean it was love at first sight

00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:27,920
I mean to tell you how much I love this

00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,330
thing you might see that I'm playing

00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,030
what's arguably the absolutely worst

00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:37,340
Atari 2600 game of all time ET

00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:40,400
I am wearing my lucky t-shirt and and

00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:42,470
I'm really really engrossed in it I'm

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,910
not sure how how it required that much

00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,820
concentration to play but apparently

00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:49,040
it's really hard stuff so about about a

00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:52,970
year later my parents brought home one

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:57,140
of these and yeah you know right pretty

00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:58,820
awesome Coco tues the thing about the

00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:01,640
color computer to that I think is most

00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:03,320
awesome actually is the the placement of

00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,540
the arrow keys which isn't really in

00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:08,750
very intuitive places on opposite sides

00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:10,310
of keyboard so that was kind of cool I

00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:14,000
thought and that was actually when I

00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:16,880
finally realized that these games that I

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,310
played were also we're also something i

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,660
could probably make one day just a show

00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,460
of hands how many of you got into

00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,590
programming because of video games but

00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,540
once one way or not a lot of people I

00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,800
kind of suspected that was the case I

00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,950
didn't think I was an anomaly in that

00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,450
case and I mean I had I had computers

00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:34,220
growing up and I mean I was surrounded

00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:38,050
by technology i grew up with this stuff

00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:40,670
right so i felt reasonably competent and

00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:42,350
then i ended up building my first

00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:44,330
computer right around the time a couple

00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,790
years after i got out of high school how

00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:49,580
many of you have built a computer before

00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:50,840
let's do you okay so then if you're like

00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,090
me and this isn't my computer but this

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,280
looks and that's not my finger tip over

00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:58,190
there but this is almost exactly what I

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,630
had to build it was a dual p2 and the

00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:02,300
thing about building computers it's not

00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:04,250
really that hard it's actually basically

00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,840
putting together a jigsaw puzzle except

00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,390
that the jigsaw puzzle is comprised of

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,670
pieces that cost hundreds of dollars so

00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:12,830
the problem with that is if you're me

00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,180
and you have a limited earning potential

00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,370
at this point in your life as you're

00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,750
stressing non-stop probably sweating all

00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:20,240
over the motherboard and everything else

00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,740
as you're assembling it so that's fun

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,750
it's not nothing like nothing like

00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,430
sweating all over the thing to help

00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:28,730
electronics I think moisture is good for

00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:29,870
them right and I really really stressed

00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,730
when I was putting this thing together I

00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,470
spent I don't know half an hour or so

00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:35,540
plugging everything in checking

00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:37,670
everything making sure everything was

00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,750
just right because I was terrified that

00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:42,770
the first time I press the power button

00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:43,940
it's going to explode and I had it in a

00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,639
full tower case because that's how I

00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:49,930
roll nevermind i couldn't lift the

00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:51,430
but half the thing part way up help get

00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:54,069
some help to slide the thing on to a

00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:56,349
desk and press the power button and

00:06:54,069 --> 00:06:57,729
absolutely nothing happens I mean I was

00:06:56,349 --> 00:07:00,279
mortified oh so this is this is

00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:02,169
absolutely horrible this is not going as

00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:04,180
planned so I checked and rechecked

00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:06,039
everything and I started unseating

00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,400
memory and plugging things back in

00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:12,400
receding the CPUs and everything else

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,650
and this is 15 minutes or so go buy of

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:19,300
this and i found the problems anybody

00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:21,879
care to guess what the problem was as it

00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:26,229
turns out in order to power on a desktop

00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:28,479
computer you must first plug it in so I

00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:30,400
learned this and I guess I guess my

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,139
takeaway is that sometimes when you're

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,629
immersed in stuff when you really really

00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:36,550
think you kind of have all the all that

00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:39,189
easy stuff covered you miss the easy

00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:41,110
stuff so sometimes and you'll thank me

00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:43,719
for putting this on two slides because i

00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:48,159
know you'll want to taunt me later i am

00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:51,250
an idiot and i would go so far as to say

00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:54,069
that sometimes maybe you guys are idiots

00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:56,050
to now i think most of the time you're

00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:59,439
smart and also you're very attractive so

00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:01,629
so there's that but but i think that we

00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:04,149
have a tendency whenever we think we

00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:06,219
sort of know what's going on and i think

00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:09,219
we sort of have the answers to make some

00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:11,439
bad assumptions so we say oh you know

00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:13,599
this is this is definitely how someone

00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,520
is going to use my app or this is how

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,199
someone you know how I'm going to live

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,569
my life we just assume that it's going

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:25,120
to work out and sometimes we skip steps

00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:27,849
now in programming we have a technique

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,589
that we use to avoid making assumptions

00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:32,140
making bad assumptions and skipping

00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:37,120
steps what is it that we tend to do as

00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:40,120
programmers right we do we do TDD right

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,279
so we go through this red green refactor

00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,690
process where we describe what we want

00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:44,949
to do and then we see whether or not

00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:48,190
we're doing it and then we make it

00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:49,660
better right and it seems to me strange

00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:52,120
that we're so good at doing that

00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:54,760
whenever we write code I mean we are

00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,250
test obsessed in a lot of cases but when

00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,110
we live our life we don't sort of set up

00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,279
goals in the same sort of way and kind

00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,560
of

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:05,910
intentional about it so gone ahead and

00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:07,259
rewritten the spec here and there's I

00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:10,139
don't know what do you think is that a

00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:12,569
good spec is that a does that cover a

00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:13,949
lot it maybe you don't like specs that's

00:09:12,569 --> 00:09:19,170
okay I've got mini tests for you too if

00:09:13,949 --> 00:09:21,029
you prefer so I think this spec and this

00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,589
test suck I mean this is a horrible

00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:24,180
tests right it's either it's either All

00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:25,680
or Nothing right it doesn't it doesn't

00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,089
split things down into something

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,269
granular that you can kind of approach

00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:31,290
in a in a sensible way and begin to get

00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:33,569
a sense of whether you're heading in the

00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,920
right direction so let's go back to red

00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:37,589
green refactor for a second and think

00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,720
about it so what is red really red is

00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:40,800
making it clear red is making clear what

00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,339
it is that you're trying to accomplish

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,259
right Green is making it real so you've

00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:48,240
set expectations now you make reality

00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:51,600
line up with the expectations in some

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,069
way and at the refactor point you're

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,670
trying to improve it in some way trying

00:09:53,069 --> 00:09:58,439
to make it better so I guess we should

00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:00,389
probably define what better is before we

00:09:58,439 --> 00:10:03,509
move forward and given the title of the

00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:05,100
talk I'm going to hope that better means

00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:08,939
it's more conducive to your own

00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:10,680
happiness so before I ever actually

00:10:08,939 --> 00:10:12,870
submitted this talk I started sitting

00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:16,410
down and writing out huge list of things

00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:17,819
that I thought made me happy I mean I

00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:20,639
ended up with dozens and dozens and

00:10:17,819 --> 00:10:22,529
dozens of things and kind of started

00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,899
categorizing them kind of figuring out

00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:29,129
you know well can I find any common

00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:30,809
thread here and then I decided maybe

00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:33,180
whenever I get the talk acceptance

00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:35,040
anyway I should probably do some

00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,079
research because maybe I'm supposed to

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,490
actually know about this stuff so i went

00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:40,319
to wikipedia and i learned a little bit

00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:44,459
of what win described earlier which is

00:10:40,319 --> 00:10:46,199
that is an endless endless journey turns

00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:50,069
out psychologists are really interesting

00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:52,459
by the way so brief aside psychology

00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:56,429
they always used to approach things

00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:58,920
using a disease model so so what that

00:10:56,429 --> 00:11:00,809
means is let's say let's say they're

00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,429
trying to make you less bad right

00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:03,509
they're not trying to improve things so

00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:06,809
they're trying to take you from let's

00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:08,069
say you're a negative 6 on a scale they

00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:10,649
want to bring you to a negative 2 and

00:11:08,069 --> 00:11:12,420
say that's a win awesome you are now

00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:15,389
like a negative 2 where you were really

00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:17,370
really unhappy before and then this this

00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:18,800
movement called positive psychology got

00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,570
started and they started to say well

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,329
there actually might be some way that we

00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:26,100
can take people and bring them maybe in

00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:27,269
two positive numbers in terms of their

00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,880
overall happiness we could use

00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:31,110
psychology to actually you know improve

00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,389
their life as opposed to just make it

00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,709
suck less and that was that was pretty

00:11:33,389 --> 00:11:37,889
interesting and one of the guys who was

00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:40,620
a pioneer of that movement is dr. Martin

00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:42,240
Seligman who is actually like 70 years

00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:45,000
old now but when I found this photo of

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,930
this dude I mean this is a guy that

00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,029
knows how to have fun right here so so

00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:54,149
Marty I'm gonna call him Marty I hope

00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:57,180
that's ok Marty Marty had this whole

00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:58,440
this whole theory and he's been working

00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,940
on it for a year onion the guys been

00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,820
doing this I think for the past 15 years

00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:05,399
or so and one of the interesting things

00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,740
is that he said that happiness is one of

00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:09,029
the aspects right positive emotions

00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,680
right but that all these other things

00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:12,630
engagement we call that flow it's

00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,130
whenever you get engaged in some kind of

00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:16,860
a challenging activity that's also

00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:18,990
happens to be enjoyable relationships

00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,610
meaning achievement he took all of these

00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:21,930
things and basically said they sit

00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:25,380
alongside happiness but they're not

00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:27,060
happiness and I kind of get that right

00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,880
like meaning is important but I think

00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:32,670
that when you or I talk about happiness

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,529
we lump a sense of meaning into that we

00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,600
lump you know a sense of achievement

00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:40,350
into that those things tend to improve

00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,990
our overall happiness and so I got I got

00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:44,519
pretty bored with some of this with some

00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:46,050
of this research I mean I started

00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,399
watching that I'll watch Marty's videos

00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:49,140
he had some really interesting videos

00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,010
he's given talks at Ted you really

00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,230
should go look him up he's an

00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:54,329
interesting dude but I just really I

00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:56,310
just the more I dug into it i started to

00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:59,010
thank gosh this is this is going nowhere

00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:01,890
and I need something that can really

00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:03,600
help me help me kind of get through this

00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:05,490
in a way that I can apply it to my life

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,740
and this just didn't strike me I mean

00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:09,870
very academic I mean granted The Dude's

00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,730
a PhD he should probably approach it

00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:14,910
academically but I wanted something I

00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:17,519
could apply to my life and so as I got

00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:19,589
through this boredom I finally came back

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:23,610
to my original list that's my favorite

00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:26,140
too I came back to my original list and

00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:28,200
my original list this is my version of

00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:31,950
everything Marty had to say basically

00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:36,460
happiness comes down to three aspects

00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:41,710
resources to do stuff stuff to do and

00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:43,210
people to do stuff with and that's it

00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:44,650
those three things and you may think oh

00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:47,530
no I have this other thing right like

00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:49,660
maybe I really enjoy having nice art on

00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:51,190
my walls but that's an activity you want

00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,270
to look at the art on your walls or you

00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,710
want to be able to tell your friends

00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:57,880
that you have the art on the walls like

00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:59,830
that's very classy right so then I

00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:03,280
decided that since perma was cool and I

00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:04,930
was able to remember perma that I should

00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,790
probably come up with an acronym or

00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:08,920
maybe a picture or something to give us

00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:12,340
a mnemonics so because I love you all

00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:14,860
and because you gave me hugs I gave you

00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:17,800
not one but both a picture and an

00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:19,420
acronym it's car and it's the freaking

00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,250
Batmobile it's not just any car so

00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:24,960
you're going to remember it the original

00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:26,620
Batmobile so and what car stands for is

00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,990
capacity activities and relationships

00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:30,730
and it just bundles down to those same

00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:33,040
three things I just said capacity

00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:35,740
resources to do stuff activities stuff

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,240
to do and relationships people to do the

00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,310
stuff with right because when it comes

00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,600
back down to it you know the at the end

00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:42,100
of our lives we're going to look back on

00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,300
the things that we did we're going to

00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:46,480
look back on the activities that we

00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:48,820
engaged in and we're going to say at a

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,030
good life I hope I mean that's the goal

00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:54,550
so this is this is my theory but I am

00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:56,740
going to let Marty ride shotgun and you

00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:58,060
definitely should check out should check

00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:00,130
out some of his stuff as well because

00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:03,010
he's a smart dude it just it just wasn't

00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:06,310
working for me so I want to drill in and

00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:08,740
talk a little bit about capacity so

00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:12,250
first off you know you need time and

00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:15,610
money to be able to do something and I

00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:17,050
want to before I go any further people

00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:19,060
say time is money all the time and it

00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:21,960
it's really really aggravates me because

00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:24,520
they are so incredibly different I mean

00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:26,920
yes you can trade time for money in

00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,690
certain ways but the exchange rate is so

00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,900
different depending on the person that

00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:34,690
you're dealing with and you can't really

00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:36,460
get more time you have the same 24 hours

00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:40,000
in your day but you may have plenty more

00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:42,040
money so it's one of those things that I

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,200
think anyway it's really really

00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,910
important to guard I am super protective

00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:52,270
of my time not that I don't waste it but

00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:54,280
I wasted on my terms and so physical

00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:55,600
capacity on the flip side you have

00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,760
physical mental capacity physical

00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,230
capacity would be you're probably not

00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,720
going to start doing mountain climbing

00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:03,160
without having trained first so you know

00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,360
if you're physically exhausted you're

00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,130
not going to be able to go out and have

00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,190
a good time you in fact you have the

00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:12,310
time and the money to do so on the

00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:13,510
activities side they can be fun they can

00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:15,400
be junk these are obviously a

00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:18,010
non-exhaustive list right but the idea

00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,810
is you may get one or more of these

00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,340
hopefully all of these in one single

00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:23,260
activity in which case you're going to

00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:27,160
check off a lot of boxes in terms of

00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:29,590
making yourself feel overall happy and

00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,650
on the relationship side you know you

00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:33,730
have family you have friends you have

00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:36,010
professional and romantic relationships

00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:39,040
as well and the potential for those

00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:40,480
things right that is what maybe get you

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,430
out of bed in the morning right like oh

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,040
I might make a great awesome networking

00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:48,070
connection today or I might meet the man

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,960
or woman of my dreams so I think of

00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:51,370
these things a lot like if you're

00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,610
familiar with Maslow's hierarchy of

00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:57,040
needs right um he says that you have to

00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:58,839
have so much of one thing before another

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,690
thing becomes relevant but in general

00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:04,180
you get diminishing returns once you end

00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:06,160
up getting to a certain level in any

00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:08,199
given any given one of these things

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,390
physiological needs safety needs and so

00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:12,189
forth so physiological needs something

00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:13,510
like food for instance if you don't know

00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:14,770
where your next meal is going to be

00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:16,180
coming from you're probably not going to

00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:17,890
be on the esteem part of the ladder

00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,240
worrying about just how you feel or what

00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,860
you've achieved today because you don't

00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,959
know where you're going to eat on the

00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,790
flip side you don't have to be eating

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,260
filet mignon every single night before

00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,459
you start worrying about safety and

00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,750
whether or not somebody's going to break

00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:32,860
into your house and murder you in your

00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:33,970
sleep so i guess i would say that in a

00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,280
similar way you should be looking for

00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,600
trade-offs among the things that we

00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:42,070
talked about earlier in terms of

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:44,920
resources and and the activities that

00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:46,300
you might want to do and start to be

00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,160
intentional about the choices that you

00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,990
make that's really what red green furry

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,550
factors all about it's about making

00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:53,830
choices and then going and falling

00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:55,330
through on the choices it's not just let

00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,890
life happen it's not writing that one

00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:58,179
speck that says life should be awesome

00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:01,029
and then checking every day and saying

00:17:58,179 --> 00:18:02,500
whether or not it was that's going to

00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:05,740
require one important thing which is

00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:10,720
that you run your specs or tests you

00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:12,580
know whatever and for me you know in my

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,200
life that's that's generally happens

00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,419
it's a it's a point of reflection right

00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:20,049
it's what am i thankful for in the day

00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:22,240
and what am i what am I may be unhappy

00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:23,710
about or worried about what is what is

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,260
the stuff that would be a considered a

00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:28,419
net negative on the day for me that

00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:30,519
happens when I pray for you it might be

00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:33,070
when you met it after you've meditated

00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:35,409
or just on a time or reflection we have

00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:37,750
a long drive just kind of chilling out

00:18:35,409 --> 00:18:40,350
listen like listening to nothing except

00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:43,029
what's going through your head and I

00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:44,850
would say that you need to take the time

00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:47,710
to do that you need to make the time

00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:49,179
only because if you don't take the time

00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:51,460
to reflect on this stuff then it's the

00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:52,929
same as writing a great test suite and

00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:57,480
then never bothering to run it and check

00:18:52,929 --> 00:18:59,889
where you are on on the achievements so

00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,840
before I go too far into some of the

00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:03,909
things we might try to do to check off

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,799
some of these boxes and the metrics that

00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:07,659
we've set up now we have metrics so

00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:09,789
let's start figuring out how we can how

00:19:07,659 --> 00:19:13,179
we can begin to meet them and raised

00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:17,500
them exercise nutrition and sleep these

00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:20,649
are huge see what I did there if you

00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:22,269
these three things these three things

00:19:20,649 --> 00:19:24,519
are actually going to help you in

00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:27,490
basically every other area that you try

00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:29,320
to work on so and if you could I can

00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:33,490
fear off topic for a second i guess i

00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:36,399
can got the mic exercise out of the

00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:38,019
three if you can only pick one do that

00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:39,309
one because the other two are going to

00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:42,850
naturally follow and i learned this

00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:45,100
firsthand in fact a lot of the stuff

00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:48,700
here going back to the I'm an idiot

00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:50,590
thing unfortunately I've learned a lot

00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,000
of things by doing them wrong and if

00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:54,070
intelligence is learning from your own

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,149
mistakes and wisdom is learning from the

00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:57,429
mistakes of others have heard that

00:19:55,149 --> 00:20:02,529
before then you guys are going to leave

00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:05,260
here so freaking wise exercise if you do

00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:07,059
it is going to first off make you

00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,720
physically exhausted and going to aid

00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:08,950
you if you're

00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,179
not sleeping well or whatever you're

00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:12,630
going to you're gonna want to get good

00:20:10,179 --> 00:20:14,650
sleep the other thing is is that I

00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:17,140
started to realize after I started

00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:18,700
exercising that all of those people

00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:20,470
giving me all of that nutritional advice

00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:23,740
weren't actually full of it like once I

00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:25,750
started to it John was what I'm talking

00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,700
about it's like once I actually started

00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,929
to exert myself I started to care a lot

00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,309
more about the kind of fuel that I was

00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:33,070
putting in my body because I felt like

00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:36,539
complete crap if I didn't and so gave me

00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:39,070
motivation to take care of myself better

00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:40,299
so after we've got those out of the way

00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:42,460
and we just know that those are things

00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:46,210
that are going to increase our capacity

00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:48,250
to do other things then we would start

00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:50,710
to look for things you know the holy

00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:52,720
grail of optimizing for happiness would

00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:54,490
be stuff that really meets at the

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,080
intersection of your relationships your

00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,070
activities and your capacity if there's

00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,470
something that can have a positive

00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:03,700
influence or a negative influence then

00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:05,830
you should be very carefully focused on

00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,929
on that particular that particular thing

00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:09,070
because it's going to have a drastic

00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:10,840
impact and your overall level of

00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:12,730
happiness and as it turns out there is

00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,799
one thing that comes to mind immediately

00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:18,130
that has a drastic impact on all of

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:20,500
those things it's location where you

00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:24,640
choose to live your life is going to

00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:27,580
have a drastic drastic effect on just

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,500
about every other aspect of your life so

00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,970
do you guys remember these I love to

00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,289
these things when I was a kid the spot

00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:34,270
the difference things I know at least

00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:36,640
two of you have probably already started

00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:38,140
looking that's not what I'm gonna be a

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,730
general idea right as you see two

00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,200
pictures there subtly different in some

00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:43,240
way and you start to find the

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,530
differences and you know you feel really

00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,650
full yourself whenever you find out you

00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:50,470
got them all and I want to play that

00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:53,049
game with you real quickly here are two

00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:54,640
code samples they both do the exact same

00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:56,770
thing when they run them but once subtly

00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,809
different than the other can you spot

00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:04,289
the difference let me give you a second

00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:04,289
maybe take a drink

00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:14,260
right so the difference is the one on

00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,460
the left was coated in Louisville and

00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:20,650
the one on the right was coated in san

00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:23,410
francisco right that really wasn't fair

00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:24,760
i'm sorry i'm i'm completely trolling

00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:26,950
you here i'll give you another one this

00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:32,830
one's a little easier ok spot the

00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:34,990
difference in this case i think it's

00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:38,050
probably a little easier throw you a

00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:39,340
slow ball and you know this is i'm not

00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:41,559
picking on san francisco i know we have

00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:43,360
yeah more folks out there and san

00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:47,200
Francisco's great and it might be for

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:48,820
you but for me personally when I started

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,830
to look at the cost of living for some

00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,780
of these some of these jobs that I was

00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:56,470
being recruited for I had a really hard

00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:58,179
time justifying moving somewhere moving

00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:00,010
my family I mean I lived directly across

00:22:58,179 --> 00:23:02,410
the road for my kids school which is

00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:04,510
huge by the way I mean like in terms of

00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:06,280
convenience it's hard to get better than

00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:08,500
that there are things like that that I

00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:11,920
just you know I would be loath to give

00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:13,179
up to to go spend that much 645 percent

00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,730
i want to make make a point to because

00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:18,190
for some reason math is hard this down

00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:20,790
here 136 percent more expensive is not

00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:23,440
thirty six percent like more it's

00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:24,850
actually over twice when they say more

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,730
expensive it's not a hundred and thirty

00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:29,620
six percent of the amount it's increased

00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:32,590
by one hundred thirty six percent that's

00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:36,070
a drastic difference and the thing about

00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:37,750
it is your physical location I've got a

00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:39,370
handy chart here of the things that we

00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,900
talked about before let me just go ahead

00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:43,690
and tick off the the aspects that

00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:45,910
physical location actually covers you

00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:47,770
know in your life it has impact on all

00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:49,929
of these things it has impact on how far

00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:52,750
you your money is going to go it has

00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:56,290
impact at the macro level like if you in

00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:59,110
terms of cost of living that way but

00:23:56,290 --> 00:24:00,490
also at the micro level if you choose to

00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,960
move to a neighborhood that's closer to

00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:03,460
where you work if you do work in a

00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:07,120
physical location that you have to be

00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:08,380
then it has impact on your time and all

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,450
of these other things I mean you you're

00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:13,900
probably not going to do much scuba

00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:15,910
diving if you live in Kansas so you know

00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,870
if you are big into scuba diving maybe

00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:20,140
you want to go somewhere where they have

00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:22,000
a little more water and so forth now

00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,630
here is the impact of physical location

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,710
on your

00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:30,160
you to an employer that's that's it it's

00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:31,690
a handy chart I think now now I will

00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,250
admit that's only for qualified

00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:35,440
employers right and what do we mean by

00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,880
qualified well you're probably going to

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,740
have objections as soon as I say this

00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,420
and there's I know that there are a

00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:42,910
number of people who work for enterprise

00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:44,560
companies out there right now so I want

00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:46,360
to I want to apologize in advance if

00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,710
you're like immediately red flags like

00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,970
no no you're all wrong we'll get to that

00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:54,310
in a second because I'm going to skip it

00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:56,350
for now um I did some research and not

00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:57,540
too long ago the US Census Bureau came

00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:01,810
up with some really interesting

00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:04,840
statistics right I want to look at this

00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:07,090
resentment this is x 1000 right so there

00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,980
are over three million poor Schmucks in

00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:10,920
this country that are spending 90 plus

00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:14,740
minutes commuting to work one way

00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:17,260
they're giving up at minimum three hours

00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:21,310
of their day in order to get to their

00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:22,600
job when I started pulling out a

00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:24,970
calculator and adding up some of these

00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,320
numbers and over 1 in 3 people i don't

00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:27,490
know if that's the case for people in

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,610
this room or not it'd be really curious

00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:32,830
actually how many of you spend at least

00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:36,700
at least a half an hour in a commute to

00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:38,650
your job wow that held up almost

00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:42,250
perfectly true that's like one in three

00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:44,470
of you I expected that for some reason

00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:48,670
to be lower in the development business

00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:50,290
and I think partly because you know if

00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:54,700
you think about it you know where is it

00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:57,880
that you really want to be for me it

00:25:54,700 --> 00:26:01,720
certainly wasn't in a car or on a bus or

00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:04,480
on a train you know for a for at least

00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,190
an hour of my life everyday think about

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,420
this let's say you have an 18 hour day

00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:09,460
you're spending over five percent of

00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:11,770
your day getting to where it is you want

00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:13,330
to be and life is just too short to

00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:19,120
spend so much of it in between the

00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:20,590
places you truly want to be so there are

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,890
two ways to approach this right and it

00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:25,690
comes back to the experience matching up

00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:28,090
with or your expectation matching up

00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:30,940
with your reality right you can either

00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:33,700
shift your expectation and try your

00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:35,830
darkness to make better use of the time

00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,210
like say you have a long commute

00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:39,370
make that the time that you reflect on

00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:41,169
your day make that make that useful to

00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:42,549
decompress as you come home from work or

00:26:41,169 --> 00:26:44,140
something like that find a way to be

00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:46,480
happy with it so that it is where you

00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:49,750
want to be or you change something about

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,100
about your situation so I mentioned we

00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:53,110
would get back to some objections you

00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:55,330
might have about my my assertions

00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:58,929
regarding physical location and whether

00:26:55,330 --> 00:27:03,010
or not you can work remotely so the

00:26:58,929 --> 00:27:04,659
impetus for this talk was really a blog

00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:07,090
post that I had written a while back and

00:27:04,659 --> 00:27:09,429
submitted to hacker news and as you

00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:10,630
might imagine me making the assertion

00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:12,279
that I would rather live in Louisville

00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:15,610
than San Francisco didn't go over too

00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:16,929
well with the startup crowd there were

00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:18,730
actually some really supportive comments

00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:19,659
in there my point wasn't that everybody

00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:21,130
should move to louisville though you

00:27:19,659 --> 00:27:24,549
totally should come visit sometime I

00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:25,960
have an extra bedroom it's fine um my

00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:29,830
point was that my point was that you

00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:32,740
should be able to find what works for

00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:34,600
you dictate how you want to live your

00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:36,340
life where you want to live your life

00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:40,480
and then once that really big decision

00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:41,919
is made start to work out all the other

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,419
stuff because the other stuff is small

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:48,820
the other stuff is really little and so

00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:52,960
the top rated comment on the the hacker

00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:54,549
news posting for this this article I'm

00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,470
only going to read a part of it as well

00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:57,909
get to the rest of it later but the

00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:59,590
single biggest problem with working

00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:01,240
remotely is that you have to be

00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:03,159
excellent at a lot of things that don't

00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,929
matter when you're on site and since

00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:06,639
your energy is a zero-sum game being

00:28:04,929 --> 00:28:09,460
excellent at these things steals energy

00:28:06,639 --> 00:28:11,320
from building so the really cool thing

00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:12,340
is there's ten bullet points here all

00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,870
the points are great because you can

00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:18,850
refute them in a very systematic way I

00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:20,769
went ahead and split these two two sets

00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:22,330
of bullet points into two groups two

00:28:20,769 --> 00:28:23,880
groups nicely matched up a five we're

00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:26,380
going to label the first one wrong and

00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,890
the second group is what is this i don't

00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:31,250
even

00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:34,400
so working through these will start with

00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:37,460
the with the low-hanging fruit first so

00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:38,960
apparently that's there's a comment

00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,280
honestly I do believe they're probably

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,010
people in this room who if you don't

00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:44,630
think this your employer does that you

00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:46,190
need to be excellent in dealing with

00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:48,920
conference calls and web-based meetings

00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:50,960
if you are working remotely that's a

00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,430
non-issue because unless you only ever

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,930
work with people that are in the same

00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:56,210
building as you you never have any

00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:57,590
customers at all which would suck to be

00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:59,660
you if you don't have any customers

00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:01,310
you're probably going to have to deal

00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:03,410
with meetings in some way shape or form

00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:04,730
and I doubt that every single prospect

00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:07,880
is going to come to your office to meet

00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:09,830
you so I don't really I don't see where

00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,390
that one weighs in at all now the other

00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:13,490
ones are kind of grouped up by two

00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:15,200
actually so this building relationships

00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:16,910
without benefit of breaks and meals and

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,570
understanding the human terrain the

00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:21,650
human terrain who writes this stuff

00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:24,250
understanding the human terrain without

00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:27,680
benefit of gossip and the water cooler

00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:29,900
well that's politics and I would tell

00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,220
you this if that is a significant

00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:33,500
portion of your job if that is a

00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:35,210
significant thing that you have to focus

00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,830
on your mental energy that should be

00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:39,400
spent on creating value for your

00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:41,120
employer and for your customers run

00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:44,000
seriously you're in a toxic environment

00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,350
that is screwed up and then as far as

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,390
the last two being noticed and

00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:49,880
recognized for who you really are by new

00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:52,880
people and being included when you're

00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:54,410
out of sight out of mind well that

00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,210
really smacks of insecurity to me

00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:58,880
because the fact of the matter is is yes

00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:01,520
you do you do need to reach out and make

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,800
yourself known but you don't need people

00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,750
to be able to come up like see you every

00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:08,180
day and come over and pat pat you on the

00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:11,690
back and say great job on writing that

00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:14,660
CSV import or Joe or whatever the the

00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:17,270
general idea is that you should be able

00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:19,280
to do good work and then know how to

00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:22,160
push that information out there to the

00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:24,500
people that need to know now as far as

00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:26,000
the wrong stuff up here the interesting

00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,650
thing about this is preparing precise

00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,330
specs interpreting for spice specs

00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:31,690
writing precisely emails in turn eight

00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:34,340
he kind of stretched it out a little bit

00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:36,590
this is all really boiling down to

00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:39,160
written communication which is seriously

00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:41,889
important so why am I labeling it wrong

00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:44,359
because of this

00:30:41,889 --> 00:30:45,649
apparently these things don't matter if

00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:46,999
you're on site you shouldn't be good at

00:30:45,649 --> 00:30:51,169
written communication if you're on site

00:30:46,999 --> 00:30:53,690
just a bonus so we've narrowed it down

00:30:51,169 --> 00:30:55,879
to written communication being one of

00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:59,840
the only valid things that that was

00:30:55,879 --> 00:31:00,889
brought up here and I've got probably

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,960
something that's not going to be a lot

00:31:00,889 --> 00:31:05,359
of news to most of you but programming

00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,509
is written communication think about it

00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:11,119
when you write code you're writing for

00:31:08,509 --> 00:31:13,729
one of the most inflexible unforgiving

00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:16,249
literal readers in the world your

00:31:13,729 --> 00:31:19,309
compiler or your interpreter but you're

00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:21,349
also writing for a future you you're

00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:23,629
writing for your teammates you're trying

00:31:21,349 --> 00:31:25,129
to reveal intent otherwise we would all

00:31:23,629 --> 00:31:27,019
be unrolling our loops whenever we were

00:31:25,129 --> 00:31:29,809
writing our Ruby code you know we

00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:31,729
wouldn't bother we wouldn't bother with

00:31:29,809 --> 00:31:33,049
using a compiler at all in fact why not

00:31:31,729 --> 00:31:36,259
just write assembly it's certainly very

00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:40,249
readable um so the point is is we when

00:31:36,259 --> 00:31:43,549
we program we are writing code we are

00:31:40,249 --> 00:31:45,619
writing intention revealing

00:31:43,549 --> 00:31:47,299
documentation at the same time even if

00:31:45,619 --> 00:31:49,190
even if we don't document our code which

00:31:47,299 --> 00:31:50,330
hopefully you do your code should be

00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:51,979
written in a way that somebody reading

00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:53,659
it gets a sense of your intent those

00:31:51,979 --> 00:31:56,119
people are going to be reading it with

00:31:53,659 --> 00:31:59,210
certain assumptions or maybe picking up

00:31:56,119 --> 00:32:00,619
nuances and looking for intent so

00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:03,109
programming is written communication so

00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:04,399
then I guess if that's the case then the

00:32:03,109 --> 00:32:06,200
single biggest problem with working

00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:13,099
remotely is that you have to be

00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:14,330
excellent so be excellent now you guys

00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:16,460
are already taken steps in the direction

00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:19,399
because you're standing here or sitting

00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:21,649
here at the moment in a conference

00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:24,139
designed to help you learn new things

00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:25,789
right you're already taking a step is

00:32:24,139 --> 00:32:26,779
there anybody here who doesn't want to

00:32:25,789 --> 00:32:31,970
be excellent go ahead and raise your

00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:33,320
hands if you don't want to be x1 all

00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:36,679
right we have one we have one

00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:38,629
underachiever all right so you're going

00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:41,720
to say whoa whoa wait a minute now I

00:32:38,629 --> 00:32:44,419
don't I don't get this I have rent to

00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:46,489
pay I have a day job I don't have time

00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:48,169
to go around working on my written

00:32:46,489 --> 00:32:50,359
communication skills when I work in an

00:32:48,169 --> 00:32:52,190
office full of people that already want

00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:54,619
face time anyway and they want to deal

00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:55,220
with me face to face I mean what do you

00:32:54,619 --> 00:32:56,990
think I

00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:58,190
where am I going to get this experience

00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:59,929
it's not like i can just go out

00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:02,210
somewhere and just find this this

00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:04,220
community that i can engage with and

00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:05,600
deal with in a way that would help me

00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,400
learn how to be part of a distributed

00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,490
team or anything it's not like that kind

00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:14,570
of thing exam init hold on a second it

00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:17,780
does open source is exactly that if you

00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:20,419
can manage to start an open source

00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:22,700
project and convince people who are not

00:33:20,419 --> 00:33:24,350
being financially compensated to take

00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,820
part in your open source project and to

00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:27,289
contribute meaningfully and you can

00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:33,740
communicate with them in a meaningful

00:33:27,289 --> 00:33:36,289
way to achieve some n then party on

00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:39,919
dudes because you're already you're

00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:41,960
already being excellent and I guess I

00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:45,559
should probably I should probably stop

00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:47,780
there for a second and say if you aren't

00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:50,360
able to maybe start your own project at

00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:52,490
least go find someone else's project to

00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:54,350
contribute to ask them what they need

00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:56,330
communicate with them about what you did

00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:57,500
you'd like to have on the project that

00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:58,820
they're working on and then see if you

00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:01,460
can collaborate with them in some way

00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:03,770
this stuff works it really does if you

00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:05,419
don't know how to work on a distributed

00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:07,010
team you will learn very quickly if you

00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:08,419
start to participate in contribute to

00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:15,080
open source it's an extremely valuable

00:34:08,419 --> 00:34:16,580
thing to be able to do so code is not

00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:19,399
your product I don't want to make it all

00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:21,260
about code right in fact you are your

00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:22,220
product and everything you bring to the

00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:27,109
table including the written

00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:29,179
communication skills and if you are your

00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:32,839
product I guess that also makes you your

00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:34,580
product manager that's really cool

00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:36,830
because product managers get to decide

00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:38,929
what the feature set is so you get to

00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:40,310
determine you know what is it that I'm

00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:42,379
going to learn today what is it that I'm

00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:44,179
going to going to start to offer to my

00:34:42,379 --> 00:34:49,070
potential employers my current and

00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:51,470
future employers you get to decide where

00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:53,389
your services are located right and if

00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:57,349
that doesn't work out it seems to be

00:34:53,389 --> 00:35:00,320
strange that that employers often times

00:34:57,349 --> 00:35:03,290
seem to exert so much control over where

00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:06,320
we get to live our lives I have another

00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:08,570
question for you how many of you have

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,660
been approached with some

00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:14,150
reasonable semblance of interest in a

00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:16,490
job offering in the past six months from

00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:18,590
our recruiter or any either internal or

00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:20,180
external recruiter all right we got

00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:27,500
about half them keep your hands up for a

00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:30,590
second three months past month most of

00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:34,520
the hands are still up so cool I just

00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:37,370
have a question then if it's that much

00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:41,720
in need if our skill set is that much in

00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:43,940
need why is it that that someone is

00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:45,500
going to dictate to us where it is we

00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:47,930
need to be located in order to actually

00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:50,720
do our jobs why would an employer who

00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:52,190
wants to get the best candidates say we

00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,690
only want the best candidates if they

00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:56,630
either live or are willing to live in

00:35:53,690 --> 00:36:00,980
this sphere that is approximately 25 25

00:35:56,630 --> 00:36:02,060
miles in diameter around our office that

00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:05,390
doesn't make sense that's not good

00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:07,370
business for the employer either so then

00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:10,430
you have the power I want to I want to

00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:12,320
stop here for a second because this was

00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:14,540
work right here there's some there's a

00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,400
site you guys remember Colorforms right

00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:18,290
the things when you put the most there's

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,790
a site called the cartoon doll emporium

00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:21,590
where I actually painstakingly assembled

00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:24,440
the he-man and Shera that you see before

00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:29,060
you so because I love you this is what

00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:32,510
you get so I don't really know how this

00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:35,300
happened how this this this this power

00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:37,280
kind of flipped around and we gave it we

00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:39,350
gave it to the employers to dictate such

00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:42,140
big things to us about like where we

00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:45,200
live but i think it probably came from

00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:48,140
you know my folks grew up with with with

00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:50,420
parents and in a family that that had

00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:52,910
been through World War two right and I

00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:56,180
think at some point you know when you

00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:58,510
look back at their generation there was

00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:00,620
a significant there was a significant

00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:02,300
portion of the population that had a

00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:05,180
good shot at doing some kind of hard

00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:07,790
manual labor and eventually eventually

00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:11,900
retiring with a pension from their

00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:13,340
company now that's that's really good

00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,540
and I'm glad that they were able to do

00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:17,090
that but that's not the world that we

00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:19,940
really live in today and the past couple

00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:21,500
of job changes that I've made have

00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,160
almost invariably been towards smaller

00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,690
companies

00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:27,850
I used to work in the cable industry

00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:31,070
which was interesting we can talk later

00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:32,150
but the thing about it was when I start

00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:34,220
when I moved out of the cable industry

00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:35,630
and I called my folks to tell me tell

00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,980
them I have this great job and it's way

00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:38,860
more in line with what it is I want to

00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:41,330
do with my life they said are you sure

00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:44,000
that was their first response and it was

00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:45,560
I mean you saw my mom she's a sweet lady

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,150
right so she wasn't she didn't mean

00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:50,030
anything by it but the fact of the

00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:51,740
matter is she didn't she was worried for

00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:53,690
me she thought I was giving up some kind

00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:56,950
of security that I had had by having

00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:59,570
worked in this job for 47 plus years and

00:37:56,950 --> 00:38:01,070
I'll admit that this one's not really

00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:04,010
technically related but my inner eighth

00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:07,430
grader had to include this this this

00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:10,460
poster I apologize if you don't have an

00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:12,800
inner eighth grader and so somewhere

00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:17,090
along the line somewhere along the line

00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:18,470
we we decided that we were going to team

00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:20,300
up with management right and the

00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:21,740
management was going to lead us lead us

00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:24,380
into the future and we needed to follow

00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:28,220
them and maybe eventually one day we

00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:29,750
could be managers too I'm not sure with

00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:31,430
and also what is it with these old

00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:33,740
posters and why do they write like who

00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:35,240
people are on their butts this is like

00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:36,980
this is always the cat all the old

00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,150
cartoons i have ever seen that if they

00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:40,940
need to illustrate i don't know if they

00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:43,250
think we're that dense or the plans for

00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:45,500
the future opportunity you know okay

00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:48,500
whatever i'm getting off topic here so

00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:53,030
it really came down to the idea that i

00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:55,040
had job security and I believe that job

00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:56,840
security is a myth I believe that

00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,460
anywhere that you're going to work

00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,920
you're going to sign an employment

00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:02,750
at-will agreement what essentially is

00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:05,540
going to say that you can leave anytime

00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:07,580
you want and they can let you go anytime

00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:10,820
they want I think that's fine I don't

00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:13,730
think that it isn't that employers don't

00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:16,100
mean well an employer may have a very

00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:18,590
good intention of letting you stay with

00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:20,300
them until until you're old and gray but

00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:23,540
that employer may not be around in five

00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:27,230
or ten years so you have to invest in

00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:29,050
yourself you have to spend time looking

00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:31,280
at what it is you want to do and

00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:32,330
building those skills because it's going

00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,260
to make you happier in the long run

00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:39,280
that's what job security looks like

00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:42,460
and the thing about job security is you

00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,170
know our brains love it because if we

00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:46,150
feel like we have job security then we

00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:50,140
can kind of coast a little bit we can

00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:52,330
relax get comfortable it's kind of neat

00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:54,370
to be the the smartest guy in the room

00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:56,200
I'm the one with all the answers cuz

00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:58,120
I've been here for 15 years and I know

00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,770
how this obscure thing that I planted

00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,330
some obscure code in so that I would

00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:04,350
continue to be able to work here for 15

00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:07,510
years works there was actually a guy

00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:09,670
that that I knew of that had that had a

00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:12,220
notebook full of he can basically put

00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:14,400
garbage garbage variable names in all of

00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:17,020
his code and then had a notebook with

00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:20,260
translations for all of that stuff once

00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:22,750
upon a time so you know fine whatever a

00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:24,970
while back guys know what hungry academy

00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:26,530
is living social I'm going to talk it up

00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:28,210
a little bit again I'm Greek Adam II was

00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:31,390
freaking awesome I got to work with some

00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:33,940
of those guys and the thing that we did

00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:35,860
was we ran a five-month course if you're

00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:37,300
not familiar with it we turn people that

00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:39,640
either were programmers but not

00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:41,170
necessarily web developers or had no

00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,900
experience at all developing we turned

00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:47,080
them into developers and before I ever

00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:48,970
started working at livingsocial Jeff who

00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,530
was leading the leading the hungry

00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:53,290
Academy students asked me if I would

00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:55,750
Skype with them and do a little chat and

00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:57,280
he surprised me midway through the tough

00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:58,780
to the talk that I was given to him and

00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,450
said if there were one thing that you

00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:02,650
could you could ask these people these

00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:05,260
students tell them that they should

00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:06,640
learn you know what was it that you

00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:08,290
would you would tell them you'd want

00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:11,560
them to take away and I thought wow

00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:12,730
that's no pressure one thing huh and I

00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,260
don't know where this came from but this

00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:19,000
is what I told them I said strive to

00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:20,770
feel stupid and a few months later after

00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,410
I took the job at livingsocial I decided

00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:24,940
I would probably do well to buy a book

00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:26,530
by Chad Fowler called the passionate

00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:30,610
programmer and read it since he was

00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:33,280
going to be my VP and turns out I'm in

00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:34,690
good company he says be the worst he has

00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,550
all chapter called be the worst and I

00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:41,740
think we talked about that just a couple

00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:43,630
of tops ago if you're stealing stupid

00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:45,190
note i'm not saying strive to be stupid

00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:48,080
i'm saying strive to feel stupid there's

00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:51,260
a difference but if you feel stupid

00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:52,910
if you feel stupid you're stretching you

00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:55,430
don't want to be comfortable you want to

00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:57,200
be you want to be in a situation where

00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:59,810
you feel that you're growing I don't

00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,970
know about you guys but for for me if

00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:03,620
I'm not actually growing I start to feel

00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:05,690
like I'm getting dumber like every day I

00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:07,880
just I get rusty I forget how to do

00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:09,620
things I wrote an iOS app like two years

00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,150
ago I haven't written any iOS stuff in a

00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:14,330
while and I if I went back to it now I

00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:16,930
would be like what this is it's

00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:20,480
important to keep stretching yourself I

00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:23,120
I like I got this from from Cora an

00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,530
anonymous user posted the answer to this

00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,120
question what's it like to always be the

00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:28,550
smartest person in the room it's my

00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:31,690
favorite way of stating this ever it

00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:34,100
sucks it means you're in the wrong room

00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:36,290
find a room you can be in where you're

00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:38,120
going to learn don't mean if it can be a

00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:39,680
campfire room or an IRC room I don't

00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,840
mean that it has to be a physical room

00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,280
that you sit in with your co-workers but

00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:48,380
you do need to find a way to stretch

00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:49,940
yourself so in case you haven't noticed

00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:54,830
I'm going through a big list of mistakes

00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:58,820
I've made here's another one I've found

00:42:54,830 --> 00:43:02,240
myself in past past salary negotiation

00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:04,880
positions where I've I've thought to

00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:07,190
myself gosh if they just gave me X

00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,920
amount more than what the offer is this

00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:13,670
would be a no-brainer if you're in a

00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,500
situation where the money is the thing

00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:17,600
that's really going to put you over the

00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:19,280
top to take a position it should be

00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:21,530
considered if not a red flag at least a

00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:25,640
yellow flag the thing about it is is

00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:28,190
this if you're actually if you're

00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:29,720
actually going to take the job because

00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:32,410
of the money there's this thing have you

00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:34,910
guys ever heard of the hedonic treadmill

00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:37,400
so the hedonic treadmill it's another

00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:39,920
one of these things they espoused in in

00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:43,340
positive psychology but they hedonic

00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:46,250
treadmill up the idea is that you have a

00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:50,210
tendency to be to trend toward a certain

00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:51,560
level of happiness so you might get a

00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,520
salary boost for a little while but

00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,980
what's going to happen is that your

00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:57,440
lifestyle is by all likelihood going to

00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:58,760
expand to fill that salary right and so

00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,650
then what ends up happening and this is

00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,650
the weird thing is that if you think

00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:04,289
about it that way

00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:06,930
by taking that job that only led you

00:44:04,289 --> 00:44:09,059
toward pledges were taking it because of

00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:10,440
the extra salary once you get

00:44:09,059 --> 00:44:12,630
comfortable with out with that salary

00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,980
level that part of the happiness goes

00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:15,930
away now I'm not talking if you're in

00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:17,520
poverty I mean if you're in poverty by

00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:18,750
all means put food on your table you

00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,220
know take it to take a good job I don't

00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:21,510
think I'm talking to people we're

00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:24,150
software developers I don't think we're

00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:27,059
struggling my way but if you're taking

00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:28,380
if you're taking a job for a salary

00:44:27,059 --> 00:44:31,380
boost and then you end up in that

00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:33,630
situation where you're now back at that

00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:35,309
normal level of happy and that's all you

00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:38,670
had to show for it was the salary but

00:44:35,309 --> 00:44:39,930
then what did you really gain in a lot

00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:41,039
of ways you've actually and this is

00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:43,170
counter-intuitive if you've actually

00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:45,119
reduced your opportunities in the future

00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:48,270
because now in order to main st.

00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:49,740
maintain that same level of happy you're

00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:52,380
going to need to find a job that's

00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:54,650
willing to pay you that same amount even

00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:58,349
if it may be is not a job that would be

00:44:54,650 --> 00:45:00,809
your cup of tea otherwise and this is

00:44:58,349 --> 00:45:02,369
the one I really struggled with I can't

00:45:00,809 --> 00:45:05,279
tell you how many times and jobs that

00:45:02,369 --> 00:45:06,900
I've said i am going to really miss all

00:45:05,279 --> 00:45:09,720
the people that I work with they're the

00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:11,900
best people in the world and I really

00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:15,660
love them and I am sorry I have to leave

00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:17,069
but as much as I wish that it could be I

00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:18,779
mean you know sometimes Superman has to

00:45:17,069 --> 00:45:20,190
go back to Krypton and stuff and you

00:45:18,779 --> 00:45:23,099
know then where are the rest of the

00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:24,510
Super Friends left I think it's I think

00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:26,730
it's really important to remember that

00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:30,779
while working with great people is an

00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:33,180
awesome bonus if you make it the main

00:45:30,779 --> 00:45:36,270
driving factor for taking a position

00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:39,059
with another company you may be left in

00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:42,779
a situation where supposedly these

00:45:39,059 --> 00:45:44,490
people whom you really like you want

00:45:42,779 --> 00:45:45,809
them right you if you like somebody you

00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:47,609
want them to do what's best for them you

00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:50,039
want them to do do the things that are

00:45:47,609 --> 00:45:51,299
going to help them be more happy what if

00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:54,329
that thing means that they go work

00:45:51,299 --> 00:45:55,619
somewhere else then you're going to be

00:45:54,329 --> 00:45:58,470
left in a position where it's going to

00:45:55,619 --> 00:46:00,930
be awfully difficult for you to be happy

00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:03,359
for them and to be supportive of them

00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:04,559
and news flash they don't have to work

00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:06,240
for the same company for you to continue

00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:08,369
to be friends I've got plenty of friends

00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,470
that have left companies never that are

00:46:08,369 --> 00:46:12,869
with companies that I left before it's

00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:14,069
not it's not necessarily important that

00:46:12,869 --> 00:46:15,360
you like everyone you work with and you

00:46:14,069 --> 00:46:16,080
guys are a likeable bunch anyway

00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:19,170
you're going to make friends wherever

00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:20,910
you go see how this works this buttering

00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:24,780
you up thing totally going to give you a

00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:26,010
speaker rate link later so why is all

00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:29,880
this important i'm running out of time

00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:32,040
but optimizing for happiness to me it's

00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:34,560
really super important because the job

00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:36,210
that we do i mean we get to start with a

00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,310
blank text editor and we get to create

00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:40,650
just about anything anything that we

00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:43,110
have in our mind we can create it can be

00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:45,360
a beautiful something it can be a

00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:48,750
functional something it might even be a

00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:50,700
world-changing something and from the

00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:52,710
time I was six I knew I wanted to do

00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:55,650
this with my life and I want to be able

00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:57,090
to do this with my life until I'm too

00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:58,410
old to be able to see the screen and by

00:46:57,090 --> 00:47:02,130
then who cares because we're going to be

00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:04,890
like wet wired anyway and if that's

00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:06,510
going to happen in order for me to keep

00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:07,890
on doing this thing that I love so much

00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:09,780
and then I feel gives me a chance to

00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:12,600
have a creative outlet and also put food

00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:14,880
on the table at the same time then I

00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,870
need to be happy I need to be happy

00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,610
because otherwise I'm going to get

00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:18,750
drained by all the bullcrap that we deal

00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:20,610
with remember we have to deal with

00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:22,350
stakeholders that don't understand our

00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:24,720
one of our internal customers just

00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:26,670
simply don't seem to really understand

00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:29,040
why we're telling them that they need in

00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:32,100
a two-week a two week lead time if they

00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:34,410
ask us for X Y or Z that stuff can be

00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:38,160
draining you need to find a way to be

00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:42,360
happy and so I guess I'm back where I

00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:45,060
started in that happiness really is like

00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:47,070
that power cord it's what Lao allows you

00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:50,720
to continue doing what it is that you

00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:53,720
love to do so don't forget to plug in

00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,720
thanks

00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,560
