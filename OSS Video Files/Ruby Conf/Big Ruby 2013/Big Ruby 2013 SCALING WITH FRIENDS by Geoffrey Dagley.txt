Publication date: 2020-01-28
Playlist: Big Ruby 2013
Description: 
	What started with two brothers in the McKinney Public Library is now a world wide word phenomenon on multiple mobile platforms. We'll look at how we have grown, the mistakes we made, and the changes we have made along the way:

Serving millions of players a day: Stats, stats, stats!
Working with constraints: * 1 service, 6 games (and counting) * Native clients means backward compatibility, ftw!
How do I know what to fix? Instrumenting and reporting on everything
Where is the data? Using the database, memcache, Redis to the fullest
What we did wrong? What we did right? What would we do differently?
