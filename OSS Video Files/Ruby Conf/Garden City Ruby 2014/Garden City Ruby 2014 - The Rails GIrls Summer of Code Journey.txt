Description: 
	By Sakshi Jain and Pallavi Shastry

The Rails Girls Summer of Code found me as a Ruby enthusiast. A little syntactical knowledge of Ruby took me to the glamour of Rails Girls SoC. Me and my partner, Pallavi Shastry, from Bengaluru, chose to work for diaspora, a privacy-aware decentralized, social network. Before contributing to diaspora, we tried our hands at Rails Girls Rails App Generator. The generator adds comments targeted at Rails Girls students to migrations, routes, controllers, models and views. It omits more advanced things like the respond_to blocks and jason stuff in controllers etc. This project also includes a Jekyll-based website on Github Pages which explains things briefly and gives pointers to guides or other resources. After completing the Rails Girls App Generator project, we dived into diaspora* which did sound more like learning to swim in a big ocean instead of a pool! The diaspora* issues that were assigned to us by our mentor were: 1. Blocking people from the profile page 2. Adopt a pull request 3. Full content in email notification for public posts 4. No content in email notification for limited posts We got 2 pull requests merged into diaspora*. Learnt about the testing workflow, rails internationalization, ActionMailers and a lot more. The open source journey with Rails Girls Summer of Code helped me build my confidence and made me realize that I too have an amazing chance to change the world and make things better and happen! The talk will surely benefit the students who wish to apply for RGSOC next time. The attendees of the conference might get inspired to become coaches for the future Rails Girls. The attendees could also help girls to understand Ruby on Rails technology and help them contribute to open source. Hopefully, there will be more RGSOC participants from India, in future.

PALLAVI SHASTRY: We're here to share an amazing

00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,939
Rails Girls Summer of Code experience.

00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:31,520
It was an internship of about three months,

00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,160
and we were the team Diasbits.

00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:38,149
So Dias is the short form of the Open Source project

00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:41,010
we picked up called Diaspora and 'bits,'

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,570
we were trying to be the tiny, teeny tiny bits of Diaspora

00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,260
by contributing to Diaspora,

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,690
and that's how we picked up the name Diaspora.

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,210
So we are- I'm Pallavi.

00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,109
I'm working as a developer in Bang the Table

00:00:57,109 --> 00:00:59,920
and this is my coding partner Sakshi Jain.

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:06,920
She's a final year engineering student from Rajasthan.

00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,360
And let's say more about Rails Girls.

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,430
Sakshi Jain: So we're here to share about the fun

00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,150
we had during Rails Girls summer of code,

00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,120
and so we'll be talking less technical and more,

00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,610
sharing more of the fun.

00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:25,110
So, Rails Girls- the aim of Rails Girls is to give

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,500
tools to women and a community so that they

00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,600
understand technology and build it ideas.

00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,330
So this they do by providing them

00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:42,930
a great experience and making technology more approachable.

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:48,270
So let's see more about Rails Girls, here.

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,480
[VIDEO]

00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:56,480
Girl: We want to give the girls a chance to build a web application from concept to code.

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:20,560
Boy: And we think it's important that the girls learn to see the web as a platform for

00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:38,010
their ideas.

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:42,880
[indecipherable lecture & chatting]

00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,680
Voice Over: It's really awesome to see you all here,

00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:54,180
because I hope that you're actually going to start building web apps and services.

00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:01,180
Boy: So we want to get the girls to destroy the world!

00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,580
P.S.: So after connecting in a number of workshops and meet-ups,

00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:14,030
so the Rails Girls organizers decided to take it to the next step

00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,110
and that's how the Rails Girls Summer of Code was born.

00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:21,650
So Rails Girls Summer of Code-

00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,830
the main idea was to get women and girls into Open Source.

00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,540
And it works very similar to Google Summer of Code

00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,950
and Ruby Summer of Code, where students will be paid,

00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:34,350
and the students are free to pick up any Open Source project work on.

00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:39,670
And like the Google Summer of Code and the Ruby Summer of Code,

00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,380
the idea of Rails Girls Summer of Code was to expand

00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,569
the knowledge and skills by contributing to great Open Source Projects.

00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:47,840
So you don't have to come up with a sophisticated code

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,890
by the end of your internship.

00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:56,890
So there were about forty applications from about

00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,360
one forty students from all over the world.

00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,080
And few of them were outstandingly prepared,

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,610
few of them had their own support networks

00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,459
from local community and coaches,

00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:09,940
and few of them had their own personal stories.

00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,310
And this

00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:10,620
00:04:10.26 ??

00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,370
was the teams that got selected from

00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:19,370
different parts of the world, and we were the team from India.

00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,569
So we were a team. So team consisted of participants,

00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:32,340
coaches and mentors. So the participants were me and Sakshi.

00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,949
It was a paired event. And coaches-

00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:39,270
coaches are the people who you used to help us with all our doubts,

00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,770
you know, help us whenever we get stuck with anything.

00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:46,099
And mentors are the people who know in and out about the project we picked up.

00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:53,099
So we picked up Diaspora and we had Diaspora developers as our mentors.

00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,449
And these people were our coaches.

00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:58,559
Arihant Godha, Neha, and Tejas Dinkar,

00:04:58,559 --> 00:05:02,039
the guy who spoke about native extensions.

00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:08,759
It was not only coding, the whole three months.

00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,759
We had a lot of fun activities,

00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,729
not only reporting or blogging about the work

00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,659
we did or the coding we did.

00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:15,580
We did have regular interactions,

00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,779
hang-outs with our mentors, other teams,

00:05:16,779 --> 00:05:21,270
and we met a lot of awesome people.

00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:28,059
And we got a lot of goodies from all the sponsors.

00:05:28,059 --> 00:05:29,669
And Sakshi will tell us more about the project.

00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:34,900
S.J.: Yeah, so let's see about what projects did we actually work for.

00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:40,199
We chose to work for Rails Girls App generator and Diaspora.

00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,309
Initially we thought that we'd be working for Diaspora

00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:46,379
for the whole three months, but Diaspora is a huge project,

00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:47,460
and it was really difficult for us,

00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,240
for us beginners to understand what actually Diaspora is,

00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,210
and how we should contribute to it.

00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:57,729
And it requires a lot of knowledge of Rails and other things.

00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:03,249
So we chose, we started off with Rails Girls App generator.

00:06:03,249 --> 00:06:09,770
This project also included our visits to Rails Girls events in Bangalore and

00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:10,460
00:06:09.90?? .

00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,619
So, what do we actually do in the Rails Girls events

00:06:14,619 --> 00:06:17,559
is that we learn more about Rails,

00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:22,569
and we get to meet a lot of people and we can meet our coaches,

00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:25,960
we can ask any doubt we have in our mind.

00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:32,449
And also there's a lot of chance to have nice pictures of Friday hug.

00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:36,710
So during this project, what we did is-

00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:41,270
Rails Girls App generator is about adding comments

00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,360
targeted at Rails Girls students

00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,300
and it removes more complicated stuff

00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:54,509
like respond-to blocks and JSON stuff in controllers, et cetera.

00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:57,919
So this project also includes a

00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:58,999
JQ 00:06:58.37 ??

00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:02,169
based website hosted on GitHub pages,

00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:09,080
which gives pointers to the guides and other resources -

00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:15,110
beginners, intermediate, et cetera.

00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:19,419
So after finishing off with Rails Girls App generator,

00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:23,960
which took us about a month to figure out what exactly has to be done,

00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:29,589
and we learnt more about Rails, et cetera, then we switched on to Diaspora.

00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:36,589
Diaspora is a legacy-aware decentralized social network,

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,539
which gives the user whole control of their data.

00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:43,229
And it was touted by the media as a Facebook-killer.

00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:47,099
So, why is it called as a Facebook-killer?

00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,449
Because it is completely different

00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:55,159
and it gives the user complete freedom and privacy.

00:07:55,159 --> 00:08:01,490
So I should not speak much about Diaspora because I haven't contributed to it much.

00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,029
Let's see- next slide.

00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:06,419
Yeah. So before contributing to Diaspora,

00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:09,270
we had some doubt in our mind as to what exactly

00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,159
should we know about Diaspora,

00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:13,539
and how should we even contribute to it?

00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:16,329
So how- should we start reading

00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:16,330
?? 00:08:16.29

00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,860
books from starting to end,

00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,039
or should we start learning all the languages:

00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:20,589
Ruby, Javascript, et cetera.

00:08:20,589 --> 00:08:25,999
So, this was the answer which was given to us by the Diaspora developer.

00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:30,409
He said that, "Never try to learn everything up front,

00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:36,130
that doesn't work. Better pick upa little task and learn what you need to solve it."

00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,380
So this, we formed as a principle

00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,669
and so now we use this concept whenever

00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:46,470
we start contributing to any Open Source project.

00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:50,319
Also, one important thing that what prior knowledge

00:08:50,319 --> 00:08:53,149
should we have before making any contributions.

00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:56,399
He said that git workflow is the most important thing,

00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,420
and learn everything else as you go.

00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:04,990
So this is a concept which helps you to save your time.

00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:08,990
Just pick up one task and research about it and try to solve it.

00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,680
If you have less time, that means you should not start

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,019
the reading whole of the languages.

00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:18,699
It is good if you know everything, but,

00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:21,550
if you have less time that means you set about a particular bug,

00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:25,399
which you want to fix.

00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:30,759
So we picked up some issues from Diaspora issue list,

00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:35,079
and these were the few issues from the beginner's category,

00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:39,069
and these are some of the issues:

00:09:39,069 --> 00:09:41,360
Blocking people from the profile page, fix commenting,

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,329
comment still displayed after a fail posting, et cetera.

00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:49,170
So let me explain to you about the blocking feature,

00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:53,730
which we introduced into Diaspora.

00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:57,459
So as you can see in the image,

00:09:57,459 --> 00:10:00,190
first we had to design what,

00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:07,190
where should the block icon be placed on the profile page in Diaspora.

00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:11,250
So we went through a series of design steps.

00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,350
As you can see, we had the block in the drop-down,

00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:19,220
and then a little finishing was required.

00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:25,230
Finally we came down to one design, which was accepted by most of the people.

00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:29,730
So through all this we learned about how to communicate

00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:34,139
in Open Source projects, what,

00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:41,139
how to ask Diaspora developers how do they review, et cetera.

00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:47,940
After fixing our design, then we,

00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,629
what we did was, we had to figure out what exactly,

00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:53,209
where exactly the code should be placed.

00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:55,560
So we had to figure out which files will be effected.

00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,910
So all this we could do with the help of Diaspora developers.

00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:02,639
So, Pallavi, what did we learn?

00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:08,690
P.S.: Rails, of course, and the Git workflow,

00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:14,160
and we had this oh-my-god situations when we had much conflicts.

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,519
So, how do we branch out? How do we fix it?

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,250
And then how do we send a poll-request?

00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,970
And how do developers review it? And how they comment?

00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,910
The whole Git workflow basically, and working remotely.

00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,879
So Sakshi's from Ajmer. I'm from Banglore.

00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:32,100
So for the first few days, in the beginning,

00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,709
it was difficult for us to communicate.

00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:38,050
And also the developers are from Berlin,

00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:40,620
and coach is luckily a developer from Banglore.

00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,060
And most of the time it was through pinging

00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:46,160
or email or IRC we could communicate with each other.

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,550
And not only fixing the bugs, we also,

00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,220
it was a test in development.

00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:56,300
So we learned a lot about RSPEC or 00:11:53.15?? and all that.

00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,060
S.J.: The impact.

00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:06,060
The impact is that we are standing here and speaking in front of you.

00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:13,079
So the whole Rails Girls Summer of Code journey

00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:15,879
had a great impact on our life and career.

00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:21,779
So we know, like, what exactly we want to do now, and what is our destination.

00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:25,060
Though we still have to learn a lot and,

00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,660
it made us realize that we too have the capability

00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:34,370
to implement our ideas and we got to meet a lot of

00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,209
people from all over the world.

00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:39,660
We understood the learning strategy of different people

00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:46,660
from different countries. We realized that we too have the,

00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,550
fortunately we too have the chance to make things,

00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:54,750
to change the world and make things better, and happen.

00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:58,279
Thank you!

00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:01,329
Thank you to the coaches, to the mentors,

00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:04,370
to the organizers of Rails Girls Summer of Code journey,

00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,769
to the Garden City Ruby Conference organizers

00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:10,389
for giving us this opportunity to speak here.

00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:11,360
Thank you all.

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,839
P.S.: Any questions?

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:20,839
V.O.: We do have time for questions, yeah.

00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:29,399
QUERANT: Just wanted to say, good job and all the rest.

00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:32,279
P.S.: Thank you.

00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,540
Anyone, any questions?

00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:40,899
QUERANT: I just want to ask like, what are the

00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:41,430
00:13:42.7 ??

00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:45,480
challenges that you faced with this? I see a lot of-

00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,500
I'm not engend- I'm gonna not engender women,

00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,999
or something like that, but I see a lot of fresher sort you know,

00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:52,850
people who are just doing their college

00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:55,240
and are finding a real tough time basically

00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,399
to learn technology and things.

00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:00,529
Like how do you break that ice, how did you guys do it in specific?

00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:04,139
P.S.: So, we do have that feeling, like,

00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:07,199
we felt timid sometimes because we don't have

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,999
the required technical skills, but then once we got into it,

00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:13,300
we eventually picked up. We slowly picked up.

00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,069
And I think the best thing would be to just,

00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:18,029
just don't feel timid, just pick up,

00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:19,749
eventually you'll pick up everything.

00:14:19,749 --> 00:14:21,920
S.J.: And yeah, the Rails Girls Summer of Code

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,170
organizers were so welcoming.

00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,379
Anything you can ask them on IRC just ping them,

00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:28,970
they'll give you an answer, you can research,

00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,980
you can talk to your coaches.

00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:35,230
So that's how we got to learn a lot of things.

00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:40,670
QUERANT: OK, so I wanted to ask you,

00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,230
have you followed up in your college

00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,920
and have you told them about it?

00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,870
What steps did you take to make people aware?

00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:51,600
Because I did my GSub this summer and I've been trying to do stuff.

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,149
So what are you guys doing in college?

00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:57,749
P.S.: Yes, we did have a similar talk in college,

00:14:57,749 --> 00:15:01,459
we introduced the rest of the girls to this.

00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:03,540
And I'm not very sure when it's gonna happen again,

00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:10,540
but I make sure some of my juniors will take part.

00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:24,259
QUERANT: All right, that's great.

00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:25,110
P.S.: OK

00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,459
QUERANT: Again, I love your confidence.

00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,889
This was a great talk. So my question is,

00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:32,699
the learnings that you've had in college,

00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:38,629
how much was it applicable in this experience?

00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:40,209
The useful stuff?

00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:43,730
P.S.: Yeah, we got to know that we didn't learn anything,

00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:48,399
and we have to start learning.

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,269
S.J.: Exactly.

00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:55,889
QUERANT: So, finally, Emacs or Vin??

00:15:55,889 --> 00:16:02,889
P.S.: Yeah, not so much. OK, he has a question.

00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:08,649
QUERANT: What is the answer by the way?

00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:15,649
QUERANT: So that was a good talk. Part of- slightly different question.

00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:22,389
What are you personal plans to take this forward,

00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:26,089
Rails Girls initiatives and the Rails Girls Summer of Code initiatives?

00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:29,790
How you gonna take it forward, because I've seen in the past,

00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,910
people come up here on stage, get there visibility,

00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:37,639
get the limelight, get into the corporate bubble,

00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:38,749
and disappear out of this.

00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:41,740
S.J.: So we are standing here, that means we're inspiring students.

00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:45,399
QUERANT: Right now. What are you all going to do?

00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:45,660
S.J.: Yeah.

00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,569
P.S.: OK, we're still contributing to Diaspora,

00:16:46,569 --> 00:16:50,949
there are few peers left under review, and now we know,

00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:53,870
we have a fair idea of how to contribute to Open Source,

00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,709
so we'll pick up some other Open Source project.

00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:57,029
I tried my hands on

00:16:57,029 --> 00:16:57,550
00:16:56.77 ??

00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:01,110
Yeah. Pretty much take it forward that way.

00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,809
QUERANT: And one request.

00:17:02,809 --> 00:17:03,839
Inspire others, please,

00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,709
other girls especially to get onto the same boat here.

00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:07,970
Well done, thanks.

00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,050
P.S.: Thank you.

00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:16,450
So we have a lot of time for questions.

00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,940
QUERANT: I have a sister, who is going to

00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,210
00:17:18.20??

00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:22,990
this year. So do you have any statements for

00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:28,690
what should I tell her to do or ask her to follow?

00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:34,220
P.S.: So basically when we applied, they asked us to show sample codes.

00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,670
So I think, this was not only specific to Ruby on Rails,

00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:40,010
any web framework, anything that is related to web.

00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:44,220
I mean, there were other teams who were working on JavaScript.

00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:49,330
So if she's interesting, ask her to have some sample codes,

00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:52,010
so that'll help her to get into.

00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:56,210
And compared to Google Summer of Code and Ruby Summer of Code,

00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,340
this wasn't so competitive.

00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:01,030
I mean, I think it was the first time.

00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,430
S.J.: Yeah, it was.

00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,200
P.S.: And only a few of them knew it.

00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,030
So it should be easy to get into it.

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,020
V.O.: We do have time for more questions.

00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,880
QUERENT: I don't actually have a question,

00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:28,110
but I have a piece of advice. In India, right now,

00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:33,830
we have a good amount of Ruby developers male

00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:40,270
to which we look forward and we plan to be more helpful,

00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:44,770
we get some inspiration from them, but there's no female developers,

00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:48,270
as such, where the new community which is coming in to,

00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:53,290
they look forward to any female that can inspire them.

00:18:53,290 --> 00:19:00,290
So I advise you guys to equally be active in social media,

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:07,220
so that it creates a word out of it, and it takes that,

00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,960
it takes forward from there, onwards.

00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,930
P.S.: OK.

00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:18,930
QUERANT: I like your introduction, but then, you know,

00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,900
I like the confidence with which you guys are standing there,

00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,600
not that you're girls or guys standing there,

00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,620
but even two guys standing there,

00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,370
I would have been really happy to see two people

00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,280
come up there and do the things they're doing.

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,410
I think there enough female developers that are kicking ass,

00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:37,780
I think, you don't have to look beyond a girl who can kick ass.

00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:41,120
But, good job because, it's just the confidence,

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,120
keep the confidence going, and all the rest.

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:51,790
P.S.: OK, thank you.

00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:58,460
He has a question.

00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,250
QUERANT: So a lot of people, including myself,

00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,780
have a issue with confidence?

00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:06,410
But did you did mention that you went through a period of feeling timid.

00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:09,870
And I've actually worked with some juniors as well,

00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,300
and I do see that as a problem.

00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,240
Could you explain a little bit more of how

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,810
personally you can overcome your timidness,

00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:21,270
or any stress level of learning so many things?

00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:25,990
S.J.: So I should thank my parents, I think,

00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:32,990
for introducing me into a school which was a kind of a great development...

00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:39,790
so, should I name my school? It is Sophia Senior secondary school from Madrid,

00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:43,320
and I'm really thankful to my teachers, you know,

00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:50,320
their encouragement and their support, so I am here today.

00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:55,360
QUERANT: Hello. My question is how did you come across Rails Girls

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,740
in the first place? As in how did you know it was there?

00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,230
P.S.: OK, so, that's a nice question.

00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:06,720
I was a part of an organization called Free Software ??

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,280
So they help students to get into Open Source pro-

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,810
I mean, you know, introduce them to Open Source and all that.

00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:15,160
So I subscribed to their mailing list

00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,880
and I happened to see this and I thought OK,

00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,000
let me try, and then started coding in Ruby

00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,590
and all that, and then applied for Rails Girls Summer of Code.

00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,710
And it's the same thing with her, even she came,

00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:31,580
she found out about Rails Girls Summer of Code through some mailing list.

00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,910
S.J.: In my career of engineering I,

00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:38,370
actually I was searching for some new language to learn about,

00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:43,740
so I asked one coach, ??, he told me to start learning Ruby.

00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:49,350
So I found it easy to understand at first. But though,

00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,740
when you go in depth of Ruby, it is more complicated.

00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:57,100
So it requires a lot of practice in implementation.

00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:04,100
QUERANT: K, I've got one question for you.

00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,870
So if you had one message to pass on to other women in technology

00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:13,620
or other girls who are looking to get into technology, what would that be?

00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:20,620
S.J.: That would be that if you want to apply for any program,

00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:23,530
just go for it, don't think that

00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,620
you don't have that much of technical background,

00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:29,450
or you don't know these things, that you can't apply.

00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:34,610
So it's better to just push yourself and you'll eventually learn.

00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:38,750
P.S.: And also like just look for any of these women-centric programs.

00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:44,240
You know they pay you money.

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:51,240
QUERANT: By the way there's also the normal ?? program.

00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,350
P.S.: List of women-centric programs would be,

00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,100
of course the Google Summer of Code is there,

00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:03,150
the twenty-four students, and there's ?? outreach program for women and uh,

00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,960
Ruby Summer of Code, and Rails Girls Summer of Code.

00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,920
S.J.: And the Next Foundation.

00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:14,920
P.S.: Yeah, the Next Foundation. Oh, yeah ?? is also there.

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:25,080
