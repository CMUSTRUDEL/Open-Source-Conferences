	By Arnab Deka

Would you like to do some OCR using Ruby and learn some machine-learning along the way?

In this talk, first up, we'll have a quick demo where an attendee writes down a digit on a sticky note and a Ruby program tries to to recognize it. Then we'll pick it apart, covering:

the basics of machine-learning (and different applications)
brief look into the Math behind supervised learning (classification)
(mostly) hand-rolled code applying this Math
libraries/tools available to Rubyists (and choice of Ruby platforms) including weka, mahout, libsvm, and the Ruby Matrix class :)
ways to dive deeper into ML
