SPEAKER: We have Mister Coby Randquist on stage.

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,850
COBY RANDQUIST: Thank you. Sorry about that.

00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,559
Like he said, I do organize a couple conferences,

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:39,520
so the in-between time is the time

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,410
I'm used to getting up here and talking.

00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:47,180
Doing more of the introductions and not so much the presentations.

00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:54,180
This is actually my second non-lightning talk presentation at a Ruby conference.

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,150
So I guess we'll start here, if I can figure out the clicker.

00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:05,770
I wanted to thank the organizers for inviting me.

00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:08,940
Like I said, I operate behind the scenes

00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:13,080
a whole lot more than I do on stage,

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,189
so I appreciate the invitation to come out.

00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:20,119
Prakash had mentioned that the community here in India

00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:23,490
had benefited particularly from the

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,470
accessibility that Confreaks has been able to make available

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:34,260
to all the various conferences around mostly the United States.

00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,810
A large part of that is due in part to Chad Fowler's support.

00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,250
When we first started Confreaks and approached him in 2007

00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,860
about recording the events, he was open to it and

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,940
actually worked with Microsoft to get sponsorship.

00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,340
Microsoft was the primary video sponsor

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:59,150
in 2007 and helped make this whole thing happen.

00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:03,620
Let me junp back to my slides for a minute.

00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,860
So who am I?

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,250
My name's Coby Randquist.

00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,890
I've been doing software development

00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,450
and managing teams and building teams for

00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:14,440
about twenty-five years or so now.

00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,140
I started off back working with Basic in business Basic

00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:22,599
in a language called Thoroughbred Basic on Unix,

00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:25,000
originally writing in software to run

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,150
construction account- or, construction companies.

00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:33,209
I migrated to Visual Basic, did a lot of work with Microsoft tools.

00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:36,980
I was a Microsoft guy for a good sixteen,

00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,760
seventeen years, migrated to C sharp

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,849
and then I discovered Ruby.

00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:46,889
One of the other things is I like doing community building.

00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:49,420
I like getting groups of people like this together

00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,310
and finding the things that you care about

00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:58,180
and then finding ways to make it more realistic for you to pursue those passions.

00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,969
I do that with Ruby.

00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:02,680
In the last year and a half I've started getting involved

00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,919
with the OpenStack community.

00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:06,359
If you're not familiar with OpenStack,

00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:13,359
it is a platform for building cloud computering meet-ups, user groups.

00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:14,999
You know I'm very excited.

00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:19,010
This is the first regional conference in India.

00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,370
It's been, you know at first when I got involved

00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,569
with the Ruby community it was like,

00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:24,459
oh this is really neat.

00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:26,620
We've got these regional conferences.

00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,189
All communities should have this and they don't.

00:03:31,189 --> 00:03:33,730
If you look at Python, Python has PyCon,

00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,129
which is their big national conference,

00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:38,290
or their big conference,

00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,769
but there's not a Python conference every time you turn around.

00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:47,239
There is a Ruby conference just about every weekend.

00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:50,959
Somewhere in the world there is a Ruby conference going on.

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:57,599
Let's see, oh so you'll notice the picture of the truck.

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,079
One of my other passions is rock crawling.

00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:02,139
That's just a really beefed up truck that you go out

00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:05,419
and you go really slow over really nasty obstacles.

00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:08,879
Another community.

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,189
So in this talk, if you looked at the abstract is says

00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:19,340
nothing because I didn't actually provide one to your organizers.

00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,810
So what I wanted to kind of do was go back

00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:26,010
and talk a little bit about my beginnings in the Ruby community,

00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,970
how Confreaks got started,

00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,240
and then a little bit about the different conferences that I do,

00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,020
and then we'll spend a couple minutes just on

00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:41,190
the topic about Open Source software and why we do,

00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,759
or why we should care about this,

00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:49,759
and how we could help spread really the passion for what we do.

00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:54,949
Because, well and I will get to that part a few slides down the road.

00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:57,659
So, how did I get started?

00:04:57,659 --> 00:05:02,520
Like I said, I was working in a Microsoft shop.

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,680
I worked for a company called Vehix dot com.

00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:11,680
We did consumer automatic research. It was a dot net shop.

00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:14,900
And I'd found Ruby, I don't honestly remember why I found it,

00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,300
but I looked at it, played around with it,

00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,229
really liked it, but decided there was no way I was

00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:23,180
gonna be able to convince our management to make the talent switch,

00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,580
and there was no way I was gonna be able

00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,919
to convince all the people on the team that we should be changing,

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,330
because we had just gone through a switch from

00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:36,300
Visual Basic to the dot net framework in C sharp.

00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,270
So we'd just gone through that,

00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:41,729
there was no way we were getting another switch through management,

00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:44,199
so I kind of put Ruby away.

00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:47,699
And then about six or eight months later

00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:53,580
I got to the point where I wanted to teach my kids

00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,729
a little more about programming,

00:05:55,729 --> 00:06:02,520
and if you open up a Windows machine today

00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,750
it doesn't come with a programming language,

00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,810
or if it does it's very varied.

00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,810
When I got into computers I started out on a Commodore 64

00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,620
for a Vic 20, the basic language was there.

00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,650
In fact that was the interface to the computer.

00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,159
You didn't have an operating system.

00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:20,139
You booted right into the language,

00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:22,759
which provided everything.

00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,949
So lacking that I went looking for a language.

00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:29,520
I found Ruby, I found Chris Pine's book Learn to Program.

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,800
You can't really tell from this photo here,

00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,270
but the computer there is actually a Sun Sparkstation 10

00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,930
because I have a lot of kids.

00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:44,000
I've got six girls, now they range from-

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,750
my youngest set of twins are seventeen,

00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,800
my oldest set of twins just turned twenty-one,

00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,300
and my oldest daughter is twenty-three,

00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,870
and there's one in the middle.

00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,430
I wanted a way to teach them so I actually built a little lab,

00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,919
and the cheapest way to do it at the time

00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,069
was I picked up a bunch of used Sparkstations,

00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:04,639
got them running Linux, got Ruby installed on it,

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,389
and sat down and away we went.

00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:13,770
Ultimately it got me involved with Ruby.

00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:17,909
None of my kids really got into software development, but.

00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:20,539
Can't win all the battles.

00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:23,979
All right, so that was in early 2006

00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:26,879
when I was trying to teach my kids how to do Ruby,

00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,199
and about that time I started to evaluate

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,789
what I was doing with my professional life and at Vehix dot com,

00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:38,270
and it really got to the point where I wanted to try to do Ruby.

00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,699
I wanted to figure out how I could utilize it.

00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,539
So at that point my options, you know,

00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:48,590
in 2006 I basically decided to quit my job

00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:52,229
to open up a consulting shop and build software solutions

00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:57,300
for people who didn't care about the technology I implemented it in,

00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,949
which gave me the ability to code in Ruby and in Rails

00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:04,120
without having to justify the technology choices I was making.

00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,150
I just had to provide a solution.

00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,240
So after doing that,

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,610
I'd been on my own for about two months or so

00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:20,610
and heard about RubyConf through the local users group in Utah at the time.

00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:25,120
So heard about RubyConf. I was in Salt Lake City, Utah.

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,949
Denver is literally a jump over the mountains,

00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:30,080
so you hop on a plane, forty-five minutes you're there.

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:37,080
So I went to RubyConf in 2006 and Chad presented,

00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:42,050
and all these guys are presenting and they're just blowing my mind.

00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,620
And at the end, I think the format was a little bit different

00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:50,010
cause I think Matz actually did his keynotes at the end of one of the days.

00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:50,940
So he did his keynote speech,

00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,180
but he went through 400 slides and talked about a topic.

00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,800
One of the topics was bike shedding.

00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,770
But he went through so many slides,

00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,160
and I was already so brain fried at that point

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,720
from all this new material that

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,440
I wanted to go back and watch it again and it wasn't an option.

00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,230
You know I think there were some,

00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,700
somebody who had a their Mac Pro turned around

00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,640
and aimed at the stage, so there were bits and pieces

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,290
of the talk available, but there wasn't a whole lot available,

00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:25,210
so that kind of set the seed for Confreaks.

00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,780
So we went home from the conference,

00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,900
started talking about a little bit-

00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,930
I don't know if you know, there's a guy named Mike Moore.

00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:36,010
He runs the MountWest Ruby Conference in Salt Lake City.

00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,920
So he started, he actually had a number of co-organizers

00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,690
the first couple of years.

00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:43,770
In 2007, he felt, I don't know if it was...

00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:47,430
Were there regional conferences before '06?

00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:51,220
So, OK.

00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,390
So Mike started organizing Mountain West RubyConf in 2007

00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:58,450
and he said, we should record this,

00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,810
and I got together with my partner at the time,

00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:05,040
a guy named Carl Youngblood, and we figured,

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,930
you know, Mike was organizing the conference.

00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:10,100
The two of us said all right, we'll go figure out how to record it.

00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,620
So we borrowed some cameras and got a frame grabber and set up,

00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,870
and we recorded to tape,

00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,750
because at the time cameras weren't what they are today.

00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,190
So we recorded everything to tape.

00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,930
We recorded the event,

00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:26,000
we did post-production on it, we came up with-

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,330
Oh, yes, we basically said, how hard can this be?

00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,930
After recording the tape and then spending like,

00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,570
I think it took us like sixty hours to take the data

00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,890
from tape and get it converted into a digital format

00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,370
to where we could then do post-production on it,

00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:49,190
and it was horrible, but we got it done.

00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,880
Later that year we talked with-

00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,040
Ruby Ho-Down was another regional conference

00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:59,290
that happened that year, and they signed up

00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,700
and said yeah, let's record is.

00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,510
So we started to make that one happen.

00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,470
Carl and I went out and bought

00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,890
all new equipment and basically

00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,530
created Confreaks at that point.

00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:14,140
So the company, we set up a company,

00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,750
we went out and bought these cameras

00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,460
and they set up on tripods

00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,270
and we had all this wiring in place.

00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,900
And we'd run all the wires to the back of the room,

00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,190
and one guy sitting at the back of the room

00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:27,070
can remote-control three cameras and do all the switching.

00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:30,870
And it was great, and it was hard,

00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,360
and in 2007 we recorded Mountain West.

00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,990
We recorded Ruby Hoedown. We recorded RubyConf.

00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:40,110
And then through these connections we recorded

00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:44,760
a conference called SmigDig which is a Agile developer conference.

00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,690
It's held every year in Oslo, Norway.

00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,790
So we did our first international conference

00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:54,070
our first year and that was an adventure.

00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,080
But the set-up that we were using at the time,

00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,950
if you can see at the bottom of the slide here,

00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,440
we'd used a double-wide format.

00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,670
So we recorded the video

00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,690
and we recorded the slides

00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,330
and we put them together.

00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,390
And they were in the incredible high definition

00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:13,390
of 960 pixels wide, because both frames were standard definition.

00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:17,990
So that was the first year.

00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,230
One of the things I learned out of the year-

00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,960
Actually this quote came about between my wife

00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,260
and I as we were raising five kids under five-

00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:31,130
"No matter how hard you think it is going to be-"

00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,940
and this applies to just about any endeavor-

00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,140
"you end up wishing it was that easy."

00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:40,570
And part of that falls into the OpenSource

00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:43,680
and the passion and the,

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,110
all of the efforts that we undertake

00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,930
or all of the things that you look at in life.

00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,650
Yes, they're hard, but they're worth it.

00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:57,290
All right, so 2008, we recorded seven conferences.

00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,890
I won't go through them individually.

00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:01,250
The O'Reilly's Tools for Change for Publishers

00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,350
was interesting because it was our first deviation

00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:07,310
from software development and Ruby Conferences.

00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:11,980
But if you notice, we haven't done a lot of those.

00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,840
There's reasons for that.

00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:19,110
We like, I like the community and the spirit that we have here.

00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:24,230
So that was 2008. But, so that year was seven.

00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:29,010
Also in 2008 I'd been doing the independent contractor stuff

00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:34,020
for about two years, and in the United States,

00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:37,910
at the end of 2008, the economy was getting a little...

00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:42,740
a little wonky, and I'd wrapped up a major contract

00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,930
that had been a large part of keeping my business going.

00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:51,540
And I'd gotten to the stage where I was going around and doing-

00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,380
A lot of the work that we were doing at that point

00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,690
was smaller project work and constantly dealing with,

00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,660
where's the next check coming from,

00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,850
and started having some checks bounce here and there

00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,070
and decided that really wasn't where I wanted to go.

00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:07,520
So I wanted a regular income rather than

00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,030
the feast and famine that you get in consulting work.

00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:15,400
So I ended up joining yellowpages dot com.

00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,590
Yellowpages at the time was a wholly-owned subsidiary of AT&T.

00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:23,420
They are no longer owned by AT&T.

00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,870
So that was also a transition in 2008,

00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:28,830
where I went from running my own company, joined yellowpages,

00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:29,850
moved to southern California,

00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,290
and started running a development team there.

00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:35,140
But when I got there, there was no meet-up.

00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,020
There was no regional meet-up and that just

00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:40,630
blew my mind because I came from Salt Lake City, Utah,

00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:45,000
which has a population probably one-third

00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,580
or less of what the LA area has,

00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:51,090
and yet we had Ruby meet-ups about every thirty or forty miles

00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,050
along the major interstate,

00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,410
cause people didn't want to drive more than 30 or 40 miles.

00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:59,410
So they just set up their own meet-up.

00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,820
So when I got to LA there wasn't one,

00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,280
so we created a local meet-up and got that going.

00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,500
And, I'll tell you, the biggest thing about running a meet-up

00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:14,600
and having them work is pick a date, pick a time, and be there.

00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,870
Be there consistently, whether you have presentations or you just hack.

00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:24,970
Make it a staple that people can count on and it will grow.

00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:28,200
Just getting the ability to get people together on a regular basis

00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,600
and something predictable that they can put on their calendars

00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,420
and know that this is gonna be there and it's gonna be at that time and place.

00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:40,420
All right, so that takes us into 2009. Our big change in 2009-

00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,240
And this generally came-

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,110
A lot of the progress that we've had with Confreaks dot com

00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:49,280
over the years has actually came from MountWest RubyConf,

00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,540
when Mike Moore says, hey, I really liked what you did last year,

00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,180
but let's try this.

00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,970
So we switched to doing high-definition slides.

00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:02,060
So instead of capturing them and scaling the slides

00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,570
from your poor resolution output to TV quality output -

00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:09,530
which is a lot worse, or at least was at the time -

00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:12,230
we started capturing them at full resolution and just,

00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,430
we continued that year in 2009 to capture

00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,940
the speakers with standard definition cameras.

00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,240
Let's see, new conferences that year...

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,800
Acts as Conference.

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,870
There's not actually too many regional events

00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:29,000
in this community that have started and then stopped.

00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,970
There's been a couple. Acts as Conference happened once.

00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:37,940
Parallels and Convergences is actually not a Ruby conference.

00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,240
And then we also did a Agile conference that year.

00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,690
In 2010, Mike say, hey, this stuff's really nice,

00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:50,040
but can't we get high definition cameras now?

00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,550
The other thing that happened at the end of 2009 that had

00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:56,450
a major impact on Confreaks is, in both '07 and '08

00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:00,680
we recorded the conference SmigDig in Oslo, and Carl,

00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:05,929
who is my partner in Confreaks, had been talking with a company in Norway,

00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:09,039
and we met up with them both years we were there.

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,750
And at the end of 2009 they offered him a job,

00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:18,260
so Carl moved to Oslo, Norway, at which point I bought him out of Confreaks.

00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:24,409
So 2010 started my first solo year running Confreaks,

00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:26,900
and in that year, Mike pushed me,

00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,199
wanted high definition cameras,

00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:31,270
so I changed from these robotic-controlled cameras

00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,920
that we had to something very similar to what

00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,860
we're using today, as far as the cameras go.

00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,910
But in 2010 we recorded LA, MountainWest.

00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:44,730
Oh, 2009 was the year I launched

00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,310
the Los Angeles Ruby Conferences.

00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,680
I'm gonna back-res there for just a second

00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,980
because I launched the LA Ruby Conference

00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,950
for a very specific reason,

00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,930
and I think it's one of the very similar reasons

00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:59,780
that Prakash has helped launch Garden City Ruby, which was-

00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:05,630
At the time in Los Angeles, I had an engineering team, we had a lot-

00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:08,890
I actually had thirty or forty people working in Ruby

00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:12,590
and I knew there was no way I would ever get the budget approved

00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:16,150
to send thirty people over the period of a year traveling

00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:19,570
to different conferences, to get them to have the experience

00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:23,110
that you all get to have by being here today,

00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:28,940
and as much as people can benefit from the content

00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,160
that we record at these events,

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,480
that's half or less of what you get out of a conference.

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,990
The benefit of attending a conference is not just your relationship

00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,920
listening to speakers up here broadcasting at you,

00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,480
but it's the value you get out of talking to people next to you.

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,460
It's the hallway track. It's the time that you spend actually discussing

00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:58,720
your coding issues, your office issues with other people in similar environments

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,720
that can help influence your culture,

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,680
and there's where a lot of the benefit of all this comes from.

00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,210
So I started LA RubyConf in 2009 because

00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:10,820
it was the best way to A) get all of my people to have

00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:14,870
that experience and B) we were looking for a way to

00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,740
introduce Ruby to more developers

00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,790
because we needed more people who could work in Ruby,

00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:24,850
and in the LA area, there's a huge amount of software development going on,

00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:27,960
but a lot of it's dot net, a lot of it is Java.

00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,490
So we needed a way to introduce those people-

00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:32,760
To this day almost every year at the Los Angeles Ruby Conference,

00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:37,500
when I ask how many people get paid to work in Ruby today,

00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,890
only about sixty percent of the audience gets paid to do Ruby.

00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:45,110
The other forty percent are there to learn about Ruby.

00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:49,670
All right, so 2010, I just got through talking

00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:53,250
about changes with Los Angeles and now I'm leaving.

00:19:53,250 --> 00:20:00,250
So in the end of 2010, I decided that it was time for a change.

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,880
Yellowpages was a fantasy company and a really great opportunity for me,

00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:12,810
and working for AT&T was an interesting set of dynamics,

00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,100
but I wanted to move some place where-

00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,150
My wife has two daughters,

00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:20,010
and one of her daughters lives on the Oregon coast,

00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,160
and we have grandkids up there,

00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,290
so we wanted to be closer to them

00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:25,320
so it wasn't a sixteen hour trip to go visit them.

00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,690
SO I looked for a job doing Ruby,

00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:31,320
running a Ruby shop, found one, and that's all it took.

00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,260
So I went to work for a company called G5.

00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,820
When I moved to Bend, Oregon, I figured small company,

00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,680
seven executive te- or seven members on the executive team.

00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,100
We're gonna have less dysfunction and more ability

00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:49,620
to get things done than dealing with the hundreds of people

00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,820
involved with the bureaucracy,

00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:55,530
or thousands of people in the bureaucracy at AT&T.

00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:56,250
Lesson learned.

00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,370
You can be just as function- dysfunctional

00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:03,280
with five or seven people as you can with hundreds.

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:09,070
So in 2011, we did more conferences,

00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,010
more conferences started showing up.

00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,610
The list of conferences that you see up here

00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:18,059
are events we actually went to and recorded.

00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:20,160
It's by no means a list of all the conferences

00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,670
that were going on in the Ruby community,

00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,830
because there are a lot of events that happen every year

00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:28,000
that we don't record, and if you go to our site we actually

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,110
do a lot of work now to aggregate videos from other conferences

00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:35,040
and not just stuff that we produce.

00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,440
So 2011, Mike came to me and said, hey,

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,020
loved the way the high definition stuff worked out last year -

00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,920
let's live stream.

00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:46,470
So we started live streaming.

00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:52,250
Also in 2011, after moving up to Bend-

00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,910
Bend, Oregon is a community of about 85,000 people,

00:21:55,910 --> 00:22:01,520
so I now have a small development shop working for G5 in Bend.

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,420
I want to hire Ruby talent.

00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,330
How do I get people to come to work for me?

00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,690
So, we decided that-

00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,970
The Bend area is known for a couple of things.

00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:12,940
One: there are several ski resorts;

00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:16,760
and two: we have twelve micro breweries.

00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,770
With a population of 85,000 people.

00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,750
So the community is known for good beer.

00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,260
So we decided that we wanted to do a Ruby conference,

00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,559
and in this case, the focus was a little different.

00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:29,580
The, so we started Ruby on Ales.

00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,800
The focus for Ruby on Ales wasn't so much about

00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,390
getting all the local developers to learn about Ruby,

00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,440
because quite frankly there weren't any, or,

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,670
the local developers we knew of.

00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:41,630
It's a small community.

00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:44,840
We pretty much knew everybody that was writing code.

00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,800
What we wanted to do was put our city on the map

00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,530
in the Ruby community, so that when we talked to people

00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:55,180
we were trying to hire, trying to get people to work with us,

00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,760
that they would know where we were at,

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,020
and having a conference did that.

00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:04,940
That was the primary reason that started Ruby on Ales in 2011.

00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,800
2012, so 2010 and '11,

00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,150
I was basically running Confreaks solo.

00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:14,920
That got a bit arduous and a bit time-stretching,

00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,600
because I still had a day job as well.

00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,240
So in 2010, or 2012,

00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:26,040
I had my first full-time person come on that I trained,

00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,340
and she now actually goes out and records conferences solo,

00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,170
and I've got a second person that'll start

00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:34,809
recording conferences solo in 2014.

00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:41,809
Mike didn't have actually any technology changes in 2012,

00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,570
so adding staff and getting our response times-

00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:48,120
One thing that some of the community experienced

00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,250
in 2010 and a bit in '11, is I'd go record a conference

00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,850
and then it would take six, eight,

00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,870
and in some cases twelve weeks before you saw the videos.

00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:01,400
Adding staff has fixed that. All of the-

00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,700
we recorded RubyConf this year in November, 8th through the 10th,

00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,300
and all of the videos were online by

00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:11,400
December 4th or 5th I believe, and that was,

00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,610
you know, that's sixty some-odd videos.

00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:18,580
2013. Now that I had full-time staff

00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,790
and other people working on it

00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:22,240
and wasn't marred with doing all of the production,

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,309
post-production work myself, we expanded.

00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:27,970
So we actually recorded twenty- looks like I missed one,

00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:32,220
we recorded twenty-three events in 2013.

00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,150
Got out of the country again

00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:38,100
and recorded Arrr Camp and Git Belgiam this year in 2013.

00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,150
The exciting thing is,

00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,880
I've now been doing the conferences

00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,670
and recording them, producing them for you know six years,

00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:53,670
and in 2013 we saw a ton of new regional conferences occur in the community.

00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,670
Berlington Ruby, which is probably the- actually,

00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:58,390
it wasn't their first year,

00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:01,240
they'd been doing it for a couple of years,

00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,630
but Berlington, Vermont is a city of about 45,000 people.

00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:09,510
Berlington holds a lot of statistical records for things -

00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:16,090
like they have the biggest shortest building in the country,

00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:19,270
things of that nature, where, you know, they have the tallest,

00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:21,170
tallest building in the state of Vermont,

00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:26,880
is the shortest building of all the other states that have tall buildings.

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,309
So Vermont's a very small community,

00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:30,700
and Berlington was the, is the capitol of Vermont,

00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,230
it's the largest city and it has a population base of 45,000.

00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:37,620
So it's fun to see even small communities,

00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,840
out in the middle of- I won't say out in the middle of nowhere,

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,990
but smaller communities can do this too.

00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:45,090
Conferences are something that can be done

00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:48,600
and can be done by a group of committed people.

00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:53,210
One of the other things that we did in 2013 is,

00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,790
in addition to Ruby on Ales, which is our Ruby Conference-

00:25:55,790 --> 00:26:01,910
Oh, also in 2012, yeah, in 2012,

00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:08,910
I left G5 and went back to work for the Deathstar at AT&T,

00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,710
only now I'm working at AT&T corporate,

00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,540
and we build cloud computing stuff,

00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:16,720
and that's where the OpenStack influence comes in.

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,610
But the OpenStack community is very,

00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,170
it's different than the Ruby community,

00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:22,700
because if you look in the Ruby community,

00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,490
if you look at our list of sponsors,

00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:28,510
our sponsors are generally small to medium-sized companies

00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:31,540
that are working on creating products

00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,559
and creating themselves

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,480
and building a marketplace and making things happen with technology.

00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,670
In the OpenStack community,

00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:45,200
the sponsors are folks like AT&T, IBM, CISCO, Hewlett Packard.

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,250
They're huge corporations who are involved

00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:54,660
with being able to build and utilize cloud platforms,

00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,809
and OpenStack itself is a project that came out of

00:26:56,809 --> 00:27:00,490
a joint effort between NASA, which is the

00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,480
National Aeronautics and Space Association

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,990
in the United States and another company

00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,510
that built OpenStack together,

00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,290
and then they released it.

00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:10,910
I wanted to bring this feel of community to OpenStack,

00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:13,429
so we started OpenStack on Ales,

00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:18,420
and the small tech there is we had thirty-five attendees.

00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,690
It's a new concept.

00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,880
But even with thirty-five people are the conference,

00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,429
and I think that's about what you had at RubyConf in 2001,

00:27:25,429 --> 00:27:31,270
isn't it Chad? Thirty-four people at RubyConf in 2001-

00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:33,830
So we're spreading the idea of

00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:37,860
small intimate gatherings and meet-ups in conferences.

00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,929
So that was 2013.

00:27:38,929 --> 00:27:42,590
2014, this is where we stand now.

00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:46,610
The first even we're recording this year is Garden City RubyConf.

00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:51,520
Thank you for having us.

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,059
We will be, the conferences that are listed,

00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:56,910
there are ones that we are relatively

00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:02,210
confident we will be recording and/or producing this year.

00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:04,549
So with that, I've got three or four minutes left.

00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:08,130
I want to get real quick, OpenSource and the enterprise.

00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,450
I worked for AT&T today

00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:12,110
and I've been there for about two years,

00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,440
and in my previous stints-

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,559
So we're doing things, we're using OpenStack,

00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:20,570
we're using Python, we're using Ruby, the way-

00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:25,860
I just have a couple points I want to sum up here.

00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,290
The important thing is, if you work for large companies

00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:32,870
that are starting to utilize OpenSource,

00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:36,110
one of the things is, at least within AT&T which is

00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,830
where most of my experience with this is,

00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,250
they want to know who's the vendor that's going

00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,620
to be responsible for this.

00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:47,679
If we use Rails, who are we going to call when there's a problem?

00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:53,230
My solution to that was we hired four developers.

00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,990
So part of my pitch that I've done within AT&T

00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:00,110
for using OpenSource software is, we may not get a vendor,

00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:04,510
but the problem as a company, even if we're your biggest purchases,

00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,980
we can't dictate what there,

00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,679
how you respond to this problem that we have.

00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:10,760
We can put pressure on you

00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:16,580
and we can put pressure on vendors to do things, but we can't control it as concisely.

00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,130
With OpenSource, if I have an issue on Rails,

00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:21,809
if we have an issue on any of our applications,

00:29:21,809 --> 00:29:26,270
with Activerecord or whatever,

00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,920
I can get a person who is a core contributor to

00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,770
Activerecord to fix the problem,

00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:35,570
because we've been able to convince management that,

00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:36,610
ok, so we don't have a vendor,

00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:39,000
so we need to put money into OpenSource.

00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,970
We need to hire people

00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:42,809
and we need to pay them to work on OpenSource full time.

00:29:42,809 --> 00:29:43,990
You're not gonna be able to do this

00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,040
with smaller companies because it just doesn't work out.

00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,000
With larger companies,

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,240
where you'd normally be spending hundreds of thousands of dollars

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,260
a year with an organization to support you otherwise,

00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:57,030
you can make the argument to spend the money on staff,

00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,170
and we've done that.

00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:01,160
And, so Erin Patterson works for me at AT&T,

00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,510
so if I have an Activerecord issue,

00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,820
I've got the Activerecord guy that we can,

00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,030
that I can have him fix it.

00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:10,010
Now luckily I don't have to do that very often,

00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:13,270
because it's a pretty solid platform.

00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,470
So in the, if you're in bigger companies

00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,960
and they're utilizing OpenSource,

00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,660
don't be afraid to make that argument,

00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:22,580
that instead of paying for support to a vendor,

00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:26,190
we should be investing in our own people to make the product better,

00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:31,290
and we go through that with OpenStack as well as Ruby and Python.

00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:37,530
OK, OpenSource and you.

00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:39,240
One of the reasons I started Confreaks

00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,210
back when I did is I'm what I call a glue coder.

00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:45,850
I take disparate systems, I put them together.

00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:47,830
I write code that gets them to talk to each other

00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:52,179
and make things work, and that's what I do,

00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:57,860
and that creates a lot of code that generally needs better tests,

00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:02,530
a lot of code that doesn't have any tests at all,

00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:04,549
or a lot of code that runs inefficiently,

00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:08,490
because I don't have the patience to optimize code.

00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:12,049
So, when I, as I got involved with Ruby,

00:31:12,049 --> 00:31:14,370
I looked at Confreaks, I looked at what was available

00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:17,920
and I said, one of the ways that I can give back to the community

00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:23,059
is by taking this non-obvious route of creating these videos

00:31:23,059 --> 00:31:26,830
and making this content available to help build the community,

00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,299
and that's the way I'm gonna give back,

00:31:28,299 --> 00:31:30,169
because that's what I'm good at,

00:31:30,169 --> 00:31:33,440
is organization and community and people.

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,400
I'm not as good at code,

00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,100
but I love what we create here, so that's where I focus.

00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,470
So as you think about what you're doing with OpenSource,

00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:46,700
think about what, how you can contribute

00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,360
and what you can do that takes advantage of your unique skill set,

00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:55,510
not about making the next project that everybody's gonna use,

00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:59,640
because there's so many supporting roles that need to be done,

00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,230
so keep that in mind as you're looking at it.

00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:03,030
And in the next section, real quick,

00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:05,720
I'm gonna go through it a little bit quicker, is just,

00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:12,140
it's a couple things to think about in both your professional and personal lives.

00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,020
So my first question for you to ponder is,

00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:18,410
why are you doing what you're doing today?

00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:23,360
And when I wrote that I was looking not so much as you,

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,700
as why you are at this conference as I was,

00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:30,590
why are you doing what you spend forty plus hours a week on?

00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:36,850
Understand why you're doing it. What are you trying to accomplish by doing it?

00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:40,870
So, like I said, I've got six kids.

00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:43,559
So one of the reasons I work every day

00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:46,010
and do what it is I do is to generate the money

00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,460
to give me a certain lifestyle

00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,910
and allow my kids to have a certain lifestyle

00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,740
and to be able to go to college

00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,860
and to be able to learn and do things.

00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:58,809
That's one of the reasons I do what it is that I do.

00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:02,030
Is what you're doing today what

00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:09,030
you would be doing if you knew you could not fail?

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:18,200
So if you knew you couldn't fail at what you're gonna be doing,

00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:23,370
would you do something differently than what you're doing today?

00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:29,650
And it's OK if what you're doing facilitates your passions,

00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:33,150
meaning, sometimes you work a job that is not

00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:36,460
the thing that you care the most about,

00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:39,520
but it gives you the resources

00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:43,870
and the liberty to pursue the things that you care about,

00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:46,700
and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.

00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,690
I mean that's crucial.

00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:52,370
It also makes it so that you can care more about your day job,

00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:54,960
or that thing you're doing that's not your passion.

00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,809
You can care a whole lot more about it

00:33:56,809 --> 00:33:59,309
and be a whole lot more excited about it if you understand

00:33:59,309 --> 00:34:01,590
why you're doing it and that you're doing it

00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,830
to drive something else in your life.

00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:07,929
It makes it much less monotonous

00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:10,460
or much less tedious if you know that,

00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:14,780
because I do X, I may be able to do Y.

00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:17,970
So the last slide.

00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:19,359
You owe it to yourself to understand

00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,460
why you're doing it and what you expect out of it.

00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,540
Yeah, another, just see where my slide is,

00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:33,540
I'm almost done. Yup, lost that thought.

00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:40,769
OK, last quote, this is one of my favorite quotes.

00:34:40,769 --> 00:34:45,210
It says, "In the information age, the barriers just aren't there.

00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,489
The barriers are self-imposed.

00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:50,399
If you want to set off and go develop some grand new thing,

00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:53,579
you don't need millions of dollars of capitalization.

00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:56,379
You need enough pizza and Diet Coke to stick in your refrigerator,

00:34:56,379 --> 00:34:57,849
a cheap PC to work on,

00:34:57,849 --> 00:35:00,519
and the dedication to go through with it."

00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:02,220
This is a quote from John Carmack,

00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:06,400
who is the- one of the founders of id,

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,380
created many of the first-person shooter games

00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:11,109
and the graphic engines that were behind them.

00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,950
The key to this, though, in my opinion,

00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:17,789
is not the - I can't see my capitalization, anyway -

00:35:17,789 --> 00:35:19,390
the key to it is this:

00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:22,069
"...and the dedication to go through with it."

00:35:22,069 --> 00:35:25,349
So the effort that it takes to put on a conference,

00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:28,950
the effort it takes to attend, not even organization,

00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:31,049
but to attend a meet-up is just

00:35:31,049 --> 00:35:32,650
the dedication to go through with it.

00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:33,609
The commitment to say hey,

00:35:33,609 --> 00:35:36,180
I'm gonna take one evening a month,

00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,720
or one evening every other month,

00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,739
and go to this meet-up

00:35:38,739 --> 00:35:42,400
and participate and work on building my own skills.

00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:49,400
It's all about the dedication to go through with it. And with that, thank you.
