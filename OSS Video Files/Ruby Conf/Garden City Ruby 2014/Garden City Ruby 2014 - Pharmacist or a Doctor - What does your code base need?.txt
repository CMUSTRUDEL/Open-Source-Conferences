You might know of every single code quality & metrics tool in the Ruby ecosystem and what they give you, but do you know:

Which metrics do you currently need?
Do you really need them?
How do you make your team members own them?
Wait, there was a metaphor in the title

While a pharmacist knows about pretty much every medicine out there and what it cures, its really a doctor who figures out what is required given the symptoms of a patient.

Just like the vitals recorded for healthy adults, infants, pregnant women or an accident patient in an ICU changes, your code base needs different metrics in different contexts to help you uncover problems.

Talk take aways

Through a lot of examples, the talk helps:

Identify the current state of your code base
Understand different metrics and what do they tell you about your code base
Drive your team towards continuously fixing problems uncovered by these metrics
