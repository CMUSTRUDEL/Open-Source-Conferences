PRAKASH MURTHY: Good evening, everyone!

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,040
AUDIENCE: [mumbling, speaking] Good evening!

00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,840
P.M.: I see the energy has sapped totally. We

00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,320
are at the end of the conference and there's...

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,030
At least that's how I am feeling. Am...

00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,210
AUDIENCE: [indecipherable]

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,150
P.M.: OK. Good evening everyone!

00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,920
AUDIENCE: Good evening!

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,210
P.M.: Yay! All right, do you- so, are you

00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:55,010
ready for the last session of the Garden City

00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,460
Ruby Conference 2014?

00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,340
AUDIENCE: Yeah!

00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:07,340
P.M.: Yes! So let me start by this thing.

00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:13,060
This happened the day before the conference,

00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,750
and I haven't processed all the

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,280
things that have happened in the last two days,

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,720
but I feel like this is the best thing

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,500
for, from my perspective in the last, in this

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,800
conference. First off, we have already fixed this problem.

00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,440
There are, there are no longer one Ruby conferences

00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,330
in India. There are - how many?

00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,420
AUDIENCE: Two!

00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:42,420
P.M.: Two Ruby conferences in India now. But I,

00:01:45,349 --> 00:01:49,310
I was really kind of shocked when Chad said

00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,270
that. Yeah, in the US it was like that,

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,940
in fact in the whole world it was like

00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:57,390
that. In fact, there was no Ruby conferences ever,

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,119
and then somebody said let's make one happen. So

00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,630
Chad and a few others joined together and did

00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,369
the first RubyConf in the US. And I was

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:10,030
surprised learn that it was, it had only thirty-one

00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:17,030
participants. 2001. In Tampa. And now, this year's RubyConf

00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:22,670
in Miami had around 500 participants. So it's grown

00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:28,379
all like that over the last twelve years. I

00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:31,170
find it heartening because we are at that stage,

00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:35,500
where they were back in 2001 and 2002. We

00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,390
can learn from them and get, butt ahead in

00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:46,390
the next couple of years. So, so this is

00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:55,820
what I have planned for this talk. I was

00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,280
not supposed to be here. My plan for this

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,920
conference was to be spending all the time with

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:12,920
my beautiful daughter and leave the team, team to

00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:20,030
take care of everything. And everything was going fine.

00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,900
In fact, two m- last two months I haven't

00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,900
been on the mailing list as well. I let

00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,730
the team take care of everything and I was

00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:35,400
just, once in awhile, say what's up, what's happening.

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,730
But today, we lost one of our keynote speakers,

00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,220
and so that was a major crisis. I didn't

00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,010
want to leave it on the team. So I

00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,890
came here, and I'm here, and I'm on stage

00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:52,580
giving this talk. With not much preparation, I thought

00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,330
it's maybe a good idea to just share about

00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,290
how we came to be here. How this whole

00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:00,730
Garden City Ruby thing happened. You guys interested in

00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,590
learning more about Garden City Ruby?

00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,050
AUDIENCE: Yes. Yeah.

00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:08,270
P.M.: OK. Let's begin at, from the very beginning.

00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:14,020
In the beginning there was nothing. Let's see, let's

00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:19,039
see... yes. In the beginning there was nothing, then

00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:23,930
on June 29th, 2013, I sent email to the

00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,400
Bangalore Ruby user group, saying hey, let's do a

00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,800
conference. This was a week after last, this year's

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,770
RubyConf India in Pune, where I gave a talk

00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,310
about taking Indian Ruby community to the next level.

00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:43,520
There I talked about essentially what Satir?? [00:04:43] talked

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,970
about in his community lightning talk. We need more

00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:52,430
meet ups, we need more conferences. Afterwards, I got

00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,100
a lot of good feedback. A lot of people

00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,440
came up to me and said, hey, you inspired

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,720
us, we are going to do a meetup in

00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,630
Mumbai. We are going to do a meetup in

00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,770
Kochi or whatever. Nobody really talked about doing a

00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:06,970
conference. So I said, OK, you know what, let

00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:11,880
me show it by example how it is done,

00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:18,310
and I started this project. This mail got an

00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,270
amazing response. Around fifteen, twenty people responded on the

00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,520
Bangalore Ruby usergroup saying hey, we are interested. We

00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:29,520
want to help you. So, thanks to the Bangalore

00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:36,290
Ruby user group for that kind of amazing response.

00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:43,290
Next. So that's when it started. And the very

00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,990
first thing I focused on was to get the

00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:55,040
keynote speakers. As somebody was pointing out to me

00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,730
earlier, if we have the key, one or two

00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:02,690
keynote speakers, well-known keynote speakers in the line-up, it

00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:08,110
becomes very easy to sell the conference to others.

00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:12,400
And the first person I approached to was Chad,

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,560
and Chad enthusiastically said, yes, I'm coming to Bangalore.

00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,460
I want to be in Bangalore. And, yeah, I

00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,120
was telling Chad yesterday, I attribute 80% of the

00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,030
success of this conference to him. Because of him

00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:30,550
being here, a lot of people decided to come

00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,780
here. We got a lot of sponsors to pay

00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:39,780
up. He says I'm, you know, I'm wrong, but

00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:47,150
I believe, at least, if not 80, 79%. Yeah.

00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:52,000
We got the keynote speakers lined up. Now that

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,150
one, one other point I want to make here.

00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:57,229
We can't keep having Chad come here every time

00:06:57,229 --> 00:06:59,830
we want to have a conference. So we need

00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:04,340
more Indian Chad Fowlers. So we need more of

00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,680
the people sitting here to be up here a

00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,260
lot of times, and make a name for themselves,

00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,940
so that when you go to another place, or

00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,220
some city to give a talk, people pay to

00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,199
come and see you. So we'll get there in

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,800
a couple of years. Who wants to take up

00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:27,270
that challenge? Nice. Nice to see a few hands

00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:34,270
go up. The next thing I want to talk

00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:40,889
about is the first, the organization behind this conference.

00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:43,949
So when I first started talking about this conference,

00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:49,120
my original idea was that we'll go with ITT.

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,870
ITT is the entity which puts up RubyConf India.

00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:59,180
They have done a phenomenally good job of organizing

00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,560
four annual Ruby conferences in India. And you already

00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,370
heard from Ajay in the morning about the background

00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:11,600
of those conferences. Very soon in the process I

00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,789
realized that may not work out for me, or

00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:21,570
at least, what I was trying to accomplish. If

00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:25,400
we had gone with ITT, it would mostly have

00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,780
been, again, Ajey, Gautam and a few others doing

00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,229
most of the work, or taking most of the

00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:37,110
key decisions. And there's no - it would just

00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:41,060
be another RubyConf India. I wanted a totally new

00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,380
team to come up, learn from scratch how to

00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,759
do all this. How to do, get sponsors, how

00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:51,560
to put up a program, how to organi- do

00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,100
all the logistics stuff required for setting up a

00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,920
good conference. So I decided in the very beginning,

00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,369
OK, not, we are not going to go with

00:08:59,369 --> 00:09:01,429
ITT. We are going to start a- we'll have

00:09:01,429 --> 00:09:07,990
a new, non-profit entity created. And so maybe, it

00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,509
took us awhile to get there, but two months

00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:14,779
later I think we had our trust. So these

00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:21,779
are the six trust members. So among the organizing

00:09:22,249 --> 00:09:24,809
team, it's me and Tejas who are not on

00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:28,259
the trust, for different reasons. Everyone else is on

00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:35,259
the trust, and yeah. The one hour of time,

00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:44,149
Satish at this point, because he did all the

00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:47,509
ground work for finding out what's required to do,

00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:50,829
set up a trust. And he is also followed

00:09:50,829 --> 00:09:54,809
up on the financial part of it. So big

00:09:54,809 --> 00:10:01,809
hand to Satish. Satish over here. So, yeah, that's

00:10:03,439 --> 00:10:06,329
probably about the organization part. Then about the talk

00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:13,160
selection and, talk proposals and selections. I want to

00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,309
share this interesting breakdown of all the talk proposals

00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:22,220
we got. Total we got seventy-two talk proposals. That's

00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,399
a good number, given that we had only around

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,439
a month's time for call, when the call for

00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:35,439
proposal was open. What do you make of this?

00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:40,749
Everybody wants to submit a talk at the last

00:10:40,749 --> 00:10:47,749
minute. This, actually we- Where's Leena? Come on up

00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:57,449
here. Carry the mic for her. Oh, you, yeah.

00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:01,220
So Leena had the idea that we should actually

00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,230
train some of these people who give us a

00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:08,449
proposal and then maybe, yeah, we could interact with

00:11:08,449 --> 00:11:12,769
them, and then we'll lead much better proposals and

00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:16,589
much better talks in this conference. If this happens,

00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:19,809
if everybody submits at the last minute, we can't

00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:23,689
do much about that. So next time a conference

00:11:23,689 --> 00:11:28,399
is announced, please make sure you submit a talk

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,139
right at the beginning. We, we, well, I want

00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:34,489
this to be reversed. I want more talk proposals

00:11:34,489 --> 00:11:37,989
coming at the beginning than at the end. Just,

00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:41,829
I have a few questions for you. So I'll

00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:46,970
just show a couple of other things. We got

00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:51,360
sixty-seven proposals from men and five proposals from women,

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,569
and of the five proposals from women, three were

00:11:53,569 --> 00:11:58,040
from the same person, and one was a, was

00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,809
paired with a perso- guy.

00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:02,730
LEENA S N: And the-

00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,519
P.M.: And the last one was, we made, we invited

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,079
those two to submit a talk. That was Sakshi

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,600
and Pallavi. We told them we need you here

00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,550
talking, so you need to propose. So really this

00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:16,569
was almost non-existant for the number of proposals by

00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:16,980
women.

00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,339
L.S.N.: And that too the three proposals was

00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,709
not from India- I mean-

00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:23,319
P.M.: Again, yeah, that three proposals-

00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:25,739
L.S.N.: It was from Emily, Emily from Mongol?? [00:12:26]

00:12:25,739 --> 00:12:30,529
P.M.: So the womenfolk in the room here.

00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:33,670
Any thoughts of submitting proposals for the next

00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:40,670
conference? OK. Let's, let's change this. We got a

00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:47,850
lot of proposals from different countries as well. But

00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,389
ultimately it ended up that none of them could

00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:55,079
come. We selected two of the speakers from this,

00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:59,959
for, from non, who are not from India, and

00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:01,819
both could not come for different reasons, so we

00:13:01,819 --> 00:13:05,160
ended up with only Indian speaker line-up, other than

00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:12,129
the invited keynote speakers. I was very happy with,

00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:17,619
to see this. The breakup from different cities. This

00:13:17,619 --> 00:13:20,589
shows that there is room for having meetups and

00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:23,670
conferences at each of these cities as well. You

00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:29,290
just need to start something there. OK, this is

00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,879
fine. So Leena. How did we go about talk

00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,829
selection. What, what happened?

00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:37,339
L.S.N.: So, like I'm, like

00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:41,139
Prakash mentioned, we wanted to have a lot of

00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:45,779
conversation with the submitters, but that didn't happen because

00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:48,989
of lots, so many proposals came in. So we

00:13:48,989 --> 00:13:53,410
relied on the busyconf rating system, so all, all,

00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,589
everyone in the, in the organizing committee, they rated

00:13:55,589 --> 00:13:58,790
the talks, and we went with the - most

00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:02,839
of the time we went with the rating, given

00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:06,220
by the, the auto rating given by busyconf as

00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,319
rated by all the organizers. And we had given

00:14:09,319 --> 00:14:14,379
some exceptions. Like the Rails Girls, we thought, OK,

00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:16,959
we want them to be talking about how we

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,600
ran. Because it's experience important that, that should encourage

00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,189
others to join these kind of things. So, so

00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:26,100
we made some exceptions like that, but mainly it

00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,609
was the rating given by, given by the organization.

00:14:28,609 --> 00:14:31,529
P.M.: So it's these ratings here. Each of the

00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:35,329
team members gave a rating and we rated all

00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:38,009
the talks. So started ?? from the ?? [00:14:38].

00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:41,259
There were a few exceptions, right.

00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:45,329
L.N.S.: Yeah, we had, only Rails Girls was the exception.

00:14:45,329 --> 00:14:47,249
P.M.: Rails Girls was exception, and I think

00:14:47,249 --> 00:14:49,799
Emily also we had to remove one of her talks.

00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:53,439
L.N.S.: Yeah, and we also, so Emily's - we, I think

00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,079
we have, we can pull out the blog post

00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:56,299
that we have written. So we also, apart from

00:14:56,299 --> 00:14:59,199
the rating, we also decided that we would not

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,929
have more than two speakers outside of India, and

00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:06,029
we'll have only one speaker from the organizing company-

00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:06,739
P.M.: Organizing team, yes.

00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,579
L.N.S.: Even if it gets

00:15:07,579 --> 00:15:11,429
higher rating. And we also decided that we'll not

00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:15,139
have two talks from the same person, so that

00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:18,259
negated many of them in the top, because Emily's

00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:20,809
almost, all talks from Emily got a higher rating.

00:15:20,809 --> 00:15:26,269
But we negated those because same speaker, and outside

00:15:26,269 --> 00:15:27,269
India. And then we relied on the rating-

00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:27,829
P.M.: Yeah.

00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:30,059
L.N.S.: And exception was, and apart from those

00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:31,779
exceptions, we gave the exceptions to Rails Girls-

00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:32,619
P.M.: Rails Girls, yeah.

00:15:32,619 --> 00:15:33,569
L.N.S.: Because we, because of the

00:15:33,569 --> 00:15:36,829
Rails reason, and I think that was a very

00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:38,889
good talk and I think we learned quite a

00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:40,279
few things from them, so.

00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:41,429
P.M.: And Hermant had

00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:43,600
a very good talk proposal and which rated very

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:43,889
high.

00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:45,499
L.N.S.: So there was a lot of-

00:15:45,499 --> 00:15:46,569
P.M.: And we had to remove him.

00:15:46,569 --> 00:15:47,029
L.N.S.: Yeah, there

00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,269
was a lot of debate on, we had to,

00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:53,049
we, among us organizers, we had to, we had

00:15:53,049 --> 00:15:56,859
a lot of debates. And that, that talk went

00:15:56,859 --> 00:15:59,790
for a couple of calls, and then finally we

00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,319
decided we'll have only one talk, and Hermant had

00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:05,470
two. But Hermant had a very good Panel Discussion-

00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,290
P.M.: Panel Discussion, yeah.

00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,350
L.N.S.: And, that I think

00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,959
was a huge success, so.

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,119
P.M.: OK. So. I

00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:14,199
want to thank Leena for doing a phenomenal job

00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:21,199
with the talk selection and leading everything. Thank you.

00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:26,799
You can give it to her. I want to

00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:29,299
thank Emil over here for managing the website and

00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:33,959
everything related to that. He, he didn't do all

00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,449
the work, but he got the right people involved

00:16:36,449 --> 00:16:38,019
at the right time, and he gave us what

00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:42,059
we wanted. The blog featured in the website, it

00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:49,059
was amazing. He made it superb. How many of

00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:55,689
you know about the opportunities scholarship that we gave

00:16:55,689 --> 00:17:02,689
in this conference? Nice. So, Swanand, what's this opportunities

00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:10,439
scholarship that we are talking about?

00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:17,260
SWANAND PAGNIS: So the opportunities scholarship

00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,339
is an opportunity for those students

00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:23,839
and other underrepresented groups to attend a conference. For

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,939
example students, who are studying ?? [00:17:26], who really

00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:28,860
want to be a part of the community, talk

00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,650
to other people, but cannot really afford to travel

00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:35,800
all the way to Bangalore, or even for the

00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,160
conference tickets. Usually conference tickets in India are like

00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,400
two, three thousand, in that range. For a student

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,230
it's a decently steep price. So the idea was

00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,820
also implemented in RubyConf India. I was one of

00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,900
the mentors of one of the students, and I

00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,030
really had fun interacting with them all along, like,

00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:57,740
about the month leading to the conference, and on

00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:02,240
the conference days itself. So Prakash and I decided

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,810
that if the budget allows it we are going

00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:07,010
to do the opportunities scholarship here at GCRC, too.

00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,140
And, well I'll a-

00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,950
P.M.: This is the list.

00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,950
S.P.: So this is the list of all the

00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:15,540
selected students, and-

00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,990
P.M.: So where are the scholarship winners?

00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,940
S.P.: Can all of them please stand up.

00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,170
P.M.: Can you stand up.

00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,400
S.P.: All the students.

00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,890
P.M.: Students! And most of them don't even know

00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:30,280
Ruby, they are seeing the Ruby for the first

00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,690
time, a couple of them are seeing Ruby for

00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:32,580
the first time.

00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,050
S.P.: Tushar here is coming from,

00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,410
all the way from Jaiper.

00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:39,680
P.M.: OK. Thank you.

00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:46,680
And, OK. Oh yeah. I missed out some- an

00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,700
important point here, which we did a lot of

00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,350
work in figuring out the way to hold this

00:18:54,350 --> 00:19:00,900
conference, and making all arrangements: food, logistics, the internet,

00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:07,900
everything - all this. Lanyards, t-shirts, all that. Tejas

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,070
and Dheeraj- Dheeraj is here? OK, so big hand

00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:23,070
to Tejas and Dheeraj, please. So this is what

00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:35,040
happened with our registrations. We made that much money

00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,570
from it, and we had a total of 187

00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:43,680
participants register. That included both people who paid for

00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:50,680
their tickets and who got complimentary admission. Our aim

00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,930
was to make it a two hundred people partici-

00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:59,380
conference. Keep it very limited - not, RubyConf India,

00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:02,450
yeah, has four hundred people. Yeah. I was there

00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:05,540
for two days, and I didn't meet a couple

00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,310
of people I wanted to meet, even though I

00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,070
was there for two days. It was such big

00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:11,390
crowd there. Here I wanted it, to keep it

00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:15,010
smaller, two hundred, so that everybody can meet everybody

00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:22,010
else. Has that mostly been accomplished? Yeah, 174. OK.

00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:26,330
And again, of that, I think that around twelve

00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:29,440
or fifteen people didn't show up. So it's about

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,980
160 people who have been here for the last

00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,140
two days.

00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,300
V.O.: 174

00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,200
P.M.: 174? Oh great. Oh

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,420
that's, you already submitted, removed the number. Great. And,

00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,160
one other thing I want to show is the,

00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:52,160
before I come here. It's in some- one of

00:20:53,490 --> 00:21:00,490
these tabs. Yes. This was maybe a day, couple

00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:06,470
of days ago that we went through our finances.

00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:09,610
We got a total income of around one grand

00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:12,760
for forty- oh, forty grand, forty to a thousand.

00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,220
We started with the idea that we'll have this

00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:21,470
fifteen grand event, but, and even with a fifteen

00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:25,320
grand budget. We met that target, almost came very,

00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,170
we came very close to meeting that target, with

00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:32,720
the sponsors and ticket sales. And expenses, we, yeah,

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,610
it looks like we are just a little bit

00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:41,120
below our income, or maybe a little bit over.

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,670
We'll know in a couple of days. We had

00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:46,850
a couple of last minute expenses come through, so,

00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:49,240
but yeah. In this context, I want to thank

00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:56,240
all the sponsors. These folks made it really easy

00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:09,740
for us to put up an awesome event, and

00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,610
it was also amazing how easy it was for

00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:18,610
us to get the sponsorship. At one point, there

00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,350
was some doubt that maybe we won't be able

00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:24,980
to do it. We won't have enough money, we

00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,470
won't be able to do - we may have

00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:30,200
to cut off a few things. We probably won't

00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:35,440
have the opportunities scholarship or maybe not, if not

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,840
lunch, at least cut something in the lunch or

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,670
whatever. So. All that didn't happen. We could get

00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:47,240
all the, the budgeted, the intended amount of money.

00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,590
So thank you Flipkart, thank you Josh, thank you

00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:53,700
Nilenso, thank you GitHub, thank you Qwinix, thank you

00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,910
ParamiSoft, thank you Bang the Table, thank you MavenHive,

00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:02,570
thank you GoodWorkLabs, thank you CodeBrahma, thank you CodeMancers,

00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:06,700
thank you Multunus, thank you Mahaswami, thank you SupportBee,

00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,610
thank you Icicle, thank you Cognitive Clouds, thank you

00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:16,610
Big Binary and thank you MaSymbol. Maybe I should

00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:24,290
have said yes there, right, to update. MartMe and

00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,110
StartUp Village in Kochi?? [00:23:33] - they were the

00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:41,110
t-shirt sponsors, so thank you MartMe and StartUp Village.

00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,120
So wow. I covered all ten of the items

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,440
I had there. So now. My hope from this

00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,340
conference is that it will inspire some of you

00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,240
to go back to your towns and start something

00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,110
similar there. In that context, what questions do you

00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:04,090
have for me and the team here? So I

00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,910
want all the team members to come up here.

00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:09,560
So, questions, questions. OK. Yeah?

00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:14,110
QUESTION: So what difference

00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:21,110
does having a conference like this have over all

00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:37,240
the regular meetups and workshops, and- P.M.: Yeah, who

00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:44,130
in the audience can answer him? Yeah. Let's -

00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:46,500
let Gautam handle it.

00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,850
GAUTAM REGE: So the short

00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:52,110
answer - the more, the merrier. Right. And the

00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:54,980
longer answer to that is that in a larger

00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,060
conference, you get to meet a lot of other

00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,840
people, see how they work. See how- which all

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,050
companies are interested. See what the other people, what

00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:07,430
experience they have. And that's why conferences, people take

00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:10,470
time out to come for conferences. Sometimes it happens

00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:13,090
in meet ups that, you know, it's an beyond

00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:14,190
my job thing.

00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:14,600
P.M.: Yeah.

00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,270
G.R.: So if I

00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:17,370
go there, it's OK, if I don't go, then

00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:19,010
it's fine. But a conference, you attend. Meet ups

00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:21,060
- I'm not sure I'm paid meetups.

00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:21,750
P.M.: So-

00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,800
G.R.: Do we have paid meetups?

00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,720
P.M.: ?? [00:25:23]

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,980
Has Chad Fowler ever covered your meet up? Conference,

00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:31,360
we need conference for that. K, next?

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:37,490
QUESTION: I would like to answer his - I would like

00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:41,130
to answer his question in one line. It, the

00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:44,740
difference between ?? [00:25:43]. People go to ?? [00:25:44],

00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,760
people don't go to ?? [00:25:47]. So there's the

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,690
answer I would give.

00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:53,690
P.M.: OK.

00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:59,970
QUESTION: Hello. What should be the mindset of a person who is

00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:03,000
attending a conference, or what should one expect from

00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,720
a conference-

00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,080
P.M.: From a conference.

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,390
QUESTION: Or what should one do for a

00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:07,180
conference, or, for that matter, a meet up?

00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,680
P.M.: As a participant or

00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,490
as an organizer?

00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:10,150
QUESTION: As a participant.

00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:15,730
P.M.: OK, as a participant, I would say, to make more,

00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:21,170
new friends. And to learn new things.

00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:25,990
TEJAS DINKAR: All right, does anyone else on the team want

00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:28,860
to answer that question as well? Swanand, or ??

00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,220
[00:26:29]

00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,850
S.P.: One important thing you need to consider

00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:35,580
when you're attending any conference is basically meeting new

00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:39,010
people. So the talks and everything is one part

00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:42,340
of, obviously they're important. And probably talks, you're gonna

00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,760
go back home and watch it again on ConFreaks.

00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,300
It's all being recorded. So the most important thing

00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,330
is you know meet new people and make new

00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:51,230
friends. That is the reason, one of the reasons

00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:54,370
why we have reduced the talk period from forty

00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:56,620
minutes to thirty minutes, and have increased the lunch

00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,850
time and the, you know, coffee breaks. So that

00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,850
people get to talk to each other more. So

00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,929
that's the reason behind that.

00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:03,710
??: Meet new people

00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:07,540
or keep meeting your friends at conferences. There are

00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,880
many people who I only meet at meet ups

00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,020
or only at RubyConf India or RubyConf.

00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:15,810
P.M.: And I meet Coby at every conference I go to.

00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:19,650
OK, next question here.

00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:23,500
QUESTION: First of all, you

00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,440
guys did an excellent job of getting this conference

00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,140
together. I basically have two questions. First is, how

00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:33,840
do you raise money from sponsors for a conference

00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,590
like this? I'm sure it's very difficult. And second

00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:40,310
is, how do you get international speakers, like, you

00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,480
know, Chad, Coby?

00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,820
V.O.: So I think Swanand wants

00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,740
to answer this one.

00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,650
S.P.: You don't raise money

00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,840
for sponsors. You just ask them, hey we are

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,940
putting on a conference, and they just say OK,

00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,630
we are gonna sponsor, here's the money.

00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,830
T.D.: Like,

00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:59,300
a bit more practically, like this is something I

00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,910
had a big conversation even with Ajey Gore about

00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:04,350
that developed this?? [00:28:03]. You have to understand that

00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:09,620
no matter who is there on this board, every

00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:12,420
company that sponsors is interested in something else. It

00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,970
kind of ties into what ?? [00:28:13] was speaking

00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:16,290
about in the morning. So I'm just gonna take

00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:18,620
my own example, is that we had at Nilenso

00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:22,590
are hoping to meet interesting people and eventually bring

00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:25,150
on like, hire someone new, and that's why, say,

00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:28,010
Nilenso is, that's definitely one of the reasons we

00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:32,160
are sponsoring a conference like this. So it's just

00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,430
to try to get into the mindset of the

00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:38,210
person you're speaking to and see what benefits can

00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:41,540
you provide them, because like, these, the different levels

00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,150
of sponsorships - you also have to, we also

00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,750
have different things that they are allowed to do.

00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:49,780
For example, a gold sponsor like Flipkart is allowed

00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,580
to bring in that large banner back there and

00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,000
have a booth, and allowed to speak-

00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,730
P.M.: And they get two minutes.

00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:54,230
T.D.: Yeah - and are

00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:57,420
allowed to speak to people. A silver sponsor has

00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,110
their own set of benefits, like giving out something

00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:03,410
in the pamphlets, so. It's about going and speaking

00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:06,110
to these different organizations, trying to understand what they

00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,720
are looking for, and seeing how your conference can

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,180
help them and vice versa.

00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,160
??: What Dejas said

00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,010
just now was exactly what Ajey was saying in

00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:18,500
the morning about keeping the stakeholders in the loop.

00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,790
P.M.: So the other part of your question was

00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:25,460
about keynote speakers. I would say it's all about

00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:29,850
personal relationships. I knew Chad from before, so I

00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,030
reached out to him and he said, yes, I

00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:33,250
am ready to come. And it helped that he

00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,070
was in Bangalore before and he wanted to come

00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:35,759
back.

00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:37,120
??: Actually Coby has a very nice answer

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,540
to this question. I was talking to him in

00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,660
the afternoon. He said, why do we need it?

00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,830
P.M.: Why do you need it?

00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:47,800
??: Why do you always need foreign spekers to come here?

00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,080
P.M.: Yeah, so. Till we have Indian Chad Fowlers, we

00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,470
need the real Chad Fowler.

00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,750
??: So, there you go.

00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,150
Your goal is set for the next two

00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:56,790
years.

00:29:56,790 --> 00:30:01,950
QUESTION: I just wanted to ask you [indecipherable

00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:06,520
- 00:30:04] at what state do you think the

00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,500
local meet ups can actually arrange a conference, because

00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,690
there needs to be a certain mileage or momentum

00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,640
that needs to be accumulated by the local meet

00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,090
ups to then, you know, result in a conference.

00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,260
You just cannot have a big conference right away,

00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,460
right. So where do you think is the equation

00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,760
of breakdown should happen?

00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,380
P.M.: Yeah, so. You want

00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,220
to answer that? How, how-

00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:32,220
??: So what do you mean by big conference, I mean?

00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:37,170
QUESTION: [indecipherable - 00:30:35]

00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:37,830
T.D.: So how big do you think

00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:40,730
that the first RubyConf India was? I don't know.

00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:42,890
Actually I don't remember myself, but it was somewhere

00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:44,480
around 300 or 350 people.

00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,430
V.O.: 250 people.

00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:48,720
T.D.: 250, is it? We were really, really scared if

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,150
we were gonna get about 40 people in that,

00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,830
in that hall. Because we had, it was completely

00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:56,960
untested waters. Like I personally, I think I'm a

00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,820
bit romantic about this, but I strongly believe in

00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:03,630
what, in Ajey said in the morning. It was

00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,620
really one person's vision. One person wanted to run

00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,400
a Ruby conference, and everyone else was just kind

00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,800
of following along with that vision and doing it.

00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:14,340
So in reality, the answer to your question was,

00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:18,270
well, money aside, it was about 4 to 6

00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:21,140
people, that was all that was needed to organize

00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,460
the first one. And people came. I think, I

00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:27,850
think Bangalore definitely India is such a place that,

00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,809
you put out something, you know, some new technology

00:31:29,809 --> 00:31:32,740
like, like we have some obscure, like Go language

00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:36,610
conf, next month, just because it's interesting, people will

00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:40,900
show up. ??: This may not be the only

00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,400
way to organize a conference, you know. Everybody's welcome

00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,429
to figure out their own way. People from ??

00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:47,510
[00:31:46] can travel together, and they talk about Ruby

00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:49,700
and come back the next day. You know, you

00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:54,080
can do your own plans, really.

00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,320
COBY RANDQUIST: So as far as, do you have to have meet

00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,440
ups to build up a momentum to hold a

00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,670
conference. I actually disagree. Because in Bend, it's a

00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:11,390
town of about 85,000 people. We had literally twelve

00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:15,440
Ruby developers in town, and we started Ruby on

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,110
Ales to get, to put Bend on the map

00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:23,150
in the Ruby community. So we knew we didn't

00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:26,270
have a mass of people there. Now what that

00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:28,570
did mean, is we had to go about it

00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:31,820
a little bit differently, because we had to do,

00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,620
you know, more external marketing, and to Prakash's point,

00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,660
one of the, one of the big advantages of

00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,679
large conferences, or actually I wouldn't even call this

00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:43,870
a large conference, but of conferences in this size,

00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:46,770
is that you do get to meet more people.

00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:49,540
And you get to create relationships with people, you

00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,690
know, honestly the reason I'm here is because Prakash

00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:57,350
and I talked several years ago at RubyConf in

00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:02,160
Loiussiana, and that's really how it came about. You

00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,850
know, Chad and I's relationship over the years, I

00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:08,750
think we've never met anywhere but conferences. I've got

00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:12,740
a whole group of, you know, literally hundreds of

00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,740
friends at this point, that the only time I

00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:17,660
ever see each other face to face is at

00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:23,559
conferences. Yes. And now I've added another country. So

00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:26,160
when you're trying to put together an event, part

00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,920
of it is make sure you know what you're

00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,679
trying to accomplish. That's the key part, because if

00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,220
you know what you're trying to do, then you

00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,559
can set your limits. And the other key piece

00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:40,400
to the budgeting aspect is, always remember you don't

00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,840
want to dig yourself a hole. You know. So

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,429
limit things. With our OpenStack on Ales that I

00:33:47,429 --> 00:33:50,230
mentioned yesterday, we basically said, we know what it

00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:53,160
costs to rent the place, and if we only

00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,830
have ten people show up plus our speakers, we're

00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:59,350
OK. We know what, we know what our out

00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,980
of pocket expense is gonna be. But we're not

00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,530
gonna provide coffee - you know, there's water because

00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:06,510
there's water fountains. But we were able to control

00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:10,579
those factors. So yeah, you don't, you don't need

00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:14,720
a lot of momentum locally. You do need an

00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,319
interest, or you need to scale your cost model

00:34:17,319 --> 00:34:19,399
so that if you only have three people show

00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:23,669
up you're OK with it. But, yeah.

00:34:23,669 --> 00:34:25,849
T.D.: Also, one more thing I want to say. I would

00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:27,440
like everyone to look at the back of the

00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,460
hall near the Flipkart stall, that's Karen over there.

00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,220
Everyone wave hi.

00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,980
P.M.: Hey Karen!

00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,749
T.D.: So, Karen,

00:34:36,749 --> 00:34:40,379
or Jase, as he's known, and is partners of

00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:43,989
about I think it's a team of five, have

00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:46,389
been running, I think, like a dozen successful tech

00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:50,489
events every single year under the banner of HasGeek.

00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:51,879
And so if anyone wants to know how to

00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:54,919
run a conference successfully and on a different range

00:34:54,919 --> 00:34:59,970
of budgets, from like, really big to really small,

00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:02,269
please talk to Jase.

00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:06,910
P.M.: OK, so. We are almost out of time.

00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,539
I want to thank all

00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:12,470
the, my co-organizers here, and the one last thing

00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:15,430
I want to say before closing is, it's not

00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:18,049
just the few of us up here who did

00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:20,950
this conference. There are a lot of people out,

00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:24,480
who helped us from outside. We may not have

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,109
time now for everyone, but I want to thank

00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:31,009
everyone who helped us put this conference up, and

00:35:31,009 --> 00:35:33,400
made it an amazing journey so far. Thank you

00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:33,880
everyone.

00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:40,880
