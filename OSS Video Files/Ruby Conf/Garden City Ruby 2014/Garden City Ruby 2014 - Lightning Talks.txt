SPEAKER 1: My name is Smith. I work at Flipkart.

00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,789
SPEAKER 2: Hi guys. I'm Tri Hari??. I

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:31,420
am a partner at Nilenso.

00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,940
S.1.: OK, we are going to talk about impact.

00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,510
So what do we mean?

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,980
So let's start with a question.

00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:43,789
As programmer, what are the problem we face? So

00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:47,140
looking at this, aside from that, you know, maybe,

00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,160
in the worst case we have to quickly fix

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,170
a bug on production, or maybe just really cranky

00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,770
client comes up with a requirement which is very

00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,570
hard to fulfill, or you know, our code quality

00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,570
or our tests written so big, like Chad said

00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,149
yesterday, that it takes a long time to finish.

00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:08,700
But these are the kind of problems we face,

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,330
generally. But let's see what other problems do people

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,450
in rural India face?

00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:20,110
Yeah. So. Let's start with this: food.

00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,910
So I'm sure all of us enjoyed the really

00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:27,410
good lunch there, [00:01:25] pune gosh, chicken packenard, fune

00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:30,209
mokney [00:01:28]. We will also get a tea break

00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:33,399
soon enough. I'm hoping. But what about the people

00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:35,220
out there? They don't even get a square meal

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,250
once a day.

00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:40,789
Water- well. People in India really have accepted the

00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:43,580
fact that they don't get water to bath in

00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,679
the rural areas. They somehow manage it with the

00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:49,300
drinking water they get. It's really not clean, but

00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,280
they somehow manage.

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,319
Shelter. V.J. told me a fact today, that sixty

00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:58,470
percent of population in India do not have a

00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,899
toilet. They don't have access to a toilet. So

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:04,110
let's, not even care about anything else.

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,000
And education, this is something very personal to me.

00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,229
Where I come from, it's even lucky to people

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,610
to study up to ?? standard [00:02:12].

00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,250
So, so my question is, how many of you

00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,140
have written a line of code which has impacted

00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,260
life in some way? I'm not saying a big

00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,830
way, but a meaningful way.

00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,810
Can anyone show their hands? Yeah.

00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,450
And how many of you really want to help

00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,100
them out.

00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,860
Only this many? Like this is really sad. OK.

00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,920
So you really want to help them out, and

00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,310
this is how you can do it.

00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,670
S.2.: Right, so this is essentially what we heard

00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,800
about. A few of us at Nilenso, and previously

00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,410
C42, have been fortunate enough to work on the

00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,180
Survey Project.

00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,880
And I'm gonna leave it to this: We have

00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,570
6,000 people who have been impacted by the first

00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:02,460
run of this project. This thing is opensource. I'm

00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,970
gonna leave this slide for you guys to look

00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:11,970
at. And we've- five big cities, 6,000 people. Kids,

00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,520
pregnant women, with the nutrition survey. Right, this was

00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,590
the first run.

00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:21,790
And there was another one, that went to people,

00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:27,100
women, in the agricultural side, and there are three

00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:34,100
thousand families who have been helped. And one, a

00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,380
single fact that, that's gonna help you understand where

00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,819
we are with this - look at the last

00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:40,319
three lines in this slide, basically.

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,400
These are the inferences that have been drawn based

00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,180
on the data here that is 6,000 requests from

00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,959
here, and 3,000 families. That's roughly, again, around 6,000

00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:53,740
records here, right.

00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,310
So that's so much data coming in, and inferences

00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:00,230
drawn across surveys.

00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:06,080
Technically, like, why am I, why are we presenting

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,980
this here, and what do you people have to

00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,940
do with it? Apart from this, like, the technical,

00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:17,970
like the number of apps and whatnot, there is

00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,250
so much data coming in, right. The last thing

00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,560
that we have in our road map is a

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,020
separate Clojure app to take care of the big

00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,910
data stuff.

00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:33,210
And, like, personally I have spent hours of my

00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,780
time looking at the UX in this thing.

00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:41,730
So these apps have to go down to the

00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:46,680
last mile, down to people's homes, where there's no

00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,810
internet, right. And they have, like, one hour of

00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,820
internet in a week, and then there's so much

00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,820
data integrated problems that you have to deal with

00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,100
as well.

00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,560
And sadly over the last month or so, this

00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,010
has come to a slow stop, and we have

00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:08,520
not had the time to work on this. But,

00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,340
I'm hoping that a lot of people here do

00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,770
have some time to spare. Send us a poll

00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,250
request, whatever it is.

00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,460
These are the people we really care about. We

00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,970
write algorithms to bring down our performance from point

00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,000
zero one seconds to point zero zero one seconds,

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,930
and that's all we have, right.

00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:33,550
S.1.: So I'll wrap it up really fast. So

00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,860
let's not always write code to help these people

00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,730
out with our wonderful projects like WunderRails RubyGems and

00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,310
other languages.

00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,250
Let's also these people out as well. You know,

00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,090
maybe give them a boost, because I really believe

00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,970
we don't all have to be Bill Gates to

00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,620
help these people out. With our own skills we

00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,990
can contribute to and write technical projects that could

00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,370
help them out.

00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,430
And, yeah, this is where you can find the

00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,820
projects and start and everything.

00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,620
Thank you.

00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,090
S.2.: You can catch anyone of us after the

00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:10,240
talk if you want to help us out. Thanks.

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,930
INTRO: So next up we have Kestap?? [00:06:12] on

00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,510
the stage. Time starts now.

00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,630
SPEAKER: Hi everyone. Today I'll be talking about Sinatra,

00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:20,800
basic introduction. Probably everybody knows this, but more and

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,370
more though I'll be talking about how to write

00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,139
an extension in Sinatra.

00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:27,300
So the basic structure of Sinatra is this. There

00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,510
is a request class that extends from Rack::Request, response

00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:36,510
that extends from Rack::Response, ExtendedRack is basically for the

00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,070
things that are not in rack, and so they

00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,680
define extra methods there.

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,660
There is a commonlogger which extends from Rack::CommonLogger, and

00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,900
this is the main part, Base.

00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,330
So there are actually three ways to, there are

00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,930
actually three ways to extending Sinatra. The first one

00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:59,020
is extensions, the second one is - no.

00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,800
Not quite.

00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,610
The second one is helpers and the third one

00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,490
is middleware. I won't be talking about middleware probably,

00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:10,180
there is a lot of material on that. but

00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,050
the extensions and helpers, I've found it difficult to

00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,979
use them, so. I've kind of made a small

00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,259
presentation here.

00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:21,199
So the first difference between helpers and extensions is

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,430
that, in helpers, you use a helper or you

00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:28,600
write a helper if the functionality is required in

00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,330
the get method or post method or any other

00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,169
blocks that we use.

00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:38,759
So inside a route block the extensions are for

00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,040
extending the functionality of Sinatra itself.

00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,850
So for example, inside a get block we find

00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:48,050
our two, return JSON response every time, so I

00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,380
can make a function like this, JSON(a) and convert

00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:55,130
basically converts our hash into a JSON string.

00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:59,680
So the implementation is this. You write it in

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,800
a module called Helpers. You define the method, you

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,539
pass it in, and it basically returns the string.

00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:10,240
And you include your helpers in before, in your

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,210
app file.

00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,240
So to write this as a gem you have

00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,729
to put that under a namespace of Sinatra, then

00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:19,889
use the module, the same code as above.

00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:21,979
And these two are the magic things that actually

00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:24,240
happen. So base dot helpers is almost similar to

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,229
adding helpers json inside your app file.

00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:30,350
So, and base dot set is basically, it sets

00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:35,550
the json_content_type, sets the request_content_type to JSON by default

00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,889
for every request.

00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:43,979
So the other thing, the major portion is extensions.

00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:48,490
So in extensions, Sinatra provides extensions to, let's say

00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:51,470
you want to define a new route, so you

00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,639
can do that by extensions. I'll demonstrate a small

00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:59,129
thing, a small route actually. So I created this

00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:01,360
extension today.

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,429
So I have a module Sinatra, I have this

00:09:03,429 --> 00:09:06,970
super module, and this is an extra route. So

00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:11,759
this, the route method is provided by Sinatra base,

00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,540
and I'm extending that, so that every, every request

00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,939
that you make to this end point, to, with

00:09:17,939 --> 00:09:21,569
a method request of this one, instead of get

00:09:21,569 --> 00:09:26,069
r post, it will return something pretty good.

00:09:26,069 --> 00:09:31,629
So start it up.

00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:38,629
And yeah. So that's what it does.

00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:51,129
So, you don't have to clap for that, it's

00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:51,839
lame.

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,240
So the basic difference between these two is that

00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,879
this is, this is an extension of Sinatra. This

00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:00,100
route is not defined but we are defining that

00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,420
route.

00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,800
We are using the things that are provided by

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,470
Sinatra and we are basically extending. So the register

00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:10,550
method is a method provided by Sinatra where all,

00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,360
whatever module you define have to be registered with

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,850
Sinatra, so that every app that you use, and,

00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:23,309
like this. So every app that you use, you

00:10:23,309 --> 00:10:26,480
just call register Sinatra, that one, and I'll, I've

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,949
defined my route instead of get slash, I have

00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:34,199
used doge and it returns this.

00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:38,689
So the basic difference is that it's, like you,

00:10:38,689 --> 00:10:41,629
if you want to extend so there are these

00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:47,860
two things, and I think that's it.

00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:54,860
VINASH: Yeah, so. This Billard, I am Vinash. We

00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:58,699
are from Mumbai, RV?? [00:10:57] So I just want

00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,559
to tell all of you guys, and introduce us

00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,720
too, we're from Mumbai RV?? [00:11:01].

00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,720
We have total counted seven meet ups in all.

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,720
So we are on our way to have a

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,369
big meet up soon. Maybe in June or later.

00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:13,399
But till now we have a frequent audience of

00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:16,179
ten to twenty people, always there. We have one

00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:18,970
or two talks, we have a single hack session

00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,329
once. That was for Brails?? [00:11:19]

00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:24,949
We are not going to push anything, but we

00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:28,569
are able to discuss a few things and we

00:11:28,569 --> 00:11:32,189
wrote entire cookies, et cetera et al. Everyone knows.

00:11:32,189 --> 00:11:35,110
So there is a mindset about Bombai that Bombai

00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,569
is partially, Bombai has very few jobs and all

00:11:36,569 --> 00:11:40,239
that stuff. But I can say that nowadays with

00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:44,939
so many startups starting up, the salaries are very

00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:47,800
good I guess, currently.

00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,079
So I guess I will tell you that. You

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,579
should ship to Bombai if you are born in

00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:56,259
part of Bombai, you should definitely come back to

00:11:56,259 --> 00:12:00,040
Bombai rather than going to Bangalore and Pume, because,

00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,449
yeah.

00:12:00,449 --> 00:12:07,449
I know! The intellectual level at Bombai is a

00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:10,720
little low as compared to Bangalore or Pume, but

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,670
we need to change that, and we want guys

00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,119
like you to come back to Bombai who were

00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:18,660
born in a part of Bombai and increase the

00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,799
?? [00:12:18] of Bombai to a level which can

00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:23,529
compete with Bangalore and Pume itself.

00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:26,129
So I want Billard to say a few words

00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:29,009
about the same.

00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:31,720
BILLARD: Actually I just interacted with some of the

00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,259
peers here, and I found out that they didn't

00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:38,029
even know that there's are some developers in Bombai

00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:40,850
like who know Rails or something. So we just

00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:44,569
came here to give a lightning talk that, oh,

00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:47,549
dude we are, we exist there, there are some

00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:49,879
people who are trying to make a dent, not

00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:53,279
in the, not in the universe, but at least

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,079
in Bombai.

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,769
To, so we are that's what we are putting

00:12:57,769 --> 00:13:01,439
all our efforts, like, and that's what, as my-

00:13:01,439 --> 00:13:05,100
as Vanash said that we are about to complete

00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,699
first annual city for Mombai. I RV?? [00:13:11]. That's

00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:12,329
what we are now making the name out of

00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:12,980
it.

00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,819
So we are created at least a small event,

00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:22,170
which, so, which we all are planning, looking forward

00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:26,999
to. So that's all we have. And Bombai RV

00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:30,629
is alive and it will be.

00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:35,549
SATYA KALLURI: Hey guys, this is Satya, I'm from

00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:37,759
Hadribad?? [00:13:36], and you know, I basically want to

00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:40,230
talk about technology meetups. I've been part of some

00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:43,369
technology meetups for quite some time. And you know

00:13:43,369 --> 00:13:45,139
to be very straight, I was a little upset

00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:46,579
with the way they go.

00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:48,769
So, and fortunately, you know, I've been in touch

00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:50,769
with some of the technologies these days, and they've

00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:53,019
revived the hope in me, so I just wanted

00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:55,259
to share some of my learnings, and how can

00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:58,569
we make better use of these technology meetups.

00:13:58,569 --> 00:14:02,329
Oh, by the way, I'm Satya Kalluri and our

00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:04,970
group is @HydRuby, so you can follow us there.

00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,439
So the first thing is I believe there are

00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:08,799
two kinds of meetups in the universe. There are

00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:10,429
two really kind of different meetups.

00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:12,999
A) is technology meetups, which we need to consider

00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:15,519
them as absolutely local. It's like you and me

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,299
catch up together in the next house or the

00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:19,259
next coffee house. It doesn't have to be as

00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:21,329
big as this in total area?? [00:14:21]. So it's

00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:23,319
a technology meetup where you know what, it's a

00:14:23,319 --> 00:14:26,549
local thing. And you know what, the, and it's

00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:28,910
focused. It doesn't have to be as wide agenda

00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:29,549
as this.

00:14:29,549 --> 00:14:31,540
It could be as simple as a bug-a-thon. It

00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,639
could be as simple as learning a new gem,

00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,299
or it could be anything basically. A small local,

00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:36,999
focused.

00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:39,179
And there are other ones which are technology conferences.

00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:41,079
These are bigger ones, where in what, all, it's

00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:42,790
like one of the organizers said, you know like,

00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,720
made of communities and sub communities. Atoms and molecules,

00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,249
right.

00:14:46,249 --> 00:14:49,239
So these small technology meetups, they come up together

00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:52,920
and create these bigger conferences, regional ones, which have

00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,309
a wider agenda.

00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:56,600
So my problem is about the technology meetups. The

00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,869
conferences are going good. GCRC here is an example,

00:14:58,869 --> 00:15:01,389
they're doing an awesome job. But how can we

00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:03,519
improve the technology meetups. You know whenever I catch

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,079
up with folks at the lunch place or something,

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,100
the majority of them say, oh, you know, my

00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,069
meetup gets only two attendees, three attendees.

00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:11,629
You know that over a period of time I've

00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:13,989
just found that certain items, if, which if we

00:15:13,989 --> 00:15:16,179
address them properly I think the local technology meetups

00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:18,160
are gonna be kickass.

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,629
So.

00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:23,470
So. Basically I wanted to let you know what

00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,619
a technology meetup is, first of all, and why

00:15:25,619 --> 00:15:26,660
are they for?

00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,859
Technology meetups are absolutely for techies to collaborate, learn,

00:15:29,859 --> 00:15:32,519
contribute, share knowledge. So these are local ones. So

00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,309
do understand, these are the only for those techies.

00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:36,679
They're not for the job seekers and not the

00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:38,749
employers. Whenever there's a technology meetup going, and if

00:15:38,749 --> 00:15:40,499
you need a Rails developer, please do not go

00:15:40,499 --> 00:15:41,069
there.

00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:42,739
And if you're looking for a job, don't go

00:15:42,739 --> 00:15:45,100
there. Just, let's not pollute these small local meetups.

00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,160
They have for technology peers to basically go there,

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,429
share knowledge and solve each others problems and become

00:15:51,429 --> 00:15:52,579
better in technology.

00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:54,829
You know the last two are acceptable for conferences

00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:57,369
like these, where, you know, these are big things

00:15:57,369 --> 00:16:00,259
where there are networking opportunities and tech meetups and

00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:03,410
everything. But for local meetups let's stick to technology.

00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,910
That way everybody who comes, you know what, knows

00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,329
what's going to happen. It's technology. This is Rails,

00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:10,970
which I love. I come here to write, to

00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,449
learn Rails.

00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:14,859
And while participating, you know what, these, the following

00:16:14,859 --> 00:16:17,119
six things are the most important things which I

00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:18,879
could recommend everybody to follow.

00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:21,149
The first thing is identity. Most of those whom

00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:22,970
I see don't have an identity on Twitter, don't

00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,239
have an identity on StackerWorkflow, even meetup I see

00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:27,309
some of them say plus five. Now what the

00:16:27,309 --> 00:16:28,519
heck does plus five mean?

00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:30,549
Not what, who are the other five guys? So

00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:32,160
it would be nice if they identities, because that

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,889
way I might want to communicate with that fifth

00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:38,029
guy. I don't need to contact this first guy.

00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:39,939
So and you are gonna create your identity, somebody

00:16:39,939 --> 00:16:41,809
needs to contact you directly, you know what, it

00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:44,230
creates an open channel, and as one of them,

00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,449
one of the speakers said, you know, you are

00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:47,439
going to create and identity and then a brand.

00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:49,279
So this is the first step. So create an

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,299
identity for yourself on Twitter, StackerWorkflow and everything.

00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:54,569
It adds authenticity to the group, you know. Two

00:16:54,569 --> 00:16:56,569
guys, two persons catch up in a meetup doesn't

00:16:56,569 --> 00:16:58,910
make sense. But two plus five is seven, so

00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,410
when seven people really catch up in a meetup,

00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,919
I think it adds a lot of authenticity to

00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:03,749
the group.

00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:05,559
When you guys have your own facebook account, why

00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:07,750
not have your own StackOverflow account. I don't get

00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,429
it.

00:17:08,429 --> 00:17:11,610
The, so the next thing is RSVPs. I see

00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:15,829
many RSVPs, like even our @HydRuby has thirty-five RSVPs,

00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,940
but only four of them turned up, so. Take

00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,959
your RSVPs seriously because there are people, like, you

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,440
know, they're not awake, and you know all these

00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,130
people who take these meetups very seriously, and there

00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:27,770
may not be some, some people who buy beers

00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:28,880
for everybody who come up and-

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,250
When 31 beers are leftover, you know, nobody's gonna

00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,830
buy them, so. Please take your RSVP seriously. That

00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,950
adds authenticity to the group, OK.

00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,450
And the next thing is attendees, you know, don't

00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,830
wait for ten or twenty people to really come

00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,280
to a meetup. You just need one other guy

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,480
to listen to you and you can create a

00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,010
meetup, and you can, guys, can really discuss about

00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:48,830
technology.

00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,830
The next thing is StackOverflow, you know, just share

00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,310
and contribute. You don't have to really, I mean,

00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,270
for you to really become a good meetup guy,

00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,600
I think at least spend every day, fifteen minutes

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,200
on StackOverflow. Don't just find answers but answer the

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,980
questions. This I've learned from Swanand. This guy has

00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,060
some 6,000 bloody points on StackOverflow. I have some

00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,000
twelve hundred, that's it.

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,900
So I've learned from it. So become a better

00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,000
contributer. You become really confident, and you'll become a

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,430
different person. You can also contribute at GitHub. If

00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,980
you don't know which GitHub module to really contribute,

00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:19,930
go for Codetriage. It gives you good popular libraries

00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:20,790
to really help.

00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:23,130
And, do you have an idea? Just stop working

00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,430
on it. First learn better technology and then, you

00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:28,370
know, you can definitely work on the product. And

00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,620
the last thing is, like, spread the word. This

00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,330
guy's already on me, so. Spread the word. Go

00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:36,070
for Facebook. You can use Facebook too, and you

00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,170
can also use Twitter.

00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,770
So spread the word and make these technology meetups

00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:40,370
a good thing.

00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,210
Cheers guys, thank you.

00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:46,670
SPEAKER: Before I start, big thumbs up for the

00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:49,520
guys who started off. It's great to see, you

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,800
know, technology people, developers who care about social issues.

00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,840
And here I am to talk about Milaap, which

00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,120
is also a social enterprise. And I just want

00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,720
to talk about what Milaap is all about and

00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,360
how you can help.

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,660
So Milaap is a Crowdfunding platform for communities in

00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:15,650
need which is powered by Ruby on Rails. So

00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,430
we are a hardcore Ruby on Rails shop, and

00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:21,770
we bridge the gap between people who are need

00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:24,810
of help and people who want to help, right.

00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:27,550
So let's quickly look at what that means. So

00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:30,670
I'm sure all of us want to do good.

00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,280
We want to help others. But when it comes

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,760
to helping others with financial aid a lot of

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,060
us are hesitant, because we are not sure, you

00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,300
know, our hard-earned money, when we give it to

00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,360
someone, you know, is it going to be used

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,080
in the right way? Is it the right person

00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,300
I'm going to give this money to.

00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,020
So Milaap tries to bridge this gap, right. So

00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,910
Milaap has a set of profiles uploaded on our

00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:00,480
website, which are across various kind of causes, and

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,010
you can, you can filter through various criteria and

00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:06,130
choose them. And it helps you make an informed

00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,670
decision about whom you want to help, right.

00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:11,300
So this is how it brings, it bridges the

00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,870
gap between people who want to help and people

00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:16,210
who are in need of help.

00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,800
How it works: It's very simple. Just four steps.

00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,120
As I said, the first step is, you look

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,570
at the various causes and various filter criterias and

00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,370
choose the person you need to help. You want

00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,530
to help.

00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:31,060
And make a loan on Milaap website. This is

00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:34,410
just an online payment that you do. The real

00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,180
test starts after website. So the whole business is

00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:41,180
about testing transferrency. Can you trust Milaap that the

00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,850
money is going in the right hands?

00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:47,290
Another big thing, when it comes to helping is,

00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:51,060
donations - there is this hesitancy that, you know,

00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,870
my hard-earned money is going away, whereas what you

00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:56,360
do on Milaap is not a donation but a

00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,700
loan. That means you help one person, let's say

00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,870
a person needs ten thousand rupees to build a

00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:04,820
toilet. You contribute just 500 rupees out of it,

00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,370
but that 500 is not a donation.

00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,020
Within a year, month on month, you get back

00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,010
your money, and all your 500 rupees back to

00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:14,610
your account within one year's time. And then you

00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:17,820
can utilize the same thing to make an impact

00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,970
on someone else's life. This is what we call

00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:22,520
making an impact, again and again with the same

00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,800
money. And of course if you start believing in

00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,320
the idea, you start putting more, more of money

00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,700
in helping others, right.

00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,900
So there's the four simple steps. Choose a customer,

00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,570
make a loan, get repaid and relend.

00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,660
How can you help, right? Of course the obvious

00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:44,090
thing is you know check out the website, if

00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:47,500
you like the idea, like us on Facebook. Tweet

00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,800
about us, write about us on your blog. We

00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,280
also have a widget which you can put on

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,960
your blog saying that you support Milaap.

00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,920
But if you want to do even more, right,

00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,700
obviously you can actually be an active participant on

00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,820
our website. Go and make a loan to someone

00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:07,590
there today. You could also do something interesting, I

00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,570
think one of the best gift ideas that you

00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,570
could have is to give a Milaap gift card

00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,630
to someone.

00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,350
That is you are gifting someone the ability to

00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:20,760
help someone, and repeatedly keep doing it, right.

00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,370
Finally you could also start a campaign. If you

00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:25,500
want to go really big, you could adopt a

00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,220
particular borrower on the website or adopt a particular

00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:31,610
cause, and decide to raise some funds to impact

00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:34,480
that critical cause. So you can decide to raise

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,600
some money for education. Let's say you're running a

00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,080
marathon, you can put out, we can put up

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,830
a page for you and help you raise some

00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:45,050
of money through you, through that event.

00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:49,690
But, right, I'm sure many of you would think,

00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:53,430
this guy's coming here talking about some company, Milaap

00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,720
in three, four minutes, why should I go ahead

00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,860
and do anything about it, right? So proof of

00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,810
the pudding is in it's eating, right.

00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:02,570
So what we want you is to first get

00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:06,090
real, first-hand experience of what Milaap is and how

00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:09,240
it helps people, how much you can trust it,

00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,220
how transparant it is. So we are right now

00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:17,720
giving away free credits, free Milaap credits worth 500

00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,280
rupees. Anyone who wants to try out what Milaap

00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,440
is without spending a buck from your pocket can

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:29,430
use this gift card, GCRC14, which some of, same

00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:32,550
as our twitter hash tag as well. And you'll

00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,390
be able to make a loan on Milaap just

00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,670
by using those 500 rupees.

00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:39,180
You just click on lend button and when it

00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,030
comes to actually making a payment, just write in

00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:43,680
the coupon and you'll be able to, you are

00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,220
good to go, right.

00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,760
Thanks a lot.

00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,810
V.O.: Thanks Sarish?? [00:23:48].

00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:51,530
SORU: Houston, can you copy me?

00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:56,550
OK. So I don't have slides. So I'm Soru.

00:23:56,550 --> 00:24:00,400
I'm nineteen. I'm still in college. So over the

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,310
last summer I did a Google Summer of Code

00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,670
with a ?? project [00:24:03]. And I built this

00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,790
GitHub for designers, so I thought I would teach

00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:09,470
that here so that you could know about it,

00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:12,050
and I could, I saw that there are some

00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:15,810
design-oriented start-ups so they could probably give me feedback.

00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:19,450
So the idea is that, like, when designers collaborate,

00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:23,070
especially opensource designers, they go to mailing lists and

00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:27,260
they share links, and so, let's say, Coby decides

00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,780
to make, make this banner. So he starts with,

00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,640
he starts with the logo, and he puts it

00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,530
on MGo?? [00:24:34] and shares a link on the

00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:38,170
mailing list, and people go plus one, cool, or

00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:39,430
this is awesome.

00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,110
And everybody gets that link. It's a pain in

00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:45,020
the ass. So like, this is kind of very,

00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:48,400
it's like spam, it's also annoying, and there's no

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,340
nice way to understand designer feedback.

00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:55,490
So how it helps is, so you can, GlitterGallery

00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,510
is not live right now. But I'll get it

00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,450
up soon. So right now what you can do,

00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:01,690
there is, you can go create a new design

00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:04,170
project just like GitHub and you can create SVG

00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:07,770
files, or you can create, you can upload your

00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:10,310
own SVGs or PNG or JPEG or whatever.

00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:13,020
So after that, so let's say he created the

00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,800
same thing inverted in color, and he can post

00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,410
it there and he can share links with his

00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:20,860
friends and anybody else on the app can log

00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,800
in and he can comment over there, so. So

00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,550
cool, plus one and all that.

00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,900
So some comments make sense. Because these comments are

00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,050
nice, they make you feel good. But there are

00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,590
certain comments which could, which could say that, OK,

00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,170
if you're going to project this, this won't be

00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,790
visible properly. So he can mark said comments as

00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:39,170
issues. They go to an issue tracker, and somebody

00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:42,440
else can forward the project, so it becomes theirs.

00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,410
They can make changes to it and send back

00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,730
poll requests to the original designer.

00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:49,810
So he can, you know, pull back and. So

00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:53,110
design projects can flourish that way. And also we

00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:56,680
have a feature called GlitterPosts. So something like, I

00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,270
don't know, maybe like medium, where you can go

00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:02,160
and explain what, what design process you went through.

00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,110
So every time you make a new change, anytime

00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:07,100
you update, there is a commit happening in the

00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:07,550
background.

00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,710
So we use the great library provided by GitHub.

00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:12,600
They use the same thing. So every instance has

00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,460
a commit idea and all that. So you can

00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,560
reference comments, so you can go there and say

00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,040
I started with this file, this is the idea

00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,540
behind it, and now, next I did this, this

00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,450
is how it went.

00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,530
So it also serves as a nice way to

00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:29,730
learn, also maybe a nice way to judge designers'

00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:33,240
thought process. So, so I would just like to

00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,590
ask if any of you work with designers or

00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:38,480
are designers yourselves, what could be some better ways

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,400
to collaborate, and how else could I extend this

00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:41,550
project.

00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:44,130
By the way, this is opensource. And next summer

00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,740
for Google Summer of Code we might be taking

00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,120
around two people. So if there are any students

00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,020
here who would like to contribute, you can ping

00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:54,700
me later. Thanks.

00:26:54,700 --> 00:27:00,030
SPEAKER: Thanks, Qwinik, for the opportunity to be here,

00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,870
first of all, because they sent us here just

00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:06,200
to, to sponsor and represent Qwiniks.

00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,600
It happens that I land in this company, and

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,650
I start to work with them as a programmer,

00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:16,610
and I have a lot of difficulties to, to

00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:21,750
adopt my German mindset to the Indian mindset. And

00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:26,309
I'm still having difficulties. I'm still not understanding things,

00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:28,990
and I'm trying, deeply.

00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:33,730
So, but I want to advise, or talk about,

00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:38,170
what, what was the things that I've faced here,

00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:41,100
and first thing that I want to advise, and,

00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,520
is that this is opensource work. Opensource work means

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,180
that there is no one willing to teach you.

00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,390
You have to teach by yourself. And the code

00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:54,330
is there. Please open libraries and write libraries. Not

00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:57,030
write what is the code inside, and not what

00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:00,430
is the documentation says, because documentation can be outdated.

00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:03,440
So with this I will advise that you need

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,970
to handle your own will and what is the

00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:09,890
consequences. So you need to be able to know

00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:12,520
the difference between what you want and what the

00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,809
project wants. This is for people that works either

00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:18,059
for projects, companies or by freelancers.

00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:20,809
And you need to think about the consequences. You

00:28:20,809 --> 00:28:23,350
need to think about what is the, what is

00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,610
the impact of this code, what is the maintenance

00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:28,530
of this code, and what is the purpose of

00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:31,010
this code. So think about that before writing the

00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,490
first line of code.

00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:35,350
The second thing is setting up your priorities. So

00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:41,780
I found that it's somehow some people wants to

00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:45,420
rush to the finish, just to find a solution,

00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,420
and most of the time without understanding what the

00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,830
problem is.

00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:53,220
I spent two, three days thinking what the real

00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,390
problem is. What is the thing that you have

00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:58,570
to solve, and then solve it. It's become, it

00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:03,980
will become easier in time. Mostly for maintainers.

00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,680
They other one will be, be humble. Not be

00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,590
humble in the streets saying, I'm not so, or

00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:12,740
not so, be humble with your code. So don't

00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:15,410
try to solve big problems. Solve the small problems.

00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,710
So don't focus on the solution and the feature

00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:20,510
that you want to generate. Focus in the method

00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:23,780
that you're generate in. Making it consistent, make it

00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,110
very small.

00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,309
I am try to go because there is a

00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:31,210
lot of the - I will jump the career

00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:34,200
of the programming to the culture one. I'm sorry,

00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,940
I will say. Clients are not gods. So you

00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:40,610
are, you can be against them. It's allowed. You're

00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:42,809
allowed to be against them.

00:29:42,809 --> 00:29:47,630
Meaning I, don't want to take this seriously, but

00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:50,800
meaning, meaning with this, you are allowed to say

00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:55,710
no, you are allowed to say scopes. Saying we

00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:59,250
are not allowed to do this. We need more

00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:03,320
time or we need this resources that we don't

00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:07,160
have. So please take in mind this because this

00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,450
is a huge impact for the company owners, for

00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,590
the people in project managers.

00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:16,710
Project managers are waiting, expecting something from you, and

00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:20,200
if you will not deliver on time, or what

00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,110
they're expecting, you're breaking big rules. It's not a

00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:26,700
small thing. You're breaking big, big rules.

00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,990
With this, I want to add, you need to

00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:34,680
be predictable. Whatever you do make it predictable for

00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,960
the project manager, for the company owner, for the

00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,740
client. Meaning if you're doing something that you know

00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,220
that will be wrong, just tell him, it will

00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:45,600
be wrong. But make it predictable. So don't make

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,730
people wait for you, to see what is, what

00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,960
it will happen. One minute more.

00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,490
OK, I just jump down to, so I will

00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:59,080
say after coming here, I'm just seeing the huge

00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,500
effort you are doing to work in opensource. I

00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:06,130
have seen sadly for me that some books are

00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:10,710
more expensive than what juniors earn in one month.

00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:15,400
So that's brokes my heart, some way, because I

00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,520
am able to buy in Europe we're able to

00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:22,870
buy books as something, without side effects. And here

00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:26,720
people that ?? [00:31:25], for them it's impossible.

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,750
I mean the book is two, is twice what

00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,660
they earn a month. So with that, it is

00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,330
impossible, I know that it's impossible to learn. So

00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:38,490
I really admire the courage that you have to

00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:40,940
come here. I know the price that you're paying

00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,080
for coming here. I know the effort that you're

00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,220
doing and I will like to say that, I

00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,290
really admire that.

00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:50,750
And yeah. My time is over. This guy has

00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:54,330
an android with him, so I better run.

00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:58,260
SPEAKER: OK, so I'll, I'll just go over this

00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,610
and then see if I can-

00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:05,720
So, what I'm going to do is I, the

00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,440
time I have, I'll try to sow some doubts

00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,300
in your mind, and then make you go back

00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,540
and think about some of the things that you've

00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,960
believed about.

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,450
So like I'll talk about my experience working with

00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:20,130
ActiveRecord and why I think it's a very bad

00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:22,620
thing for building business applications.

00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,400
So ActiveRecord is good when you're building web applications,

00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,800
shallow web applications that have a database and some

00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:33,270
rich UI on top of it. But when you

00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:35,929
are trying to build business applications that have a

00:32:35,929 --> 00:32:38,980
lot of heavy logic, it's not a good, a

00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,240
good thing to do.

00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,390
I'll briefly talk about why it's not such a

00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:46,510
good thing. One of the most problematic things about

00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:49,770
ActiveRecord is it's so much coupled with databases. So

00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,950
when I am trying to solve a problem that

00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:55,740
is very business logic heavy, I tend to put

00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,220
things that are difficult to, positions that are difficult

00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,660
to reverse later.

00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,860
The database schema is something that is very difficult

00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,230
to reverse. ActiveRecord makes you do that upfront. Any

00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:08,900
model that is tied to ActiveRecord, you can't write

00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,809
this without connecting to database and all that. We

00:33:10,809 --> 00:33:12,600
need to define schema up front.

00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:17,640
Which I think is troublesome. So it kind of

00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,770
makes it difficult to decouple the core business logic

00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:24,030
from the framework. Most of the stuff you're writing

00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:26,480
is tightly coupled with the framework. Something new comes

00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,730
up, you need to rewrite the entire thing. There's

00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:31,770
no, nothing that can you, you can take to

00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:35,210
that new, new framework.

00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:40,190
There other things, like, so whenever you encounter situations

00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:43,000
which were not thought of when the framework was

00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,070
designed, there are no points that allow you to

00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:49,260
extend. There's no easy way to customize the ID

00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:53,590
generator, logic. There's no easy way to incorporate composite

00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,790
keys. So the project I was working on,w e

00:33:55,790 --> 00:34:00,760
needed to use mySQL partitions. So I can't use

00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,420
mySQL ID generation. I have to use auto composite

00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,210
keys.

00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,700
And there was no easy way of doing it.

00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,860
There's a plugin that provides composite key support, if

00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,099
you go look at the implementation of that, you'd

00:34:10,099 --> 00:34:13,169
be scared to use it. So it's like, gorilla

00:34:13,169 --> 00:34:16,139
patching - monkey patching to the extreme. So it

00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:21,309
kind of like highlights some of the problems. How

00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:24,609
the code to framework has been written.

00:34:24,609 --> 00:34:27,379
And there are other features that I like and

00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:30,399
other form mapping?? frameworks [00:34:29]. Like you load a

00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,440
bunch of objects, do something on it, at the

00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:36,099
end they all get persisted to the database. It's

00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:39,929
automatic, dirty checking transaction right behind. There's something called

00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:42,710
a persistence data utility. I create an order, order

00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,339
line items, all this stuff.

00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:46,999
I create save and it saves everything. So limited

00:34:46,999 --> 00:34:48,609
support for things like that.

00:34:48,609 --> 00:34:51,690
These features are very important when you're trying to

00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:54,349
follow these practices, domain-driven design, so you need to

00:34:54,349 --> 00:34:57,099
work in terms of aggragates, so you need to

00:34:57,099 --> 00:35:00,289
decouple your persistence logic from your busienss logic. All

00:35:00,289 --> 00:35:03,480
that is very, very hard to do if you're

00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,140
using ActiveRecord.

00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:07,499
So there are some alternatives.

00:35:07,499 --> 00:35:09,549
So datamapper is a framework, but I think it's

00:35:09,549 --> 00:35:13,749
become stagnant. There's a new version of it called

00:35:13,749 --> 00:35:15,309
Ruby?? [00:35:13]. I don't see a release for that

00:35:15,309 --> 00:35:17,380
as yet. So those are some alternatives that you

00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,480
can look at.

00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:25,239
Or, yeah. Look at something in other languages. So

00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:27,319
these are based on my observations of working with

00:35:27,319 --> 00:35:29,900
ActiveRecord for the last five months, and I'm comparing

00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:34,390
it with eight years I've spent working with Hibernate,

00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:39,619
and this looks like a toy compared to what

00:35:39,619 --> 00:35:41,690
that can do.

00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:43,059
Thank you.

00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:45,359
NIRANJAN PARANJAPE: So, a few really good talks. Heavy

00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:45,509
talks. I'm gonna keep this light.

00:35:45,509 --> 00:35:48,700
So any - talk abuot continous learning.

00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,499
But before going there I want to talk about

00:35:50,499 --> 00:35:51,749
what happens if you don't learn continuously.

00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:53,680
So we have been doing interviews for quite some

00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,470
time. And these are a few gems I have

00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,720
heard while doing interviews.

00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,710
So I asked a question: Which programming language do

00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:01,989
you like?

00:36:01,989 --> 00:36:04,499
Imagine the answer - come on.

00:36:04,499 --> 00:36:05,569
AUDIENCE: Ruby!

00:36:05,569 --> 00:36:08,999
N.P.: No. I program in Rails.

00:36:08,999 --> 00:36:14,539
Go read RubyonRails dot org. You'll find something different.

00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:17,220
Someone asked me, why shouldn't I use GOTO?

00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,499
After all language supports it.

00:36:19,499 --> 00:36:22,170
Do you know anything about cyclomatic complexity?

00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:24,470
Do you know what other feature language supports which

00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:26,970
are really bad programming constructs and you should generally

00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:27,259
avoid?

00:36:27,259 --> 00:36:30,269
Go read about that.

00:36:30,269 --> 00:36:32,700
So I started the interview. I spoke about like,

00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,489
OK we have been hearing a lot about, you

00:36:34,489 --> 00:36:36,529
should ask skinny controllers and fat models, and there

00:36:36,529 --> 00:36:37,869
was a huge buzz about it.

00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:40,099
Then we went and said that, no we actually

00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:42,029
need thin models.

00:36:42,029 --> 00:36:43,420
So where to I write my business logic.

00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,529
And I wrote a response. Helpers.

00:36:45,529 --> 00:36:50,589
I asked someone, how do you scale your application?

00:36:50,589 --> 00:36:53,980
I got a response: I don't have to, I

00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,559
deploy in Cloud.

00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:58,970
I asked someone, can you talked about GC?

00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:02,019
Oh, GC, garbage compiler. Let's talk about it.

00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:06,489
I asked someone, why is encapsulation important?

00:37:06,489 --> 00:37:09,930
I heard, because the book says data security is

00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:10,390
important.

00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:14,119
And, last noted, but not the least - I

00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:15,989
have heard this, actually.

00:37:15,989 --> 00:37:18,789
I don't believe in learning in my personal time,

00:37:18,789 --> 00:37:21,579
because I believe in work-life balance. Now, my answer

00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:24,369
to that person is, this is the doctor's roadside.

00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:26,779
Are you going to go to him, or are

00:37:26,779 --> 00:37:28,230
you going to go to him?

00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:30,650
You want your doctor to continuously learn and understand

00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:33,950
his medical practices, and essentially keep up with the

00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:37,829
latest technology. You are a software programmer. You are

00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:39,769
You cannot afford to fall behind the scene. You

00:37:39,769 --> 00:37:40,900
have to keep learning.

00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,049
How do you keep learning? Lots of books are

00:37:43,049 --> 00:37:45,930
out there. How many of you have read Pragmatic

00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,749
Programmer's Journeyman to Masterman?

00:37:47,749 --> 00:37:50,650
How many of you have read it twice?

00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:54,849
This is a book you should read every year.

00:37:54,849 --> 00:38:00,109
It's a brilliant book. Coding Honor. Clear coding. Wonderful

00:38:00,109 --> 00:38:05,210
books. Read different blogs. Learn different language or paradigm,

00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:07,259
because what you learn there, you can essentially translate

00:38:07,259 --> 00:38:10,950
it into your understanding of programming itself, and maybe

00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:14,049
bring some parts in your actual code.

00:38:14,049 --> 00:38:16,589
But just reading these things are not important. Understand

00:38:16,589 --> 00:38:18,910
the concept behind is important. Where do you understand

00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:20,069
the concept?

00:38:20,069 --> 00:38:21,660
Maybe you can go to, read c2 dot com.

00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,759
How many people know that? What is c2 dot

00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:24,210
com?

00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:26,609
It's a first Wiki. And then maybe you can

00:38:26,609 --> 00:38:29,089
go to c2 dot com. And maybe you can

00:38:29,089 --> 00:38:30,259
go to c2 dot com again, because that's a

00:38:30,259 --> 00:38:33,779
brilliant, brilliant site.

00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:36,039
And most importantly, contribute to opensource. We hear a

00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:39,119
lot about hey, you should contribute to opensource because,

00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,210
you know, give back to the community, it's fun.

00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:44,640
But there is one major aspect of contributing to

00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,200
opensource that's just learning, self-learning. And that is something

00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,690
which I have done a lot.

00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:51,579
How do you start? You start by reading code.

00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,259
Read what other people are writing.

00:38:53,259 --> 00:38:57,119
That's the first step in understanding how to write

00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,680
better code.

00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,739
Essentially it allows you to pair with good people,

00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:04,390
across the globe, and get their feedback about your

00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:07,150
code. Talk to them about their design, their understanding

00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:10,739
of programming. So it's a wonderful tool.

00:39:10,739 --> 00:39:12,549
Find a mentor if possible, and just, don't just

00:39:12,549 --> 00:39:15,150
stop there. You have to actually go and become

00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:17,859
a mentor and teach someone what you have learned.

00:39:17,859 --> 00:39:24,859
