Description: 
	By Aman King

Will showcase real-world project code, highlighting custom-written Ruby DSLs that contribute to project success by improving team productivity. Ranging from simple authentication rules to complex social networking capabilities, DSLs can help tackle cross-cutting requirements and domain-specific abstractions. Benefits include faster story development, easier bug fixes, and deeper technical exposure for team members. Will also talk about some gotchas.

Will explain multiple techniques for creating DSLs within a Ruby project, including simple OO code without any metaprogramming, to medium-complexity use of mixins, to advanced usage of metaprogramming.
