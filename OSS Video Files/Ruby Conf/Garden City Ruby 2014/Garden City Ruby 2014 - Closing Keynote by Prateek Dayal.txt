So hi. Alright, so welcome to my keynote.

00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,300
All right. Apologies for that.

00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,170
I've been a Rails programmer for too long,

00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,690
and I used Scaffold to generate this presentation,

00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:43,760
and I kind of, I kind of kept this towards the end.

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,190
You know, I'll fix it in the end,

00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:45,790
and I forgot.

00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,690
So yeah I'm really sorry about that. But, anyway.

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,659
So my name is Prateek Dayal.

00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:52,379
Unlike Chad, you know, I do need an introduction,

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:56,079
so I'll introduce myself as I go along.

00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,610
So yeah, I'm currently the CEO of SupportBee,

00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:02,390
and I started working with Ruby in 2007,

00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,080
when I co-founded Muziboo.

00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,000
And Muziboo is a music sharing website

00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,770
and we had this idea,

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,420
how cool it would be if you know people had

00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,000
a place like Flickr for music,

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,950
where they would go and upload music and discuss it,

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,369
not just share with their friends.

00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:17,369
And we launched Muziboo,

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,560
we worked on it for a few years,

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,179
we grew it to about,

00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:24,100
you know about half a million users. 200,000 uploads.

00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,069
And as I said, I started working on this in 2007,

00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:29,369
and it was a great time.

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:31,250
It just felt like heaven.

00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,659
So I did electronics engineering in my college days,

00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:36,860
and this was my first real programming project,

00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,979
and unlike the unfortunate people like you,

00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:41,979
you know I never did any PHP or Java.

00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:44,420
So I came to the programming world straight into Ruby,

00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,469
and it was so awesome,

00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:46,890
and I could sit and code all day.

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,289
That was the part that appealed to me the most about doing a start up.

00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:51,969
Actually we didn't even call it a start up back then.

00:01:51,969 --> 00:01:53,409
So we just did something,

00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:55,969
and I was sitting and coding all day.

00:01:55,969 --> 00:01:57,820
And the community was still there actually,

00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,140
surprisingly even in 2007 in India.

00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,380
We didn't have a Ruby meet up but we had Open Coffee clubs,

00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,609
and we had some start up meet ups

00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:05,509
and actually all the people talk about

00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:07,909
is programming pretty much, all the bar caps??.

00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:09,259
So I remember meeting Sidoo??

00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,920
and I remember meeting a few other people,

00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,489
later I met Hemant. And we would sit

00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:14,790
and chat about Ruby and you know,

00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:15,579
they would give me all these cool ideas,

00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:16,950
I would be like, I would be like hey dude, you know,

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:17,480
how do I deploy?

00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,380
And they would tell me there's this cool thing

00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,680
called Mongrel, you should look at it.

00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,489
And I would go back and check out Mongrel

00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:24,480
and I would deploy. So that was a really fun time.

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,380
I was having a great time.

00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,790
But as you would guess it didn't last.

00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,220
It wasn't as bright and sunny anymore eventually,

00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:35,230
because I had to start worrying about making money.

00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,500
And I, you know I would just a couple of years out of college,

00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,239
not much cash, so I had to really start worrying about,

00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:40,449
OK, how am I gonna make money?

00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:42,530
This is all fun, but you know let's get serious

00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,989
about this start up thing now.

00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:45,930
And I had never done a business

00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,519
and so I did what you know any sensible programmer would do, right.

00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:49,979
I went to a business guy,

00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:53,169
I went to a few business people to get their advice.

00:02:53,169 --> 00:02:56,609
And all the advice that I got was about SEO,

00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:59,310
about partnerships, people said oh you're a music company

00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,150
you should go partner with the music labels,

00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,820
you should hire a few sales people, sell music listings.

00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,100
Like if, I don't know how long, if you guys remember,

00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,120
but in 2007, India was sort of moving from

00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,840
the offline world into the online world,

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,120
and the models were just sort of being adapted to the online models.

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,790
And everybody was sort of like,

00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:17,870
everything was a listing site essentially,

00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:21,190
and you could just put ads on it.

00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,900
So I, you know I didn't like this obviously.

00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,459
I hated doing this work.

00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:28,799
Because I loved doing programming.

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,400
But I still persisted with it,

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,500
I still persisted with it for a few years.

00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,269
So I did some SEO, you know I tried doing some sales -

00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:39,650
it didn't work. And, you know, I really felt like this guy.

00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,870
I felt like I had all these super powers,

00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,959
like metaprogramming and you know all the cool stuff

00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,720
that Ruby had to offer, but I would just sit and, you know,

00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,139
tweak page titles all day long.

00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:54,530
To get myself ranking. You know I felt really bad.

00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,479
And I really felt disillusioned.

00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:57,609
I felt really disillusioned with start ups because,

00:03:57,609 --> 00:04:00,090
I said this is not what start ups should be about, right.

00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,709
I should be able to do what I enjoy doing.

00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:05,419
And that's when I kind of started asking myself,

00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:08,669
can I leverage my strengths as a developer to build a great business?

00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:11,290
Can I do what I enjoy doing already

00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,380
and somehow build a great business

00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,600
and build a company that I'm really proud of?

00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,250
And I started sort of looking around to get ideas,

00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,530
and that's what my talk is about.

00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:22,070
So my talk is about coding your business.

00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,880
And I just want to share some experiences I've had,

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,199
some learnings I've had.

00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,710
Some ideas we are even now working on.

00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,199
And just get your thoughts, maybe, you know,

00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,389
it would be nice if you guys could tell me, like,

00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:36,060
what do you think, what if you tried something similar.

00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,509
Or even if later you try something

00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:40,949
and you know just tweet to me. That'd be cool.

00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:44,600
So when I was doing Muziboo, about a year into Muziboo,

00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,780
SoundCloud launched.

00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,140
And you know they launched in a public data or something.

00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,310
And they are a nice product.

00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,560
And they started getting some traction.

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,190
But other than working on the core product,

00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:58,260
one thing I noticed was that they had this thing called the API.

00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,820
And somehow people were slowly starting to use that API

00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,240
and people started writing apps on top of the API.

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,880
And if you go to their app listing now they've got dozens of apps.

00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,560
And you know they have apps which help them get new musicians on board.

00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,340
These are apps which will allow people to upload directly

00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,280
from let's say a music recording program.

00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,730
All these are apps that get some new listeners.

00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:24,030
So people have used API to build charts

00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,090
that are hip-hop charts, specific charts.

00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:31,440
So I think the API really, really helped them grow their user base.

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,860
And that was a great learning for me.

00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:38,460
In some ways it was you know it was the hard way that

00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,810
I was learning, because they were taking off,

00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:44,250
but I mean there was definitely something to learn from them.

00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,240
And then I sort of started looking around

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,380
and I realized that API is definitely

00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,700
the new business development.

00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,330
You know today if you want to grow a product,

00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,600
APIs are a great way to do that.

00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,480
And it's like, if you look at a lot of other products,

00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,530
so GitHub, Twitter, Facebook, Google -

00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:02,280
there are so many examples that wouldn't be the same product

00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,060
if they didn't have the API ecosystem.

00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,500
And especially most in the last few years,

00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,000
a lot of products are actually just APIs.

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,260
A lot of products around are simply APIs.

00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:19,470
So for example, Firebase - I should use a clicker probably, sorry.

00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,530
So Firebase is a tool that gives you a back

00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,660
and forth mobile of web apps.

00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,730
Swifttype for Surge, mailgun for delivering emails.

00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:31,009
Plivo from the streets of Bangalore is computing with

00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:32,400
?? (00:06:31:06) head on.

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,200
And they both provide APIs for telephoning.

00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,490
So there are a lot of products which are simply APIs.

00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,630
And I think as developers we are really,

00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,630
really well-suited to do these kind of start ups.

00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,540
We already understand our target audience.

00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,940
We are the target audience.

00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,570
We, all of us have been to hack-a-thons,

00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,300
we have worked with different APIs,

00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,050
we know what it feels like when the documentation is shitty,

00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,389
what makes good code examples,

00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:56,660
what kind of libraries do you need to kick start the environment.

00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,310
We really understand this stuff really well already,

00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,060
and I think if you were to start a company like this,

00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,990
you're definitely at an advantage.

00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,419
And so you can build a product

00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:11,870
and you know you can get maybe some users

00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,740
but what about marketing?

00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,300
That's typically the question that I get asked most often from programmers.

00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,260
Like how do you market your product?

00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,570
How do you get customers?

00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,419
And there are several ways to market a product.

00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:24,790
Most of them don't work.

00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,220
And are frustrating actually to execute on.

00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,770
And what I - personally at least for us

00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,800
and our company I've realized that writing

00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,340
has turned out to be the best form of marketing actually.

00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,639
And what I mean by that is if you look at developer docs

00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:42,699
or marketing copy site or newsletters,

00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:44,990
or even delegating great customer support,

00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,710
it all boils down to being good at writing.

00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:51,230
And, I mean that's just how it is.

00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,790
For example, this is Mailgun's documentation.

00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:57,210
If you go through it, it talks about setting up SPF records,

00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,770
you know how to get to deployability,

00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,290
why do you need dedicated IPs,

00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,240
it's stuff that all of us already understand and can write.

00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,370
We just need to be really good at communicating this to our customers.

00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,540
So we already understand this stuff.

00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,600
We just need to get better

00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,190
at being able to communicate it in writing.

00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:18,199
The same way if you look at Firebase's landing page,

00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,740
any of us could sit down and write this

00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,010
and we could build this and we could write this

00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:26,410
and you just need to be good at writing again.

00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,560
So fortunately there is good news, right.

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,590
I mean it's, as developers,

00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:34,620
I think it's very easy to improve at writing.

00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,519
And I'm just going to show you a few examples of how to do that.

00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,570
So GitHub. I think one of the coolest things

00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,339
that GitHub does is that every time you create a new depository,

00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:46,980
it says add a readme file.

00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,130
And that's a great starting point to start learning

00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,690
how to write or communicate our ideas.

00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,720
How many of you guys have opensource projects.

00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,079
Even, or just some bit of code online?

00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,490
And have you written a readme for it?

00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:04,350
Oh, quite a few of you have, and quite a few have not. Good.

00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,889
One hand stood up very long actually.

00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:08,910
So, there you are, yeah.

00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,230
So if you haven't,

00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,149
just go back and write a readme for that,

00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:13,999
and if you already have, maybe try to improve it.

00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:15,170
Get some, maybe more feedback.

00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,499
It's a great starting point to start writing

00:09:17,499 --> 00:09:19,980
and learning how to write.

00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,860
The other cool thing, at least in today's world,

00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,550
is that product development involves a lot of writing,

00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,170
and this obviously depends on company to company

00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,709
but you can become a company like this

00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:32,149
so you can choose to work for a company like this.

00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:36,100
So for example, I'll give you an example from SupportBee.

00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,769
So most of our feature requests are enhancement requests

00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:41,399
typically originate in our subcode desk ?? (00:09:41:07),

00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,040
so some customer, for example in this case somebody emailed saying,

00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,619
can we have search word for word trash tickets?

00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:49,339
And my colleague I asked who is here,

00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,860
I asked him you know, do we support this?

00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,519
So it turns out we support this in the API

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,009
but we don't support it in the front-end.

00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:59,459
And so what we do is we write this ticket into -

00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:00,959
we have a GitHub app - so the code,

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,910
we would write that into GitHub,

00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,040
and we create an issue.

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,720
And other than create,

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,110
other than using the issue to actually

00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,300
just review code or attach code,

00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,920
what we do is we try to flesh out the feature completely in issues.

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,970
So we are encourage, not only encourage,

00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,869
sort of we enforce everybody to just discuss

00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:20,470
ompletely in issues. We don't even encourage

00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:24,490
face to face or voice calls early on.

00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,639
If you're not able to communicate something

00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:27,839
in issues then you should probably go to a call,

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,579
and then also sum it up and put it back in the issue.

00:10:30,579 --> 00:10:32,509
What this does it just forces you to

00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:34,839
try to explain to your peers what you're trying to do.

00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:36,389
Sometimes in terms of code,

00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:38,240
sometimes in terms of the marketing copy

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,550
that you think should be there,

00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,399
or the subject line of the email.

00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,619
It forces you to communicate your ideas.

00:10:43,619 --> 00:10:45,779
And acquiring that skill also helps you

00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,559
in communicating those ideas to your customer.

00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:49,860
So it's really the same sort of skills.

00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,790
And once we know what we want to work on,

00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,999
what we do, we obviously attach code

00:10:54,999 --> 00:10:58,899
and then we go through maybe a sprint or two with that code.

00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:00,899
And then finally once we are almost getting done,

00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:05,170
we post screen shots in the same issue of the finished feature.

00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,350
And what that does is, it -

00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,600
one thing is that it really helps us review faster,

00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,470
so we can, you know, know that this feature is done

00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,040
and can be deployed.

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,660
But more than that,

00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,459
it's also a starting point for writing a blog post about the feature.

00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:19,470
And we have taken the same GitHub issues process

00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,319
and turned it into user for our blog as well,

00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:23,970
you know we power our blogs by JQL.

00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:27,699
We create issues for each new feature that we have,

00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:31,189
or if you want to put out a def post about how we did the feature.

00:11:31,189 --> 00:11:35,199
And we use these assets and we write the block post.

00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:36,339
And because we are already comfortable

00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:37,559
with this GitHub issues process,

00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:39,249
very easy to get feedback.

00:11:39,249 --> 00:11:41,300
So just like code we can comment in-line,

00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,360
we can help people if they're feeling a writer's block

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,699
or if they want some feedback.

00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:46,829
It's very easy to give out feedback

00:11:46,829 --> 00:11:48,540
and push out this block post.

00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,470
So we really tried to make this process work for us,

00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:56,699
and it has ended up, it has ended in a lot of our developers,

00:11:56,699 --> 00:11:59,069
or people who've worked with us getting better at writing,

00:11:59,069 --> 00:12:02,579
and in fact for the first time even realizing that they enjoy writing.

00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:03,740
And it's worked really well for us

00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:08,410
and I encourage you guys to go and try it out.

00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,610
Because the cool thing about this process

00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:10,439
if that you can start tomorrow.

00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:12,079
You don't have to wait to start a company

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,029
to become good at writing.

00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:15,259
You know you can do it in your current job.

00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:17,660
So next time you have a feature release post,

00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,309
go out and propose to do it yourself.

00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:21,269
Maybe you have a job opening

00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:22,629
and you're putting up a job on Haskee

00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:25,499
(00:12:23:02 ??). You know, tell your founders

00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:28,170
or tell your CEO that you want to write that.

00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:28,779
And just practice.

00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:30,589
So there's so many opportunities around us

00:12:30,589 --> 00:12:35,829
to practice writing in development.

00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:37,879
If you build a company like this,

00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:40,790
one of the other cool things that happens is,

00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:43,059
it's very easy to recruit a developer.

00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:45,179
Because developers love hanging out with other developers, right.

00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:46,129
That's why we are all here today

00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:47,850
and will be here tomorrow.

00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,149
And so it is a very natural fit there.

00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:52,879
And I've been talking to a few developers

00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:54,050
in the last couple of months

00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:57,759
and I realize that most developers hate these block,

00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:01,149
you know, job posts written with the words ninja,

00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:05,300
or, like how many of you are ninjas here? No one?

00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:10,600
What about programming rock stars? No one?

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,160
So yeah, I mean, people kind of hate that

00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,410
and if you are a company like this that is developer friendly,

00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,119
it will show through.

00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:20,559
You won't have to put an effort to look like that.

00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:26,649
And, so it really does help if you hire better people.

00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:28,999
So what I'm saying is that,

00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:32,519
we figured out that in the end it just falls under two things.

00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,329
Doing great work on the product,

00:13:34,329 --> 00:13:36,209
on the ecosystem, and then talking about it.

00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:37,730
I think especially in India,

00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,649
where we are really good at doing great work,

00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:42,779
I think we are very, incredibly talented set of developers here.

00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:45,850
But we are not so savvy about talking about it,

00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,029
and it's not as much of a skill thing

00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:49,369
I think as much as it's a mindset thing.

00:13:49,369 --> 00:13:52,769
So it's about doing great work and talking about it.

00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:54,470
But obviously, I mean, this is not easy.

00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,749
You know building a company like this

00:13:55,749 --> 00:13:57,230
is not going to be easy,

00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,449
because it's all about good teams.

00:13:58,449 --> 00:14:00,279
It's all about hiring the best people

00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:03,119
that you can and after you hire them,

00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:07,179
spending a lot of time helping them get even better.

00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,160
And empowering them, so they can make decisions on your behalf.

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,179
And obviously this is a,

00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:13,329
this is a very hard thing to achieve,

00:14:13,329 --> 00:14:16,100
and it's very easy to get it wrong.

00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,329
And you have to just keep trying.

00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:18,799
And it takes a bit longer.

00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:21,809
So if you are definitely trying to flip a start up soon,

00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:25,049
don't try this. Don't do this. It'll take awhile,

00:14:25,049 --> 00:14:27,199
but I think you'll get a much nicer company in the end.

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,230
And one of the side effects of working like this

00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,019
or creating a company like this is that

00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:34,489
you can actually work from the beach,

00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:38,249
because now everything happens on the, online.

00:14:38,249 --> 00:14:39,269
Everything happens in tools.

00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:41,360
Everything is written, everything is documented.

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,369
And you become really comfortable.

00:14:42,369 --> 00:14:43,379
It's like testing, right.

00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:45,309
Before we started testing,

00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:49,629
how many of you felt testing is gonna slow you down?

00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:51,790
And how many of you now feel that,

00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,480
oh I can't write something serious without tests.

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,679
Yeah, well same number of people.

00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:59,439
Yeah. Good. Yeah, so it's the same thing.

00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:02,160
It feels like writing is gonna slow your product development down.

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,189
It's gonna take, make decisions longer,

00:15:04,189 --> 00:15:07,029
but it actually helps you get way more structure.

00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:12,189
And you'll definitely see that in a few weeks or maybe a few months.

00:15:12,189 --> 00:15:15,579
And - by the way that is a real picture

00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:17,639
of us sitting and working from the beach,

00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:21,259
so. That's one not-stock image.

00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:25,049
And what's incredible to me personally

00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:28,540
is that I was working on Musiboo for about three years,

00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,949
about two of those were miserable.

00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:34,480
Right, there was, I was just banging my head against a wall,

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,910
and I could have figured this out

00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,299
and I could have changed my direction,

00:15:38,299 --> 00:15:42,019
but I didn't. And I literally felt like I was stuck

00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:43,350
in a Groundhog Day.

00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:46,110
Right, it's very easy to get stuck in a Groundhog day.

00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,970
And what you have to do is obviously

00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,360
you have to step back,

00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,679
and then you have to get a better perspective.

00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:55,009
And I think the thing that prevented me from doing that

00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:58,149
was that I had no semblance of a work-life balance.

00:15:58,149 --> 00:16:00,959
Nothing. I was just working all the time.

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,100
I was under this assumption that if I am failing

00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,069
it's only because I'm not working hard enough.

00:16:05,069 --> 00:16:07,660
How many of you believe that actually?

00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,459
That if you are not succeeding at something

00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:12,059
then you just got to try harder? Yeah.

00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:13,999
Quite a few people, right.

00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:16,079
And I think this is kind of true

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,499
but I think it's not about the number of hours.

00:16:19,499 --> 00:16:21,129
So definitely having some work-life balance

00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:24,379
is very important in getting this perspective.

00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:26,709
And the other thing I give thought a lot about

00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:30,299
as a company is that there is simply no way we can outwork our competitors.

00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:33,279
So for example our competitors are companies like FreshDesk,

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,579
which have thirty million dollars, two hundred people team.

00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:39,119
Even if like all of us work two days in a day,

00:16:39,119 --> 00:16:40,869
we would still not out-hour them.

00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:42,209
So it's simply not going to work like that

00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,290
and technology companies are not built like that.

00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,579
They're built one team member

00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:47,709
and one great decision taken at a time.

00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:50,269
And that happens when you have a fresh perspective

00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:52,420
and a clear vision.

00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:56,359
And it's amazing to me that being in the knowledge industry

00:16:56,359 --> 00:17:00,649
or industry driven so much by knowledge and by creative energy,

00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:04,049
how little at least I did, and when I talked to other people,

00:17:04,049 --> 00:17:06,559
people understand about how our brain itself works.

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,089
And that's I think probably where a lot

00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:10,319
of these misconceptions come from.

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,720
So I highly recognize that you guys

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,620
take a look at this book called Your Brain at Work.

00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:18,620
It's a very quick read. It's gonna take you a few hours to read.

00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,549
How many of you have read this book? OK, only two people. Cool.

00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:26,679
So. And both of them have (00:17:26:08) ??, so yeah.

00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:28,549
So yeah, please go ahead and read this book.

00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:32,620
What this book shows you is how to get more out of your work life.

00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,899
How sometimes just trying harder is not the solution.

00:17:36,899 --> 00:17:38,139
And it's a very enjoyable read

00:17:38,139 --> 00:17:41,779
and it gives you a very nice perspective.

00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:47,679
Apart from this, I've also lately started using RescueTime.

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,080
So I did a quick survey before the RubyConf

00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,049
and I asked people how much they worked,

00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:54,470
and so about twenty people I asked,

00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,720
actually about twenty people filled out that survey,

00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,990
and I think seventy percent of them said

00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,330
that they work about sixty hours a week.

00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,830
And I encourage everyone to go back

00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,139
and set up this application.

00:18:05,139 --> 00:18:06,710
It's free for about a week.

00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,940
And you'll be surprised by the results.

00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,320
You'll be surprised by how much time you just lose

00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,970
in a YouTube video that somebody sent you

00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,360
and you had no idea that you opened

00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,120
and watched for thirty minutes.

00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,889
So your time is definitely finite.

00:18:19,889 --> 00:18:21,480
So there's no denying that.

00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,289
But it's amazing that with that finite time

00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:26,610
how much of it we lose without even knowing.

00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:28,740
So try to use this application

00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,360
and free up more of your time

00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,720
and enjoy your life as well while you're building a start up.

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,929
I think that's really the key.

00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:45,299
So Bangalore. When Prakash invited me to do the keynote,

00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:46,470
he pushed out block which it said

00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,389
I'm gonna bring a unique Indian perspective.

00:18:48,389 --> 00:18:51,730
And I wasn't sure what that was gonna be entirely,

00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,860
but one thing I do feel very passionate about

00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,389
is being in this city actually.

00:18:55,389 --> 00:18:57,840
So in the last couple of years I've traveled a lot.

00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,299
I've been to Chile,

00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:00,799
I've spent a lot of time in Vietnam

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,309
and some other southeast Asian countries.

00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,250
And I've traveled a lot

00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,860
and I really enjoy living in some of these places.

00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,090
But I always come back to Bangalore,

00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:12,820
and I really like spending time here simply for one reason.

00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,080
I think this place is full of incredible developers.

00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,889
It's just so amazing.

00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:21,460
I haven't been to U.S. Yeah, thanks.

00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,440
Thank you.

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,049
I haven't been to U.S.

00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:28,370
But I've been to some of the other hubs.

00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,539
I've been to Syngapore.

00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:31,769
But seriously the development activity here is just amazing.

00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:35,120
People are so passionate, they really like the code,

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,250
they like trying out new stuff.

00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,350
And in general if you see our English ability,

00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,029
everything is really good.

00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:43,139
And I really think that we,

00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:44,840
and especially today if you look around you,

00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,600
there's enough money, there's enough resources,

00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,950
enough accelerators,

00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,230
some may even say too many accelerators

00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:54,559
or incubators around us, to help you launch companies.

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,750
And I really hope that in 2014 a lot more

00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,110
such companies get launched from Bangalore.

00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,600
I'm totally rooting for you guys.

00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,019
If I can help you guys in any way,

00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:04,000
or anybody else, I'm totally up for it.

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,049
Let's build more such amazing companies.

00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:13,049
So yeah. Happy New Year, and thank you so much.

00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,769
So I wanted to keep the talk a bit short,

00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:21,620
so you can either use the time for Q&A

00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,399
or reclaim your fifteen minutes of life

00:20:23,399 --> 00:20:30,309
and go back home early. It's your choice.

00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:34,850
V.O.: Questions, anybody.

00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:38,460
QUESTION: Regarding the writing of,

00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,409
I mean encouraging your team to start writing.

00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:42,710
When you started up, how big was your team?

00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,480
P.D.: Sorry?

00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,090
QUESTION: When you started off with Muziboo,

00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,289
how big was your team when you

00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:50,600
started actually writing in the code and solving issues?

00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,090
P.D.: No, no, not really.

00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:54,630
So none of this happened in Muziboo actually.

00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,380
And that's why I kind of moved away from Muziboo.

00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,220
I realized I'd gone too long, far too long,

00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,870
to like, totally change

00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,679
and the product had taken like a lot of fundamental decisions.

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,190
QUESTION: OK, one more connecting question.

00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,409
So when was the point that,

00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:07,880
how many team members were there

00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,639
when you actually started encouraging your

00:21:09,639 --> 00:21:11,380
team members to start doing this?

00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:15,970
P.D.: Right. So that's a cool question actually,

00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:16,769
and you have to start doing this

00:21:16,769 --> 00:21:20,049
when you are just one person actually.

00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:23,720
And you have to start from day one.

00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,330
So it's funny but even when I started doing SupportBee,

00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:30,370
I would actually, you know I was the sole developer

00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,880
but I used pivotal tracker

00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,389
and I would try to document everything,

00:21:34,389 --> 00:21:36,710
and not as much but still.

00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:40,139
Because I think that's the biggest challenge

00:21:40,139 --> 00:21:42,259
in setting any kind of culture,

00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,950
that you have to start really early on.

00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:44,789
And when you say early,

00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:46,830
you have to basically start with yourself.

00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,889
So the best time to start is

00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,549
when you're starting the company.

00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:52,210
And some companies have done a good job of explaining this,

00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,799
so recently you know we've been reading the walf??

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,049
(00:21:54:23) handbook.

00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:57,639
I don't know how many of you guys know about it.

00:21:57,639 --> 00:21:58,500
But there's a company called walf,

00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,179
which makes a lot of cool games like Counterstrike I believe, right.

00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:05,820
And, sorry, I'm not a gamer, so, yeah.

00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,700
And, so Walf has a good handbook,

00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,380
and that's what they said.

00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,419
To build a company like this,

00:22:10,419 --> 00:22:13,750
you need a very strong commitment from day one.

00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,970
And one of the things I didn't mention

00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:17,860
is that one reason we can do this

00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,470
in a lot of companies can do this

00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,870
and take longer to build better companies

00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:23,539
is the fact that they don't take any investment.

00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:26,039
So you know you might have to worry about that as well, sometimes.

00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:27,429
QUESTION: Hey, um, Prateek.

00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,440
Something that always fascinates me

00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,090
with entrepreneurs who have started product-

00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,929
moved to a different product is,

00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:35,460
at what time did you decide that, OK,

00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,460
this product sucks.

00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,730
Or it's not gonna work,

00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:38,950
I need to move on.

00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,880
When do you take that decision?

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,769
It could be a lot of factors -

00:22:41,769 --> 00:22:42,929
finance, team, motivation.

00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:44,090
P.D.: Right, right.

00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,019
QUESTION: What was your move?

00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:49,659
P.D.: Right. So I definitely had a moment

00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,779
where I clearly knew I had to move on.

00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:55,350
And so for awhile obviously I thought

00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,519
that you know I should keep trying,

00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:57,980
and I talked to a few more entrepreneurs,

00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,880
and given. So we had a lot of traction,

00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,500
we had about a million visits at one point.

00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,110
And we did have a good amount of traction,

00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,070
but the thing that frustrated me the most

00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,070
was that over the three years that I did Muziboo,

00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:12,649
I learned a lot of new stuff. And not just in terms of programming,

00:23:12,649 --> 00:23:15,919
in terms of how to go about product design and things like that.

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,940
And in the case of Muziboo it had already become

00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,710
too big to sort of start over or to completely change,

00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:23,169
especially with, and we didn't have a big team as well,

00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:24,909
so it was just me and my co-founder

00:23:24,909 --> 00:23:27,840
and I was pretty much the only programmer anyway.

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,100
So it just felt like, with the new experiences

00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,620
that we had and the new knowledge that we had,

00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,460
it just makes more sense to start something fresh.

00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,549
Because one of the things that also happens is

00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:38,130
when you are just starting out, sometimes you

00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:41,000
pick an idea that's close to your heart, or looks cool,

00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,289
but may not necessarily make business sense.

00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:44,870
So with all those factors put in it

00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:48,259
just felt that it's better to start over again

00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:51,210
in a domain that I can relate to more.

00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,409
One of the other problems in Muziboo

00:23:52,409 --> 00:23:54,190
was I'm not a musician myself.

00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:57,620
So after awhile I couldn't relate to their problems actually.

00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:00,399
And it's, in Support it's been incredible

00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:02,429
because we use SupportBee ourselves.

00:24:02,429 --> 00:24:04,000
And I wanted to get into a domain where

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,049
at least I could relate to the target customers a lot more.

00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:09,759
So even though I wasn't from customer support,

00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:11,769
I could relate to business owners and small

00:24:11,769 --> 00:24:13,639
and medium companies,

00:24:13,639 --> 00:24:15,190
and so it made sense to just switch over.

00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:17,490
QUESTION: OK, so your story is very close to,

00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,610
you might like this, ??, he's a ??.

00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:21,450
P.D.: OK.

00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:23,440
QUESTION: But he started with his own service company.

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,800
No, he- yeah. First service company,

00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,400
and then he expanded his product (00:24:27:19)

00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,140
and then he learned this concept of ??, so. ??

00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:34,060
P.D.: Right. Yeah I think a lot of entrepreneurs do that.

00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,789
I think visual website optimizer are another one.

00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:38,950
Paris ?? tried a couple of ideas.

00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:41,289
In fact he had a music service as well.

00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:44,909
I don't remember the name but it was there for awhile.

00:24:44,909 --> 00:24:46,860
And, so I think even India there are a lot of entrepreneurs

00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,980
who have done that actually.

00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:52,179
And I think they've had pretty good success that way.

00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:54,820
QUESTION: Do you think it's important

00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,759
for someone who wants to start a start up

00:24:56,759 --> 00:24:58,360
to first work in a desk job, you know,

00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,379
with an MNC and then start the start up?

00:25:00,379 --> 00:25:03,299
I mean do you need the experience or can you just,

00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:05,669
you know, finish college and then go straight into a start up?

00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:07,779
This is because I'm a college grad,

00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:10,529
almost, so I want to know.

00:25:10,529 --> 00:25:12,409
P.D.: Right, so obviously this answer

00:25:12,409 --> 00:25:15,929
will come with a disclaimer that, yeah,

00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:19,669
you know, there are always exceptions to the rule,

00:25:19,669 --> 00:25:20,639
and so there are, like for example,

00:25:20,639 --> 00:25:21,820
I think Fractor?? is one company

00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,190
that came right out of college and did really well in India.

00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,250
I don't know if you know about them.

00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,169
But typically what I've seen is,

00:25:28,169 --> 00:25:30,649
it does help to have a few years of experience.

00:25:30,649 --> 00:25:33,259
But at least today you don't need to get that experience in an MNC,

00:25:33,259 --> 00:25:33,769
necessarily.

00:25:33,769 --> 00:25:35,559
You can actually get it in a well-run start up.

00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:38,779
A start up with a certain amount of validation.

00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:40,210
So probably you don't want to join a start up

00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,340
that has no validation,

00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,500
and you're not sure where the start up is headed.

00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,159
But as soon as you think there's enough validation

00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:48,240
or you like the product story or you like the founders,

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,580
you can definitely work with start ups.

00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,929
And they can teach you a lot more.

00:25:50,929 --> 00:25:53,000
Similarly because in starts ups you work,

00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,049
you have to do what work,

00:25:54,049 --> 00:25:56,470
and your work is always going to be used.

00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:58,100
Big companies have the luxury of just sitting

00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,220
on your work or just wasting your time.

00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,389
But in a start up that luxury isn't there,

00:26:02,389 --> 00:26:06,379
thankfully. So you're always going to gain a lot more exposure.

00:26:06,379 --> 00:26:08,129
So yes, to answer your question,

00:26:08,129 --> 00:26:11,519
I think it's good to get some experience.

00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:13,370
QUESTION: So hi Prateek,

00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:16,049
I'm going to add a comment,

00:26:16,049 --> 00:26:19,269
and then you can probably add more to it.

00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:21,419
To start up, there's no right time.

00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:25,090
But what I believe is the research that goes into starting up.

00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:28,629
So whether you're out of college or you work for MNC,

00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:31,259
whatever that means, but all your work for any company,

00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:34,269
as long as you do good work and you find a problem you can solve,

00:26:34,269 --> 00:26:37,870
and you validate it, by going, asking, talking to people.

00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,419
Then you can start up.

00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:41,210
And then the rest of the start up stuff

00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:44,960
like finances and team and stuff comes through.

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,379
So Prateek it'd be pretty interesting

00:26:46,379 --> 00:26:50,710
to see how you started about the idea about SupportBee.

00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,990
Why you thought there was a gap.

00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:56,600
When did you realize that this could actually potentially take off?

00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,049
And finally, you know, competition.

00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:01,100
P.D.: Right. Can these lights be a little bit dimmer?

00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:06,299
It's, if it's OK.

00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:08,149
So sorry, so your question was when did I,

00:27:08,149 --> 00:27:11,289
when did I start and why did I think it was a good idea?

00:27:11,289 --> 00:27:13,440
QUESTION: So you, there must have been a time

00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,759
when you found there's a pain point,

00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:16,330
and was like hey, man, this is a cool idea,

00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,000
then you did your research.

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,110
Then you actually said,

00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:23,110
all right I think there is some app to be found.

00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,320
And finally competition.

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,529
P.D.: Right, right.

00:27:25,529 --> 00:27:27,419
So when I was coming out of Muziboo-

00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:29,190
actually in some ways that's the other lesson

00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:32,460
I have learned. It's always easy to learn in hindsight,

00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:36,080
right. You can look back and it's much easier to come up with lessons,

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,080
life lessons. So take it with a pinch of salt.

00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,590
But one thing I realized was that after Muziboo,

00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,559
I was pretty, like, not really desperate,

00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:45,240
but I was like, in a rush. I was like,

00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,440
oh my god man, you know, I've been sitting

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,549
for a whole twenty days without doing anything.

00:27:49,549 --> 00:27:52,759
You know, three weeks. And, so I was like,

00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:54,529
actively looking for ideas, and we've had,

00:27:54,529 --> 00:27:58,779
we had this idea about having a customer support tool before.

00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:00,149
Because we tried to find form to use

00:28:00,149 --> 00:28:01,470
where we ended up using something,

00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,929
but it wasn't that great.

00:28:03,929 --> 00:28:06,360
So it was around that time that I came up with the idea,

00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,669
all right. And so, one of the first things I did was,

00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:11,999
and we had a few other ideas before that,

00:28:11,999 --> 00:28:14,860
so we tried validating those, and those didn't work with customers.

00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,259
So we would just put about,

00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:20,200
put up a landing page and then try talking to people.

00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,139
And the one of the first things I did about,

00:28:22,139 --> 00:28:24,340
when I came up with the SupportBee idea was,

00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,620
I talked to Valerie from Balsamiq.

00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,879
So Balsamiq is a very popular company

00:28:27,879 --> 00:28:28,820
I think most of you guys would know.

00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:31,169
And they were very, very well-known for their customer support.

00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:32,519
So I reached out to Valerie

00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:35,169
and she was kind enough to come on a Skype call

00:28:35,169 --> 00:28:37,259
and talk to me about the idea,

00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:39,320
and we did this with a few other companies like BooFoo ??

00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,980
and Discuss, and actually a lot of those interviews are now online,

00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:46,159
on our blog. And we have also written more about this process,

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,029
it's still on our blog if you guys are interested in checking it out.

00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:50,990
And so with, in a month,

00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:53,230
a month and a half even then we thought,

00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:59,570
OK, we could do this. I think what Coby said in the morning that,

00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:00,190
you basically found it at least as hard

00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:00,570
as you thought it was going to be,

00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:00,909
in my case it was definitely true.

00:29:00,909 --> 00:29:02,639
So I thought OK, so I just need to

00:29:02,639 --> 00:29:04,009
pass an email and then I can get started.

00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:07,220
And that's it. Passing the email too me a night,

00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,590
and then ?? (00:29:12:21) a little bit later,

00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:12,379
it took us a whole year or something, pretty much.

00:29:12,379 --> 00:29:13,100
And so we started coding,

00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,360
but getting the product out it took us

00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,600
about a good eight months or something.

00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:21,680
And in private ... ?? (00:29:27)

00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,320
V.O.: Anymore questions? All right,

00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,259
thank you Prateek.

00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:44,320
