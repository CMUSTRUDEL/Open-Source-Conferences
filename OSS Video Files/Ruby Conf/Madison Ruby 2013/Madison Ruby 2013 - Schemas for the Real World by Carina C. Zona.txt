Title: Madison Ruby 2013 - Schemas for the Real World by Carina C. Zona
Publication date: 2020-01-28

Description: 
	Social app development challenges us to code for users' personal world. Users are giving push-back to ill-fitted assumptions about their own identity â€” name, gender, sexual orientation, important relationships, and many other attributes that are individually meaningful. How can we balance users' realities with an app's business requirements? Facebook, Google+, and others are struggling with these questions. Resilient approaches arise from an app's own foundation. Discover how our earliest choices influence codebase, UX, and development itself. Learn how we can use that knowledge to both inspire the people who use our apps, and to generate the data that need as developers.

alright so yeah as Jim said several

00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:21,060
times my name is karima see zona you can

00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:24,310
find me all over the Internet as CC zona

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,680
I'm a developer i'm also a sex educator

00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:28,390
I volunteer for an organization in San

00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,939
Francisco called the San Francisco sex

00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:32,410
information otherwise known as

00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:34,750
took me about a year to learn how to

00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:36,850
pronounce that spicy has been operating

00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:39,100
a phone hotline for over 40 years and

00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:42,269
our mission is to answer any question at

00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:45,430
all as long as we can accurately

00:00:42,269 --> 00:00:46,510
confidentially and without judgment and

00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,309
you would think that people would take

00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,680
advantage of this I asked all sorts of

00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:52,960
really crazy questions right and they do

00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,030
to some extent but the majority of

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,489
questions when you really boil them down

00:00:55,030 --> 00:01:00,070
come down to something really simple and

00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:03,250
universal for all of us and that is am i

00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:05,170
normal do I fit in to this world and

00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:07,810
that kind of fascinated me and got me

00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:13,030
thinking a lot about why we have to ask

00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:15,460
that question so often so as you know I

00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:25,539
think a lot about how my two worlds

00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:30,909
overlap they do some are more whimsical

00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:32,289
than others and I want to share

00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:35,170
something with you that was written by

00:01:32,289 --> 00:01:36,909
Sarah dopp imagine walking through the

00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,609
world knowing that everyone's first

00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:41,890
assumptions about how you see yourself

00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:45,130
who you love what feels right for you

00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:47,439
are completely wrong now imagine signing

00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:49,119
up for cool website and then being

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,039
required to select an option from a

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,310
drop-down menu that doesn't include

00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:57,009
anything that represents you you'll feel

00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:58,179
defeated you'll want to argue that

00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:00,549
whatever they think they're learning

00:01:58,179 --> 00:02:03,280
from that drop-down menu it's not really

00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:05,319
true you'll want to tell them that

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,959
they're adding to your humiliation by

00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:10,600
making you do this you'll want to tell

00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:15,700
them that they're missing a huge part of

00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:17,640
you users are giving push back to

00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,900
assumptions that leave them out and

00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:23,650
social apps in particular are being

00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:25,240
pressed to adjust Facebook Google others

00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,530
they're all having

00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,600
to deal with these questions and they

00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,460
have been for years and they're

00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,710
struggling they're still trying to work

00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:34,330
it out so if you've ever felt out of

00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:37,630
depth with this stuff just know that

00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:39,610
you're not the only one when developers

00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:42,370
talk about normalization we're typically

00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:44,440
talking about databases right about

00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,850
computer science but when dealing with

00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,750
human attributes we're inherently

00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:53,830
dealing in the social sciences as well

00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:57,130
is that going to happen hoping we've

00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:59,680
gone through all of them okay yay thank

00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:02,140
you all right we're just gonna pretend

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,420
that there's only the one of them that

00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,190
one's dang cool all right so we also

00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,290
have this thing called sociological

00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:10,000
normalization and conflating that

00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:13,060
computer science normalization and

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,710
sociological normalization is going to

00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,050
work out fine as long as you only want

00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:20,590
users who can be among that select few

00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:22,240
who belonged to the idealized norm but

00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:25,630
most of us are going for a much broader

00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,820
user base than that right so what we

00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:30,640
lose track of is one of the core tenets

00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:33,820
of database normalization we're supposed

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,760
to mirror real world concepts and how

00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:38,620
they interrelate when the database is in

00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,050
tension with people's own real world

00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:46,510
then it's not the people who need to be

00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:49,600
flexible it's us so why why why is this

00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:52,780
hard at first glance this stuff seems so

00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:56,710
easy because it's just forms and we've

00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:57,970
done those a million times but we're

00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:03,100
getting tripped up by some flawed

00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:04,780
premises first premise that deeply

00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:09,310
personal stuff about humans can be

00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:10,900
reduced to lists second our assumption

00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:14,260
that canonical lists for these things

00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:17,859
always exist or that at least surely we

00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:19,330
can make them and the third problem is

00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:23,650
our faith that the first two problems

00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:29,560
here could be easily solved just add

00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:31,360
more list items this is a real list this

00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,000
is British Airways a few years ago

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:38,320
there's 122 of them so we might have to

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,100
stop at the point oh yay it's really

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,810
easy to

00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:46,420
wind up looking this foolish and this is

00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:49,600
what we try to do and we haven't even

00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:55,720
solved a problem yet some people have

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:57,640
more than one title right so what's the

00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,120
social network anyway what is it in

00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:04,060
purely human terms well it involves

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,690
trust individuals revealing who they are

00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:11,080
what they value who they care about

00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:13,030
that's as personal as we get this is the

00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,270
real life that our apps are meant to

00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:19,240
replicate and build on and support and

00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:21,040
emulate but we have to ask what

00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,900
relationships are we fostering between

00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,430
the person and the app what

00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:30,040
relationships are we accidentally

00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:32,500
inhibiting or denying this is sad is

00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:35,170
there anything to do to survive it or

00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:37,870
stuck okay we're going to keep going in

00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:40,150
real life saying I know your personhood

00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:44,860
better than you is always going to sound

00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:49,990
presumptuous right in real life we don't

00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:54,850
do this in real life saying your

00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:58,300
existence just isn't possible sounds so

00:05:54,850 --> 00:06:03,850
clueless but then we do stuff like this

00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:08,950
I know there's someone in the room

00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:14,220
saying uh-huh in real life saying who

00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:22,030
you are is invalid sounds arrogant Oh

00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:25,000
validations data modeling is psychology

00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:27,070
and it is philosophy it reflects

00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,980
individuals beliefs about reality it

00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:31,930
doesn't reflect reality itself it

00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:35,050
rejects realities complexity and

00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:38,410
richness it's not what we've set out to

00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:42,120
do it's never what we set out to do it's

00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:44,650
not the community that we seek to build

00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,870
Pamela Fox says I think I only truly

00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:50,610
understand how complex the real world is

00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:50,610
when I try to model it in a database

00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:55,690
postelles law reminds us to be

00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,420
conservative in what we do and to be

00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:02,160
liberal in what we accept from others

00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:02,160
but are we taking that wisdom to heart

00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:09,850
there are two kinds of schemas first

00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:12,850
there's mental schemas these are our

00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:14,890
preconceived ideas about a framework for

00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:17,680
representing some sort of aspect of the

00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:19,510
world around us and we use it as our

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,810
system for organizing and perceiving new

00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:25,540
information as we bring it in database

00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:27,610
schemas are closely related to that it's

00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:34,600
a mental schema it's just translated

00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:35,920
into blueprints for a database so here

00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,350
we have some simple front-end

00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:41,800
manifestations of various individuals

00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:45,220
mental schemas and when we look at them

00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:48,270
really closely we can see some things we

00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:51,490
could see that scheme is our foundation

00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:57,700
for expressing things that are deeply

00:07:51,490 --> 00:08:00,310
deeply intimate they're a foundation for

00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:03,160
expressing things that are important

00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:07,840
about our relationships at about our

00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:14,800
self-image schemas define user

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:18,730
experience but our schemas and our UX

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:22,180
are leaving people behind which is

00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:23,860
something that we can fix and it's by

00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:26,830
asking ourselves what benefit will be

00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:28,810
user notice and that question is not

00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:31,660
equivalent to what will the user benefit

00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:34,630
because that one is an assumption that

00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:37,930
grants us too much latitude it assumes

00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:39,970
that what we want to give is of course

00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:42,220
to their benefit because it's going to

00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:47,500
help us to deliver a product that's

00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:49,210
awesome there isn't one way to deal with

00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,670
this there isn't one right answer

00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:55,900
because the nature of our dilemma is

00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:58,720
that users inherently very and so do

00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,280
their social worlds so we always need to

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,500
understand the varying approaches

00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,010
available to us and how they fit into

00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,890
different contexts

00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:08,330
what trade-offs they bring and we even

00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:10,070
have to deal with those obvious really

00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:14,570
boring questions of how does this meet

00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:18,620
the business requirements checkboxes

00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:20,780
radio button select menus ranges these

00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:24,470
each apply that every single possible

00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:26,540
value can and will be included if any

00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:28,460
value isn't included there it's the real

00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:31,820
world being rejected because it didn't

00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:33,890
match up with our mental schema checking

00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:37,430
a box is just a one step action and

00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:39,590
entering a texturing is not so a

00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:41,930
free-form solutions such as a text area

00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:45,740
or a text input just doesn't seem

00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:47,210
automatically exciting for us but it can

00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,190
bring some really visible meaningful

00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:53,600
benefits from the users perspective and

00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:56,530
from ours a metafilter gender has been a

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,030
text field for over a decade and

00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:01,160
initially people really shuddered at

00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:02,930
that thought because the early crowd at

00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,810
metafilter were a lot of them

00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:11,690
programmers themselves and they hated

00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:13,370
the idea of dirty data collection and I

00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:15,170
was for about five seconds and then they

00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:18,500
jumped on board because they got to be

00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:22,180
creative in silly with things like XY &

00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:27,050
fella and queer fembot dangly bits

00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:32,210
chicklet sideburns ambidextrous member

00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:34,370
of the patriarchy and because they could

00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:37,370
express things about themselves really

00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:39,080
fully an authentic voice like I speak

00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,570
using the male gender when it's required

00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:43,940
by language or I'm fifty percent

00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:48,170
quintessential tomboy and fifty percent

00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:53,150
totally girly girl and things like

00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:54,860
transgender and gender queer that text

00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:57,710
field has grown into beloved institution

00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:58,880
and whatever you is a user choose to put

00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:02,630
in that field to something revealing

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,310
about who you are and that you're

00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:06,410
allowed to put anything into it or put

00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:08,570
nothing into it at all says something

00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:12,590
revealing about how metafilter envisions

00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:15,140
community itself that schemas trust in

00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:16,790
users was the foundation for metafilter

00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:22,670
users to ask

00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:24,560
share more about themselves in 2010 died

00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:26,570
asked for likewise turn gender into a

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,050
text field and just like a metafilter

00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:33,020
users felt set free by it gender like

00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:36,830
masculine male man more or less

00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:41,960
normative man boy ada lovelace that's my

00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:46,580
favorite another go to have not checked

00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:48,470
today uh-huh there's an important

00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:50,990
distinction here though metafilter is

00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:54,170
closed sourced it's a single developer

00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:55,970
and it's entirely in English whereas

00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:58,670
diaspora needed to me a really different

00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:01,550
set of needs it's open source got a lot

00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:05,870
of developers and it international

00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:08,570
eise's so some of its developers were

00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:10,780
not amused it's fair to object that this

00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:14,900
approach is going to wreak havoc on

00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:18,430
internationalization of pronouns here's

00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,430
what I've got to say about that

00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:23,920
internationalization is hell period

00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:27,350
there is no get-out-of-jail-free card

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:29,450
get no safety net constraining gender

00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:31,880
options does nothing to solve the

00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:33,230
translation of languages so don't be

00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,270
setting yourself up for trying to deal

00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:39,740
with internationalization that way it

00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:41,300
will fail you and if you're really

00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,460
thinking that boiling this question down

00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,050
to instead what's your legal gender is

00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,160
going to be an easy way out we're gonna

00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:50,600
have to talk about internationalization

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:53,950
there too because this is the year that

00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:56,690
we had some lovely new advances

00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:58,940
indeterminate that has going to become

00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:02,390
the legal gender on german birth

00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:04,310
certificates as of november first x is

00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:07,250
now a legal gender on australian

00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:10,310
passports in New South Wales Australia

00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:13,580
sex not specified is yet another option

00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:15,440
available this isn't going away it's

00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:17,240
going to keep on expanding like this our

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,860
lists are going to have to deal with it

00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,590
and we already know that expanding list

00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:26,210
is going to get us right back to 122

00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:28,730
options randall munroe is best known as

00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:29,870
XKCD and he's examined this issue of

00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:32,630
pronouns many

00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:35,029
times in depth for just english language

00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:36,860
projects and he says it's the most

00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:39,140
complicated thing that he's ever spent a

00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:40,760
lot of time learning about and he spent

00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:44,900
a lot of time learning about quantum

00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:49,430
mechanics so here's what he ultimately

00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:53,089
concluded on all that you got to ask the

00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:55,190
only thing that works ask ask the

00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:57,860
question straight up what pronouns do

00:13:55,190 --> 00:14:00,320
you prefer and that's truly the best

00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:05,810
that he could come up with so things

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:07,339
like he him she her they them even it or

00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:09,589
you can just avoid pronouns all together

00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:11,150
and just ask hey what's your name we can

00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:15,440
construct sentences that way right

00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:17,450
instead of saying you know he went to

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:21,320
the cross the street you could say Tom

00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:23,390
one across the street no big deal or

00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,490
maybe we can refine some of those lists

00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:27,110
a little bit tweaked keeping in mind

00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:29,960
that we're going right track to the

00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:32,750
problem of not respecting how users want

00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:36,430
to describe themselves and you may be

00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:39,290
thinking about that they and them and

00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:44,270
remembering English class and your

00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:46,550
teacher said that's plural I know it's

00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:48,890
plural and singular and it has been for

00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:50,900
over 400 years and if you don't believe

00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:54,350
me you're going to take the word of Jane

00:14:50,900 --> 00:15:01,490
Austen Shakespeare Chaucer Lewis Carroll

00:14:54,350 --> 00:15:03,200
ah facebook they've been doing this

00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:07,910
construction for at least five years and

00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:09,550
it's going just fine we can aspire to

00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:11,990
make our social apps feel just like home

00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:15,620
we can do that by making development

00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:17,510
choices that say users we get you be as

00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:23,690
individual it is messy as you want to be

00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:25,310
we can handle you being you when we're

00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:27,260
collecting on data on people then we're

00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:30,020
moving into a different realm and that's

00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:31,970
the social sciences so if we want to run

00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:34,190
useful analytics about personal

00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,529
attributes and behaviors then we have to

00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:37,940
do data collection that way too and in

00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:41,870
social sciences you're going to need to

00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:43,820
make two minimum criteria first the

00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:50,060
fields values have to include every pasa

00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:51,620
auction we call that exhaustive secondly

00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,120
the fields options have to be mutually

00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:55,880
exclusive there can be no overlap

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,890
between them at all how many of our

00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:02,330
social apps really do meet both of those

00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:05,450
bare minimum criteria though we've seen

00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:07,160
stuff like this all the time and it

00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:13,460
seems like the values are pretty fully

00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:19,520
covered right seems hang on hang on it's

00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:22,760
not trying hard trying to do better just

00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:27,400
don't let done all right here's another

00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:29,360
attempt kids you tried this one right

00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:34,040
although I like the addition here of

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:37,220
none-of-your-business still tried all

00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:39,890
right try again a whole lot of things

00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:41,330
that weren't on those last few no matter

00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:44,840
what it's still inadequate to express

00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:47,240
the real world's complexity and we do

00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:51,530
realize that the world has great variety

00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:55,160
of course we do the problem is knowing

00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:57,410
how to handle it it's easy to just sort

00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:01,160
of dismiss that and say well refactor

00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:03,710
later initial choices that we set about

00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:06,020
differing user experiences are setting

00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:08,720
everything in motion from beginning we

00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:10,400
can't refactor that away later thinking

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,890
at the outset about the real world's

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,870
variety and complexity starts as asking

00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:17,930
early questions that set the foundation

00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:20,720
for social app building we're just going

00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:25,550
to have to ask what user experience does

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:27,860
this schema drive us toward it's easy to

00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:31,550
get into a habit of structuring data for

00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:32,930
easy analysis and we can choose to look

00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,650
at human data from a really different

00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:39,170
perspective instead we can step back

00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:41,630
wallow in the users perspective because

00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:45,380
data serves other purposes it doesn't

00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:49,400
have to be just for analysis can be

00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:52,040
sheer expressiveness data has character

00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:54,640
it has individualism it has

00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,640
distinctiveness

00:17:54,870 --> 00:18:00,210
as developers we have a vision of what a

00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:06,240
good code base should be what it should

00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:09,540
not be we want it to be structured we

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:12,360
wanted to be predictable we try to have

00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:15,510
relational data we want everything to be

00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,300
indexed fast searchable and we always

00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:20,040
think we are going for exhaustive

00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:22,710
because we want everything to be so nice

00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,930
and easy to analyze because we want

00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:27,960
ultimately to be able to build

00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:31,620
data-driven decisions we love the sense

00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:33,300
of the empirical instead what we do our

00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,920
whole bunch of validations and then we

00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,750
got to throw exceptions we have all

00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,790
these conditionals and partials for them

00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:41,280
we're doing all this premature

00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:45,300
optimization that nobody actually wants

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:48,710
us to do because we're not acknowledging

00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:51,330
cultural variability individuals

00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:53,720
variability and that's always going to

00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:55,679
be a moving target it's always changing

00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:58,800
so we're making all these decisions

00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:04,110
based on false premises we're

00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:06,179
data-driven in wrong directions eros is

00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:08,100
the largest ongoing survey of Americans

00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:09,540
religious identification it just asked

00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:13,309
this one really simple open-ended

00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:16,170
question what is your religion if any

00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:18,720
and that netted them over 100 unique

00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:22,790
answers and if you're making a forum

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:25,020
based on that this is tricky right

00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:27,420
there's no form element that's going to

00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:28,679
make this easy for our users no way to

00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:37,170
just pick out from that list of

00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:39,270
possibilities this is long so they try

00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:41,490
to compress it they got it down to 13

00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:42,929
major categories and that feels a little

00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:45,059
more manageable especially from a user

00:19:42,929 --> 00:19:48,120
perspective we could go ahead and use

00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:49,860
that in a form a lot of these though

00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,150
feel like kind of edge case is hard to

00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,670
see here but some of those numbers are

00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:57,300
really tiny and we like to focus on you

00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:59,490
know the genuine major groupings so we

00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,990
can bring it down a bit at least a

00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:04,980
quarter of Americans turn out to be a

00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:08,039
Christian done every other religion

00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:09,869
would just be some clutter edge cases

00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:12,659
and then we've got some sort of you know

00:20:09,869 --> 00:20:15,919
crummy data inside that will probably

00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:19,440
assign an ill value for some of these

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:22,229
fix that too now we're focusing

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,940
attention on the next problem one in

00:20:22,229 --> 00:20:25,559
five people are giving us answers that

00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,539
aren't really useful at least from an

00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:31,940
advertising perspective or for our own

00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:37,039
analytics right get rid of the nils to

00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:41,239
now we've got it down christian or other

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:51,289
good clear list deals with the majority

00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:51,289
nice binary boolean storage optimization

00:20:53,539 --> 00:21:00,450
we don't do this we don't do this it

00:20:57,989 --> 00:21:02,759
covers the biggest categories it seems

00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:06,210
like logic and at least people out we

00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:07,590
know how offensive this is so why do we

00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:12,960
do with other things that are just as

00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:16,369
personal people are in edge cases they

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,599
push back when apps treat them that way

00:21:16,369 --> 00:21:23,039
so being reductive has those big

00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:26,220
problems scaling upward does too it's

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:30,509
instinctual II uncomfortable for us to

00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:35,700
deliberately not structured data I feel

00:21:30,509 --> 00:21:37,289
it too I resist it really do but again

00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,450
we have to return to that foundational

00:21:37,289 --> 00:21:42,809
question of what benefit will be user

00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:46,169
notice what identities are we going to

00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:48,479
say are okay with us and we can strike

00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:50,519
some middle grounds on these things this

00:21:48,479 --> 00:21:53,970
is where guided response comes in also

00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:55,619
known as auto-suggest when there's a

00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:57,239
subset of values that you're most

00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:59,519
interested in we can do minimal

00:21:57,239 --> 00:22:02,669
auto-suggest instead it's auto-suggest

00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:04,889
just until those handful of values you

00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:08,580
care about are no longer what's being

00:22:04,889 --> 00:22:11,299
entered and then back off structured

00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:14,669
data from those who want to give it and

00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:19,379
freeform to let people be expressive if

00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:21,239
that's what they want to do so we get

00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,880
this nice compromise we get structured

00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:24,940
data

00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:28,000
and that's balanced there are of course

00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:31,720
trade-offs data quantity is going to be

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:35,290
lower being free to opt out of providing

00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:40,930
personal data yes some people do on the

00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:44,860
other hand data quality is improving now

00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:46,480
we've got real data it's fine to do some

00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,580
mixing and matching we can find the

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,550
right approach for our users for our app

00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:53,470
for our business objectives Facebook

00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:56,020
makes relationships that is completely

00:22:53,470 --> 00:23:00,370
optional for instance but they get

00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:03,130
coercive if you do opt in most users do

00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:08,140
opt in though sixty percent of them

00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:10,420
select a relationship status the bottom

00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:13,210
line is we want everyone to feel excited

00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:17,670
about what we build we want users to

00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:17,670
feel passionate about their involvement

00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:23,530
analytics investments monetization they

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,530
always are based on this premise that

00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:30,040
our data is accurate but data being

00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:36,100
collected by coercive means has this big

00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:38,530
risk the premise is garbage some people

00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:41,880
lie because lying is what we make or

00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:44,320
requirement for getting in the door

00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,880
conclusions drawn from that bad data are

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:49,320
just misdirecting our decision-making

00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:51,790
about the next stage of development

00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:54,550
restrictive options that stuff I talked

00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:56,440
about earlier checkboxes radios those

00:23:54,550 --> 00:24:00,250
don't actually have to be marked as

00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:02,590
required the way we set up schema often

00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:06,250
embeds assumptions that we should that

00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:08,320
we will so we do an attribute that is

00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:10,660
ambiguously named is destined to become

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,540
a form field where data wanders away

00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:16,450
from its original intent and code that

00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:18,030
misunderstands how to use it a field

00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:21,520
that's not allowed to be dull is

00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:23,770
destined to be mandatory a field that is

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,590
assigned a maximum length is an

00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:31,030
assertion that all possible values are

00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:32,600
knowable and fit within it when I see

00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:39,350
something like this

00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:41,380
I see a belief system boom you can make

00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:45,740
a whole different set of assumptions

00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:48,650
this here change in a field name from

00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:51,200
gender to gender identity setting and

00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:53,810
Nell deliberately setting a var car

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,520
instead of a fixed length all these are

00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:59,210
foundations for a whole different user

00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:02,420
experience and the really cool move here

00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:07,730
is that we're doing less I love doing

00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:10,520
less make the stuff flexible up front we

00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:15,680
can optimize for storage later we can

00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:17,300
decide what we have to validate later so

00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,850
now we have this discretionary field

00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:25,510
right whether to respond is being left

00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:29,980
to the user and as developers we may

00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:33,260
look upon this expression of null true

00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:37,190
explicitly it's kind of unnecessary

00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:40,130
because null is true by default but

00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:43,220
making that explicit is with purpose

00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:46,700
it's a communication to our team to

00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:49,700
ourselves it's a statement of intent

00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:54,620
that this was the spec it's documenting

00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:56,300
a product decision what would a

00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:59,480
canonical set of relationship statuses

00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:02,210
look like this was facebook three years

00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,920
ago it felt like that's pretty good I

00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:05,840
even got some sort of liberal options

00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:10,130
going on here it's complicated open

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:12,800
relationships users disagreed it

00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:14,540
disagreed really strongly and under

00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,100
pressure facebook had to double those

00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:22,250
options and that was this in two years

00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:24,320
time Facebook was not new and then

00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:27,350
Google+ launched and they largely

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,970
adopted Facebook's list although for

00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:32,690
some reason they left out separate and

00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:34,130
divorce I'm really not sure why and

00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:35,990
notice that they also added something

00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:41,690
really important I don't want to say

00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:44,330
choice opting out allowing users to

00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:48,820
identify their relationships

00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:48,820
I'm so glad this slide is viewable

00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:54,399
identifying their relationships with

00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:57,799
labels of greater personal significance

00:26:54,399 --> 00:27:00,200
this is being driven by people rejecting

00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:05,960
a user experience that isn't working for

00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:09,320
them how do some senses seem Universal

00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:11,600
while others don't naming a thing

00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:13,700
creates scope for it the assumed

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,830
validity of a fields values are getting

00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:19,700
constrained as soon as that field is

00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:22,010
named marital status can lead to a list

00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:24,350
something like this crossing off some of

00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:27,460
those right a person is assumed to be

00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:31,929
either unmarried preparing to be married

00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:34,460
currently married I'm really married

00:27:31,929 --> 00:27:36,399
whereas legal marital status gets us

00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:38,960
something a little bit different right

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:44,480
we add things like civil union and

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:46,850
domestic partnerships relationship

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,559
status sets a different paradigm in

00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:51,200
which one is either in a current

00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:56,120
relationship or defined by the absence

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:58,730
of a relationship when you name that

00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:01,250
field you define the paradigm you define

00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:03,380
all the possibilities and there are

00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:04,909
important differences in what each of

00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:07,970
those envision and they're able to

00:28:04,909 --> 00:28:11,029
measure naming fields with great

00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:13,720
specificity upfront is what makes our

00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:19,279
analyses stronger more powerful more

00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:30,110
consistent or valuable when you change

00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:31,909
that name I love what you guys love we

00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:34,279
go through life experiencing a whole lot

00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:36,320
of relationships and they don't all have

00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:38,690
predetermined labels they don't all have

00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,309
predetermined sequence a new

00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:46,159
relationship identities don't

00:28:40,309 --> 00:28:48,590
necessarily leave old ones behind said

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,750
woman I like to be truthful it's

00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:53,200
complicated is really deceiving for me

00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:55,730
because it's not complicated I'm

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,100
separated from my husband who I am still

00:28:55,730 --> 00:29:00,110
legally married to

00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,850
you got to ask why should anyone have to

00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:03,740
feel like they're required to disavow a

00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:06,740
relationship that's meaningful for them

00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:10,309
and that can cut really deeply sometimes

00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:13,419
is a widow only a widow until she

00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:16,280
resumes dating isn't she Widow forever

00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:19,910
should she have to puzzle over that and

00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:21,350
make a decision to let go of one why

00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:23,660
does she have to be confronted with a

00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:37,669
decision like that at all just to use

00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:46,250
our stupid app spot the flaw say it loud

00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:54,260
and why is that a problem yes open

00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:55,789
relationship is a one too many all right

00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:58,820
what do we mean by one too many right

00:29:55,789 --> 00:30:01,070
now we're going back to CS zero one or

00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:04,940
many right that's what a relationship

00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:09,409
and open relationship is facebook thinks

00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:12,590
an open relationship is one this is what

00:30:09,409 --> 00:30:21,620
happens when you think let's just add

00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:24,309
more labels let's just concede but it's

00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:27,140
not funny from that person's perspective

00:30:24,309 --> 00:30:30,789
it's a schema forcing them to either

00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:33,380
look evasive or to be inauthentic and

00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:35,120
that's what happens when we try to throw

00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:38,710
more labels at the problem instead of

00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:40,880
re-examining the schemas assumptions

00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:42,350
when we don't give people means to

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,140
express what's real important for them

00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:50,559
they just hack around us a quarter of

00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:53,500
facebook users are married probably not

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:55,429
what they probably have is a best friend

00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,490
married for them is the nearest

00:30:55,429 --> 00:30:59,870
equivalent that they're allowed to have

00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:02,570
that's the way that they can say this

00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:07,280
person is the most important person in

00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:09,530
my life our dogged pursuit of nice clean

00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:12,169
crunchable data takes us to all the

00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:14,239
wrong places it makes our data are

00:31:12,169 --> 00:31:17,059
users want to work against a system that

00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:20,389
doesn't acknowledge their lives reality

00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:22,279
as developers our lines of code are

00:31:20,389 --> 00:31:24,169
building or breaking an app's community

00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:26,659
so it's worth making some really

00:31:24,169 --> 00:31:30,999
conscious choices from the start and as

00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:35,749
we go model in the real world is complex

00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:37,730
that's okay but assuming that we know

00:31:35,749 --> 00:31:41,570
who users are is surrendering our

00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:44,350
opportunity to learn who they are early

00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:47,869
constraints in schema neta scrappy

00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:49,309
misleading data so we're going to keep

00:31:47,869 --> 00:31:52,340
those constraints out of human and

00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:54,950
social schema at least at first to

00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:57,710
gather enough initial response to do

00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:59,809
some data mining watch the data for a

00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:04,340
while keep an eye out for emergent

00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:06,379
trends what discoveries can we make how

00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:09,320
can those discoveries shape the apps

00:32:06,379 --> 00:32:11,480
growth and evolution you don't have to

00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:14,720
stay with this that's a great starting

00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:18,470
point data quality improves when lies

00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,779
become merely optional not required data

00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:24,109
becomes like the real world itself rich

00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:25,879
and specific so we can unearth the

00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:30,289
patterns that are undetectable when data

00:32:25,879 --> 00:32:32,960
is generic we get to make discoveries we

00:32:30,289 --> 00:32:38,749
get to re-envision possibilities we get

00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:41,330
to adapt quickly agile and users

00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:46,190
response to all this is engagement it is

00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:48,999
passion it's loyalty those are

00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:54,070
foundations for great user experiences

00:32:48,999 --> 00:32:54,070
that's what we want thank

00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,160
you

00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:09,690
