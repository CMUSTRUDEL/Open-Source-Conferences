Publication date: 2020-01-28
Playlist: Madison Ruby 2013
Description: 
	I will help set the tone for an exciting conference This creative and interactive kick-off will get all the attendees on the their feet, interacting with each other and having fun! While they are energized, I intend to have them connect and bond with 3 or 4 new people that they will want to stay in touch with far beyond this year's conference. They will start the conference with a good belly laugh!
