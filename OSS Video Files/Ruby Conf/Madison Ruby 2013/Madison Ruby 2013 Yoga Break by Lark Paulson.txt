00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:56,260
one of the knee or if you want you can

00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,000
rest and come all the way down you

00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:01,960
really want to feel the stretch in the

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,640
outer thigh back into the gut they

00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:07,260
mentioned earlier this is really great

00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,260
for preventing sciatica

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:18,300
Clemont tiny brush

00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:18,300
breathing deeply into those hips

00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:28,339
you're nice inhale begin to rise back up

00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:37,109
the other side crossing that left foot

00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:40,859
over the thigh pull Lord from here

00:11:37,109 --> 00:11:44,160
hinging at the waist dropping down just

00:11:40,859 --> 00:11:45,509
letting your head hang heavy there's

00:11:44,160 --> 00:12:00,239
nothing you need to do here in this

00:11:45,509 --> 00:12:03,619
moment sup just let go all of these can

00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:05,910
be easily done and I do recommend and

00:12:03,619 --> 00:12:07,829
many studies are showing now that we

00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:11,279
need to be doing some movement every

00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:13,990
hour for sitting in a computer lock

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:20,800
programs out there now

00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:23,670
on the things you can download gonna

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,670
kind of shake out the legs

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:31,110
stand up so one thing is really

00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,410
important especially for staring at our

00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:35,399
clown

00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:38,199
is our eyes eyes are getting solely

00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:39,639
society so one thing you should do is

00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:42,009
exercise your eyes i'm just going to

00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:46,389
start by looking up looking over to the

00:12:42,009 --> 00:13:02,050
side down into the other side x zoom

00:12:46,389 --> 00:13:03,790
your eyes now i'm pointing to find

00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:07,029
different points really quite normal are

00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:09,059
slow your hard to come your head with

00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:11,119
each other

00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:11,119
you

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,649
it's really important to view screen you

00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:20,070
can look outside me to really work those

00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:24,660
imma

00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:26,310
relax live and now one thing I want to

00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,440
do is just a little test before those

00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:32,340
tests what I want you to do is turn your

00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:35,900
head one side and then to the opposite

00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,900
notice what kind of tension

00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:42,620
your shoulders right now as I'm going to

00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:44,330

your ears it's a massage therapist trick

00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:55,190
so believe it or not the ears or like

00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:58,400
the feet so if you know reflexology the

00:13:55,190 --> 00:14:00,740
ears mimic all the organs in the body so

00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,470
actually by massaging the ears you'll

00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:08,210

want you to slowly roll the spine and

00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:28,059

00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:42,519
balancing pose for a moment so for those

00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:45,850
of us who sit a lot the muscles that get

00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:47,619
really basically they're pretty weak

00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:49,509

all grown technology

00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:53,090
I personally use different apps and

00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,889
programs to remind me every hour to get

00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:57,620

John's gonna brush down with that up and

00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:21,159
so we're helping to release that left

00:34:18,649 --> 00:34:21,159
shoulder blade

00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:25,569
close your eyes here if you want

00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:32,230
crud

00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,620
you

00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:40,110
ah

00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,540
the other side

00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:12,740
let's slide the hands behind the head

00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:17,529
and you want to pull the chin towards

00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:22,009
the chest as tightly as you possibly can

00:35:17,529 --> 00:35:24,880
and then keep working your way down fold

00:35:22,009 --> 00:35:24,880
all the way down

00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:31,600
to come about halfway and then you're

00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:33,040
going to inhale just rolling back up

00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,920
through the spine holding the chin

00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:38,730
tightly towards the chest and then give

00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,730
me up all the way

00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:45,540
so we did this yesterday afternoon make

00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,870
a few people thought I was a little

00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:50,750
weird when I

00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:53,300
again because it works them all so we're

00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:56,300
just going to do we like your massage so

00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:58,760
this is a true amazing trick so you

00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:01,760
massage your year for about 30 seconds

00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:04,100
not they're discussing it is the

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:07,070
quickest way to release tension and the

00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:10,190
head back and shoulder I do this every

00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:12,530
day if you came with me it's amazing so

00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:15,260
the ears like the feet if you know

00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:17,660
anything about reflexology they mimic

00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:20,510
the meridians the bodies so you're

00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:22,310
actually releasing a lot of tension to

00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:24,860
all your body but particular what this

00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:27,280
really works on is that touch on the

00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:27,280
shoulder

00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:36,900
stay here a couple more breaths inside

00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:36,900
outside all around

00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:41,820
and

00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,980
shake it out we didn't do the test like

00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:46,290
we did yesterday afternoon but just how

00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:51,770
you doing right now turn your head one

00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:51,770
side and the other relief is so much

00:37:00,809 --> 00:37:07,100
do a little breath work so

00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,100
come up nice and tall

00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:12,689
much back

00:37:10,289 --> 00:37:14,819
nice and Tom it's just allows our spine

00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:16,589
be straight there's actually a scizor

00:37:14,819 --> 00:37:19,420
Menotti that runs down through there so

00:37:16,589 --> 00:37:21,609
you're letting the energy flow

00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:23,740
it's really important so from here we're

00:37:21,609 --> 00:37:26,230
just going to inhale opening the arms

00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:29,770
out to the sides i'm going to feel your

00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:32,770
test opening and then exhale pulling

00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:34,950
hands back Ian so nice to close your

00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,950
eyes

00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:57,850
four times

00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:16,800
I suppose you can drop the hands down to

00:38:14,609 --> 00:38:19,560
the knees

00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,920
finish off with Brad that even more

00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:25,840
Theon

00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:27,190
43 and then you an exhale 46 you want to

00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:30,420
take a breath grace you're a little bit

00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:30,420
long that's a sign

00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:41,070
as I saying

00:38:38,289 --> 00:38:44,170
very simple breath work

00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:49,840
finally if you ever get stressed out

00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:52,260
before presentation or just a really

00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:57,580
quick way to slow your heart rate down
