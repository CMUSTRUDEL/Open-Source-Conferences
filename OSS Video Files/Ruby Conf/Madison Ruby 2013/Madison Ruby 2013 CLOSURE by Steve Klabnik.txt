Title: Madison Ruby 2013 CLOSURE by Steve Klabnik
Publication date: 2020-01-28
Playlist: Madison Ruby 2013
Description: 
	On August 19, 2009, _why the lucky stiff disappeared from the Internet. It was a sad day for Rubyists everywhere, but we all moved on, or at least, tried to. Then, on April 18th of this year, _why came back. His website became a printer spool, spitting out almost 100 pages of new, interesting stuff to read. A lot of people found what he wrote to be really confusing, though. In typical _why fashion, it was full of all kinds of weird, wonderful things... but how many Rubyists have really read Kafka? In this talk, I'll go through CLOSURE, explaining a few of how I read its more tricky parts, and show you what _why's final words mean for us as Rubyists.

hi everybody I'm Steve

00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:21,210
thanks so much for coming to Madison

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,009
Ruby like like Jim said three times this

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,050
is always one of my favorite conferences

00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:26,640
um it's always been special to me for a

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,930
number of different reasons so thank you

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:34,199
all for being here so uh when when Jim

00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,760
asked me to come speak he was like Steve

00:00:34,199 --> 00:00:37,470
what he want to talk about and I said I

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,640
don't know and let the email pileup

00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,980
forever because that's what I do is

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,559
letting emails pilot forever and then uh

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,949
why came back and so I was like all

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,540
right let's do this so this is a one

00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:49,379
time talk you know that you all know

00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,089
there's big a lot of conferences

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:52,920
sometimes I give the same talk over

00:00:51,089 --> 00:00:54,120
again with modifications but one of the

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,589
reasons that I'm excited you are all are

00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:01,860
here is because this is the only time

00:00:55,589 --> 00:01:04,019
I'm doing this talk so thanks so anyway

00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,180
this talk is called closure this is time

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,270
well spent

00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:12,930
so as you probably know this is talk

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,729
about this guy it uh it's sort of funny

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,770
I've been doing this recently - I hate

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:18,900
the raise your hands meme but who does

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,480
not know who why the lucky stiff is in

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:25,020
this room sweet

00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:26,790
welcome to Ruby thanks for being here no

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,380
I see that with like with truthless it's

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,670
actually there's this is the smallest

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,050
percentage of people at a conference

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,230
I've been to where I've like talked

00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:35,610
about this and like we've been in Ruby

00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,710
world for a long time

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,780
remember why disappeared four years ago

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,820
and Ruby and rails has grown so much in

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,310
those last four years that there's no

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,500
reason for people to remember our you

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,909
know petty drama of years past right so

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,370
it's sort of like if I was like oh

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:52,650
remember that time whenever Zedd Shah

00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:54,450
flamed out of rails a lot of you might

00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:56,220
remember now but like the point is is

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,990
that you know we're growing and there's

00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,790
new people here so I'm gonna try to fill

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,930
you in on the details about this guy and

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:05,280
why I'm giving a talk on him so this

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,860
man's name is why

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,019
the lucky stiff and it makes it very

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,879
hard to have conversations because with

00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:13,980
people that don't know that's his name I

00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:15,840
had a conversation in a cab one time in

00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,370
Austin and the driver turned around is

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,870
like I'm sorry I'm not trying to inject

00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,099
on your conversation here but what are

00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,200
you saying

00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:27,930
because it just you know it messes

00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:29,609
people up so okay so why quit

00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,719
programming I'll get to that in a minute

00:02:29,609 --> 00:02:32,790
for someone to talk about I'm coming

00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,349
back so this is a talk about a document

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,730
called closure and that's what I've been

00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:39,120
calling it anyway

00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:42,689
why returned from his leaving and gave

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,959
us 95 pages of stuff and it is super

00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:48,329
good and super interesting but people

00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,730
had said to me Steve

00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:53,340
you like doing all that reading stuff I

00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,689
I don't know what all these words mean

00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,439
could you just tell me what the answer

00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:59,939
is

00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:01,680
so in many in many cases this is true

00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:03,959
because it is a very interesting

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,669
document it is like a story and is a

00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,730
number of stories it's all sorts of

00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:09,989
things and so I sort of wanted to give

00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,669
you guys a talk on my thoughts on this

00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:14,250
thing and then you should all go read it

00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:16,500
so basically why I decided to repost

00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,480
stuff on his website and it actually

00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,689
allowed you to it was a printer spool so

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,489
it would let you download these pages as

00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:25,379
they came through and then you know once

00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:27,900
it's done printing and they went away so

00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:30,060
you get like five pages at a time in a

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,280
cycle and so this is a photo that I took

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,019
when I printed out one of the pages at

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,790
home now all the pages look like this

00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:37,199
and will actually be like bringing up

00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,699
the document a little later so you'll

00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,590
see what it all looks like but we got

00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:42,209
these sweet you know a photo of a page

00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,560
with handwriting on it right this is

00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:46,680
like one of those silly things where I

00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,079
saw I saw a poster that was like missing

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,569
poster with two tick stickers ripped out

00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:53,099
I'm gonna had the photo of itself into

00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:55,009
infinity is just missing poster missing

00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:58,229
poster this is the same kind of thing

00:03:55,009 --> 00:04:00,930
and yeah so 95 pages so it's pretty

00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:03,000
pretty thick and awesome so much good

00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,870
stuff in here there's gonna be a teeny

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,219
little bit of spoilers I'm sorry I

00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,569
assumed that it by coming to a talk

00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:10,799
about a thing if you didn't read the

00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:15,870
thing you'd expect to hear about the

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:17,489
thing so I don't I don't mean to kill it

00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,549
for you but I'm probably gonna end up

00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:21,570
spoiling it so my bad but just put it

00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:25,940
out there if you don't want to be

00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:28,680
tainted by my words leave now okay and

00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:31,260
to go back over the full story again of

00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,660
why and his return and everything so

00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:37,110
basically this is this is the actual man

00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:40,110
Jonathan who is why the lucky stiff that

00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:42,210
was his pseudonym and basically he did a

00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:45,170
lot of really awesome stuff with Ruby

00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:49,220
and programming in general and then

00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:53,190
decided four years ago as of Monday to

00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:54,450
commit info suicide and destroy every

00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,650
piece of him that was left on the

00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:57,210
Internet

00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:59,010
we'll talk about that obviously a lot

00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,870
but that was basically what happened and

00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:04,230
he was gone just one day just totally

00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:06,090
gone so there's this article where you

00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:10,850
can read more about all the details

00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:13,200
where's why buy any Lowrey and basically

00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:14,550
yeah so he disappeared was totally gone

00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,950
a bunch of us decided to pick up his

00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:19,110
projects me being one of them and this

00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:22,020
was largely because I did not want Weis

00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:24,570
work to die so I never actually got to

00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:27,840
meet why because when he came to

00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:29,520
Pittsburgh my hometown I was out of town

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,990
for the weekend I was like oh I missed

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:35,550
why I'll see you next time he's around

00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:37,590
and then he wasn't so whenever he

00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:39,390
disappeared people started collecting

00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:41,280
all of his works that had been done

00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:43,050
previously and because we have get

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,810
basically because the Ruby world moved

00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:48,900
to get we still have why the lucky

00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:51,990
stiffs stuff basically because everyone

00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:56,490
had copies of it and so we were able to

00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:58,950
salvage what he deleted now basically

00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,480
everybody stood up and said hey I want

00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:02,520
to take over this project I want to take

00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,200
over that project and so I looked at his

00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,600
projects and I was like hacky hack is

00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,130
the ultimate project of why's everything

00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,070
else that he built was in service to

00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:13,350
acne hack in many ways and so I wanted

00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,960
it to not die but I was pretty new to

00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:18,210
Ruby I had built one production rails

00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,190
app and I'd done some some Ruby stuff

00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:22,290
but I had not really done a whole lot of

00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,940
open source before and so I said I'm

00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:26,310
just gonna come around and help whoever

00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:28,470
decides to pick up acne AK like I'm just

00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,240
gonna help out and so then flip the guy

00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,740
who is keeping track of everyone was

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,590
like cool you're in charge of Hackney

00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:37,169
hack and I was like notice how I said

00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:41,160
the problem is is that then people

00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:43,530
didn't show up so it was just me and so

00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,630
I was like well I guess I have to sort

00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:46,950
of step it up and write some code and

00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:48,660
not let this

00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:50,550
died so that's sort of what I decided to

00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,530
do and one of the big things that I had

00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,750
a super big like crisis of conscience

00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:56,430
about for the first long slog it

00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:59,250
actually took me six months to compile

00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:01,080
shoes the first time and we'll talk more

00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,180
about what that happened later but

00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,590
basically during this really long hard

00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,060
part and I was like trying to put things

00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,220
together I had this really big deal of

00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,110
like okay why left so now this thing is

00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,700
mine and like what does that mean right

00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,770
taking over what you consider someone

00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,720
else's life's work to then make it your

00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:18,090
life's work is a really weird thing

00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:21,500
right cuz I didn't want to be that guy

00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:24,180
who up why stuff right that's bad

00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:29,130
but I also didn't want to like make it

00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:31,020
be slavishly like going over why and

00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,400
like what would why do I did not want

00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,690
that to be like the way the heck they

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,950
should be but it took me a long time to

00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:40,790
like come to terms and be okay with that

00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:44,070
anyway so in the end of this article uh

00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:45,810
MS Lowry decided that when she

00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:47,670
interviewed me for it she she Mesa says

00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:50,040
how do I get a hold of Y and I was like

00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:51,840
you can't get a hold of Y and she was

00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,920
like no but I mean like how would I go

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,970
about like what do you think would be

00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,240
the best way of actually getting in

00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:58,440
touch with Jonathan and I said you

00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,410
shouldn't it's terrible

00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,070
don't do it don't stop but then she did

00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,500
it anyway

00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:06,990
and I was kind of to be honest slightly

00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,730
happy because then I got to know that he

00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:10,560
was okay without being like morally

00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:13,890
culpable for the fact that he was known

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,620
it was okay so uh you know that's kind

00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:18,120
of amusing but so yeah so she figured

00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,950
out basically she like found the place

00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,330
that he worked and like literally went

00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:23,250
to his work and was like I want to speak

00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:25,740
to Jonathan and then they were like no

00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,910
and she was like but no like for reals I

00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,260
really need to talk to him and they're

00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,850
like he doesn't want to talk to you and

00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,260
she's like can you at least like make

00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:32,280
sure that he liked you he it does work

00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,320
here right and they're like we can't

00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,570
confirm or deny the existence of this

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,010
person but you know basically just

00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:41,250
deduced and finally when he said like

00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:44,610
yes I'm here on fine leave me alone she

00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:48,660
left so so we knew that he was okay then

00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:52,470
long time passed and one day I was

00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:53,910
walking to go get some pizza and I was

00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:57,900
like checking hacker news on my phone

00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:59,220
because I'm terrible and I saw this

00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,390
thing that said why the lucky stiffs

00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,340
site is back

00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,690
so I like frantically like clicked on it

00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:06,030
and saw that there was this weird

00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:08,490
printer spool thing that had a couple

00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,480
documents and so we downloaded it and

00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,490
found some of the things that are on

00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,310
there and it basically said at the end

00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:17,010
like this printer spool is going down

00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:20,550
for maintenance until April 17th from

00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:21,780
noon til about 4:00 and so then in the

00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,910
intermediate time that was in like

00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:26,940
November if I remember correctly or

00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:28,560
December early December so we had a

00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,030
while until April happens so I set an

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,160
alarm on my phone and was like April

00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:33,360
17th I'm not forgetting and a couple

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,160
more pages came through in the middle

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,930
time one of which had a handwritten Oh

00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,390
camel program that would actually pull

00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:41,070
the site and download stuff and send it

00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,870
to your printer right away because the

00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:45,000
files that were posted were actually PCL

00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,560
files which is a specific like file

00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,140
format the raw bits that the printer

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,110
takes in so this was like an actual

00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:53,400
literal or printer school so printed all

00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:56,370
those things out and they came through

00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:58,140
we got this now he's gone so that's the

00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:59,660
story that's the summary the backdrop of

00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:03,270
everything so we're all on the same page

00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:04,980
so what I want to cover today is first

00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,660
of all briefly before we get into this I

00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,240
unfortunately have to diverge slightly

00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,490
into post-modernism I apologize it will

00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,830
be brief then we're going to talk about

00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:16,800
the question like major themes in this

00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:20,970
work so the biggest one is identity and

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:23,670
then impermanence and then finally we're

00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:25,230
going to talk about where he is and what

00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:29,810
where do we go from here

00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:31,890
so okay so briefly post-modernism

00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:34,110
because it's like a really really

00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:36,210
important in how you read this work and

00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:38,820
also how you can like understand a lot

00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:41,130
of what Y was about so you're already

00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,160
probably fans of post-modernism even if

00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:47,340
you think you hate post-modernism and

00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:49,680
the reason is community so like

00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:52,650
community is there any community fans

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,550
like community yeah new seasons not a

00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:58,110
great but the original ones awesome I

00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:00,810
hate saying that so much when I heard

00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:02,490
Jessie J's first single come on the

00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:04,020
radio I thought originally that she was

00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:05,610
Katy Perry and I was like am I really

00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:08,810
gonna be the person who's like I prefer

00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,810
Katy Perry's earlier work

00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:15,570
so it happens anyway so community takes

00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:17,300
into like large elements of

00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:19,410
post-modernism and the reason that

00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,210
community is good is because of

00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,710
post-modernism so closure is written in

00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,890
the same style so when I talk about this

00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:26,940
I'm gonna make some brief community

00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:28,140
allusions if you haven't seen community

00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,720
you should go home and watch the first

00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:34,040
three seasons right now it's on that

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:37,940
hulu and the netflix i think whatever

00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:40,440
okay so this dude Liat are defined

00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:42,060
post-modernism is incredulity towards

00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,740
meta-narratives that's like the most

00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,570
succinct way of putting what those

00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,760
modernism is which is even hard to nail

00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:50,340
down itself and i've chose this

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,590
definition initially because nerds love

00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:55,260
meta right and we like we got our hands

00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:58,110
locked on meta as a concept so basically

00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:59,820
a narrative is a four leotard is this

00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:01,260
like story that organizes the way that

00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,060
society works or the way that we do

00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:05,310
things and so meta-narratives are

00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:07,260
narratives about narratives so like how

00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:09,570
do we tell the story of how we go

00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,670
together and like work together and so

00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:14,160
we should be skeptical or in crewless

00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:15,630
incredulous how are you say this word us

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,190
forced to read as a child and so I can't

00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:21,210
pronounce anything at all but basically

00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:23,940
we should be skeptical of

00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:26,400
meta-narratives so for example when

00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,900
there's a story that says 10,000 years

00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,370
ago the earth was made and by the way

00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,380
dinosaurs are fake and that's how we all

00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:33,180
got here you should be skeptical when

00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,560
someone says evolution caused all these

00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,320
things to be here and that's the grand

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,300
over a unifying narrative you should be

00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,250
skeptical when someone says I have the

00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,570
answer to the truth you should be

00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,430
skeptical of what they're saying because

00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:47,070
who knows what the truth even is

00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:49,110
actually right there's your side their

00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:50,340
side and what actually happened right

00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:53,670
that's kind of like very much what this

00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:55,620
is like with community community and

00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:57,390
bodies post-modernism because like the

00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,620
show community is theoretically about a

00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:00,480
bunch of college students that get

00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,010
together to have a study group but first

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,450
of all you never actually see them go to

00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,920
college like they're always just in that

00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,510
room where the study group happens and

00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,980
the study group wasn't even really a

00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:09,720
study group because Jeff made it up in

00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,360
the first place because he wanted to be

00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,610
lazy so like the whole entire story

00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,110
about why the story of community is

00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:19,020
happening is just like an outright lie

00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:20,580
it doesn't actually ever happen and all

00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,600
the characters personal stories are out

00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:24,889
like um

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,329
outright lies too right so you have the

00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:28,980
non-acting activists who has never done

00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:30,329
any works of activism in a while

00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,920
you have the person who probably has

00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:33,899
Asperger's syndrome is like the most

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,639
human and most relatable and most

00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:37,589
emotional out of everything and like all

00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:39,660
these sub things to you we're like total

00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:41,550
stories are lie so you may notice that I

00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:44,040
am giving you a meta story about this

00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:46,860
why stuff so you should just like ignore

00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,060
me that's what I'm saying but I'm not

00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,279
quite because I'm gonna go with the

00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:52,139
other definition of post-modernism one

00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:54,000
of the other ones which is genealogy

00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:56,339
this is a Foucault and Nietzsche thing

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,199
basically geology is a historical

00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:00,449
technique in which one questions the

00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:03,240
commonly understood beliefs of the time

00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:05,009
so basically instead of trying to come

00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,019
up with these grand unifying stories you

00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:08,639
pick some themes and you show how they

00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:09,930
had different amounts of influence in

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,420
different time periods and how they can

00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:13,800
contradict and you know affirm each

00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,660
other and like all these other things so

00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,639
this is why I said like I'm not gonna

00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,959
give you the story of closure in order

00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:20,339
I'm gonna talk to you about these couple

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,029
themes and we're gonna go over it

00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:22,800
because I think that's a much more

00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:24,959
honest way to review this kind of stuff

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,329
and this also means that closure in

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,279
itself has no actual real objective

00:14:27,329 --> 00:14:30,689
truth everything when you read it will

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,009
be different than when I read it because

00:14:30,689 --> 00:14:34,310
we're different people and we experience

00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:36,779
it differently so that's important

00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:38,519
because basically like every time I read

00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:40,110
it I see something differently so just

00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:41,189
because I say that I have this opinion

00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,709
does not mean you should treat it as

00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:46,880
valid that's what I'm saying

00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:49,380
okay so first theme identity who is why

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,519
you may notice already like right I've

00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,160
already referenced him by his name

00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:57,120
Jonathan as well as his name why because

00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:59,339
he is to people question mark and this

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,019
sort of like this sort of question of

00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:02,189
like Who am I and what am i doing is one

00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:03,990
of the biggest things that you can see

00:15:02,189 --> 00:15:05,550
why struggle with while writing this and

00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:08,850
he's like working through this process

00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:11,130
of his own identity so to this we're

00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:12,180
gonna go briefly to this I'm gonna one

00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,649
of the other things I know it's terrible

00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,149
to read stuff that's written on slides

00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:16,889
but since I'm assuming that a lot of you

00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:18,180
did not read it or memorize the stuff

00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:21,480
I'm gonna have to read off of some

00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:28,740
slides so I apologize so we're gonna go

00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:34,050
to dr. pestis on page eighteen here okay

00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:35,640
so this is this is a story briefly where

00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:37,769
why was like in

00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:41,130
in getting the opinion of this person

00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:43,230
who is an expert on pseudonymity so he

00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:45,060
says dr. pestis good afternoon I'm a

00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:46,649
fellow a professor of sorts doing work

00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,029
under an anonymous guys and I finished

00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:49,440
reading your book kill yourself the

00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:51,600
terrible things people say and do when

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,820
they aren't themselves now before you

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,769
start to assure a reply I'm not writing

00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,269
to disagree with you my complaint is

00:15:55,769 --> 00:15:59,010
that my real name is very plain and I

00:15:57,269 --> 00:16:00,420
prefer to have a fictional one you don't

00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:01,950
seem to suffer this problem since your

00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,990
real name is quite fictional sounding in

00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:05,940
its own I do realize that having a

00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:07,320
fictional name makes me a bad person but

00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,240
how bad of a person does it make me

00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:12,360
please rate me on the scale of John Q

00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:16,140
public to mr. X also is it too late to

00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:19,529
be real why his reply came in a few days

00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:20,940
mr. jonathan galette Gillette I guess

00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:22,680
probably again who knows how to

00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,180
pronounce things yes it's true I know

00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,800
your real name I asked a few of my

00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,269
experts to trace back the email you sent

00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,010
me and it lined up with his coordinates

00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:29,700
of one pirate OHS General Store in

00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:31,589
Draper Utah

00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,610
it seems you composed this email while

00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:34,860
you're plugged into their connection

00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:36,600
enjoying a sangria signore al it seems a

00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,579
quick call to store owner chase McQueen

00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,930
sorted all this out now please tell me

00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:42,449
the point of this ridiculous anonymity

00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:44,100
exercise hmm as it turns out oddly

00:16:42,449 --> 00:16:45,630
enough it seems that your real self is

00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,300
just an unknown programmer from Utah

00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:49,920
then that myth is easily dispelled why

00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,750
not make something of your real self of

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,160
course I know why and I can tell you

00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,750
because your fear of the world has

00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,730
clouded your ability to do things to

00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,380
improve your situation you're stuck

00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:59,190
there and Draper Utah and so you can cut

00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,350
through the paranoia

00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:04,589
please mr. Gillette come on in the

00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:06,179
water's fine best Emery pestis and then

00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:08,100
why I talks about searching to see what

00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:10,350
it is and like the place is not actually

00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,850
there and then he says dearest doctor

00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:13,049
thank you for the letter sorry to bother

00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:14,970
you again but can you tell me anything

00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:17,640
else about this place pyranose just an

00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:20,189
address is fine why and then the email

00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,720
bounced so I was trying to explain this

00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:23,160
is someone one time and I said like

00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,600
about this talk we were like talking

00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,640
about it and I was like okay so you have

00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,010
the real but trying to be anonymous

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,540
person talking to the fake person with a

00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:33,900
fake sounding name who is theoretically

00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:36,720
real then the real fake person asks the

00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:39,179
fake real but actually fake person what

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,740
he thinks about his anonymity and he

00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:42,809
totally disregard he says that that's

00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,940
stupid but then also gives why the

00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:47,040
answer to his question about his own

00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,850
self doubt about his identity and then

00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:51,610
why just totally ignores it

00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:53,410
and then the the fake real fake person

00:17:51,610 --> 00:18:00,340
disappears because he's not real

00:17:53,410 --> 00:18:01,990
and they were like and they were like

00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:05,470
it's pretty obvious you did almost get

00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:06,940
that English degree I think but the

00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:09,460
other funny thing about this is like

00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:11,560
pyranose in Draper Utah is a real place

00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:13,780
and a Google search will trivially show

00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:16,720
you that the thing is real so like even

00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:20,380
then the real person is saying that a

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,880
real place is not real so closures

00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,110
consists of a ton of these kinds of

00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,160
stories that are wrapped up like this

00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,390
that explain these things but I think

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,220
it's pretty obvious you can see here

00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:29,140
that like why is saying to us right like

00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:31,900
I am super paralyzed by not knowing

00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:33,490
what's going on then there's this

00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,780
section about Kafka if you've seen me

00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:37,060
tweeting about reading Kafka all this

00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:41,860
month that's because why told us not to

00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:43,210
do it so I'm doing it but so Kafka is an

00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:45,940
interesting character in relation to all

00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:47,950
this because basically Kafka told his

00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:51,070
best friend max broad to burn all of his

00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:53,260
writings before he died and max brought

00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:55,660
I was reading my copy of the trial and

00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:57,940
in the or America and in the preface it

00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:00,010
says like yeah it shows the letter where

00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,540
cut where he's like please burn all my

00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:05,080
stuff and I'm like well I'm holding it

00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:06,820
now good job max but so it's the same

00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,650
thing right like why told like why

00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:10,870
deleted all his stuff but it came back

00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:13,180
so in a section about like talking about

00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:14,170
Kafka stuff there's this sort of self

00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:16,630
referenced in there which is really

00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:17,710
great and one other part is this is

00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,910
where my favorite quotes the entire

00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:21,190
thing is down here at the bottom

00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:23,800
reality's kind of a medium may be

00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:25,870
greater than paper and so this is like

00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,280
also part of the reason why there's a

00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:29,110
struggle with identity right is like

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,390
once you start pretending to be someone

00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:33,370
else who's not real and you do it all

00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:35,680
the time to everyone at what point do

00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:37,810
you disappear into this fake person and

00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:40,180
at what point does the persona you take

00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:41,650
on become your like reality and it's

00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,300
also sort of like an artwork in and of

00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:45,700
itself right like every time you were

00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:47,590
acting is this person you were you know

00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,330
doing some of this artwork so there's

00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:53,590
that whole chunk of section 2 that's

00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:55,330
really super good ok so this relates to

00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:58,360
impermanence right so Kafka burning all

00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:59,710
his papers why disappearing this is sort

00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,000
of this quote that he tweeted right

00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,590
before he disappeared and now it makes

00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,419
sense after reading this thing

00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:08,740
America was only written for the 32-bit

00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:10,210
PowerPC which is a Kafka novel and so

00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:14,350
we'll talk about what that means in a

00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:17,650
second so page 23 I'm not gonna read

00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:19,150
nearly as much of this but basically he

00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,770
finished reading his books for the month

00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:22,900
like reading all the Kafka and said I

00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:24,940
finished early I was done I was

00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,799
decimated to program anymore was

00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:28,570
pointless my programs would never live

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,580
as long as the trial a computer will

00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:31,990
never live as long as the trial hadn't

00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,120
he told max broad to destroy all this

00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:36,039
books he said burn the my friend or in

00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:38,020
these books but look he was America

00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:39,370
thoroughly reconstructed so one of the

00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,169
big deals that why has this week's

00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:43,510
trouble with is the fact that in our our

00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:46,120
like March for Progress means that we

00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:47,649
also lose all sense of history which

00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,029
makes it really hard to have those meta

00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:52,000
narratives about where we're going and

00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:53,620
what we're doing because like we don't

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,029
have any sort of institutional memory

00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,260
and we're really bad at transferring

00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:58,570
lessons we've learned to the next

00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,919
generation of programmers so his point

00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:01,779
about if America had been written for

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,429
the PowerPC is that like if America was

00:21:01,779 --> 00:21:05,049
a computer program instead of a book and

00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:07,570
it was written for an architecture that

00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:09,940
is outdated you wouldn't need someone to

00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:13,000
burn the book you would just let it

00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:15,610
atrophy and bit rot and it goes away on

00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,380
its own oh you know I don't have the

00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:20,110
first couple programs I wrote as a child

00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:22,480
I have a printout of some of the things

00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:23,950
that I you know did which is also kind

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,779
of funny too because why is whole

00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,490
blogging printer thing right it's like I

00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:30,159
was like man I'm so lucky I even have a

00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:31,929
printer still but like he needed one to

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,490
fully experience this going out because

00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:35,020
like we've moved on we don't need

00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:37,179
printers anymore for the most part right

00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:39,309
so even like the medium in which this is

00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:43,000
happening is this like you know

00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:45,039
impermanence and so I've discovered this

00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,279
about myself about go I've been like I'm

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,720
a super go hater and like I realized

00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:51,700
that it's actually more about me than it

00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,779
is about go because if you just came to

00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,909
programming through Ruby or JavaScript

00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:56,860
and you used go for the first time you

00:21:54,909 --> 00:21:58,659
would be like this is amazing it's just

00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:00,130
when I'm like okay Mel said structural

00:21:58,659 --> 00:22:01,630
subtyping for twenty years why is that

00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:03,340
cool and go

00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:04,480
remember when you all said that Java was

00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,039
really boring and that's why it was

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,600
terrible and now you're saying but go is

00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:10,179
really boring and that's why it's good I

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,649
don't understand this is fine but like

00:22:10,179 --> 00:22:13,480
I've come to realize that I'm an old man

00:22:11,649 --> 00:22:15,580
and I've like seen all this history go

00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,100
by and we haven't like every time I have

00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,809
a problem

00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,490
I do some research on the literature and

00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:21,740
someone wrote a paper in the 60s like

00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:23,210
saying how it works right like there's

00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:25,580
so much of computer science that was

00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:27,890
solved in that like late 50s to early

00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:32,390
70s era that we just totally like ignore

00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:33,559
completely so yeah so impermanence in

00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:36,740
the way that our industry is is like

00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:40,910
that Foote Island is a super ridiculous

00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:42,679
last part here page 71 and 92 so the

00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:45,559
last whole chunk of this the last like

00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:48,830
20 pages or 30 pages is actually this

00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:51,350
really ridiculous allegory about a cult

00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:54,020
that looks like Steve Jobs and they wear

00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:56,059
turtlenecks and black air and jeans and

00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:57,650
they speak this like French that's not

00:22:56,059 --> 00:23:01,309
actually French it's like half French

00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:03,289
and it's really trippy and like it's

00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:06,140
good but it's it's just giant metaphor

00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:07,760
so he's first talks about Bill Gates

00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:09,830
versus Steve Jobs and how there's like

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:13,850
this titans of industry that go back and

00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:15,650
forth and you know these were but two

00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:17,690
sides of the same coin the rich computer

00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:19,880
guys of late 20th century commemorative

00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:21,530
coin they represented all those rags to

00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:25,190
riches ideals that so intoxicated in our

00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:26,630
society and so this like comparison goes

00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:28,760
back and forth and then he skips to this

00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:31,429
job stuff and so what's funny about the

00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:40,880
job stuff of 92 is the other page here

00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:43,400
so yeah none of them speak any Frette

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,169
anything except this broken french and

00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,820
this guy shows up and this is where why

00:23:45,169 --> 00:23:48,380
it's like really sarcastic about the

00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,940
state of our industry as well so if it's

00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,620
impermanent and always changing and

00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:55,100
never staying the same the other thing

00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:57,799
too is this I'm Paul Allen he said of

00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,419
Microsoft hello I said feebly I'm a

00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:00,230
wealthy powerful man in this region and

00:23:59,419 --> 00:24:02,450
also in the world

00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,650
beloved by some hated by others he

00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,100
adjusted his glasses and took out his

00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,230
wallet

00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:08,840
I am eccentric he said and gave me two

00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:10,460
$100 bills and I spend my money and

00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,960
freely and unpredictably but often on

00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,039
things that improve life for everyone in

00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,530
ways that are not immediately obvious

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,760
but will ultimately benefit us why did

00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:19,669
you give this to me I said holding out

00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:22,309
the bill to bills the bill I just need a

00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:23,750
ride I'm usually 10 to 20 years ahead of

00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:25,730
the curve he said most people say about

00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:27,470
13 and I won't lie that does ring true

00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:29,030
to me he'd been motioning with his

00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:30,020
wallet but he put it away you're a man

00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,580
who's learned English despite

00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:34,790
the pressures of the crowd consider this

00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:36,560
me investing in you elsewhere he says

00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:37,910
this thing where he's like other people

00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,380
struggle with large questions about

00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:42,890
their lives but what I struggle with is

00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:44,570
my hatred of entrepreneurs and so

00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:46,280
there's this whole thing too about like

00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:48,830
that our industry is super obsessed with

00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:51,320
this like investment startups making

00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:55,790
money shenanigans and like we've lost

00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:58,190
all the parts about craft so that's also

00:24:55,790 --> 00:25:00,290
a big part of it too with why his

00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:01,370
disappearance if you notice like for

00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,050
those of you have been around in a while

00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:04,310
we don't get blog posts and conference

00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:05,960
talks that are like look at this cool

00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,920
weird wacky thing I did with Ruby

00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,270
anymore right

00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,980
and part of this is cuz we've explored

00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:11,810
the problem space and like you know way

00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:13,160
back when ruby was new that was like new

00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:14,750
and exciting and interesting but now

00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:17,240
we're just busy making money with our

00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:19,820
agile social mobile rails applications

00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,980
right and so we sort of lost a lot of

00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:25,520
that like spark and interestingness and

00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:26,840
like weirdness that we used to have and

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,620
so that's also one of the reasons why it

00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:32,540
was time for Y to go so what happened

00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:35,210
and where is y the biggest thing is this

00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:40,750
disclaimer on page 13 which pretty much

00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:44,720
straight up exactly says what happens so

00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:46,400
the first thing is that he says please

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,080
forgive any distortion in the text it's

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,360
quite perilous to communicate this way

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,490
and so like this to me speaks of like

00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,110
this dangerousness of RIA taking on that

00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:55,520
persona briefly right like if this is

00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:58,220
causing him all this stress and trouble

00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:00,260
like readapting the persona is dangerous

00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,970
and that's why he also did it via this

00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:03,650
text medium instead of coming out and

00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:05,440
like giving a talk or posting some audio

00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:07,460
or video like communicating this way

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,870
anyway here's that here's the paragraph

00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:11,060
this is the most important and this was

00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:12,920
so good for me personally as well but

00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:14,210
now I want to make it perfectly clear

00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,950
that in these papers and all my other

00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:18,080
works in life belong to the general

00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:20,270
public in fact I would also like to turn

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,950
myself over to all of you as well this

00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:23,780
was actually done several years ago but

00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:25,220
an embarrassingly disorganized manner I

00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,480
like what you've done with the character

00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:28,010
but I want to step into his tattered

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,440
suit for the next hundred pages and

00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:32,330
after that I'm yours again do what you

00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:36,860
must I always enjoy seeing what becomes

00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:37,910
with me so first of all this is like

00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,740
super vague right because I talked about

00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:41,720
my own crisis about what I should do

00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:43,820
with why stuff and if it's okay or not

00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:46,369
and so to hear why I say that it is okay

00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:49,970
in fact maybe good was like super super

00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:52,159
good for me but beyond that this also

00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:55,429
speaks to the fact that like why is more

00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:57,889
of a mindset or a persona than he is the

00:26:55,429 --> 00:26:59,899
person and so we should all as he says

00:26:57,889 --> 00:27:01,519
he wants to give him itself back to us

00:26:59,899 --> 00:27:04,190
like we should be taking on the persona

00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:07,070
of why every so often because it is good

00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:09,139
and useful and interesting and so in a

00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:12,139
certain sense why is not dead why is

00:27:09,139 --> 00:27:14,539
just different and why is like everyone

00:27:12,139 --> 00:27:16,580
not just one person right we had one guy

00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:18,409
who was really good at performing why

00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:20,239
but like he doesn't want to do it

00:27:18,409 --> 00:27:22,789
anymore so if we want Y to stick around

00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:25,460
we need to keep performing Y and not

00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:27,619
burden one person with so much being why

00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:28,879
right if Jonathan came back to Ruby

00:27:27,619 --> 00:27:31,700
today do you think that we would allow

00:27:28,879 --> 00:27:33,859
him to be Jonathan like if you saw a

00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,690
commit from him in some logs like

00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:37,279
where's the wacky joke why aren't you

00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:39,409
being silly why I like come on what's

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:42,139
going on like you couldn't actually be

00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:44,450
himself because he was already someone

00:27:42,139 --> 00:27:45,470
else instead around all of us this

00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:46,940
happens to me with anyone who has a

00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:50,419
public persona when they don't want to

00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:52,039
be that persona anymore and then

00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:53,269
fighting null I won't cite this for you

00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:54,470
because I'm running a little long which

00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:56,239
is good because I want to make sure to

00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:58,159
fill it all up but one of the big things

00:27:56,239 --> 00:28:00,649
that Y talked about being really

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,059
terrible was this fighting null over and

00:28:00,649 --> 00:28:03,080
over and over again so he's like no was

00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:04,759
the biggest problem I had as a

00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,289
programmer right because you like get

00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:07,549
this error and it's never where the

00:28:06,289 --> 00:28:09,950
error actually happens it's always

00:28:07,549 --> 00:28:11,330
somewhere else and like to me this also

00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:13,039
speaks about the permanence thing right

00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:14,239
cuz again to bring up go briefly like

00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,369
I'm like why would you make a language

00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:17,809
with null pointers today right the guy

00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:19,909
who invented the concept of null calls

00:28:17,809 --> 00:28:21,710
it my billion dollar mistake he liked

00:28:19,909 --> 00:28:23,419
things that is tragic and terrible and

00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:25,429
it causes so many problems but because

00:28:23,419 --> 00:28:28,070
of our impermanence and because of our

00:28:25,429 --> 00:28:29,450
lack of like passing on the torch we

00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:31,549
still build new programming languages of

00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:33,289
null but he talked about this being

00:28:31,549 --> 00:28:35,570
super ridiculously frustrating and it's

00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:38,119
very humanizing especially if you hold

00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:40,009
like people in great regard like we do

00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:41,929
with why to see him struggle with

00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:43,429
something is really interesting and

00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:45,440
useful one of the reasons why I enjoy

00:28:43,429 --> 00:28:46,820
teaching beginners I just got done

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,220
teaching high school kids for six weeks

00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:51,799
is that like you don't know how much you

00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:52,820
know and remember and working with

00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:54,590
someone who does not understand what a

00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:56,389
variable is really makes you appreciate

00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:58,220
the days whenever you're feeling really

00:28:56,389 --> 00:29:00,320
terrible about

00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:03,680
and struggling with some gem that I

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,240
probably wrote as bad Doc's anyway so

00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,800
moving on where do we go from here I

00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,840
sort of touched this really briefly but

00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:11,270
like we need to take the persona on now

00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,920
it's done like that Jonathan is done

00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:14,300
with it and is like giving it to us as a

00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:17,000
present and so we need to make sure to

00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:19,430
keep it spirit alive amongst everyone

00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,720
and so that's really important I've been

00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:23,450
doing this talk recently about

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,250
irresponsible Ruby I think this is like

00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:27,020
part of it but also it's just like

00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:28,520
allowing ourselves the freedom to be

00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:31,280
silly and innovate and mess with things

00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:33,590
and and be weird and like be ourselves

00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:39,110
and not just like money-making machines

00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:42,050
which we all are as well so I didn't

00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:46,330
manage this super super spoil it but I'm

00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:46,330
going to now so at the end the very end

00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:56,030
this is I cried

00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:57,830
softly trembling unable to take the

00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:59,630
pencil from him but unable to let go I

00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:01,610
cried all the tears that I had and I

00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:04,160
resolved to say it with conviction this

00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:06,320
is time well spent I said it's biting my

00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:10,670
lip tasting my own salt at that point I

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:12,830
must have died and then there's this

00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:14,150
last page which has some writing that

00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:15,920
you can't really make out that's about

00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:17,570
the fact that he did not actually die

00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:24,350
but you can't quite tell because there's

00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:25,760
this hand covering the way so anyway I

00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:30,460
think this is true and then it

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:30,460
definitely was time well spent so thanks

00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,910
you

00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,440
