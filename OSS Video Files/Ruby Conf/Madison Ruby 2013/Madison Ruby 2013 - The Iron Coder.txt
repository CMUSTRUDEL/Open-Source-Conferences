uh you guys ready for some iron coder

00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:24,490
action I feel like this is like at right

00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:27,070
thing to say but no matter whoever wins

00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:28,420
or loses it took a lot of strength of

00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:39,220
character to participate in this event

00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:41,980
so whatever words all right our expert

00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:43,660
judges who are currently being

00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:49,000
distracted by the fact that you can see

00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:57,850
this image on the back side too first we

00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:05,409
have friendly whoo red is the CTO of

00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:07,330
ANOVA up next we have Margaret pagal you

00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:11,650
saw her earlier she is the director of

00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:15,689
sales look at that job she just did

00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:19,149
selling herself and last but not least

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:27,490
Ryan's m spider Davis from Seattle RB

00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:30,189
whoo now your judges have all been given

00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:34,390
access to either the application the

00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:46,390
code or both and it looks like maybe

00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:47,560
even notes have happened so the uh let's

00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:50,049
put it on this other table where

00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,689
everyone can see uh-huh no no it's

00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:56,770
beyond the last is fine alright so our

00:01:52,689 --> 00:02:00,789
oh let's put it I got it sorry alright

00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:05,170
so team number one is going to be the

00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:09,359
challenging team correct yes indeed Zack

00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:09,359
Moneypenny and Jeff Casimir

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:25,180
hey Wes I understand you're in the

00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:28,209
middle of something can you give us five

00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:30,129
minutes on the clock they'll have fun

00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:35,500
that's gone we're going to need five

00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:41,799
minutes on the clock yes or you could

00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:45,370
speak into the podium yep all right so

00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:47,859
we started we kind of you know music we

00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:50,200
thought a few different things went in

00:02:47,859 --> 00:02:55,139
took the first 30 or 45 minutes to kind

00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:58,150
of sit down think about well is it music

00:02:55,139 --> 00:03:00,760
enter or create music with it may be

00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:03,579
something that will just fetch a

00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:07,180
playlist from a website and display in a

00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:09,069
window but as we kind of listed out some

00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,950
high-level ideas and kind of tech phone

00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:14,049
back to the idea of game and it was like

00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:18,760
well okay so what kind of game would it

00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:20,709
be a game that incorporates music being

00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,889
that i was already pressed for time and

00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:25,180
felt terrified i went all but i regress

00:03:23,889 --> 00:03:31,889
all the way back to when I was three

00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:35,410
years old and thought about Simon yeah

00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:37,510
that and then I fast forwarded like 25

00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:40,060
years and thought well then make

00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:42,519
like at our hero I mean things we flying

00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,500
from the top got hit things at the right

00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:47,669
time match them up and then looked at

00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,669
the shoes a yacht and

00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:54,030
that so let's let's play through game

00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:59,230
wait there's more by which I mean I

00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:09,670
could wait for the job jvm as we did for

00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:11,710
most of the four hours have you yeah so

00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:13,270
when I say thinking we did I mean just

00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:15,040
there's some would have been a much

00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:17,290
better here to actually manage the

00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,790
creation of sequences in the comparison

00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:23,190
of the fleeing sequence versus what the

00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:25,870
generate sequence easy to manage vs

00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:28,050
already employee but at the same time we

00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:30,520
have to battle the old colors and

00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:33,409
rewarding puts and match those up so

00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:37,999
basically I started from the top down

00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:41,360
providing layouts recap mining and

00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:43,969
refactoring elements in vent dispatchers

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,899
and things like that and kind of just

00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:49,309
left it there so that when bottom that

00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:59,419
we have something that ok now we have

00:05:49,309 --> 00:06:01,129
notes so we had like notes in sequence

00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:04,959
primitives that would be then follow

00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:04,959
along inclined to these

00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:12,099
bind to these UI objects and so that you

00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:14,509
could not only play Simon but could also

00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:19,009
play cupid how do you like a hammer a

00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:22,580
bit worn it's for key piano bar and yeah

00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:24,770
this is a great p 1 i'm either we have

00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:31,399
tons of ideas or anyone would I so

00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:33,499
acquire us no I some ads on the side

00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:36,289
there and maybe like when you get above

00:06:33,499 --> 00:06:38,300
eight cos if you'd like to reach the

00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:43,969
market of five year olds who can't

00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:47,659
tolerate and configure the JVM install

00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:51,499
shoes JRuby 1.6 now when i said i was at

00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:54,169
work Jamie 1.74 and then you just gotta

00:06:51,499 --> 00:06:55,279
go in and run the whole thing and bam no

00:06:54,169 --> 00:07:02,719
you gotta run it from the shoes

00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:04,939
directory though oh yeah yeah you stop

00:07:02,719 --> 00:07:06,740
20 jams I mean but no in the end in

00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:14,209
other words one gym but we loved working

00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:16,399
with me meet us I was gonna say I'm good

00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:21,139
in the end is it important I mean we're

00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:25,269
talking about children they need to

00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:25,269
learn Chavez awful time to rate test

00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:59,870
mysterious the test suite place me so

00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,870
now we're going to

00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:42,740
there's a financial game

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:30,600
it was a game I saw a lot of different

00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:34,339
uses for it outside just what you show

00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:37,529
here in multitude of different

00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:41,670
opportunities not only gain but using it

00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:44,130
in an educational setting I like the

00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:48,510
keyboard input I like the mouse input

00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:52,260
like the color input I thought guys did

00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:53,880
a really good job it wasn't once I

00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,279
understood how to use it it wasn't

00:10:53,880 --> 00:11:00,630
difficult at all certainly held my

00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:03,990
attention and it didn't hurt after about

00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:06,420
10 minutes and talking of edge gently

00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:09,440
didn't start sell it with the awesome

00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,440
commitment I'm in sales

00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:43,399
the object decomposition was great

00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:43,399
actually functionality

00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:03,669
some things I didn't like someone did

00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:12,600
not use his normal tools so you wanna

00:12:03,669 --> 00:12:12,600
mixing spaces oh wait it down

00:12:26,089 --> 00:13:02,339
no exit lectern you get lost points now

00:12:53,310 --> 00:13:05,130
that I throw that so quick story Wes

00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:07,860
actually taught me that we're standing

00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:11,610
on the podium the lectern is with the

00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:15,320
laptop think about it at the Olympics

00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:15,320
they stand on podiums

00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:34,450
but does it they totally it turns out

00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:36,430
yesterday just fine okay all right coder

00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:37,990
you have five minutes all right so first

00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:39,430
of all what I really wanted to build is

00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,740
this game of an obsessed lately called

00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:45,670
re rain but then I realized that there's

00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:47,020
no touch so like you punch these little

00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:49,540
things I've been doing it here's what's

00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:51,280
important about RiRi of though this is

00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:54,700
my friend Z Zach took this video he

00:14:51,280 --> 00:15:01,060
playing this and he tweeted like ll

00:14:54,700 --> 00:15:03,520
Skrillex this year oh it's not showing

00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:05,700
up so actual Skrillex like this on

00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,700
Instagram

00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:13,930
but unfortunately no touch screen on

00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,980
this and i do not have like ruby motion

00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:18,910
or any of the things with you I life

00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:21,730
stuff so none of that so Franklin enjoys

00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:24,690
making lots of music and has this things

00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:27,610
I want to use like what what I should go

00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:30,820
recently I had learned or I'm running

00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:32,410
happening and the alternatives like the

00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,750
software that's available nowadays is

00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:36,700
easily like one like ableton live the

00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:38,410
Chinese at the very minute is a hundred

00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,970
dollars we're thinking about children

00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,950
that might want to make music and want

00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:44,170
to get into music and start learning how

00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:47,920
to play beats put together sequences and

00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:49,329
enjoy just secure the excitement even

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,089
putting together so many symbols like a

00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:53,440
little art panel yeah something like

00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:55,000
that would be exciting and interesting

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,300
for them perhaps it could be the next

00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,550
big apple so what we wanted was to

00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:03,370
create a digital audio workstation that

00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:05,140
was minimal on features and able to

00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,850
provide enjoyment to allow individuals

00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:10,480
to create the very simple sequence of

00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:12,250
meats and perhaps put together tom yeah

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,589
so if you haven't seen one of these

00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:18,459
things basically the columns are the

00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:20,709
beets with a Z and then the rows are the

00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:23,829
sounds so you can like pick different

00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:25,540
things to play different times and you

00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:28,560
know all that is good and then basically

00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,560
when you hit the start button

00:16:36,449 --> 00:16:44,369
I got to plug this part into computers

00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:46,889
are probably all right so and we also

00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:49,829
have this loop button which has a little

00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:51,480
loop emoji there but when you look at

00:16:49,829 --> 00:17:14,610
basically we'll just keep going forever

00:16:51,480 --> 00:17:21,480
boo boo with anarchy and I saw you with

00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:23,339
Ke$ha um yeah so in in the true you know

00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,139
I guess so I would say this other team

00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:30,990
was kind of team talking trash but we're

00:17:25,139 --> 00:17:32,549
Team saying nice things we because of

00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:34,019
our minimal feature set and the fact

00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:35,490
that we put this thing together so

00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:37,320
quickly we were actually able to not

00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:39,799
only go eat lunch but by the other team

00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,799
lunch

00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:51,060
how was your burger down after a long we

00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:55,470
meant the food we just wanted to make

00:17:51,060 --> 00:18:04,800
sure goat went down well so there was

00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:07,050
that too I also yeah we did not we did

00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,910
not write any tests but i did use two

00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:10,410
spaces because even though i'm terrible

00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:14,670
at him that's the first thing i set up

00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:15,930
every single time so is that too but we

00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:17,100
did have to dig into probably the

00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:19,650
hardest thing about this is that we

00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,810
actually in order to get sounds to play

00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:23,670
at the same times and stuff which like

00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:25,650
kind of still sort of semi works as you

00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:28,170
heard but is a little flaky we actually

00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:32,190
had to like call into java from the

00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:34,110
JRuby you know ap is so Peter Cooper was

00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:36,450
actually like porting a game and notch

00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:38,460
made for one of the love them dare

00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,540
contests and so we were able a look at

00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,790
some of that code looks of Java

00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:45,390
tutorials and like cross our eyes and

00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:47,670
get the like jruby java ee stuff so this

00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:49,050
actually like preload this entire board

00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:51,180
with sounds and loops through them and

00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:52,950
spins up separate threads and then plays

00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,630
the songs in the threads this is going

00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:56,790
on so even though it looks simple there

00:18:54,630 --> 00:19:00,750
is some complication involved the

00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:02,280
natural stuff oh yeah so so the idea

00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:04,620
would be we would continue to build this

00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:07,470
application to allow individuals to

00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:09,330
create music have fun and laugh like we

00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:12,360
could after we got this initial sound

00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:15,900
board up also I i wrote docs for

00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:17,520
everything so you know i'm surprised it

00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,870
actually describes what we did it and

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,000
also the things that we wanted to do in

00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:22,680
the future because you know and like

00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,050
most docs this comment is actually now

00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:28,770
wrong because i fix this two minutes

00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:29,230
before the submission the card screwed

00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:32,890
up

00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:35,790
it gets out of sync so that's it's all I

00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:35,790
got so nice

00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:51,650
Thank You time as long as any i wish i

00:19:48,380 --> 00:20:06,230
was like what ya get out of here ready

00:19:51,650 --> 00:20:13,130
judges so first of all I like very

00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:15,620
classic I admit that the biggest test

00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:29,990
that i played in this team was really

00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:36,860
just keeping him off twitter i try to

00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:38,090
this one and so there's actually picture

00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,220
you guys I'm sure that I thought was

00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:43,130
interesting on while it's fun you can

00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:46,039
change the buttons and it will actually

00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:47,750
react to your changes right so it's not

00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:50,690
like kind of move this way to wear

00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:57,440
casually diversification

00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:59,990
I really liked it I can definitely see a

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:07,550
market for it you know in the DJ world

00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:21,260
but I also it's a babysitter or a lot of

00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:23,180
months doesn't need babysitter's the

00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:26,510
only thing that really kind of

00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:29,690
frustrated me on it was if you found a

00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:32,750
pattern or passively really light there

00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:35,840
was no way to identify you know maybe

00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:38,570
I'm you know two columns over six rolls

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,940
down kind of thing so many icons in

00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:51,190
different positions might actually be a

00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:51,190
good idea from I don't understand point

00:21:53,950 --> 00:22:01,490
while he didn't have tests or really

00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:06,130
much object and composition I think you

00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:06,130
did an amazing job doing more with less

00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:13,940
ability of the app is very functional a

00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:17,030
lot I've actually used for these both

00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:19,010
physically and software and nailed it

00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:25,220
and you did that with half the

00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:27,020
complexity of the other out because you

00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:29,000
didn't have the object composition that

00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:33,400
codes a little Messier and harder to

00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,400
follow but it was still very

00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:53,450
thank you at this point our competitors

00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:58,070
are all going to be taken by Jim back to

00:22:53,450 --> 00:23:00,800
our soundproof rooms will give them just

00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:03,560
a minute to get back there and then I'll

00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:05,600
get the brother our judges will

00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,430
have their deliberations and we will

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:26,810
determine who will be the first annual

00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:33,740
iron I don't know it work can you hear

00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:36,590
me still back there I know like David

00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:40,730
summer fun but we just need to make sure

00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:56,270
that they can hear what's like it'd be

00:23:40,730 --> 00:24:03,650
cool we're good Robert alrighty let the

00:23:56,270 --> 00:24:05,360
judgment begin explanation then final

00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,630
deliberation or no what do you what do

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,630
you people think

00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:44,389
well it's not ironed answer those I

00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:47,929
think okay why um actually you already

00:24:44,389 --> 00:24:51,469
know can you get so high she got a sneak

00:24:47,929 --> 00:24:53,719
peek into this but if you already know I

00:24:51,469 --> 00:24:57,919
don't think he was going let's go get

00:24:53,719 --> 00:25:09,440
them actually surprisingly they're very

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:11,629
nervous what would you do or do you know

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:25,879

00:25:11,629 --> 00:25:31,440

back for that burrs like it may re-enter

00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:58,259
the arena before you tell us the scores

00:25:56,399 --> 00:25:59,730

00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:02,240
