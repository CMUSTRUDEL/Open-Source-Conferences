00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:37,649
so I wanted to talk to you guys about

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,260
how to improve your organization using

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:42,479
improv a lot of times people here improv

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,860
and they're like I have no idea what

00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,649
that has anything to do with what I'm

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,170
learning or what I'm doing at work and

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:51,989
so I wanted to survey you and ask you

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,949
when you hear improv what does it mean

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:59,100
to you so shout it out what does it mean

00:00:54,949 --> 00:01:04,650
drama class comedy what else thinking on

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:10,829
your feet say yes what yes Colin Mochrie

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:14,130
listening and being open up there yeah I

00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:15,810
love you um yeah so it's all these

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,689
things a lot of times when i go to

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,250
organizations truthfully especially when

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:22,710
i'm working with developers they are

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:26,250
petrified that I'm coming and I'm very

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:28,500
aware of that um however it is my job to

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,120
win them over in about two minutes or

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,610
else they're probably want to kill me

00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,830
and throw me out the window so improv

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,210
yeah so a lot of people have these ideas

00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:38,490
of what they think it means and that

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,020
it's directly related to comedy and

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,479
being on stage and whose line is it

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:47,670
anyway and it is those things it's also

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:49,500
a lot of other things as well so I am

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,740
the owner of the improv effect I started

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,500
my company about six years ago and I

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:59,760
work worldwide with all sorts of

00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:04,770
companies big small whatever um I love

00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:06,720
that you're here um and yeah so and I i

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,780
go to companies and I help them either

00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,730
communicate better or I help them with

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:15,689
innovation so thinking differently um

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:18,390
and yeah so here's a couple pictures

00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:20,489
this is an ideation I did a couple weeks

00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,110
ago with a company like the company from

00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:25,829
up in the air where they fire people for

00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:29,040
a living so that was fun um not um and

00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:30,920
so they wanted like how do we rebrand

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,470
ourselves how do we not be like

00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,170
bummer company that comes in and you

00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:37,849
hate us so we ran them through a couple

00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,500
days of ideation and got them to think

00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:42,530
differently and we used improv to do

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:44,780
that and then this is a group of

00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:47,060
trainers at an investment bank and they

00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:48,800
wanted help using improv to help them

00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:52,819
actually trained better and make their

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,770
training more experiential and more fun

00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:58,010
and make it stick because they did it

00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:59,660
and so I i did a fun exercise with them

00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,860
about an unusable product which some of

00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:04,010
you have done that if I've worked with

00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:07,940
your company um and then where's waldo

00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:09,680
um and so this is how I was like the

00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,299
weirdest pictures of me which I'm sure

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,459
is not surprising to you at all um and

00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:15,319
so this was them picking out their

00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:17,330
objectives for their team they wanted to

00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:20,780
figure out like what is their team

00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:22,340
really behind and and so we worked on

00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:26,269
this exercise to kind of figure out what

00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:28,370
is that together so anyway so improv is

00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:30,590
something that you can use to remove

00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:31,970
barriers and it's because you're having

00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:35,239
a shared experience and you're laughing

00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:37,790
and constantly laughing actually breaks

00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:40,310
down a lot of walls so it's actually

00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:42,650
very helpful um the first thing I want

00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:44,450
to talk about is building a troop okay

00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,880
so I'm going to talk about how I build

00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:49,040
my troop of improvisers because i have a

00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,970
group of improvisers we do shows about

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,380
twice a month um and we do shows kind of

00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:56,660
like whose line is it anyway so short

00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:59,959
form and when i'm looking to build a

00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:03,019
troop i have to look for important

00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:06,380
things so I'm looking for the type of

00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:08,780
person who understands the good of the

00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:11,870
whole group they have in us mentality

00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,489
meaning they are not divas okay and I

00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:15,170
think that you guys can relate to this

00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:17,060
when you're working with somebody on

00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:19,250
your team who has a very diva type of

00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,950
personality it really derails it doesn't

00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:23,930
matter if they're amazing developer they

00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,760
derail it because their personality gets

00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,350
in the way right and that's the same

00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,120
thing when I'm putting together a troop

00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:31,310
of people who are going to perform I

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,220
need these people who are very much have

00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,750
this team mentality I'm also looking for

00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:39,349
a group of people who have diverse

00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,820
talents okay I don't want all the same

00:04:39,349 --> 00:04:43,190
type of people with all the same

00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,100
experiences I want very different people

00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:46,140
so that when we play

00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,610
all these different games we succeeded

00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,380
them all because we're stronger because

00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:51,210
of all of our diversity and our

00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,890
different experiences and I think that

00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:55,320
that is something that you guys are

00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:58,140
looking for as well and I've seen

00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,900
products actually that it's very clear

00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:03,840
that they've all been made by like a 20

00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,730
something year old man and so it would

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,800
help them to have some sort of you know

00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:09,390
diverse group working through that

00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,460
product together and I think it would

00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:13,710
make their product much stronger I look

00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,940
at my improv troupe as our product you

00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:17,070
know that we're performing and we're

00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,300
iterating based on what we get called

00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,620
out from the audience and seeing if it

00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,190
works and if it doesn't we go in another

00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,540
direction the other thing is that I want

00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,730
a group of people who aren't afraid to

00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,770
be vulnerable and they're able to try

00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:30,000
new things and part of that is as a

00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,320
director you need to set up an

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,230
environment for that right you can't

00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:37,290
just expect people to be okay with being

00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:38,670
vulnerable but it is important you want

00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,290
people on your team who are willing to

00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:42,840
be vulnerable because the creativity

00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:44,760
comes from vulnerability and then the

00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,430
last thing is I want people who know

00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,410
when to lead and when to follow so these

00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,910
people clearly are aware they're

00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:52,170
self-aware and they're aware of others

00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,550
and they know where their strengths and

00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:55,410
weaknesses lie and they know when to

00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:57,210
play what part and so they're not the

00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:59,610
kind of people who plough over everybody

00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,870
else to get their point across they know

00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,220
that there might be somebody else on

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,350
their team who has the strength and

00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,560
that's what we currently need so does

00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:09,630
that make sense yeah all right awesome

00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,450
thank you gnome all right so these are

00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:16,830
my crazy people this is my troupe um we

00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:19,350
jump around a lot um and like I said we

00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:21,150
do shows twice a month and we also

00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:23,130
sometimes we get asked to do corporate

00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,110
commercials so this is us we were asked

00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:28,140
to do a commercial about the world's

00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:30,510
worst internship and we did a series of

00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:32,820
sketches on the sky in the front the

00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:34,080
redhead he was the world's worst intern

00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,190
at the world's worst internship and

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,290
we're all the people that worked with

00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:39,000
him and so we were not very happy with

00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,740
him and making fools of ourselves in

00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,980
corporate America which is very fun to

00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,150
do so I want to tell you a story and I'm

00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,620
going to relate the story it's also

00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,510
going to be interactive because there's

00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,130
no way I can do a talk without it being

00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:54,630
interactive so just for you to be

00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:56,100
prepared um so we do shows okay and at

00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,950
the end of our show like I said we do

00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:01,250
short form

00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:03,560
and we liked this game called worst date

00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,360
and so what we'll do is we'll ask the

00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,160
eyes will say has anybody had a really

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,810
terrible date and usually somebody

00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,010
raises their hand because usually you

00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,380
know there's somebody who's had a rotten

00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:14,330
day at least at least one and so this

00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:17,270
night we had this girl named Emily come

00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:18,950
up and so she comes up and I'm the host

00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,570
so I started interviewing her and I'm

00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:22,910
asking her all these questions to kind

00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:24,770
of get as much detail about her as I can

00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,360
while I'm doing this the rest of my

00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,940
troop is in the background and they're

00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:32,450
really listening they're being hyper

00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:34,670
like using active listening skills right

00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:36,830
so they're listening not only to what

00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:38,810
she's saying but they're also listening

00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:40,700
to what she's doing and her quirks so

00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,500
they're watching her they're picking up

00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,060
on everything so I start interviewing

00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,000
Emily and I say Emily so when was your

00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,710
date and she said oh I was in college it

00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,780
was a terrible and I was like oh did you

00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:52,640
live on the dorms and she's like what

00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:55,490
did I live on the dorms and I'm like

00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:58,400
nevermind i mean in the dorm so clearly

00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:00,260
i had failed I people do not live on the

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,110
dorm at least I didn't think so um and

00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:04,520
so this brings me to the first exercise

00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:06,920
we're going to do which is called

00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,720
failure high five okay so what I want

00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:11,630
you do is with the person next to you I

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,820
would like you to share a mistake that

00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:17,000
you've made either today this morning

00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:19,790
while you were dancing with me or this

00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,320
week any time at all and I want you to

00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,480
share with the person next to you each

00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:26,000
of you share one mistake at least unless

00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:28,790
you're really open and then high-five

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,890
each other woohoo I failed okay so high

00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:32,600
five and say I failed all right mine was

00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:34,190
that I told you know this person that

00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,710
she lived on the dorms which clearly is

00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,270
ridiculous okay so go ahead and you have

00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:42,010
a couple minutes to share your failures

00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:42,010
and give them a high five go for it

00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:50,759
what was your failure I should have an

00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:56,319
hour and a half late very thirsty oh

00:08:50,759 --> 00:09:00,550
nice excellent yeah actually went to a

00:08:56,319 --> 00:09:02,380
really good I would do a really good in

00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:07,930
Harper and

00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:10,060
la us here or this year some year from a

00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:12,520
like it used to be an instructor it was

00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:15,550
quite an awesome cycling I'm much more

00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:17,170
involved than I think I am at people are

00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,290
that's the thing they don't think they

00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:23,730
don't think they are but they are like

00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:26,590
I'm barely adequately exposed to it yeah

00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:30,400
yeah exactly but you know once every two

00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:33,460
years yes totally but I love it I enjoy

00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:35,020
the art one awesome I keep thinking

00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,400
you're gonna detonate something with

00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:40,410
that I know this is really weird like a

00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:47,110
wile e coyote looking yes all right

00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:51,220
everybody admit their failures all right

00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:52,930
good um so yeah so an improv were not

00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,360
afraid we're not afraid to make mistakes

00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:57,130
we celebrate our failures and I think

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,960
this is a really important thing when

00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,760
you're putting together a group or your

00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,920
organization that you have that culture

00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,200
where you have the freedom to fail and

00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,960
that you're learning from it so let me

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,510
get back to this night so meanwhile i'm

00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:12,130
interviewing Emily I've now said that

00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,420
she accidentally lives on the dorm not

00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,620
in them and she goes through the date

00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,600
she goes to the movies it's just

00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:19,690
horrendous like it's a terrible date

00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,730
anyway not the point so um so then as

00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,970
soon as I finish interviewing her my

00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:26,860
troop comes up and they immediately

00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:28,950
reenact her date and so what you're

00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:31,810
seeing here is our sort of seeing is

00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:34,120
Sarah she's playing Emily the one in the

00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:36,730
front and then justin is playing her

00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:39,430
date ok so the scene comes up and I'm

00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:41,620
sort of like off to the side and I see

00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:43,900
Justin going like this and I'm like oh

00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:47,350
dear God so he is climbing up a ladder

00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:50,140
and I'm like great all right so he's

00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:51,930
taking the mistake okay and he's

00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:56,410
climbing up the ladder and he goes hello

00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:59,980
how come you live on the dorms Emily OH

00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:01,990
wonderful okay um so instead of freaking

00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,850
out you know this is this is hilarious

00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:06,490
and actually was like the funniest part

00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:08,769
of the whole show was this mistake okay

00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:12,190
and so what I wanted to talk to you

00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:14,889
about is how this relates to improving

00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:17,290
your culture or your organization the

00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:18,790
first thing is that in my troop we've

00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:20,649
created a very non-judgmental

00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:23,220
environment so we're okay with sort of

00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:25,779
joshing each other and being silly and

00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,069
like I told you before they were sitting

00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:28,959
back there and they were actively

00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:31,180
listening and they were being aware of

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,189
everything they did not miss a breath

00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,959
they did not miss a move a scratch of

00:11:33,189 --> 00:11:37,180
the hair anything because all of those

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:40,300
things allow us to understand that

00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:42,970
person as much as possible okay um and

00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,889
then the funny thing is we now have the

00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:47,110
scene happening which is from a

00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:49,300
completely different perspective right

00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:51,430
so nothing we had ever thought but

00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,709
because of the mistake of me saying that

00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:55,569
she lives on the dorms we have this

00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:57,819
whole new perspective and something new

00:11:55,569 --> 00:11:59,829
to explore that we wouldn't have never

00:11:57,819 --> 00:12:01,899
done have we not listened and not

00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:05,019
explored it and sort of negated it and

00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:08,949
pushed it to the side okay and improv is

00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:11,920
all about seeing mistakes as gifts so

00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:14,649
let's do another exercise all right so

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,600
this is called the two object mashup and

00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:18,399
what we're going to do is with a person

00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,949
next to you I'm going to count to three

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:25,779
and you're both going to name an object

00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:27,639
out loud okay and then you are to figure

00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:30,160
out what is this thing that we've now

00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:32,230
created these unlikely things like a

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:36,069
student living on top of a dorm was our

00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:38,019
mashup okay in this case it's shoes and

00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:39,639
an umbrella like what does that have to

00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:41,740
do with anything but I think I mean

00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:43,660
that's a great idea if you spent a lot

00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,639
of money on a good pair of shoes you

00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:49,000
don't want him to get wet so just stick

00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:50,439
some umbrellas on him obviously um so

00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,899
that's what I want you to do so you're

00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:55,089
going to a object object at the same

00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:56,829
time so so that you're not purposely

00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:58,449
fitting yours to theirs and then I'd

00:12:56,829 --> 00:13:00,699
like you to figure out explore with each

00:12:58,449 --> 00:13:02,649
other what would this be what's the good

00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:05,410
of this why would people like it who

00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:07,329
would use it all right you ready yeah so

00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,189
everybody have their partner so find

00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:09,699
your partner all right so scoot over to

00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:12,100
next

00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:20,009
but I'm forcing you to interact so sorry

00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:23,939
um all right you ready one two three go

00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:23,939
all right now talk about it

00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:35,149
30 up for a nova peppermill I actually

00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:38,749

applause for volunteering all right so

00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:50,500

00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:16,110
need to stay warm and look good yes

00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:18,600
right so we stylin elephants with the

00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:20,790
big huge skulls I like it and it keeps

00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,960

branded it too that's of course

00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:44,220
depending on their elephant personality

00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:46,440
I oh I understand great high five cuz

00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:49,530
elephants want diverse things as well

00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:52,200
alright so let's go back to this to the

00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:54,690
story alright so Justin's climbed up the

00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:57,960
ladder he's up at the top he says hi

00:16:54,690 --> 00:17:00,450
Emily how come you live on the dorm okay

00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:02,550
now she could have said I don't live on

00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:04,560
the dorm what are you talking about okay

00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:06,810
she could have said no and she could

00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,970
have negated and the scene could have

00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:12,180
just sort of died right there but

00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:14,339
instead she used the biggest philosophy

00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:16,829
of improv which is yes and and she said

00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:18,990
of course I live on the door and it's

00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:22,110
because my parents can't afford tuition

00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:25,350
so I live up here all right and so we

00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:27,720
continue the conversation and and the

00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:30,930
scene went from there and so the idea is

00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,640
that we say yes and ok that we're not

00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:34,740
just bobblehead saying yeah yeah yeah

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,630
we're not listening the and is the most

00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,580
important part and this is because we

00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:41,010
are validating the people on our team

00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:43,230
and inner organization and the and is

00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:45,870
we're adding to it ok we're coming up

00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:47,640
with something that adds and pushes an

00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:50,610
idea forward and that's what she did

00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:53,070
okay she didn't stop it in its tracks so

00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:56,220
we're gonna do another game alright so

00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:59,880
I've got a beach ball that may light up

00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:03,030
which was a surprise um but yeah so I

00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:06,000
think about yes yeah that that was a

00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:07,650
total surprise ok so we're going to

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,170
build a persona

00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:12,540
huh based on yes and and what I'm going

00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:14,970
to do is the first person that catches

00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:18,090
it is going to say the name of a made-up

00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:20,460
person ok the next person who catches it

00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:23,760
will then add one thing about that

00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:25,800
person so it might be her name is Zelda

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,590
ok and somebody else catches it yes and

00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:31,050
she has long blond hair yes and she

00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:33,180
trips over it all the time yes and she

00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:35,190
used to be a former model yes and she

00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,750
loves soup okay if we're just gonna keep

00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:39,900
adding and hopefully more clever than

00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:42,450
that was ok um what I want you to do

00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,830
though is I do not want you to get in

00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,750
your head and say I've got this really

00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:47,400
really clever idea and I can't wait to

00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,860
catch the ball and just force my idea on

00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,920
everyone what I want you to do is listen

00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:54,840
to what everybody says and stay in the

00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:57,330
moment and whatever is appropriate to

00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:00,060
say next say that and add to it so if

00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:01,800
you say that Zelda has blonde hair and

00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:04,410
two seconds later somebody says she's

00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,030
bald you better have a reason why it

00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,200
shouldn't be because you weren't

00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:08,730
listening and you thought it would be

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,700
funny for Zelda had to have blonde hair

00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:14,120

00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:22,590
when you catch the ball just if you

00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,120

goodbye ball okay alright so I hope that

00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:21,590
this is a little more clear how improv

00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:23,800
relates to actually putting together a

00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:26,450
team in an organization organization

00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:29,420
hello I didn't drink at lunch I promise

00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:30,680
um so the first first thing I want you

00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,420
remember is that laughter actually

00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:36,740
breaks down barriers and it allows

00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:38,240
people to be real with each other that

00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:40,400
it is really important that your

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,280
organization and your team is not afraid

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,020
to fail and that you see the

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,700
opportunities you don't look for

00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:48,170
opportunities you actually see them and

00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,570
there's a difference between looking for

00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:52,400
opportunities and seeing them and that

00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:54,080
mistakes are opportunities for gaining a

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,510
new perspective just like we had this

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,040
whole new scene where we were on top of

00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:59,420
the dorm and the audience fell in love

00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,890
with it because it was so different and

00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,450
nothing they had ever imagined and

00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:06,560
that's what you want when you're being

00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:09,890
innovative also that blocking gets you

00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:12,080
nowhere so if you're the kind of person

00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:13,430
who's constantly forcing your ideas on

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,170
people are not listening and telling

00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:19,310
everybody know you're really hard to

00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:22,190
work with really hard and so I would

00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:24,590
advise you to try try improv or try at

00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:26,330
least being aware of hey I'm that I'm

00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:28,190
that person that does that I'm that

00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:30,980
person that blocks things all the time

00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:36,100
and i would say instead change it and

00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:36,100
say yes and thank you

00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,880
