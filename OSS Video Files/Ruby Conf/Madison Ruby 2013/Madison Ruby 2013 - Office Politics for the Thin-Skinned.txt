Title: Madison Ruby 2013 - Office Politics for the Thin-Skinned
Publication date: 2020-01-28
Playlist: Madison Ruby 2013
Description: 
	By Justin Searls

Software projects rarely fail for technical reasons. The icky, gooey human aspects of our teams and organizations regularly present structural obstacles around which a solution simply can't be programmed. "Office politics" deserves much of the derision it receives, but every virtuous person who opts out of solving the softer problems of software effectively forfeits the organization's future to others, whether or not they're acting in good faith. Developers tend to have several disadvantages when it comes to this arena, but they can be mitigated with greater awareness and can ultimately be overcome with intelligence and leverage. In this talk we'll discuss how to gain awareness of the human systems that govern organizations and—through the use of examples and illustrations—we'll highlight the individual virtues necessary for successfully having an impact on your organization's future that's larger than yourself.

this awesome carpet has kind of gone to

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,110
waste this weekend everyone's hiding

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,250
behind the podium so I'm gonna try to

00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:24,750
stay confined in this space first one

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,640
really really glad to be here

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,200
second of all I'm here because I gave

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,360
this talk exactly once with the intent

00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,980
of only ever giving it once

00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,079
at Kalamazoo X in April which is a

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,640
fantastic nearby enough conference that

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,430
you should all consider going to next

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,500
year only because Ruby Buda up there

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,079
after I gave it so hey you should do it

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:48,420
Madison Ruby so if you love it thank him

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:51,539
and if you hate it blame him so let's

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,949
get started when I first came out of

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,590
college I was really really anxious

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:57,690
because I was convinced that my code

00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,149
sucked and that I didn't know anything

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:04,559
about building real applications and I

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:06,840
was right and my it showed so my first

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,370
manager my first technical lead pulled

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,500
me aside and they gave me this advice

00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:13,170
they said Justin you really need to grow

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,610
a thicker skin and I didn't know whether

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,620
to take that advice or not I'd know how

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,180
to take it and all I really realized was

00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:22,400
that over six months of working with

00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:25,020
them that their concept of a thick skin

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,170
really was more of love myopia in my

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,939
opinion it narrowed their vision to only

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,500
what was right in front of them

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,610
things didn't hurt their feelings when

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,689
they happen but they also liked an

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,100
awareness of what was going on around

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:39,360
them and I realized that you know to

00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,979
strive to have a thick skin is really an

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,649
unnatural condition for us as humans

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:45,899
because we objectively have thin skins

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:49,350
so that I renamed the talk it's actually

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:51,329
office politics for the humans so

00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:56,490
hopefully this is relevant to you if

00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:58,710
you're not a human I apologize I like to

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:02,969
start off talks at the very basic so

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:04,920
some basic term definition I define the

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:07,110
word politics I'll actually I go back to

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,810
the Greek it's a two-part word poly

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:12,350
meaning many and tics meaning blood

00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,350
sucking parasites

00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:21,310
but you know why we've taken this

00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:24,370
beautiful word this beautiful definition

00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:26,560
and we've completely ruined it in in the

00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:29,410
United States of America we have this

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,090
two-party system and we all tend to have

00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:33,130
either a lot of emotion or a lot of just

00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,520
anger towards the concept of politics

00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:39,460
whether that's that we think that

00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:41,200
politics is you know the the men in

00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,510
suits taking money from the poor and

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,870
giving to the rich or even whether we

00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:48,250
have an aspirational view of politics

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,630
that like through grassroots community

00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:58,270
organizing we can actually affect real

00:02:49,630 --> 00:03:00,910
change it's actually not Jim I love you

00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:02,530
Jim but but the reason that I just did

00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,730
that why I just denigrated Republicans

00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,860
and promoted Democrats a little is

00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,870
because the other aspect where we view

00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,400
the two-party system is this zero-sum

00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,040
game and that's kind of where we

00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,780
conceived of politics but of course

00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,100
what's ridiculous about it this visceral

00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,209
emotional reaction that we all have is

00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,970
that we don't really have that much of

00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:20,800
an impact on it and on top of that it

00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,390
doesn't really matter it sort of reminds

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,630
me like I love this image of you know

00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,380
two toys of fictional characters

00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:28,510
battling it out because it's like

00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,620
politics because like first of all it

00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:35,950
doesn't matter and second of all whoever

00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:37,600
wins we lose so I I don't want you to

00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:40,720
think about that type of politics i when

00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,850
I talk about office politics I just do

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,620
whatever you need to do flush it reset

00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:48,160
your mind think about something else

00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:51,400
think about I like the image of water

00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:54,130
because if everyone's like a little

00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,320
water drop making a little splash making

00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:59,050
an outsized impact without doing

00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,840
anything more is how I try to view

00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:03,640
making changes within organizations all

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,959
right because I I'm just one little guy

00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,590
and if I can just make a bigger impact

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,720
in the world around me then you know

00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:13,600
that makes me happy I guess why do we

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,260
work so today I'm going to talk about

00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,160
four virtues I'm not going to you know

00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,840
explain how to be like you know a

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,390
manipulative person and like navigate

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,919
all the chummy waters of complex

00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,510
organizations but I'm gonna share four

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,920
character traits that

00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:29,620
I think are really important to at least

00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,970
get started and the way that I'm going

00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,590
to try to convey that is with four

00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,600
stories from my own professional career

00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,190
these are things that you happen to me

00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,370
one of them uh something that happened

00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:40,840
to a friend of mine a project and you

00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:42,430
know these stories on their own they're

00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,350
not going to convey to you the skill

00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,910
that you need to like master this but

00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,750
hopefully it'll like at least resonate a

00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,100
little bit with something that you've

00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,260
experienced and maybe you can just kind

00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,970
of key into it later so in the future

00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:55,090
you can kind of like build these reflex

00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:56,410
muscles I'm also like I like telling

00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,900
stories because I'm like a career-long

00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,190
consultant I I know we've got a few

00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,380
consultants in here I love being a

00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:04,240
consultant thinking about this topic

00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:07,240
because every six months I get to swoop

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,190
into a new organization I experiment on

00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,740
people you know the organization goes to

00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:17,230
hell and I swoop out and then I send an

00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:18,760
invoice and if you don't love soft talks

00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,290
I know we got a lot of soft acts here

00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,710
you don't love soft talks feel free to

00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:25,180
try to beat my count I counted ninety

00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:29,200
six stick figures in this presentation

00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:30,400
if you want to just not think about what

00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,350
I'm saying and instead count stick

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:36,130
figures and correct me at the end I will

00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:39,120
give you a prize to be determined you

00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:39,120
can have Jim's beard

00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,750
so the first virtue I want talk about is

00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:45,070
awareness and I think this is the most

00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:48,880
important one has been the most time on

00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:50,350
it and if you have awareness of the

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,580
world around you above and beyond just

00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,820
like what you've been asked to do for

00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:55,870
your job you can accomplish a lot I

00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:58,060
studied Japanese in college the first

00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:02,110
idiom in Japanese that I learned was

00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,800
dated Kuya Lou Tadeo which literally ish

00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,690
means

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,910
the steak that sticks out or the nail

00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:08,920
that sticks out gets hammered down I

00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:10,570
think this is the approach that we have

00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:13,000
to mentally conceiving of work

00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:14,950
post-industrial revolution by standing

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,480
out we kind of put ourselves at risk so

00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,920
the safe and easy thing to do is keep

00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,490
our head down do the job to which we

00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:24,010
were prescribed and if we follow the

00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:25,990
straight and narrow path we will fall we

00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:28,420
will walk up the stairway of success and

00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:29,800
ultimately reach the zenith and you know

00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,900
we will have been successful whatever

00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,610
that means to us but of course I don't

00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,500
really I'm cynical I don't believe in a

00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,300
stairway to success I you know there's

00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,220
no corporate ladder it's just people

00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:44,450
stepping on each other

00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:46,160
and and by doing a but by finding

00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:48,590
success by only doing the job that I was

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,270
asked to do harder I don't think that's

00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:52,250
the effective way to do it and I think

00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:54,100
the best way to demonstrate that is to

00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:56,389
talk about local versus global

00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,130
optimization because I've found in lots

00:06:56,389 --> 00:07:00,080
of organizations that a team actually

00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:02,030
over performing and really kicking ass

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,470
has been net effect counter to the

00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:05,330
overall goal of the success of the big

00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,970
organization that they're at of slowing

00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:09,169
down the overall system and I witness

00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,300
this a couple years ago and I want to

00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:13,640
share it to you as sort of a block

00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:17,120
diagram history of how this company came

00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:19,760
to be and then how I messed it all up so

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,370
it started like a lot of applications do

00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,630
a programmer and a user user got value

00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,640
from what the programmer was doing and

00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,830
that worked pretty well for a time until

00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,960
they I decided to introduce a product

00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,970
owner who organized the work into a

00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:35,540
backlog and and add a little bit of

00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:36,979
structure and cadence eventually the

00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,820
team grew there was a you know a couple

00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:42,260
programmers and a designer there's a

00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,700
once that once the application started

00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,710
providing real meaningful business value

00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,030
the business came on because now they

00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,780
cared and so they start coordinating

00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,640
with the product owner he's now the

00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,140
product owner kind of is the hub in a

00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,030
hub-and-spoke communication model here

00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:55,520
that only works for so until you get so

00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:57,080
big you know they have a tester too

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,430
because once it's providing business

00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,810
value they want to make sure that fewer

00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:03,020
and fewer bugs actually make it to the

00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:04,400
user they continue to grow so zoom out a

00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,990
little bit that consider that a

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,430
development team now so that we can make

00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,840
room in our chart for you know a release

00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:11,000
manager somebody who's concerned about

00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,640
let's let's maintain multiple branches

00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,750
of the code and figure out when and how

00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,090
we release and add a little bit of

00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,440
formality there they added a sales guys

00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,210
so now the product owner takes a little

00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,039
pressure off handing that directly in

00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:24,740
interacting with the users anymore that

00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:26,000
instead new requirements come in through

00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:28,820
sales to the business back to the

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,950
product owner QA the tester becomes a

00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:33,979
kind of QA team over time as things grow

00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:35,089
sales guy becomes a sales team the

00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:38,419
organization's getting bigger and bigger

00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:41,690
so zoom out again and now instead of

00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:42,919
just one development team we had a

00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,510
second development team and another

00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:47,510
product donor and it doesn't necessarily

00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:48,589
mean that it was necessary from the

00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,970
products perspective but in their

00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:51,260
particular case was just the room got

00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,440
full so there's a lot of time for a new

00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,440
team

00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:58,980
that's how teams are byzant that how

00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:01,320
teams are formed usually so zoom out

00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,000
again because when you arbitrarily

00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,680
divide teams like that it usually means

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,269
that they're actually sharing one code

00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,260
base so the product delineation isn't

00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:09,510
clear they share a lot of shared

00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:13,019
resources which is a great way to slow

00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:14,820
your organization down and and to manage

00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:17,279
that and facilitate that cordon that

00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,990
coordination that was necessary instead

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,430
of just being a release manager now that

00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,290
he's kind of changed management

00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:24,120
responsibilities to keep all the plates

00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:26,339
spinning and additionally they had a

00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,050
DevOps team because the two teams shared

00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:29,970
production environments and somebody had

00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:31,560
to be the gatekeeper and then finally

00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,149
they added a DBA who would be

00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,829
responsible for any schema changes and

00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:36,300
kind of be a gate check before to make

00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:37,320
sure that any change that one team want

00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,180
to make the schema would be copacetic

00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,610
with the other is all you know this

00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:45,420
story has been told a thousand times and

00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:47,550
and and as such things really started to

00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,779
slow down because any new change any new

00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:50,639
feature just had to take a lot more

00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:52,260
coordination effort and communication

00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:53,910
across all these different people so the

00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:56,100
business you know they get upset they're

00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:59,010
like why you know ship software anymore

00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,630
and the business goes to like their

00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,560
local conference and they get all jazz

00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,120
because they hear about new

00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,190
methodologies every decade it's a new

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,660
thing this time it was agile they and

00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:08,250
they they found out you know like wow

00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,380
with agile teams to get fast feedback

00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,820
you get you know all these cool

00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,500
practices they work directly with the

00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,850
business and it's you know ironically

00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,420
that's exactly where they were at the

00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:19,890
beginning of this diagram but so they

00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,329
bring in some consultants and they

00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:23,250
designate a put the consultants on a

00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,600
stage in front of everyone and they say

00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:27,060
to the entire organization this is

00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,610
awesome team these guys are these guys

00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:31,440
are be agile awesome guys

00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,160
and we're gonna work with them and you

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,089
know we're gonna do the agile

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,170
transformation but we're gonna start

00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:35,579
with them then we're gonna roll it out

00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:37,260
to everybody and you're all gonna just

00:10:35,579 --> 00:10:43,110
be it's gonna be fantastic when you get

00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:44,310
more done I was on awesome team and the

00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,930
best part about being an awesome team

00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:48,569
you see this little red box around here

00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:50,310
is we kind of had a Hall Pass you know

00:10:48,569 --> 00:10:52,139
we have the CTO the CIO all these

00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:54,600
bigwigs inside of this is a very large

00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:56,069
organization it kind of gave us just

00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,420
carte blanche they said you know you

00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:58,649
need anything you just push on people

00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,720
and tell them call me if you got a

00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:02,069
problem so we were able to like you see

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,839
all these like little arrows are

00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:05,610
bi-directional ours weren't because we

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,620
could just push on people so you know

00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,790
the the DBA they had a stressful life

00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,199
because every time something you need a

00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,880
column change the process in this

00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:13,740
organization was like three pieces of

00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,940
paper had to get filled out and so when

00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,949
we told them we're gonna be changed in

00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,569
columns every day they freaked out

00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:19,170
because it really really upset their

00:11:18,569 --> 00:11:21,810
apple cart

00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:24,959
DevOps team same thing there's a crazy

00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:26,610
Oracle nasty proprietary runtime

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,980
production system and even to get a new

00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:31,319
dev server set up because they only had

00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:33,149
like one was apparently a three month

00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:34,350
job and costs like hundreds of thousands

00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:36,180
of dollars and so when we told him that

00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:40,800
we were like we're going to be receiving

00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:42,269
one in two weeks they got upset the QA

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,670
team they saw us come they were they

00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:46,439
were worried that you know we didn't

00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:48,209
talk to them we were like I know we

00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:49,709
actually we do behavior-driven

00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:51,750
development test-driven development you

00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:53,010
know we don't really need you so then

00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,000
they felt immediately threatened because

00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,980
like oh they're gonna roll this out

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,300
everywhere what's gonna happen to me and

00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,180
then the change management people they

00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,949
they were extremely worried when we

00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:06,689
would talk about things like shipping

00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:08,310
code they they literally had a meeting

00:12:06,689 --> 00:12:09,899
every Friday and it was a really short

00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,490
meeting it was like scheduled like 4:45

00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:13,709
it was like everyone in the organization

00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:15,209
who might instigate change inside of the

00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:17,399
production environment and the whole

00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:19,890
like the ideal pace of this meeting was

00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:21,569
everyone to just be asked a you got any

00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:22,829
changes in production everyone would say

00:12:21,569 --> 00:12:24,990
no and be like okay good good good

00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:26,339
weekend and so when we came in were like

00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,360
hey we're starting this new project

00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:28,890
we're gonna be in production and you

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,010
know like a couple weeks and we're gonna

00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:36,269
want to deploy nightly I just like blew

00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:37,769
their mind so they didn't love us but

00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:39,060
the business was super happy because we

00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:40,620
were getting really really fast feedback

00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:43,199
we built an app faster than they could

00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,370
ever have remembered and and we had a

00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:45,689
lot of fun too and it felt like a real

00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:48,240
big success but everyone else in the

00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:49,850
organization was a little grumpy and the

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,800
change management person in particular

00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:54,619
they were really angry

00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,670
and and here's a fun trick to try if you

00:12:54,619 --> 00:12:57,679
ever work in a publicly traded

00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:59,209
organization find whoever this role is

00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:00,139
and then get them really agitated and

00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:02,420
talk about all the changes you're gonna

00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:04,249
do because if it's a publicly traded

00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:06,079
organization it's very likely that not

00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:10,309
only will they froth at the mouth but

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:11,739
every third word will be Sox and I found

00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:14,420
that the best way to end a conversation

00:13:11,739 --> 00:13:16,970
in such an environment is just to use

00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,739
Sox play the Sox card and no one

00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:20,239
understands why you can't do it but

00:13:18,739 --> 00:13:22,749
that's why and then it just ends the

00:13:20,239 --> 00:13:25,910
conversation you can go about your day

00:13:22,749 --> 00:13:29,119
so when that was the state of the

00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:31,100
overall organization however the first

00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:32,660
project very very successful

00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,459
the second project everyone schemed

00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,929
against us and suddenly we weren't

00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:37,369
getting our column changes anymore and

00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:38,749
the dev ops team wasn't providing are

00:13:37,369 --> 00:13:40,100
actually our environment had to restart

00:13:38,749 --> 00:13:41,809
every twenty minutes and we couldn't

00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,910
make any forward progress and it was

00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:46,189
almost as if they were trying to work us

00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:48,850
out and they succeeded the overall

00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:52,699
organism rejected the parasite and the

00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:55,429
new business arrived the CIOs all got

00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:56,929
new jobs elsewhere and you know me being

00:13:55,429 --> 00:13:58,449
a consultant I floated away to my next

00:13:56,929 --> 00:14:02,629
thing

00:13:58,449 --> 00:14:04,670
awareness that so so so I didn't exactly

00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:06,079
see all of that coming this is the

00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:07,759
benefit of hindsight I'm able to make

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,199
this diagram but I saw a lot of it

00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:10,519
coming we actually would like sat down

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,899
with the executives and we're like this

00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:13,819
is where this is gonna end up you know

00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:15,259
the end of the story is not great and

00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:16,490
they they were still confident we want

00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:21,230
to try it out anyway we're like alright

00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:22,670
cool let's let's experiment but

00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:24,110
awareness is really really important to

00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:26,449
understanding what's going on around you

00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:28,100
obviously I think empathy is also

00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:30,350
incredibly important this is a

00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:34,899
photograph of me on the first day of

00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:37,730
every project ever I

00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:39,139
it's a powerful moment right because you

00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:40,879
have the outsider result you've still

00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:44,240
got this positive energy you want to

00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:45,949
effect change and you can if you're an

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,049
empathetic individual why empathy is so

00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:50,749
powerful is you can identify why

00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:52,220
everyone else is having a bad time or

00:14:50,749 --> 00:14:55,790
why they're having a good time and help

00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:57,230
them succeed and try to help fix their

00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,819
problems by feeling what they're feeling

00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,319
but the downside of empathy that is

00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:02,029
feeling what other people are feeling

00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:03,559
is that as a normalizing effect over

00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:04,760
time so they're like me six months later

00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:08,480
I'm just one of the blue

00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:10,010
frowny faces but empathy is incredibly

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,920
powerful especially when it's used in

00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:14,180
relatively healthy social environments

00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,920
and I think that even though developers

00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:18,410
have a bad rap as being not very

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,600
emotionally aware or intelligent we all

00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:22,880
are actually very successful empathetic

00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,380
creatures and my favorite like obvious

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,840
example of this that I hope you can

00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:28,520
relate to I think most developers can

00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:30,530
similar to how the Lorax speaks for the

00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:33,290
trees who who cannot speak for they have

00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:35,570
no tongues we as developers are very

00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,980
often the advocates of the user you know

00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:39,530
we're told hey you got to go implement

00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,700
this story and we think about what that

00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,990
would be actually be like from a user's

00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,520
perspective and then we push back a

00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:46,490
little bit because the users not in the

00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,660
room they can't advocate for it and one

00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:50,660
of my favorite little stories of user

00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:53,630
advocacy from a programmer I came out of

00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:55,130
a woman who ran a business she woke up

00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:57,440
one day she had an awesome software

00:15:55,130 --> 00:16:00,590
product idea she owned a freight local

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,700
freight shipping business and everything

00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:03,710
was manual everything was by hand they

00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,570
just wrote little checklists of of where

00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:07,970
they'd been and kept track with manual

00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:09,740
paper logs but the iPad had come out so

00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:12,230
she she contracted my friend a local

00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,730
like mobile iOS app and they converted

00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:16,250
all that stuff over to the iPad it was

00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:17,660
actually really quick win and it was

00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:20,780
fantastic and it revolutionized the

00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:24,170
business really quickly so hopper and

00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:25,700
then that evening in the bathtub she had

00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:28,400
the idea like hey I could actually

00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:30,530
leverage this and do so much more now

00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,780
for my business and her idea was well

00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:35,030
I've got all these ships or all these

00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:36,710
trucks out in the field and I've got a

00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:38,870
business manager in the office and he's

00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:40,580
got a smartphone and all these trucks

00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:43,940
now they have iPads which have antennae

00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:45,710
and GPS that they're broadcasting all

00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,810
the time so why can't we just add to the

00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:50,150
app something that makes me able to like

00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:51,980
keep tabs on where everyone is and so

00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:54,860
then that way you know I could know that

00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:57,440
Jack is out for delivery or Jane is

00:16:54,860 --> 00:17:00,980
getting her car filled up or I got to

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:05,410
pick a name Zak is out at lunch or Sarah

00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:05,410
is playing bocce ball with Zak the cat

00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:14,270
that Zak the cat that Sarah

00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:17,230
so programmer pulls this story off the

00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:17,230
card wall and he thinks to himself

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,949
what would this actually be like for a

00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:23,390
user he already knows location service

00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:24,709
is cold he could implement this really

00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:26,539
easily but just some sort of you know

00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:28,130
feeling out like what what's actually

00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:29,360
trying to be accomplished here he

00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,289
empathize with the user a little bit

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,789
he's like well if I was one of these

00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:34,100
delivery people I probably would not

00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:35,690
appreciate somebody surreptitiously

00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,890
vlogging everywhere that I am and

00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,360
keeping tabs on me and what I'm doing

00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,190
especially if I don't have any certain

00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,860
notification of that so he raised that

00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:44,809
issue with with the product owner who

00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:47,390
just could only see how this would be

00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:49,880
really valuable to her business and and

00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:52,039
and didn't empathize and so then he

00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,389
called the lawyer and suddenly when the

00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:55,250
lawyer realized all the liability of

00:17:53,389 --> 00:17:56,960
like you know spying on people without

00:17:55,250 --> 00:18:00,950
notification but suddenly the product

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,690
owner really did empathize and it ended

00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:04,190
up you know they ended up moving much

00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:06,320
more cautiously in that area as opposed

00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:07,940
to just outright spying on people but

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,080
sometimes it takes that in a lot of ways

00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,760
programmers I think are like the last

00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,230
line of defense of like really bad ideas

00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,440
because because we're the ones with the

00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:17,450
keyboards but that's just one example I

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,220
think that's a example how empathy is

00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:21,380
powerful but I think if you apply

00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,909
empathy just beyond user advocacy which

00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,440
I think we're all used to and instead

00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:26,240
think hey coworker

00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,830
like try to understand where they're at

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,210
emotionally what's driving them what

00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:34,220
incentivizes them what makes them happy

00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:35,480
or sad how can we help them win it's a

00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,730
powerful thing and I think that we can

00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,230
you know make a lot of progress getting

00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:40,850
people on board with what you want to do

00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:41,809
unity is the next thing I wanna talk

00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,860
about because once people are on board

00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:44,659
with you it's important to they stay on

00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:47,960
board with you because it's critically

00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:50,630
important that everyone be working

00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,250
towards the same goal the reason is

00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,539
obviously it's a lot harder to build

00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:56,029
something than it is to tear it down and

00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:59,330
if somebody on your team isn't really on

00:18:56,029 --> 00:19:03,350
your side then that's that's you're

00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:04,700
gonna have a bad time I think that a lot

00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:06,649
of us tend to be optimists when we're on

00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,059
a team we assume that everyone is we

00:19:06,649 --> 00:19:09,110
have this childlike naivety that

00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:10,970
everyone's like on the team we're gonna

00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:13,909
build the thing yay even if your code

00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:15,710
totally sucks at least you're trying and

00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:17,389
that's how I approach teams generally

00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:20,269
but every now and then there's like this

00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:21,830
evil Lego man spy who's on the team and

00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:23,360
he's actually like actively working

00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:25,730
against it for some reasons that you

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,580
aren't apparent to you initially I was

00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:30,110
on a team with eight people and we knew

00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,980
from day one because this project had

00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,640
been tried and failed in this

00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,050
organization

00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,370
times that many other people in the

00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:36,440
organization were actually incentivized

00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:38,570
for this project to fail we could see

00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,620
them all over the place it was really

00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,610
really obvious that we were surrounded

00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,470
by people who were actively working

00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:49,100
against us so we did the agile thing and

00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:50,660
we put up a wall and and the the the the

00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,880
the wall was helpful because it

00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:55,130
insulated us right so I gave us the

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,770
safety to experiment to play to like be

00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:59,540
creative and build some software and

00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:01,760
normally that's great because if I have

00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,440
idea a like hey let's use this library I

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,670
should be able to float that safely

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,700
without it being used against me in a

00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:09,380
court of law and that wasn't how it was

00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,880
going though because right after I had

00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,800
idea a within a couple hours like

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,690
architect Joe from over and the other

00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,740
end of the room would have it and then

00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,630
it would spread throughout the whole

00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,310
organization suddenly the whole week is

00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:20,840
lost now to arguing over framework a

00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:23,450
when it was just an idea in the morning

00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,770
that I had so clearly we had a mole

00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:27,050
somebody inside the wall was actually

00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:30,250
working against us and we had a really

00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:33,050
brilliant a maniacal but also brilliant

00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:34,970
tech lead and and manager who took us

00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,840
each out to lunch under the auspice okay

00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:38,060
let's talk about this architecture

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,530
because obviously the rooms not safe so

00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:42,080
I got a truth table coming up right so

00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:45,020
so what they did was given these three

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,450
ideas let's kind of dole them out so

00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:51,620
person one got idea a B and C person two

00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:54,230
got idea a and B a and C B and C and

00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:57,050
then breaking it down further if I've

00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:58,490
just got idea a b c and then presumably

00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:02,270
person eight got something totally it

00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:04,480
just just off the wall so then we just

00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,480
waited

00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:10,730
suddenly idea AC emerges spontaneously

00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,920
never having actually been talked about

00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:14,450
in the room which identified if you

00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,940
remember correctly the fingers person

00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:19,820
number three and so we just found you

00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:22,040
know a very fun single single sign-on

00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,480
authentication project that was going to

00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,430
take him six months and we thought he'd

00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,810
be perfect for it and so we've assigned

00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:32,780
him to that and then our team moved a

00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:35,030
lot faster so unity is obviously really

00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:38,150
important to succeeding once once you

00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:39,050
have people on your team the last thing

00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,010
we'll talk about is patience because

00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:41,750
like a lot of these other things are

00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:44,390
active these are things that you can do

00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:46,330
to actively manipulate the world around

00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:48,770
you and then the groups around you to

00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:50,930
achieve some goal hopefully it's a it's

00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:53,210
an altruistic goal whether it's personal

00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:55,130
or the success of your company but

00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:56,930
patience is sometimes the best play

00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:59,930
sometimes the best thing that you can do

00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:02,570
is nothing and it's hard for me because

00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:06,230
I love tinkering but but I love this

00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:07,790
example because it was really really

00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:10,280
intense

00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:16,360
has anyone ever like imagined an evil

00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:16,360
boss or had an evil or crazy boss right

00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:22,370
evil bosses exist in all kinds of

00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:23,630
organizations but it doesn't necessarily

00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:26,000
mean the whole organization screwed up

00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:27,620
like in for example in this one client

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,480
that I had there was clearly a guy who

00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,770
is just a really really bad nut like

00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,940
people go out to lunch probably with

00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:37,760
this guy and be like hey this is Jack

00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:39,290
I'm evil but his co-workers his fellow

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,250
executives they were all cool guys I

00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:41,180
love getting along with them it was

00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:44,000
clear that they were trying to do the

00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:46,870
right thing but it's clear that Jerry

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,750
I'm just making up his name

00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:53,150
Jerry Jerry had only risen to power like

00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:55,100
on top of a mountain of skulls and once

00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:57,950
he had once he had climbed over all

00:22:55,100 --> 00:23:00,590
these corpses like he got to the top and

00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:02,450
he you know shockingly he was a bad

00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:04,430
executive because he'd spent his entire

00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:06,290
career doing nothing but like climbing

00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:08,600
over dead bodies and so he didn't know

00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:10,040
what to do with all that power and so he

00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,740
just used it to be manipulative and

00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:14,690
terrible and as a result he was a

00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:16,190
ticking time bomb we all knew that it

00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:17,840
was going to blow up sooner or later

00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:19,490
and the

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,620
best thing to do in that situation is to

00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:23,710
allow other people to fail because if if

00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:26,059
organizations are good at nothing if not

00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:28,520
responding well to failure responding to

00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:31,460
failure usually strongly in making some

00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:33,080
kind of corrective action and so that's

00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:35,000
where patience comes in obviously is

00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,289
he's got to let things fail sometimes so

00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,940
this is Jerry at the top of the

00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:41,270
organization he had three business

00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:43,070
analysts he chose business analysts to

00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,909
promote to product owners people in

00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:45,380
charge of teams of developers

00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:48,529
specifically because they didn't have

00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:49,789
the experience to tell him no and he

00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:51,020
also chose three of them so he could

00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:52,730
play them off of each other

00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,669
gonna be a little duplicity us and give

00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:56,720
us away without being easily fingered

00:23:54,669 --> 00:23:58,640
there are also three development teams

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,070
perfectly capable development teams and

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,710
the problem of course is these product

00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:05,029
owners had no experience in that role

00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,830
had never run a software project before

00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:09,409
and so they they were a little confused

00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:10,820
from day one to begin with and as a

00:24:09,409 --> 00:24:12,440
result the developers who were all

00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,299
building one product but across three

00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,500
teams didn't really know how to slice

00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:17,360
things didn't know how to work together

00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,950
I didn't know how things would

00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,820
necessarily be organized so right off

00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:23,899
the bat things were a little hinky and

00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:27,470
that was before the lightning round

00:24:23,899 --> 00:24:28,970
started which is the you know the the

00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,960
crazy guy at the top starts pushing and

00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:31,370
pushing and pushing and making up

00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,200
arbitrary deadlines and saying hey why

00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:34,490
haven't I seen anything yet and so

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,990
naturally that freaks out the product

00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:37,669
owners and because they don't have the

00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:38,809
experience of like you know what it's

00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:40,039
like to manage your software team before

00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:41,690
the right thing to do here is to

00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:42,799
insulate your developers from that

00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:46,250
pressure because once that pressure

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:47,750
leaks down brains turn off a cognition

00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:49,340
is over the creative exercise of

00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:53,390
programming is impossible and everyone

00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:54,740
just starts updating their LinkedIn but

00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:57,140
they didn't do that so those guys went

00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:58,460
crazy to the product owners in this case

00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:01,159
they just started feeling like they were

00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:04,159
drowning they they felt completely lost

00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:06,169
I got here shortly after this so it was

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:09,049
clear that everyone was really really

00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:10,970
burnt out and then the developers you

00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:13,549
know all of them were just really really

00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:17,029
sad like I say that like not sad like oh

00:25:13,549 --> 00:25:18,740
they're sad like sad like like they just

00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:20,840
bought this multi-million dollar team

00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:22,850
space this beautiful restored building

00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:25,929
and on day one I was there day one when

00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:28,250
they moved in on day one it smelled bad

00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:30,260
because these people weren't showering

00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:31,670
and they weren't showering not because

00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:33,230
they were working long hours on

00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:34,910
project they were actually showing up at

00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:36,950
like 10:00 a.m. and leaving at 4:00 p.m.

00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:39,020
they were like not showering because

00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:41,840
their lives were bad like this project

00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:43,610
had so demoralized them as people and so

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,770
clearly this guy's had a very bad effect

00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:47,180
on lots of humans and the worst thing I

00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:49,850
could do as a consultant is help him

00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:51,410
succeed but that's my instinct so this

00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:53,090
is like this little like gecko I imagine

00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:56,200
like standing up tall I'm gonna like you

00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:58,970
know succeed in the face of defeat and

00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,950
that's just my nature I want to help

00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:02,870
everyone every project every endeavor

00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:07,640
succeed no matter what but sometimes the

00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:10,010
right call is to retreat and so in this

00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:12,620
case I was smart enough to at least sit

00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:15,980
back and watch this you know complete

00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:17,420
cluster of an operation I was you know

00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,830
like imagine some like this like lean

00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,360
back just watch it happen

00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:22,760
don't do anything to facilitate it don't

00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:27,230
try to reconcile zone gonna gonna fall

00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:31,700
apart and just sit back and just watch

00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:34,310
it all burned down and and it did and uh

00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:35,960
you know it's true a lot like pretty

00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:38,000
much everyone had to find your job but

00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,950
at least that guy wasn't in power for

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,610
many years more wrecking more people's

00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:46,640
lives so that's the power of patience

00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:49,430
sometimes even when you're in a you know

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,230
a position of being able to influence a

00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:54,230
team sometimes failure is the best

00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:55,760
option even at the macro level so those

00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:57,290
are four little virtues I came to talk

00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,390
about you know the importance of

00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:01,910
awareness of lifting your head up out of

00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:03,680
your cubicle wall to take stock of the

00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:04,250
broader organization and how you can

00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,070
improve it

00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:09,440
empathy helping other people you know

00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:10,760
win and feel better and and and

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,990
accomplish what they want accomplish is

00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:15,590
the best way to get them on board with

00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:17,420
you unity the importance of just once

00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:19,070
you once you've gotten endeavour making

00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:22,010
sure that everyone's on board and in

00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:24,620
genuine and honest and then patience is

00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:26,510
always handy it's always handy but I

00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:28,010
always forget so if you ever work with

00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:31,100
me remind me to be patient and things

00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:32,690
will go better anyway the messages take

00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,490
some of that and and start to consider

00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:35,780
getting political I want I want office

00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:38,060
politics to not be a four-letter word

00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:39,320
and and and hopefully people can have

00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:42,710
fun with it and draw stick figures like

00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:45,620
