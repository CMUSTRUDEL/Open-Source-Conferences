Description: 
	By Justin Searls

Software projects rarely fail for technical reasons. The icky, gooey human aspects of our teams and organizations regularly present structural obstacles around which a solution simply can't be programmed. "Office politics" deserves much of the derision it receives, but every virtuous person who opts out of solving the softer problems of software effectively forfeits the organization's future to others, whether or not they're acting in good faith. Developers tend to have several disadvantages when it comes to this arena, but they can be mitigated with greater awareness and can ultimately be overcome with intelligence and leverage. In this talk we'll discuss how to gain awareness of the human systems that govern organizations and—through the use of examples and illustrations—we'll highlight the individual virtues necessary for successfully having an impact on your organization's future that's larger than yourself.
