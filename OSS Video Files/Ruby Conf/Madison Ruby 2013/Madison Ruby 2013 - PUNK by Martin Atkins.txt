I've been at the cutting edge the

00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:35,879
forefront of dangerous innovative

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:41,579

00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:58,590
punk who threw that back here and

00:03:50,040 --> 00:04:00,060
chocolate that's later I originally did

00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,609
this lecture at the university of

00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,530
southern california in 2007 when it was

00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:06,900
like five ideas written on the back of a

00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:09,889
brown paper bag and it was called the

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,819
socio economic backdrop socio-political

00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:14,280
economic backdrop to the punk rock

00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:16,380
revolution and i'm not an expert on Punk

00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,970
i was just in it i was in a band with

00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:24,060
Johnny Rotten for five years called

00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:26,610
public image limited from 79 to 85 but

00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:29,820
before that I was a kid growing up in

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,710
England during punk so that's what this

00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:38,430
is kind of and then it goes completely

00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:39,900
off the rails no pun intended it just

00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,370
goes off the rails and connects a bunch

00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,720
of different things that are important

00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,300
to me and I think have something to do

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:49,650
with punk so I was born in nineteen

00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:51,449
fifty-nine which makes me 54 I

00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:53,160
started playing drums when I was nine

00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:56,789
started drinking Newcastle Brown Ale

00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,930
when I was 11 yeah I used to live in

00:04:56,789 --> 00:04:59,940
Durham which is really close to

00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:06,030
Newcastle so that's what all the kids

00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:07,490
did yeah and I started playing in the

00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,720
bands

00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:12,800
like cover bands in the north of England

00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,960

00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,770
something called a Mellotron which I'll

00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,960
talk to you about in a minute it was

00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:36,470
kind of the first sampler and we had

00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:42,320
these long winded psychedelic songs

00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:42,320
guitarist had Flair sleeved shirts I

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:52,470
remember we were doing some yes covers

00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:54,870
and I cuz i was playing drums so i'd see

00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:57,480
the guitarist in this in his satin lace

00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:59,580
up shirt with the flared sleeves and

00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,740
like with his double neck guitar 12

00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:06,570
string and a six string so he could just

00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:10,710
masturbate constantly and now and and

00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:12,600
i'd be drumming Maya yeah but nobody

00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:14,370
could see my view I wish I'd taken a

00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,790
picture in my head of this great big

00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:20,220
iron mark that his mum had like burnt

00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:22,050
the back of his satin shirt suid he

00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,090
would never it would never turn his back

00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:26,580
to the audience that's just yeah anyway

00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:29,070
and that this is me on stage with the

00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:32,700
mind you want to talk logos and graphic

00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:35,580
art we got those yeah stick on letters

00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:38,910
on the Mellotron that's that's me

00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:41,730
playing drums and this is a Mellotron

00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:44,070
it's kind of the first sampler every key

00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:48,060
on the keyboard was basically the play

00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:49,830
button of a tape machine it was like it

00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,440
was insane as a heaviest thing

00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:54,000
and it was supposed to replace like a

00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:58,380
horn section or a string section or a

00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,270
choir but the wow and flutter of the

00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:05,970
tape machine gave the mellotron its own

00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:08,250
kind of hard tingly that haunting sound

00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:12,440
right of the wow and flutter of the

00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:15,600
tapes is just kind of awesome but anyway

00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:18,200
here's my school report I don't know why

00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:22,880
I put this in here ah

00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:26,960

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:31,910
minus for what bring buyers for drugs a

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:34,430
for alcohol uh-huh I think I put this in

00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:36,260
there to make my eldest son Ian feel a

00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:43,520
little better because we're pretty much

00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:50,930
neck in neck satis Martin has ability

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:53,630
but lacks application you and but

00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:56,420
you know this is from some kind of

00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:59,420
bygone era old quill pen school

00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:01,220
report right and and I know I was doing

00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,570
really badly because it's my mom signed

00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,810
july 75 britain was in recession

00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:19,940
unemployment figures were the worst

00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,760
since world war two school leavers least

00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:24,080
likely to find work sounds familiar

00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,670
public spending had risen to forty-five

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,520
percent of national income and the

00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:33,140
optimism of the 60s had started to fade

00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:35,300
away I forgotten about the troubles in

00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:39,860
Northern Ireland and how close they were

00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:42,200
to home in England so this wasn't like

00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:44,240
oh yeah there's a conflict over there

00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,540
read about it in the papers watch it on

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:51,020

away in a trash container right as soon

00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:04,970

00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:35,040
north of England everyone

00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:36,990
if you saw like a package on a bus it

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,880

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,010
blackouts right we used to get the

00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:09,240
newspaper and it would tell us when

salad on thursday it didn't matter when

00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:34,890
we'd have hot water for bathing because

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:40,230
British people don't bathe so that was

00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:41,880
fine that was fired um but yeah Margaret

00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:43,800
Thatcher's using the police to break up

00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,710
the minor stroke it was weird I'm in the

00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:49,200
north of England and we would do a deal

half price drinks at the door and we'd

00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:59,460
let you in for three this is like

00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,780
community-based everybody's trying to

00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:04,520
help each other it's kind of a strange

00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:07,140
time this is from the BBC website

00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:10,950
trafalgar square was a mountain of black

00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:13,140
garbage bags twitching with rats no

00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:17,280
bread they flew in bread from france

00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:20,090
until that was stopped and if there

00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:22,740
was flour in the house one had to bake

00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:26,190
the worst strike for many was on throw

00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:29,370
away nappies or disposable diapers is

00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:31,260
how you would understand that but listen

got let go back to the owner if there

00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:38,190
was flour in the house like that's how

00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:40,740
bad things if there was flour then you

00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:43,650
would bake I remember one time I had to

00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:45,870
wait two hours outside a fruit shop just

00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:48,300
to get some milk

00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:50,670
it's crazy like if you guys had to wake

00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:58,860
wait 14 minutes for a Wi-Fi connection

00:11:50,670 --> 00:12:00,510
your heads would blow up I don't

00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,010
remember all the political chaos but i

00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:04,230
do remember playing scrabble by

00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:06,660
candlelight that's kind of cool it

00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:09,089
letter and the fact that we couldn't

00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,010
bury my deceased grandfather my mother

00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:14,339
never forgave the Labour government or

00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:15,839
the trade unions for that so I think I

00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:18,839
would have put I would have put that

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:22,320
first if that was my if I was typing in

00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:25,620
on the BBC's website right hook hey Carl

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,740
yeah i saw your entry you put scrabble

00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:31,410
first or granddad sir granddad's dead

00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:33,930
upstairs but your room you're going on

00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:37,320
about the scrabble I think I'd flip that

00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:39,210
I love the bread strike as my

00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,100
grandmother would make proper bread in

00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:43,290
her oven and it was better than anything

00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,000
you could buy in the shops I remember

00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:47,370
the smell which lingered in the house

00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:55,290
was beautiful unlike the smell of

00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:59,520
granddad wafting wafting down the

00:12:55,290 --> 00:13:02,730
Ramones formed in 1974 this is stuff I

00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:05,070
used to think that punk rock was an

00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:07,290
English thing you know I think we all

00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:10,440
thought all of us english punks with all

00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:12,800
right English thing but before

00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:18,450
those punk in England the Ramones formed

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:21,029
1974 forest hills queens and because

00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:23,220
I've been traveling around and also

00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:25,620
found out that the saints any Australian

00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:29,540
see there was Australians at UX any

00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,540
Australians okay good

00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:37,260
I didn't mean good there are earlier I

00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:43,350
mean good I meant good we'll move on I

00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:45,390
didn't get this um so the saints so

00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:47,310
I was thinking well did it start in

00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:49,950
England or did punk start in New York at

00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:54,690
the same time as the Ramones of starting

00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:57,450
the saints formed in Brisbane kind of an

00:13:54,690 --> 00:14:01,760
interesting band and the Ramones single

00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:03,990
came out before the st. single but it

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,910
couldn't have influenced the Saints

00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:07,710
because they had a single come out like

00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:09,120
three weeks later and you know you're in

00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:11,160
production for like six or seven weeks

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,750
at the pressing plant so it's like this

00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,390
pump thing was just happening everywhere

00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:17,670

00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:22,880

it where's ash cover your ears there's

00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:20,780
all kinds of language in this in this

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:22,670
clip so 1976 the bill Grundy interview

00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:25,790
this so I've got to tell you a few

00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:30,410
things about life in England there were

00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:34,430
three television channels like what yeah

00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:36,680
3 there's a BBC onebbc to with no

00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:41,270
commercials and then a commercial

00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:43,160
station ITV whatever and television was

00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:45,020
a big part of English life everybody in

00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,580
England would watch monty python or

00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:49,060
Benny Hill or whatever at the same time

00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:51,260
and then talk about the whole country

00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:53,060
it's a big difference here in the states

00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:57,050
with the time zones and all the channels

00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:59,960
and everything um so people come people

00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:02,420
would come home from work and sit at the

00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:05,900
kitchen table and have the evening meal

00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:10,790
with the family and the television right

00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:13,310
so this isn't like a cable channel where

00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:19,130
you can choose to watch the channel and

00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:28,340
expect some language this was 530 news

00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:31,790
time they are punk rockers the new craze

00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:35,330

reckon comfy doesn't that seem odd to be

00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:53,720
slightly opposed to the empty

00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,700

00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:09,490
scene then I was still playing in the

00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:12,690
mind where technical proficiency was the

00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:15,250
order of the day how fast could you drum

00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:18,130
how fast of a lead guitarists you were

00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:21,550
it was all musical masturbation to the

00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:24,580
nth degree and we weren't just

00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:27,130
frightened by Punk's with safety pins

00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:29,680
stuck in their noses we didn't

00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:33,280
understand it we were frightened because

00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:36,190
we didn't understand the music either so

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:38,200
the uniform of that time was doc marten

00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:39,610

00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,150

00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:19,799
interesting right there this is

00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:21,779
very Sweeney yeah I I asked my Facebook

00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:24,210

00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:26,700
really like she's a photographer here in

00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:30,529
town and I love what she had to say

00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:33,600
apart from jeepers which is not punk

00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:35,549
jeepers I could write a book about what

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,350
punk mentor means to me in a very

00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:39,899
rudimentary way at men died I didn't

00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:41,220
have to be a sheep I was with other

00:22:39,899 --> 00:22:43,740
people that could think for themselves

00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:46,289
question what they heard I live outside

00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:48,950
of that ridiculous box everybody talks

00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:52,110
about being outside of but never are

00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:55,320
punk music challenged me and pushed me

00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:58,710
to never stop asking why and to never

00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:01,980
let no be the final word unless I said

00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:04,770
it it was being an individual in the

00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:08,490
middle of like minds just love the way

00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:10,289
she expressed that um this is where it

00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:12,779
gets frightening well if you're

00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:14,730
technically proficient this is it's not

00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:16,529
from sniffing glue fanzine which is also

00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:17,880
something we should talk about everybody

00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:49,750
the cover of their next single god save

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:52,270
the queen which you know i look at that

00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:55,450
now and I'm like okay I've seen some

00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:57,340
kind of edgy artwork in my time once

00:24:55,450 --> 00:25:01,300
again I need to tell you something about

00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:03,280
England the Queen comes into our homes

00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:06,550
on Christmas Day to address the country

00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:08,950
my granddad used to stand to attention

00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:10,900
not like standing during the national

00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:14,380
anthem here at a baseball game with

00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:18,600
hotdogs and nachos and some other your

00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:18,600
funnel cake and a beer and a margarita

00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:27,010
but he would like stand to like a

00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:30,820
rigorous attention with the dissolute

00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:32,710
it's the Queen comin into our homes even

00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:35,680
I'd be walking around London sometimes

00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:38,260
with some crusty up lunatic and

00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:41,470
they'd be like scrambling around on the

00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:45,640
ground for like a half-smoked cigarette

00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:47,740
or some Sebata love cider or something

00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,560
and a cual the Queen's cars would go by

00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:52,960
all the Queen Mother and they'd stand up

00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:56,290
they'd stand up the Queen was a big

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:59,050
thing so when I first saw the cover of

00:25:56,290 --> 00:26:02,470
god save the queen I Japan it's you

00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:04,660
drawing you it's outrageous it

00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:08,160
was like when I drew Mickey Mouse ears

00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:13,330
on Chairman Mao in China it was bad

00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:17,740
um so oh if you know am was her about

00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:19,960
puts label he sold 13 million recordings

00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:22,720
he outsold the Beatles don't have to

00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:25,090
tell you guys that but there you go so

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,270
from pressure for all of the people from

00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:30,940
all the other artist signed to a.m. herb

00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:34,060
drop the Sex Pistols and we'll see him

00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:35,140
later in the story too and in the middle

00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:38,290
of all of this

00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:40,920
it's this weird kind of thing that

00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:43,300
happens in a revolution or a movement

00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:47,610
the Sex Pistols just got blamed for

00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:50,080
everything grandad upstairs putrefying

00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:52,660
the nappies that weren't getting picked

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,990
up the lack of bread the garbage in the

00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:58,270
streets it kind of boobs like the

00:26:55,990 --> 00:27:01,660
 sex pistols did it which they

00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:05,560
obviously didn't right but that that's

00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:09,250
what happened Malcolm McLaren great

00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:12,340
 manipulator and Prada of the

00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:14,320
press but not a great traditional

00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:16,210
manager self the band didn't have any

00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,220
this of the services you'd expect from

00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:21,610
any kind of management like some

00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:24,100
security or somebody with a car right so

00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:26,290
after that bill Grundy interview I think

00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:28,240
in in the weeks after one of the guys

00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:29,710
was knifed when I used to go to Gunther

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,860
grove in Chelsea which is where John

00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:34,740
still has a house to go and get paid

00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:36,850
when I when I join public image limited

00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:40,240
sometimes the door would just be off its

00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:41,860
hinges and look hello and John would

00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,610
come to the top of the stairs with a

00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:52,860
sword not like a Dungeons and Dragons a

00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:54,910
 sword it was just kind of crazy

00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:57,850
the Sex Pistols couldn't perform

00:27:54,910 --> 00:28:00,400
anywhere anymore they would do ah they

00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:04,900
would try and he shows SPO tier Sex

00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:06,310
Pistols spots under assumed name but as

00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,930
soon as anybody found out was the six

00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:10,420
process they couldn't play and the same

00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:15,660
was true for the saints in Australia the

00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:18,760
Saints couldn't play anywhere either so

00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:22,200
77 I'm not in public image limited yet

00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:26,200
I've moved to London I handed my hair

00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,880
anybody handed their hair here it's kind

00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,370
of but you know it is right you right

00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:33,310
it's like a it's basically a big pile of

00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:36,850
cow then you mix it up and stick it

00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:39,280
in your hair and it turns it red not red

00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:41,260
enough for me it was a little bit it was

00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:44,220
while I'm colorblind and it was subtle

00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:44,220
right

00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:51,530
so after two weeks I might this

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:57,200
henna I'll go Billy Idol I'll

00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:59,150

00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:02,390
called that there and I bleached my hair

00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:04,940

00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:13,070
came up from the sink here we go it's a

00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:15,919
nice day for a white wedding the

00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:18,710
bleach activated the henna and it was

00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:29,360

tourists for making the sandwiches so

00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:58,970
expensive wait but I going to work with

00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:17,929
like yeah you can't you can't do that

00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:21,140
and work for the government so anyway

00:30:17,929 --> 00:30:23,510
relax but we might fire you at some

00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:26,360
point in the next two weeks I mean it's

00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:29,150
 heavy over dyeing your hair

00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:31,039
I mean I should die every second day

00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:33,500

00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:37,580
right it's hilarious and it's awesome

00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:40,780
but this was heavy in 76 is like

00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,780
what the

00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:55,230
Isis make

00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,960
they were together

00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:08,179
I think it's a sign

00:31:08,419 --> 00:31:11,799
Oh

00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:11,799
Oh

00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:26,369
I arms so we used to get pissed off with

00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:29,369
anybody who like mess their hair up or

00:31:26,369 --> 00:31:33,089
like make made a faux hawk on a Friday

00:31:29,369 --> 00:31:37,529
night here we go you know safety

00:31:33,089 --> 00:31:39,960
pin up the nose and then flattened it

00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:41,820
out on a monday we called them the part

00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:44,099
time punks and any of us who like bleach

00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:46,769
their hair or disfigured ourselves in a

00:31:44,099 --> 00:31:48,989
more permanent way will get pissed off

00:31:46,769 --> 00:31:50,849
with a part time punks it's also

00:31:48,989 --> 00:31:53,129
interesting to note that any kind of

00:31:50,849 --> 00:31:54,950
vocal tuning guitar tuning or everybody

00:31:53,129 --> 00:31:57,239
playing in the same key seems to

00:31:54,950 --> 00:32:02,159
slightly vanished as well I love that

00:31:57,239 --> 00:32:03,809
song ah 78 this is the undertones they

00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:07,229
released a single with a guy called John

00:32:03,809 --> 00:32:10,259
Peel he gave the money to do this they

00:32:07,229 --> 00:32:13,499
didn't have money for the sleeve so they

00:32:10,259 --> 00:32:14,759
just xeroxed some posters at Kinkos or

00:32:13,499 --> 00:32:17,779
the English equivalent which was called

00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:21,239
pronto print and I love what they did

00:32:17,779 --> 00:32:23,700
aside from the art of this this is a

00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:26,999
punk thing to the undertones our

00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:29,249
you just completely grab the power from

00:32:26,999 --> 00:32:31,019
a journalist right so now a

00:32:29,249 --> 00:32:34,440
journalist from the enemy or sounds or

00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:36,719
Melody Maker can't go well in my opinion

00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,820
I've seen lots of bands and I think the

00:32:36,719 --> 00:32:42,899
undertones a like yeah now we

00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:48,570
 said that say something original

00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:49,889
you let's punk I love it so it's

00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:51,389
a do-it-yourself movement we're

00:32:49,889 --> 00:32:54,289
questioning everything with questioning

00:32:51,389 --> 00:32:54,289
authority

00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:28,649
anybody know this genre out it is of

00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:32,230
course oh okay slideshow nightmare um

00:33:28,649 --> 00:33:35,049
that was punk you know I son Harrison

00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:37,179
had the cars on his ipod driving up from

00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:39,669
Chicago and it just sounds like

00:33:37,179 --> 00:33:43,179
bubblegum pop to me now the cars were

00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:45,970
punk like weirdly but this is the

00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:48,100
stranglers from 78 golden brown and it's

00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:51,299
punk because it was the stranglers and

00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:54,190
it's a song about heroin golden brown

00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:57,070
it's like weird Elvis Costello and

00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:58,720
Alison if you listen to that and umg

00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:05,110
won't let us because they're

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:06,549
arseholes ah listen except in tune with

00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:08,980
the guitar and Elvis Costello slightly

00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:12,310
different glasses ah it's just a

00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:14,829
country western singalong song but we

00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:16,589
are Punk it isn't that it's just

00:34:14,829 --> 00:34:19,329
weird to me to just think about that

00:34:16,589 --> 00:34:22,169
Elvis Costello was Punk but if you if

00:34:19,329 --> 00:34:24,940
you listen without watching it wasn't

00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:27,669
it's just weird don't have any

00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:29,589
conclusions it's not just record labels

00:34:27,669 --> 00:34:32,800
of music clothes brands and publications

00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:34,119

00:34:53,169 --> 00:34:57,970
of basically a film canister with the

00:34:55,899 --> 00:35:00,490
logo of the band embossed in the lid

00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:04,810

brownie with the pill logo look just you

00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:21,359

00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:33,180
Vivian Goldman who's touring right now

00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:36,660

00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:28,500
really nice 35 mil camera and just took

00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:32,280
shots whenever I felt like it yes this

00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:36,990
is yeah if any of you were ever wondered

00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:40,200
how much snot can actually hang off your

00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:50,430
nose before it falls off well as the

00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:52,920
answer about 10 inches yeah in 2006 I go

00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:55,740
across to China and I stumble across a

00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,720
club called d22 it's a kind of a punk

00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:02,310
club that was set up very much like

00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:04,980
CBGB's I made an album of my own and

00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:07,320
recorded a bang called snap line which

00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:10,940
is now a favorite of CMOS teens which is

00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:13,890
kind of like oh how weird is that

00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:16,800
they've just are performed itself by

00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:19,200
southwest in 2012 and I released a red

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,840
vinyl 7 inch it wasn't until I did it

00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,460
and actually put this lecture together

00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,950
that I realized I'd copied the

00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:27,420
undertones and I bought these posters

00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:29,540
these posters from the Cultural

00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:32,070
Revolution and folded them up and

00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:36,690
basically copied teenage kicks from the

00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:39,630
undertones I gave her video camera to G

00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:41,550
Chen the singer from snap line ah which

00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:43,590
is kind of a punk thing to do the first

00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:46,350
thing he filmed at d22 was the New York

00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:47,910
Dolls performing acoustically it was

00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:49,800
kind of interesting I think a couple

00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:51,810
people said to me as I handed this guy a

00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:55,020
video camera not a particularly good one

00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:57,690
a mini DV cassette tape video

00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:59,250
camera what are you doing giving you

00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:01,350
might never see that camera again I

00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:03,000
don't care about the camera he sent me

00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:04,920
the tapes of the New York Dolls

00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,350
performing acoustically it's kind of

00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:09,560
awesome i wrote a second book and i give

00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:14,330
that away i think that's punk as

00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:17,730
and where's the influence of punk now

00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:21,210
threadless punk as those guys are

00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:24,480

Rotten lives down the street from Herb

00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:02,670
Alpert

00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:05,960
I wish I had a tape recording like we

00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,880
not going to do his accent so yeah keep

00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:17,310
coming down pacific coast highway they

00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:21,810
take that left after Trancas market not

00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:24,900
the first house that's about hurts you

00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:31,620
coming up like you you

00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:34,950
Malibu punk is now a beer what

00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:36,540
the what what it should be is like

00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:42,510
nothing inside it's not a beer off

00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:46,200
that's it you too beer what

00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:51,830
would Johnny Rotten say now do i buy

00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:51,830
country life butter because it's British

00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:57,230
bye-bye country life because I yearn for

00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:57,230
the British countryside

00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:05,360
no because he's made only from British

00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,360
milk

00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:13,160
now I by country life because I think it

00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:22,450
tastes a bus stops Matt Great Britain so

00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:31,279
that great butter people's heads

00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:34,759
exploded well he saw that huh yeah

00:42:31,279 --> 00:42:37,789
well act now is actually his wife Nora

00:42:34,759 --> 00:42:40,309
owns the largest daily newspaper in

00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:42,109
Germany the toga Spiegel so their

00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:48,589
neighbor isn't the next castle down the

00:42:42,109 --> 00:42:52,430
Rhine is mr. Beck yeah so yeah he didn't

00:42:48,589 --> 00:42:54,200
need to do that of course how weird to

00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:56,240
go from being attacked by the police and

00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:58,759
stabbed in the street to becoming a

00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:05,960
spokesperson for English dairy products

00:42:58,759 --> 00:43:11,440
and sales went up sixty percent so punk

00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:11,440
is a beer at least we still have anarchy

00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:28,720
don't we it's not complicated it's a new

00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:28,720
fragrance relax

00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:51,610
yeah Aniki for him what will you shout

00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:55,630
like it like that has anything to do

00:43:51,610 --> 00:44:03,100
with anything in your future today but

00:43:55,630 --> 00:44:08,230
girls don't worry yeah I Nikki for her

00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:09,880
and icky for her but no no no no no

00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:12,550
here's the thing though I think this is

00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:14,410
a rip off because I think they both

00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:18,720
smell exactly the same what do you what

00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:21,870
do you what do you think they both smell

00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:31,780
exact right what do you think okay look

00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:35,340
don't don't look at the can just don't

00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:35,340
smell it you walk through the cloud

00:44:45,250 --> 00:45:19,609
hahahaha it just hangs doesn't it it

00:44:58,369 --> 00:45:21,170
just has unexpected lessons no but a few

00:45:19,609 --> 00:45:25,790
people down the front actually needed

00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:27,680
that I mean you know no that's one of

00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:30,530
the reasons that Jim invite me said look

00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,849
things get a bit stinky about two-thirds

00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:33,950
of the way through the if you can come

00:45:31,849 --> 00:45:35,720
and do that spray thing it's a great way

00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:41,180
to keep everybody smelling fresh and

00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:43,190
keep networking unexpected lessons I

00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:45,410
don't know what they are solar okay

00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:47,660
alright so the first time I did this

00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:51,140
lecture it was like four or five slides

00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:54,589
whatever I end my lecture and I say so

00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:56,270
that is why punk is unique it's never

00:45:54,589 --> 00:45:58,250
happened before it'll never happen again

00:45:56,270 --> 00:46:01,130
nobody's ever done it one of a kind

00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:02,510
thing and there it is punk the socio

00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:09,310
economic backdrop to the punk rock

00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:11,960
revolution today and Ken Lopez says says

00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:16,910
does that remind the class of anything

00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:18,890
and I'm like ah point of order ken how

00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:20,720
could it remind anybody of anything

00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:22,550
because it's unique it's never happened

00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:24,140
before it happened one time it was all

00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:27,140
so many happening there it is and

00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:33,530
someone in the class says ah reminds me

00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:35,180
the Delta blues I'm like ah what and

00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:37,369
then they kind of told me why it

00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:42,650
reminded them of the Delta blues and I'm

00:46:37,369 --> 00:46:44,960
like oh and I love learning

00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:46,520
 not particularly like that on stage

00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,940
in front of a bunch of students looking

00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,940
like an idiot

00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:56,220
but yeah a tired of the Unruh and they

00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:59,280
were talking about the the economic
