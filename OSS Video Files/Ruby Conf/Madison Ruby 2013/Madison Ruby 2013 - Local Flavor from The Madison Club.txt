had worse and not so we we know Andrew

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,160
because he is if the brother of a

00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,679
co-worker but also the executive chef at

00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:48,530
at the Madison club which I'll let you

00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:51,980
talk about what the Madison club is but

00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:54,500
just hearing Andrews story he turned out

00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:57,879
to be the perfect person for this slot

00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:06,140
so ladies and gentlemen Andrew Wilson oh

00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:08,510
thank you yeah so I'm executive chef at

00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,820
the Madison Club which is a private

00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:14,300
social and dining club here downtown

00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:16,520
Madison Wisconsin it's it's a unique

00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:19,430
situation is an executive chef to be a

00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:23,840
private club chef just because we are

00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:25,460
only open for a set group of clientele

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,549
you know as people who pay dues and our

00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,810
members that come so that it makes it

00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:30,979
challenging in that we're not open to

00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,869
the general public so we have to really

00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:35,990
kind of focus our efforts and the people

00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:39,290
that that we have the Madison club has

00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:43,219
been around of a 103 years something

00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:44,960
like that it's right next door to the

00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:46,909
monona terrace so it has beautiful lake

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,909
views I think it's really unique in that

00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:52,009
that it has a great location in downtown

00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:55,310
mass and so I think that's definitely

00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:57,140
one of our our big advantages and then I

00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,789
know for me when I started there was

00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,590
confusing because i kind of said well

00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:02,119
you don't have a golf course or tennis

00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,250
courts or something and because it's not

00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:06,979
a country club it's a city club so we

00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:09,500
really focus more in events and dining

00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:11,830
and you know because of that the

00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:15,040
culinary operations tend to be pretty

00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:18,890
robust in a little bit more dynamic I

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,030
was planning on maybe bringing uh I

00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:23,660
should have brought food it sounds like

00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:25,400
now but I was I was thinking about

00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,830
bringing on my knives and maybe doing

00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,170
them

00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,000
in there but like with my nerves and my

00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,370
luck I'd walk out of here short a couple

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,480
fingers and so I saw him scheduled or

00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,010
something tomorrow called eight fingered

00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,010
chef I don't know what that's all about

00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,990
but I took it to be a very ominous sign

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:46,710
and I stay it away from that idea

00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:49,230
altogether I am a chef so I started you

00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:52,170
know just as a cook in the kitchen so

00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,940
definitely being out in front of people

00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:56,340
like this is not my natural environment

00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:59,820
I enjoy being behind the stove more than

00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,780
anything but it's definitely been fun

00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,570
for me to kind of grow professionally

00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,910
challenge myself there yeah as far as

00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:10,740
i'll just talk a little bit about my

00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:12,240
story i started it really what I wanted

00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,580
focus on is I talked about kind of my

00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,100
career my story is just a I'm the fact

00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:19,320
of mentors and all these different

00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,030
mentors that I have had along my career

00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,300
and we focus on three of them and so the

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:26,550
first chef that I work for is a shepherd

00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,800
pie eater of four restaurants in

00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:31,470
sheboygan wisconsin and i started there

00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,459
at trattoria Stefan owns his name is

00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:37,260
Stefano via lady it's a regional Italian

00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:39,209
restaurant that's pretty well fairly

00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:42,150
well known within the state and he does

00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:44,959
a just a fantastic job and great food

00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:47,940
and he was doing the whole local food

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,370
organic thing years ago before it was

00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:54,540
hit before it was trendy just because

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:56,670
that was the Italian ideal you you bring

00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,500
the best of what's in season and you

00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,390
seek out things that you know where they

00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,239
came from and you know that they're of

00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:05,489
the highest quality and because of that

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:08,580
prepared simple your food is amazing so

00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:09,750
I think for a start for me I couldn't

00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,000
have asked for anything better just

00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:15,450
because he was such a or he is such a

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,220
passionate individual and we spend 45

00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,479
minutes before service when everybody

00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,700
had other things to be doing and he

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,830
would just be talking about the

00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:25,650
provenance of a specific ingredient or

00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:28,410
the history and cultural significance of

00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:30,870
a dish from northern Italy so I think to

00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:33,090
get that background was great and it was

00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:36,450
you know it was more laid back as more

00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:38,580
of a family oriented thing so we didn't

00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,510
call him chef I didn't know all these

00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,610
French term

00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:43,440
that I know now as far as knife cuts and

00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,610
no DeBruyn woz was we just had to cut

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,660
the carrots real small for the pasta

00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:52,440
sauce that's all we knew it and so I

00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:55,020
spent four years there and some of my

00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,020
fondest memories of being a cook he

00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:01,500
opened a second restaurant which is a

00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:04,110
Neapolitan style pizzeria Neapolitan

00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:07,760
style pizzas from the natalie coast and

00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:10,110
it's some is a specific style of pizza

00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,240
certain toppings and ingredients are

00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:15,660
used and so there's actually national or

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,640
international register of of those and

00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:21,000
we were six in the united states to join

00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:23,610
that he had brought a gentleman pepe

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,400
over from Italy the guy didn't speak any

00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:27,960
italian he he trained us how to make

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,130
pizza is he been doing it for 30 years

00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:33,990
in Positano Italy and so that was an

00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,880
amazing experience to especially be

00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:37,140
yelled at by a guy in Italian and not

00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,770
know what he's saying you but you

00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,760
knowing that you're messing the pizza up

00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:43,770
it was it seem like it's a different

00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,540
training project process over there I

00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,770
think at one point he burned one of the

00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,020
guys with something out of the oven

00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:50,160
because he was so upset we just kind of

00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:55,170
kept their heads down we made the pizza

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:57,540
so I at it and in Stefano one of the

00:05:55,170 --> 00:06:00,120
really amazing things about he was so

00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:02,010
passionate that he would he would take

00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,920
staff members and when the restaurant

00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:06,540
was small and young early on they would

00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,460
close down for a week or two and summer

00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:10,170
and you buy everybody plane ticket Italy

00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:12,570
and they go over Italy and just see how

00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:15,840
things were done you know at the source

00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:17,270
and and I being young and foolish was 19

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,340
and some friends move in California I

00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:23,250
jumped on that bandwagon and probably

00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,990
missed my ticket to Italy but I've taken

00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:27,120
me a California I lived on the Central

00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:30,350
Coast of California for a while and

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,570
worked in a few restaurants there and

00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:35,370
the second place I worked there was a

00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:38,160
boutique hotel spa resort called czekam

00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:43,320
Sycamore mineral springs it was a unique

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:45,720
place it had yoga and massage therapy

00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,070
and we kind of did is right in the

00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,240
middle of wine country in Central Coast

00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,560
so we definitely did kind of wine

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,840
country food we didn't didn't

00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,340
necessarily do health and wellness food

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,870
but it was there they met

00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:57,780
I can mentor I really want to talk about

00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:59,910
his name is chef David mcwilliam and he

00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:02,910
was a graduate of the Culinary Institute

00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:05,130
of America the CIA and so he was one the

00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:08,040
really kind of he really took the time

00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:09,000
and trusted the the kid from Sheboygan

00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,979
who didn't really know what he was

00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,139
talking about took me under his wing and

00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:14,940
really showed me a lot of things but

00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:17,610
more importantly I think taught me how

00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,900
to manage how to be a leader because he

00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,220
was just a type of guy that could just

00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,229
command the kitchen with his presence

00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:26,250
and we also had fun we had fun doing it

00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:27,479
it was it was a fun spot there we and I

00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:31,380
really got to see the bounty of

00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:33,690
California produce we had almost three

00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:35,910
acres of gardens that were grown

00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:38,400
specifically for for our hotel for the

00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:40,320
restaurant and I mean with more tomato

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,270
as the first year any idea what to do

00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,700
with but it really drove our creativity

00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:46,440
to know that you had to go out you know

00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,270
the three hours you have before service

00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,560
to get all your things ready to get your

00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:52,260
meats and plants that's all your

00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,360
ingredients all your stuff set up in

00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:56,070
front of you which is kind of you know

00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,450
aunty Bourdain in this books talks about

00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,669
that just being it cooks religion the

00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:01,740
meats and plots the needs as we call it

00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:03,000
just it's what you live and breathe so

00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,100
we'd be focused on getting that setup

00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,979
and have to take time out and drive a

00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,720
golf cart half a mile down the road to

00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:12,630
the gardens and harvest tomatoes and

00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,979
bring them back to the to the restaurant

00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:16,950
and figure out what to do with them so

00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:18,510
that that really was one of the first

00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:20,070
places I saw you know kind that level of

00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:22,320
creativity under pressure and the

00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:24,810
necessity of that you know in the chef's

00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:27,750
repertoire and so I spent a few years

00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:29,550
out in California enjoyed it but

00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,710
definitely kind of for whatever reason

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,360
began to start missing seasons it's one

00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:36,180
of the things I love about Wisconsin so

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,650
much is the seasons it makes a it makes

00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:40,010
everything so much more dramatic when

00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:42,089
you have asparagus you have asparagus

00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:44,490
randomly you know could be March it

00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:45,959
could be May and it's only in season for

00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:48,029
a little bit a little bit of time so you

00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:49,230
just you get after it and we put in

00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:50,360
everything and then and then we're done

00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,770
with it we move on to the next thing

00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,709
California miss Ferris becoming februari

00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:57,720
and be great you know for months same

00:08:55,709 --> 00:09:01,709
with tomatoes things like that and so I

00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:03,959
think Wisconsin in the climate really

00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:05,910
has given me a greater appreciation for

00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:09,900
seasonal cooking because it

00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:12,330
just harsher season's so from signor

00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,160
meadow springs in California I went and

00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:16,710
moved back yard to Madison Wisconsin

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,220
when from originally and that's when I

00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:22,350
ended up at the Madison club I never

00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:25,320
pictured myself ending up at a private

00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:27,050
club I here I am and I've learned to

00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,610
embrace it and love it for what it is

00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:32,670
and when I started there as working for

00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:35,280
a gentleman chef Dan Fox and then use

00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:37,710
the next guys really had one of the

00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:40,680
biggest influences I would say my career

00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,850
thus far and he was executive chef there

00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,060
he's a young guy who's only a couple

00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:46,350
years older than me and he's actually

00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,790
just about to open a restaurant here in

00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,070
Madison in about a week I wish I could

00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:51,570
plug it was open but it's it's called

00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,800
the heritage tavern and it's going to be

00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:55,050
open about weekend I know it's going to

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:59,790
be the best restaurant in town without a

00:09:55,050 --> 00:10:02,340
doubt and uh it was him where I really

00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:05,180
saw you know just the level of just

00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:08,460
dedication to to being local into

00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:10,170
seeking out the best ingredients but to

00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:12,120
really forging relationships with the

00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:14,490
farmers I mean that's that's what I

00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,620
enjoy now at the club is being able to

00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,060
have there's different producers or

00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,640
farmers and they come to me and we'll

00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,500
have a dialogue at some points at the

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,360
start of the growing season what we need

00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,480
what we want to put on a menu what we

00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:30,810
like to see and so having that kind of

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:33,630
connection to to the food and to just

00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:36,360
the sense of place is fantastic so I I

00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:37,920
definitely saw that in him and then he's

00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,870
a type of guy where he got so obsessed

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,170
with a certain thing which it was

00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:44,910
heritage breed pigs kind of rare breed

00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:47,760
pigs or pigs that aren't bread anymore

00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:50,100
for just for commercial reasons that

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,560
they have too much fat or they you know

00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,790
grow too fast or too slow or whatever it

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,920
may be and there's you know there's a

00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:58,320
the heritage pigs that that's a broad

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,500
category of a lot of different types and

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,940
so he got interested in them enough to

00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,880
the point where he didn't want to have

00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:07,530
to go and try to buy what he wanted the

00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:10,500
pork that he wanted he decided to start

00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:13,320
growing raising the the pork anyone so

00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,870
he partnered with a local farmer and

00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,480
bought some pigs in the

00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:20,420
went from one pig in three years later

00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,070
he had over 150 and now he's opening a

00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:27,320
restaurant and he's still selling pigs

00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:30,410
to me so that I think was just seeing

00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:35,570
that from start to finish was very

00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:38,029
important for me and we we got into the

00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:40,100
habit of taking staff field trips we one

00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:41,870
of the most important ones we did we

00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,930
went to a local farm font prairie farms

00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:46,339
and he had partnered with a guy who had

00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:49,100
worked as a butcher in Italy for six

00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:51,589
months making charcuterie making

00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:54,620
prosciuttos hams all these uh you know

00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:57,140
beautiful Italian products and we went

00:11:54,620 --> 00:12:00,529
to the farm and we harvested a pig and

00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:02,089
we were in there from you know the start

00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:03,980
all the way through to the salami and we

00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:06,560
made head cheese and we learned how to

00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:09,290
not waste a single scrap on the animal

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,570
everything went into a stock or a pate

00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:14,870
or a salami or terrine and just seeing

00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:17,180
that level of sustainability and just

00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:19,550
you know a whole hog hooking that you

00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:22,790
can have when you really are starting

00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:28,070
with a quality product that was raised

00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:29,690
and dispatched in a humane way that was

00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:31,010
I think the biggest lesson I take away

00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:34,190
from my time-honored an but then you

00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:36,950
know he was a guy who was trained by a

00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:39,770
bunch of real classic French French

00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:42,050
chefs and so I really went back and kind

00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:44,150
of reread a scoff EA Escoffier is one of

00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:46,490
the most famous French chefs of all

00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:47,779
times kind of the he's a guy really set

00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:50,680
up the whole system is the reason you

00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:55,130
have chefs and sous chefs and all that

00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:56,839
so getting that for from Dan was a was

00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:59,480
really important at that point in time

00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:01,580
where I kind of really and I know what I

00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,410
want to come back to Wisconsin because

00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:06,020
it was home and because there was family

00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:08,020
here and I missed a lot of people is at

00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,890
that point that I think from

00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:12,290
professional from a culinary standpoint

00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:17,089
I really fell in love with the area we

00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:19,430
have the biggest producer driven farmers

00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:21,200
market in the country everybody out

00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:22,640
there and it's getting to the point now

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,980
where I walk around and I know people

00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,459
and and I know their story and I know

00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:28,730
their name

00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:31,069
and I know exactly where I have to go to

00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:33,740
avoid the crowd and just by the hickory

00:13:31,069 --> 00:13:35,240
nuts and get out of there which has been

00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,149
incredibly helpful for me because I

00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:42,019
don't like to wake up early on saturdays

00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:44,329
and so that that that's a wonderful

00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:45,829
thing the proximity of the Manson club

00:13:44,329 --> 00:13:47,779
to that we're about two blocks off that

00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:49,339
and then Wednesdays we have literally

00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:52,749
read our front door another farmers

00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:56,929
market which is just as fantastic and

00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:59,360
then in Madison also i think is just

00:13:56,929 --> 00:14:01,399
really we have an incredible amount of

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,339
restaurants per capita I mean there's

00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:06,189
there's days that I wish the Madison

00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:08,509
club was it was a public restaurant

00:14:06,189 --> 00:14:11,209
because we do fly under the radar a

00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:12,769
little bit but I do get to get out and

00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:14,509
be involved in the community these are a

00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:17,179
lot of you know initiatives we've kind

00:14:14,509 --> 00:14:18,769
of started the club of being more

00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:20,269
involved with the local food Kamini

00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:22,220
working with other chefs getting our

00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:23,629
name out there because I show up to

00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,369
these things of people go where are you

00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:27,350
you guys are and we have to go through

00:14:25,369 --> 00:14:28,879
explain it and just nobody knows that we

00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:30,319
exist because it's a private club and

00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:33,649
then they're upset then they find out

00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:34,790
that they can't eat there it doesn't

00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:37,910
always work well as far as selling

00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:39,290
memberships but we do our best and so

00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:42,350
that's been a great thing I think

00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:44,929
there's a fantastic community of local

00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:46,850
chefs I know Tori milleri won the James

00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:49,100
Beard Award Best Chef Midwest seeing a

00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:53,629
guy from Wisconsin take that I was

00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:56,389
fantastic we hosted a very big event for

00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:58,610
his / close to 500 people at the Madison

00:14:56,389 --> 00:15:01,279
Club this past March called slow pig

00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:04,549
this was actually my former chef Dan Fox

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:07,100
had put this together again to showcases

00:15:04,549 --> 00:15:09,529
heritage breed pigs but just to put more

00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:14,809
of an emphasis on that concept of slow

00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:17,209
food and of doing things the way it used

00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:20,809
to be and not shipping in your asparagus

00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:24,470
from Peru in November and not serving

00:15:20,809 --> 00:15:26,779
tomatoes from Mexico and in March things

00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:28,100
like that so that's where you know

00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:32,059
that's where we've really came to as a

00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:33,860
club and so I'm you know I owe so much

00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:36,769
to him in that he really turned the

00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:38,899
place over to me in a great spot where i

00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,220
can just kind of continue

00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:43,129
to focus in on the things that we've

00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:45,199
done well and improve on them and build

00:15:43,129 --> 00:15:47,509
a team that I can rely on because I

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,579
think one of the things that inspires me

00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:51,619
most in food beyond all the ingredients

00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:54,499
in the history and all that is really

00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:57,800
the the teamwork of it the team

00:15:54,499 --> 00:15:59,980
atmosphere it you know cooking really is

00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,389
it is a team sport you have to have

00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:04,160
everybody working towards the same goal

00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:05,420
and so the camaraderie in the kitchen

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,610
has been something I feel like I've

00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:11,779
always I've always enjoyed and thrived

00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:15,139
on so you know I look forward to another

00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:17,089
you know to helping the club move into

00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:22,399
another hundred years we'll see how that

00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:25,309
goes but I again I just think that for

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:29,089
us to remain you know viable as a

00:16:25,309 --> 00:16:32,360
private club in a down economy is to get

00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:34,910
out there and be be on the cutting edge

00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,369
of food and be you know more

00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:39,949
forward-thinking and and really get

00:16:37,369 --> 00:16:41,689
involved with the community even though

00:16:39,949 --> 00:16:46,279
you know our model isn't that of a

00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:48,889
public restaurant so I really think you

00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:50,600
know the the course in my career I kind

00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:52,339
of just want to have to sit back and

00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,610
think of what I want to talk about here

00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:57,980
it was just pinpointing those those

00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:00,290
points where I kind of had somebody look

00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:03,319
at me recognize some kind of talent and

00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:05,630
then take the time to appreciate that I

00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:07,819
mean I go back to to Stefano that first

00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:10,699
chef and I had started there as a busboy

00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:11,959
and worked as a dishwasher at switched

00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:13,880
to washing dishes at some point just

00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:15,500
because I didn't like the front of the

00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,480
house aspect of it just wasn't for me

00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:21,620
and so around the time I turned 18 I

00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:25,669
wanted to I wanted to make more money

00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:28,610
and I wanted to so I asked him if I if I

00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:30,140
could do wait if I wait tables they're

00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:32,210
gonna be a surfer and it was at that

00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,380
point you look at me and said he's like

00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:35,270
you don't want to be a server I'm

00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,590
telling you just trust me on this one

00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,630
you wanna be a cook I'll start training

00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:41,990
on salads and I really went from there

00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:45,860
and so that's been you know as I move

00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:47,330
now into the role of hiring younger

00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,919
cooks and training them that's that's

00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:50,570
one of the biggest lessons I've taken

00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:51,440
away from my experience is to really

00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:55,730
take

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:59,629
time to recognize the talent and support

00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:01,009
it in the people around you so you know

00:17:59,629 --> 00:18:03,500
hopefully something that can relate to

00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:05,720
the things that you do I you know I

00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:08,029
think a lot of you a lot chefs try to

00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,889
relate cooking to other things and I

00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:11,000
think it isn't always accurate or

00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:14,149
successful but I think there are

00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:18,950
parallels there as far as just kind of

00:18:14,149 --> 00:18:20,960
the teamwork in that emphasis on

00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:23,360
mentoring in a professional atmosphere

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,210
so thank you guys very much for

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,129
listening to me ramble on about my story

00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:29,779
it might not be the most interesting but

00:18:28,129 --> 00:18:33,100
I hope you enjoy the rest of time here

00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:33,100
and I really appreciate it thank you

00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:43,990
