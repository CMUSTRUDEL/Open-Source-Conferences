Title: MadisonRuby 2013 - Open Sourcing Mental Illness by Edward Finkler
Publication date: 2020-01-28
Playlist: Madison Ruby 2013
Description: 
	In the spirit of open source, I'd like to shine a spotlight on depression. Not because it's easy, but because it's important. Mental illness affects many of us, but the stigma attached to it dissuades most people from talking about it openly. That's not how we make progress. With this talk, I want to do my part. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was thirteen, and I've been struggling with it my whole life. In this talk, I'll discuss how it has impacted my work as a developer, husband, and father. By speaking openly about my own challenges and successes, I hope those struggling with mental illness will learn how to be happier and more productive, and others can better understand how to be helpful and supportive.

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:45,780
or a couple really and i want to talk to

00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,640
you today really as a person I'm not a

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,030
doctor I don't have any training in

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,040
mental health I'm just a person who's

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:57,839
kind of dealing with this since I was a

00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:59,040
kid about 12 13 years old and I'm just

00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:00,239
kind of going to talk about what it's

00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,839
like to have a mental illness from

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:07,140
mental illness from my perspective and

00:01:03,839 --> 00:01:08,850
hopefully it'll uh you know folks can

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,860
gain some insight from that learn some

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,060
things from that so I'm going to talk

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,570
about a little bit about sort of my what

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:18,840
my diagnosis are I have something called

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,520
generalized anxiety disorder and that

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,689
was something I was sort of diagnosed

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,070
with later on it also dealt with

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:25,680
depression a lot during my life and that

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:27,560
was initially when I was younger that

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,460
was the thing I struggled with the most

00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:35,070
so generalized anxiety disorder adult

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,469
a.d.d is something I struggled with it

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,329
seems like i don't know if it's if the

00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:40,979
the percentages are really higher but

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:45,929
seems like a lot of developer types have

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:47,520
issues with attention stuff but i have

00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:51,600
adult a.d.d i was diagnosed with i was

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,250
27 I think I had it my whole life and it

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,729
would have been helpful if I'd known

00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:59,609
about like when I was in school I when I

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:02,009
was at school I often was the first guy

00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:03,420
or are you excuse me I I had a lot of

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:05,789
trouble getting homework done and things

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,320
like that I don't think in my high

00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:09,149
school career I ever finished all the

00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,750
homework that I ever had once a night

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:14,040
and I remember in my in the class of my

00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,510
graduating class at high school I had

00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,630
like the third lowest GPA and a third

00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:25,080
highest SATs score it's kind of funny

00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:25,770
but but yeah meds that I take which I've

00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,270
got to go

00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,740
to go through fast but I take medication

00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:32,160
as part of the therapy and part of the

00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,630
way that I engage with my treatment and

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,160
these are the things that I take I take

00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,620
something called lexapro which is an

00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,080
SSRI selective serotonin reuptake

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:43,230
inhibitor is basically next-generation

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,930
kind of stuff that if you've probably

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,430
heard prozac it is a drug in the same

00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,680
classes that works basically the same

00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:52,260
way boo spar is something I take for

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,070
anxiety but it also seems to have an

00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:58,620
enhancing effect with SSRIs and you'll

00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:00,750
often find actually as a side note that

00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,030
when people talk about how these drugs

00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,800
work they also say it seems to even like

00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,720
doctors and scientists and stuff like

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,520
that because they go 100-percent really

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,170
understand why it works away those but

00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,900
they kind I think it works a certain way

00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:16,560
I also take strattera show Tara I take

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:19,080
for a DD and it helps me have my focus

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,820
be a little bit better I might have a

00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,320
day that doesn't go well as opposed to

00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:26,300
like two or three weeks where I just

00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:28,170
read news feeds instead of working and

00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,610
strattera is quite interesting because

00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:31,590
it's I believes the only thing on the

00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:34,110
market right now at least in the United

00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:36,030
States that's you can use to treat a DD

00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:40,830
it's prescribed to treat a DD that's not

00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:42,030
an amphetamine and I have tried I start

00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,580
off taking adderall which is a really

00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:47,670
common thing to take for a TD which is

00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,050
an amphetamine after a month I didn't

00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,450
really like it it sort of just made me

00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:53,310
anxious but different people different

00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,570
kinds of things and I take klonopin

00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:58,350
which is kind of an as-needed thing

00:03:54,570 --> 00:04:00,050
which is a a tranquilizer it is similar

00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:03,209
to things like xanax or stuff like that

00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:05,250
I took one this morning because I am

00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:07,080
super nervous about giving this talk and

00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,120
i usually do before i give a talk and it

00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,950
kind of calms me down and helps me not

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,450
have gigantic freak-outs about stuff

00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:17,419
that don't really deserve gigantic freak

00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:21,150
outs to get into kind of what it's like

00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:23,370
for me I think it breaks down on a

00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:26,010
couple different ways I think the first

00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,810
thing that I deal with is this intensity

00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:30,350
of emotion and if you've ever seen the

00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:35,250
movie kill bill and there's these parts

00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:38,370
there's a part when uma thurman's

00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:39,569
character like like the color the screen

00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,449
changes and she's real

00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:46,319
really like mad and it starts going it's

00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:49,199
like that a little bit you get real like

00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,569
it for me the things that their hardest

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,580
is went is that i will feel like sort of

00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:54,990
a wave of emotion come on and that's

00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:58,169
usually something where i'm very

00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:59,969
frustrated or very upset about something

00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:02,789
and i feel kind of out of control of it

00:04:59,969 --> 00:05:04,649
and the the challenging thing with it is

00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:06,539
that it feels like a wave that I have to

00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:09,149
just kind of let go and stop and and

00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:13,979
wait for it to pass and even though I

00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:15,779
consciously no I'm not I'm not in a good

00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:17,520
place to make sort of good decisions or

00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:19,860
things like that or say the right thing

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,559
or stuff like that I'm so driven by my

00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,879
emotion and it feels so strong that I

00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:26,699
feel like I have to just kind of cut

00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:28,020
myself off and if I don't cut myself off

00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:31,139
I'm going to say something very hurtful

00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,369
or I'm going to do something very bad so

00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:34,169
that's that's the thing that I struggle

00:05:32,369 --> 00:05:37,080
with a lot is this very really strong

00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:40,409
intensity of emotion where you sort of

00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,149
feel out of control with that and then

00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:43,229
you know I talked about it probably the

00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:45,659
biggest thing idealist is this

00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:47,189
generalized anxiety disorder and the

00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:52,559
anxiety is something that I struggle

00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:53,969
with all the time the i guess the

00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:57,959
difference that i would describe it as

00:05:53,969 --> 00:06:00,360
is that it's not this sort of being

00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:01,740
somebody told me said I find the

00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,209
challenge to be explained to folks how

00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,949
it's not like their anxiety about a job

00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:06,839
interview or mondays or stuff like that

00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:11,930
it's not kind of being like a little bit

00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:14,809
nervous about stuff it's sometimes it's

00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:17,159
it's having a really really extreme

00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:19,589
stress reaction or a fight-or-flight

00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:24,539
kind of reaction in situations where

00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:26,550
it's not appropriate like how should I

00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:30,329
describe you have a if you have a

00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:31,860
situation where like I well I get

00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:34,409
nervous a lot about traveling it's not

00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,029
actually about it's not actually about

00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:37,979
like the process of traveling like I'm

00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:39,869
not afraid to get on planes and fly that

00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:41,969
actually doesn't bother me very much but

00:06:39,869 --> 00:06:43,379
it's the it's the I get worried about

00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:44,669
like that I'm not going to have my stuff

00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:46,169
together like I'm not going to have all

00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:47,339
the documents that I'm supposed to have

00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:48,659
and I'm not going to pack the right

00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:50,159
stuff or I'm going to forget like the

00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:53,400
power supply for my computer and stuff

00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:57,930
like that and so the reaction

00:06:53,400 --> 00:07:00,120
I have to that can be like say a week

00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:02,759
before that's going to happen I will

00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,380
have a really i will start feeling

00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:10,710
really extreme levels of stress I'll

00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:12,210
start sweating all I have these you know

00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:15,330
sort of physical manifestations where I

00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:17,490
get a real tightness like right the

00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:19,229
bottom my sternum and it feels like if

00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,419
you have like rope and you have a broken

00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:26,310
and not your kind of twisting it rubbing

00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:30,570
on it's painful and you can't get rid of

00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:33,449
it I guess the thing is kind of like is

00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:34,800
like I'm having it's it's it's so

00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:36,960
extreme that it's the kind of stuff

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,030
where it would be appropriate if I was a

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:43,020
client if you know 10,000 years ago I

00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:44,520
was like fighting a mastodon or like a

00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,979
line was going to eat me or something

00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:50,430
like that but the problem is I'm having

00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:51,930
that about things like I'm afraid that

00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:54,900
I'll forget to print out my boarding

00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:57,630
pass right and and so that's that's the

00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:59,910
kind of struggles that it's not there in

00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:02,310
a sense they are natural reactions these

00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:04,169
are reactions that are encoded into our

00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:05,870
bodies I think but the problem is that

00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:09,030
I'm having them at inappropriate times

00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:11,130
times where it becomes it becomes

00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:13,409
crippling because you cannot do things

00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:15,810
that are sort of like normal expected

00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:18,000
things for you to do to that you should

00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:22,349
be okay with and doing in our society in

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,940
our culture so yeah I have problems

00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:25,710
focusing and I talked about adult a.d.d

00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:28,590
and that's something that I struggle

00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:30,150
with to a fair extreme either cetera

00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:33,360
seems to help me quite a bit but

00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:35,550
generally it's that feeling like it was

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,099
particularly bad before I had any kind

00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:43,409
of medication i'm sure i was i was

00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:45,660
diagnosed with this i had extreme

00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:47,700
problems like doing anything i didn't

00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,920
feel like i wanted to do like I wasn't

00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,990
strongly motivated to do it was very

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,610
hard for me to do things like complete

00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:56,670
homework assignments and things like

00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:58,770
that complete reading assignments things

00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:02,279
of that nature College was something

00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:04,500
where it like I was good enough at doing

00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:05,670
things to half-ass my way through it so

00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:11,040
I got a degree

00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:12,540
um but I through not having the kind of

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,070
skills add never having developed

00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,570
certain skills for in terms of studying

00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,280
things like that not learning really how

00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:19,050
to cope with that not having any kind of

00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,790
medication to help with my focus levels

00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,290
it was often things that were

00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:24,600
particularly challenging for me too I

00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:26,490
where I really had to sit down and like

00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,470
it was a concept I didn't understand and

00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:30,150
I really had to work at that that was

00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:32,130
something I had a lot of trouble with

00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:33,930
unless I was just deeply motivated to do

00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:35,400
that and I wasn't I was interested in

00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:37,950
doing things like writing music and

00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:43,050
stuff like that and not so much about

00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:45,090
like learning 68,000 assembler code so i

00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:47,460
did really really really bad in my CS

00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:53,820
classes which is why i got a degree in

00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:55,890
english so and I don't regret that I

00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,890
don't regret that I got a minor in CS

00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:00,450
but I got a c-minus and assembler and I

00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:03,030
actually had to go to the professor one

00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:04,920
day and say if I'm going to get worse

00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:07,020
than a c-minus could you please fail me

00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,000
so that I can retake it and then is a

00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:11,490
complex thing basically if it's in a

00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,840
minor you can't like if you fail it if

00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,130
you get lower in the c- it basically

00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,240
doesn't count towards your minor so i

00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,680
had to go and do that that was a fun

00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,940
thing to do to go talk to professor and

00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:23,100
say please fail me but somehow worked

00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,050
out i don't remember jack from it and I

00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:28,800
it's those things were completely

00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:30,120
useless to me let's see here oh one

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,520
thing I have a lot of trouble with and

00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,470
is this idea of spiraling changed of

00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,120
thought and with medication I think

00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,830
that's gotten better and I think I've

00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,900
gotten older and learned how to sort of

00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:44,850
like short circuit those things I think

00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:48,390
I've gotten better at that but the I

00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:50,370
it's it's really easy for me to take a

00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:51,840
certain event that's happening in my

00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,700
life particularly some kind of stress

00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:58,070
event or a potential stress event in my

00:10:53,700 --> 00:11:00,660
life and turn and construct a a

00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:03,140
particularly negative outcome from that

00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:06,210
very quickly so I can go from like okay

00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:09,480
this event happened so then ABCD and

00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:12,060
then I'm here so like let's say oh my

00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,680
manager or my project manager or

00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,560
whatever you know wants to talk to me

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,450
it's just as hey can I talk to you all

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,529
right well so I will very quickly

00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:22,529
construct

00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:24,810
a situation where you know oh you want

00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:26,040
to talk to me so I wonder what's the bad

00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,600
i wonder if this project isn't gonna

00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,029
work out and [ __ ] i don't know maybe I

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,499
could and anyway it ends up with like

00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:33,870
that me and my whole family are going to

00:11:31,499 --> 00:11:34,999
be homeless and or we're going to I'm

00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:39,480
going to end up in a Turkish prison

00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:41,309
right and that is super easy for me to

00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,139
get there and I struggle with that a

00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:45,089
long time and of course what happens is

00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:48,689
that that feeds on my anxiety more

00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:50,670
because I now have associated this event

00:11:48,689 --> 00:11:53,009
which may or may not I don't know what

00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:55,139
the outcome is actually going to be but

00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:56,579
now I've associated with it with oh [ __ ]

00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:58,499
i'm going to have to find a new job or

00:11:56,579 --> 00:12:01,680
something like that and i can get there

00:11:58,499 --> 00:12:04,620
really fast I'm really good at finding

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,730
potential outcomes select that I'm

00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,850
particularly also really good at

00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:09,749
obsessing on negative events

00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:12,269
particularly things that involve

00:12:09,749 --> 00:12:14,309
conflict if I get into a discussion that

00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:16,499
becomes heated I tend to be the kind of

00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:19,019
person who gets emotional and takes

00:12:16,499 --> 00:12:20,759
things personally and that's something I

00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:25,319
struggle with a lot to detach myself

00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:27,120
from that but i feel i have sort of a

00:12:25,319 --> 00:12:28,439
duality where I feel a certain sense of

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,449
justice and how people should be treated

00:12:28,439 --> 00:12:31,980
and stuff like that and that is

00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:33,360
important to stand up for people when

00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,579
they're not being treated properly I

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,059
think at the same time I find conflict

00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:42,059
really upsetting and I tend to obsess on

00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:48,149
conflict and negative events a lot and I

00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:49,680
even things so I thinks that have to do

00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:51,209
with I don't know like going back to

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,920
when I was in college and flame wars on

00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:56,639
you on like wreck music industrial on

00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:58,019
using it or things like that right that

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,779
[ __ ] like that would keep me up at night

00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:02,009
right I mean literally actually keep me

00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:03,329
up at night because I was so stressed

00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:06,899
about that some guy was just being a

00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:10,410
[ __ ] prick right even things long in

00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:12,149
the past that I that I have regret about

00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:14,579
not necessarily conflict but when I was

00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:16,199
in the third grade we had a spelling

00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:17,009
workbook that we're supposed to do they

00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:18,990
were supposed to work on it the whole

00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:20,220
year right now you may recall that

00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:23,999
homework and me didn't really get along

00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:26,160
and so we're supposed to do these

00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:27,809
assignments and it was really on our own

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:32,399
to do those assignments well that is not

00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:33,150
sort of how I roll brother and so what

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,290
ended up was

00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,970
it was like the end of the year and I

00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:37,530
did not have any of these work done so

00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,730
it's like I had a hundred assignments to

00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:40,950
do and it was like two days before the

00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:42,090
end of school year and I don't know I'd

00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,560
end up working out i got like in

00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,970
spelling i gotta see or something like

00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,230
that i don't know i was third grade and

00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:49,110
i can't i can barely remember anything

00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:54,300
that happened in the past 20 minutes but

00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:57,870
the but the point is i still so over the

00:13:54,300 --> 00:14:00,450
years I mean 10 20 so so third grade I'm

00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:05,220
38 now so let's see i was probably eight

00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:08,220
then so 30 years later it's gotten some

00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:11,520
better but i will still feel a great

00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:14,340
deal of discomfort thinking about that

00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,810
and being embarrassed and ashamed of

00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:20,310
what happened for something it happened

00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:24,240
its third grade right that that sucks

00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:25,560
right that's a and and you know why why

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,780
am i so carrying this with me i know

00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,750
logically that that's not a sensible

00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:32,160
thing to do but i do anyway and you know

00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,840
one of the things I kind of struggle

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,130
with is this idea of unwanted thoughts

00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,510
and these are things that kind of pop in

00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:38,040
your head and maybe I'll become more

00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,420
comfortable with it because I know that

00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,800
my brain is just really good at coming

00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,350
up with at least appropriate thing

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,730
possible a given time and the second

00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,530
thing is I finally learned him when to

00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:48,090
keep my mouth shut and what not to so

00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:51,090
dot to share those things in certain

00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:53,130
places but I remember when I was say in

00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:55,020
junior high I had this period for about

00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:58,110
a year or two and I grew up Catholic so

00:14:55,020 --> 00:15:01,500
I was I was raised very devout Catholic

00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:03,900
family and so if you've ever been to a

00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:07,200
Catholic Mass you know that it is very

00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:08,220
wrote and quiet and you say things when

00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,150
you're supposed to say them and you

00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,530
don't say things when you're not

00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:13,590
supposed to say them it's not some kind

00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:15,360
of crazy ass like you know Protestant

00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:17,070
church where they like talk like to

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,750
other people and stuff like that or kids

00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:20,730
are running around and garbage like that

00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,800
listen you got your [ __ ] to go and you

00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:24,510
kneel when you kneel it and for you know

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,710
that that's just a weight that's how I

00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:29,880
grew up that's how it's supposed to be

00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:32,700
right so the problem is though so as a

00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,560
like 7th grader I would stink of like

00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,450
just the stupidest things like you know

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,430
you see the priests holding up and he's

00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:39,960
blessing the host and magically changing

00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:42,840
it into the body of Jesus Christ and

00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:45,580
stuff like that and don't laugh it's not

00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:48,050
funny now

00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:50,330
this is [ __ ] it's [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:51,589
um but he hands up and I was like just

00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:53,089
imagine I'm like well know what if he

00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:56,180
was holding up a hamburger I think some

00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:58,520
kid some kid in school said that to me

00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,680
one time so now what happens is that I'm

00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:03,080
[ __ ] terrified because i'm afraid i'm

00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:05,410
going to start laughing right and so I'm

00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:08,450
like every time like I'm in a situation

00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:09,680
where there is something that I ight is

00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:11,060
not appropriate for me to laugh about

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,440
stuff right now I'm [ __ ] white

00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:14,360
knuckling it through this whole thing

00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,610
like holy [ __ ] let's just get through

00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,950
this and I'm sweating and I'm stressed

00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:20,810
out and [ __ ] I'm like a [ __ ] seventh

00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:25,279
grader why is this you know such but I

00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:27,500
really it was build into me um you know

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,930
Maria Bamford it she's a comedian that

00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,820
if you freely she's super awesome i love

00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:33,320
maria bamford and Maria Bamford's been

00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:35,180
really open about her struggles with

00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,740
mental illness and one thing she talks

00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,120
about a lot of these unwanted thoughts

00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,279
and she would talk about like being in

00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:43,130
church and thinking like what if i just

00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:46,130
did I mean really a little more severe

00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:49,370
than the burger king joke but stuff like

00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:50,839
what if I went up and like chopped up a

00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:52,730
bunch of people and went and pooped on

00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:54,200
the altar or something like that or she

00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:57,800
would you know I always say that nobody

00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:59,779
laughs when I I thought it was funny i

00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,860
laughed when I heard her say that but or

00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:03,350
she would talk about that she was like

00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,880
in a starfish pool in at an aquarium

00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,890
this is like as an adult and she was

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,420
like looking at starfish she's like well

00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,980
what if I just closed this in public

00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:12,189
what if I just picked it up and like

00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:14,750
kissed it on a little poop hole right

00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:16,939
now it's Kennedy but [ __ ] like that just

00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,439
happens and I don't know you know and I

00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:19,970
think I've gotten more comfortable with

00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:21,319
that but it is a struggle when you have

00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:22,550
things where it's like I don't want to

00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:24,709
be thinking about this right now but it

00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:27,230
still sticks to you the thing that you

00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:29,480
that's that's worst the thing that's

00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:30,710
hardest about all this is that you know

00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,720
I feel like I can talk about this [ __ ]

00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:34,550
now and I feel like some people kind of

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,309
relate to that or some people can see at

00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:39,830
least empathize to some extent with it

00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:42,740
the problem is is this feeling that I

00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:46,970
had for the longest time all probably

00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:49,490
since 4th [ __ ] grade until a long

00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:50,780
time till I was well into my nashit 20

00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:53,000
so I don't know 30s I still struggle

00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:55,669
with it is this idea of feeling like I

00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,980
was just alone and disconnected and I

00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:58,759
was not like anyone else and when you

00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,669
feel like

00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:03,679
that you feel like you're just [ __ ]

00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:06,679
broken and you're never going to be

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:09,379
right I felt like for the longest time

00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:14,059
that something was wrong with me that I

00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:18,259
was made wrong and that I cannot cope in

00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:20,929
society I thought that I just you know

00:18:18,259 --> 00:18:22,609
it seemed like I'm a relatively smart

00:18:20,929 --> 00:18:24,799
person i guess and i feel like i can

00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:27,109
kind of get stuff and i can but they

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,820
selling i always [ __ ] it up I always if

00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:30,469
I could just focus myself if I could

00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,719
just get things done if I could just

00:18:30,469 --> 00:18:34,699
motivate myself and do the things i know

00:18:32,719 --> 00:18:36,229
i should do i could be very successful

00:18:34,699 --> 00:18:37,909
and everything would go well and stuff

00:18:36,229 --> 00:18:40,940
like that but i always [ __ ] it up

00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:42,379
somehow and i would always say that like

00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,879
things to be going well then I'd say

00:18:42,379 --> 00:18:46,369
something stupid or something like that

00:18:43,879 --> 00:18:48,829
and people will get mad at me or things

00:18:46,369 --> 00:18:51,549
of that nature and and the problem

00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:53,809
really is is that it when you feel like

00:18:51,549 --> 00:18:55,389
there's just there's just something

00:18:53,809 --> 00:18:57,739
wrong with you when you feel that

00:18:55,389 --> 00:18:59,359
feeling of just brokenness and

00:18:57,739 --> 00:19:01,609
disconnectedness from other people that

00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:05,509
other people are not like you and

00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:07,429
they're just not going to get you that

00:19:05,509 --> 00:19:13,669
loneliness that you feel is just

00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:15,919
absolutely crushing I have dealt with

00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:17,449
some with issues of suicide ideation or

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:22,129
suicidal thoughts and self-mutilation

00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:24,199
for much of my life for the most part

00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:27,049
the times where I say cut myself or

00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:28,549
something like that for me I think it

00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:30,529
varies from person to person but I think

00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:33,379
for some people it's like it is for me

00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:36,289
that I did not know how to express how I

00:19:33,379 --> 00:19:38,809
felt I felt like there was sometimes

00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:40,909
stuff screaming in me like my brain was

00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:42,649
[ __ ] screaming and I did not know how

00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:46,029
to explain to people what that was like

00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:48,379
and why I would behave in certain ways

00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:51,349
because I didn't know how to relate that

00:19:48,379 --> 00:19:53,719
to them and I think for me that's why

00:19:51,349 --> 00:19:55,639
that's how I did that was I didn't know

00:19:53,719 --> 00:19:58,159
how else to express that to people and

00:19:55,639 --> 00:20:00,799
I've still got scars on me from it you

00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:02,809
know and that stuff reminds me of what

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,969
it was like to be that way to be that

00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:06,559
teenager be a [ __ ] 13 year old and

00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:11,029
feel that way feel completely

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:12,410
disconnected from everyone for me I I

00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:13,880
like actual

00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:16,400
or suicidal reactions have been very

00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,930
rare I've had a lot of times where my

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,150
emotion was very intense and I thought

00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:21,950
seriously about doing stuff like I was

00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:24,590
you know driving a car and feeling like

00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:28,490
I'm just wanted to spin the wheel and go

00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:37,010
off the road the darkest had ever got

00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:42,170
was I was a [ __ ] probably 29 and I was

00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:43,370
with my I was at home and I had

00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:48,530
barricaded myself in the upstairs

00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:50,270
bathroom with my back to the door and my

00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:52,520
son's mom was banging on the door trying

00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:55,790
to get in I wouldn't let her in and we

00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:59,480
gotten a huge [ __ ] fight and I was

00:20:55,790 --> 00:21:03,320
just I was just sick of it i just i knew

00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:05,720
i was in this place where that intensity

00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:08,840
of emotion where I know that this is a

00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:13,580
bad thing but not only did I just not

00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:16,970
care i just wanted to destroy everything

00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:18,080
and i had a mouth full of pills and I

00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:22,430
was just sitting there feeling her

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:24,680
banging on the door and I at the time

00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:26,780
our son was a year and a half old and he

00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:29,240
was in there not not with me but with

00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:31,910
his mom and that was honestly the only

00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:36,350
reason why I didn't swallow that was

00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:39,020
because I could not justify no matter

00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:42,500
how I felt I couldn't justify leaving

00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:44,540
him on his own because that's just I

00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:47,720
couldn't do it that just seems like such

00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:51,470
a [ __ ] move to leave this kid who

00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:53,420
had dessert node didn't ask to be here

00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:58,370
and somebody's got to take care of him

00:21:53,420 --> 00:22:00,110
and my son's 10 now and he still gets me

00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:01,940
through a lot of [ __ ] I'm not the best

00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:04,850
father in the world by any extent but

00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:07,160
that responsibility to him that I know I

00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:08,810
have has kept me from doing a lot of

00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,560
[ __ ] that's very self-destructive and I

00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:11,560
know that's the case

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:23,570
so that's something I you know a site

00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,010
nope people always like they don't want

00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:26,660
to talk about like my parents like

00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:29,480
getting mad at their kids or really

00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:31,730
flipping out or just feeling like doing

00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,190
hard [ __ ] I don't know that all of this

00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:35,930
is normal so if you have kids rest

00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:37,970
assured it's okay and it's normal if you

00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:42,110
ever feel really intensely angry or

00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:44,630
upset or things like that that that is

00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:47,030
it's normal to feel that way and that it

00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,870
should be okay to talk about and to deal

00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:50,090
with that but that's a whole other

00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:51,560
subject anyway the problem you get into

00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:52,760
with all this stuff particularly when I

00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,070
talk about that loneliness and that

00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,930
crushing feeling of loneliness the

00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:58,880
problem is with this depression and

00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:02,060
anxiety and the way these things work is

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,890
that this [ __ ] that if you suffer from

00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:05,660
this on a constant level where you have

00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:07,460
a chronic condition of anxiety or

00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:09,950
depression that this is going to kill

00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:12,650
you one way or another so it doesn't

00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:14,650
just do it and it's like that say you

00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:18,290
commit suicide or something like that

00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:21,560
you will die sooner because of chronic

00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:23,780
depression or anxiety and there's a lot

00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,830
of pretty good evidence for this there's

00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,180
an interesting article in The New

00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:29,420
Republic that talked about loneliness

00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:30,650
but I tie this in really tang zai under

00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:33,350
pressure because i think i think that

00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:36,830
separation those things are very tightly

00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:38,450
tied together but basically anxiety and

00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:41,420
depression raise the mortality rate for

00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:43,460
people one of the it describes in this

00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,140
is article quote from that emotional

00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:48,380
isolation is ranked as high risk factor

00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:49,580
it for mortality is smoking and it was

00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:52,250
an interesting study I think it was done

00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:54,320
in the early 90s that with that

00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:56,930
monitored I was done in the Bay Area and

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,090
monitored men who had HIV gay men who

00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:02,210
had HIV and i found that closeted men

00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:03,710
who had HIV you can imagine putting

00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:09,010
yourself in that position at that

00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:11,300
feeling of being a closeted man is I

00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:13,280
can't entirely understand what that's

00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:15,050
like but I can understand the idea of

00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,400
that you're hiding something fundamental

00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,840
to yourself that you feel the need to

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,550
hide that and the anxiety and the

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,950
disconnect that you feel from other

00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:23,750
people because of that closet of men

00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:25,220
with HIV died in average of two to three

00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,570
years earlier than

00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:30,230
people who are out than men who were out

00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:32,539
in this study so there's just a lot of

00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:36,640
evidence that it actually compromises

00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:40,250
your immune system and Robert Sapolsky

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,929
which he did a lecture he's a he's a

00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,520
biologist at Stanford has talked a lot

00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:45,620
about depression the nature depression

00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,140
and there's a link here when you could

00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:49,789
get my slides later but he says

00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:52,210
depression is the worst disease you can

00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:54,860
get because of how debilitating it is

00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:56,750
from that talk World Health Organization

00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:58,039
says depression at the times of 2009 is

00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:02,030
the number for cause of disability in

00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:04,130
the world and essentially what he's

00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:07,130
getting at is that depression or you

00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:08,330
know feeling anxiety or things like that

00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,980
particularly with depression it's not

00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:11,150
just you being lazy or your body just

00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:13,010
feeling like man I just don't feel like

00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:15,350
doing this actually what's going on is

00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:17,120
that your body is having a severe stress

00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:19,460
response at that time and it's pumping

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,169
out hormones and things like that that

00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:24,919
you would have in a typical stress

00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:27,549
reaction a low level kind of like a bear

00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:29,659
just bit my arm off kind of reaction and

00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:31,549
the problem is you're not having that

00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:34,400
because of bear bit your arm off you're

00:25:31,549 --> 00:25:36,020
having that reaction when sometimes for

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,380
not any reason you can really identify

00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:41,179
and that's the struggle with it that's

00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,770
the problem is that you're you're not

00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:45,140
having the stress reaction at a time

00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:48,230
where it you probably should have it you

00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:50,870
have at times where in our society tends

00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:52,220
to trigger those things a lot and with

00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:54,200
certain people they have a

00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:55,789
predisposition so that if they have say

00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,600
three or four major stress events in

00:25:55,789 --> 00:26:02,600
their lives their rate of having chronic

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,549
depression goes up 30 fold because they

00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,840
have certain genetic predispositions it

00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:07,850
doesn't mean they're necessarily going

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,590
to have that but it's very typical that

00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:11,360
if they have three or four of those that

00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:13,039
the rate of chronic depression goes

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:16,220
through the roof compared to people who

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:18,260
don't have those same genetic markers so

00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:21,520
that really sucks right and there's not

00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:24,350
any good way to transition out of that

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,610
so that's a hard thing and I'm not here

00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,960
necessarily tell you how to solve those

00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:28,419
problems I don't have the time I've got

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,440
about what two minutes left on the clock

00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:32,419
so I'm going to kind of push through

00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,580
this stuff a little bit but the point is

00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:37,549
this is a real disease with real

00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:39,170
biological [ __ ] that's happening and it

00:26:37,549 --> 00:26:41,630
is okay to treat it

00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:43,340
that it is not okay to just not talk

00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:45,500
about it and be scared of it or tell

00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:48,770
people well you just need to buck up

00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:50,900
brother or no man it's okay you know

00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:52,730
you're going to be fine well that's

00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:54,740
that's just that's just how helpful or

00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:58,100
calm down I get people tell me that a

00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:59,480
little time calm down if I could [ __ ] if

00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:07,520
I could [ __ ] calm down i wouldn't

00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:09,050
have any problems yeah you think I

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:15,590
haven't tried that my whole goddamn life

00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:17,120
Jesus great yeah so but I want to go

00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:18,830
through this a little bit it's

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,290
interesting any other context i'm a

00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:23,780
developer in languages that you don't

00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:26,210
want to hear about and and there's some

00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:27,680
interesting positives about that i think

00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:29,180
you know what stays i'll talk about i'm

00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,010
really good at constructing negative

00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:33,980
outcomes easily those are all that that

00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:36,200
technique is often very useful in terms

00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:37,430
of identifying potential problems when

00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,690
you're particularly when you're early in

00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:40,730
a project you're making a decision about

00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:42,560
how to how to go in someplace i'm pretty

00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:45,230
good at identifying potential security

00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:46,490
problems because well if you don't do

00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:49,190
this well what if you know what if the

00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:51,470
user does this divey you counted for

00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:52,790
that is that going to let and what i

00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,930
found is that I actually kind of

00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:55,490
embedder at that than a lot of people

00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:57,620
who just don't kind of think about that

00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:59,480
stuff I'm really good at finding like

00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:01,040
well if you do this this might happen or

00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,300
this this might happen is this might

00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,790
happen so you got to consider all those

00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:07,460
things so I'm and I'm not actually

00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:08,750
particularly good like programmer in a

00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:11,000
sense that there are way smarter people

00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:13,010
here who understand you know more

00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,190
complex stuff like the [ __ ] Simone and I

00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:17,780
don't know the hell that [ __ ] is but I'm

00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,700
really good at taking patterns and

00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:22,070
applying those patterns to solve similar

00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,330
problems so if I see a solution to a

00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:24,740
problem over here I can take that and

00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:25,910
say oh yeah you know I can apply it to

00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:28,040
this and this and I'm really good at

00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:29,900
that so I'm really good at that stuff

00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:32,450
and that is really advantageous when

00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:34,250
you're part of a development team so and

00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:35,360
I talked about anticipating potential

00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,830
outcomes quickly and I think the other

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,490
thing is that being empathetic and

00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:42,230
supportive to colleagues and find great

00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:44,300
rewards and helping others I find that

00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:47,480
and that is part of who I am because I'm

00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:50,210
tend to be pretty empathetic and that is

00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,950
really really good for me so many

00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:53,059
interesting things I'm going to skip

00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:55,309
through this I think there's

00:28:53,059 --> 00:28:58,309
of things I have to work in with seems I

00:28:55,309 --> 00:29:00,769
work remote our whole group is remote at

00:28:58,309 --> 00:29:02,480
fictive kin and one of the things i know

00:29:00,769 --> 00:29:04,879
i have two boys i have to avoid working

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,519
alone for long periods i'm the only

00:29:04,879 --> 00:29:10,519
person on my team who is where i am

00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:13,519
which is in west lafayette indiana and I

00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:15,559
have to be sure not to like work home at

00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:17,539
home all the time because i will get in

00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:19,309
a bad mental place if i do i have to

00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:20,779
kind of be around people and I have to

00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:25,519
reconnect with people and stuff like

00:29:20,779 --> 00:29:27,440
that I for conferences and communities

00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:29,179
and stuff like that you know it I think

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,369
the thing that underlines for me is that

00:29:29,179 --> 00:29:32,960
this you know when I first got here it

00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:34,159
was kind of scary for me because I

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,570
didn't really know a lot of people and I

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,460
didn't know where things were set up and

00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:39,740
stuff like that so when I first got here

00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:41,119
yesterday I was very quiet and if

00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,919
anybody who was standing around me like

00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:45,139
I don't know if ashes in here i was i

00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:46,039
was talking to ash and she was she was

00:29:45,139 --> 00:29:48,559
being super nice and I really

00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:50,749
appreciated her for doing that and I was

00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:54,200
being very much like okay everything's

00:29:50,749 --> 00:29:56,779
all right here right okay nice to meet

00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,889
you and I've no not carrying any parts

00:29:56,779 --> 00:30:00,169
of conversations or anything like that

00:29:57,889 --> 00:30:03,799
because I'm [ __ ] freaked out because

00:30:00,169 --> 00:30:04,999
I'm scared I'm scared of the situation I

00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:06,740
mean cuz I don't understand I don't

00:30:04,999 --> 00:30:08,029
understand the social etiquette that's

00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,559
something I've struggled with a lot is

00:30:08,029 --> 00:30:10,580
that feeling of like I'm in a place

00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:11,929
where I don't have the right social

00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:16,279
etiquette and I don't know how those

00:30:11,929 --> 00:30:18,110
things work out so quickly I think the

00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:19,639
key thing that I want to come away from

00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:22,129
with this is even if you don't struggle

00:30:19,639 --> 00:30:23,809
with this stuff yourself being able to

00:30:22,129 --> 00:30:25,820
help people who are around you I think

00:30:23,809 --> 00:30:27,499
it's really key there's two things I

00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:29,090
want to say one this stuff varies for

00:30:27,499 --> 00:30:31,070
everybody there you're going to run into

00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:33,139
some people who say oh you know what

00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:36,049
depression is just this and you're this

00:30:33,139 --> 00:30:37,490
is how you fix that and I you know it

00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:39,440
didn't know there's you know or it's

00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:41,059
just that and if you do this if you eat

00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,269
a lot of kale that's going to solve the

00:30:41,059 --> 00:30:45,889
problem for you you know and more power

00:30:44,269 --> 00:30:46,999
to you brother and sister if you eat a

00:30:45,889 --> 00:30:48,379
lot of kale and that solved your

00:30:46,999 --> 00:30:49,789
problems for you and I tell you what

00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:53,210
that kind of [ __ ] can be connected to

00:30:49,789 --> 00:30:56,869
things like pituitary disorders thyroid

00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:58,279
disorders diet [ __ ] like that so I'm not

00:30:56,869 --> 00:30:59,840
saying it doesn't work but what I'm

00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:00,710
saying is you should not assume that

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,990
it's going to work for a particular

00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:04,039
person i am not an expert in this stuff

00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:06,919
but i just want to talk about the things

00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:07,520
that key and the key thing really over

00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:10,130
anything else

00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:12,650
is empathy empathy empathy empathy

00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:16,550
empathy empathy look like steve ballmer

00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:21,380
empathy empathy and then I'm going to

00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:24,080
throw a chair across the room but that's

00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:26,900
the key it's trying to put yourself in

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,790
their place and try to understand how

00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,050
they got there and sometimes that's

00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:32,120
harder than others and sometimes you

00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:34,100
just can't it's it's hard for you to get

00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:37,610
there but even some glimpse of that is

00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:39,620
going to make them more human to you and

00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:41,600
I kind of think this applies for

00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:43,010
everything but particularly for people

00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,600
who are struggling with this and the

00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:46,820
dangers that they have to deal with I

00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,320
think it's really key to be empathetic

00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,850
and try to understand where they're

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,850
coming from so the first thing I'd say

00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:54,410
is help them feel safe listen to them

00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:57,350
and try to understand what it's like for

00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:58,700
them a key thing for me is acknowledged

00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:01,730
that they're frustrated know that

00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:03,950
they're frustrated I know that what I

00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:06,170
deal with sucks and it makes it gives me

00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:08,240
that it makes me make bad decisions or

00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:10,070
do things that are dumb or stupid or

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,540
that I'm embarrassed about and that are

00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:14,090
not the appropriate things to do in

00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:16,970
certain situations I know that and is

00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:18,380
deeply frustrating to me I am almost 40

00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:20,420
years old and I'm still dealing with

00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:25,100
this [ __ ] really the same [ __ ] I was

00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:26,870
dealing with when I was 12 often times

00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:32,000
I'm like what the [ __ ] is wrong with me

00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:34,670
I'm a grown-up right grown-up um and and

00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,250
I'm still dealing with this it's deeply

00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:39,740
frustrating to me I'm getting better at

00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:41,530
it but that is what is that it's just

00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:43,250
very hard and just understanding that

00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:45,050
understanding that there no they're not

00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:46,490
just doing it then it's not like they're

00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:48,440
not aware of it and they're just doing

00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:50,540
it to piss you off to make things harder

00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,940
for you because they are sometimes hard

00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:55,430
to deal with no they probably know very

00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:57,500
well what they're doing a third thing is

00:32:55,430 --> 00:33:00,650
that change is really really terrifying

00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:02,720
for a lot of people it's really hard for

00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:04,490
a lot of us and when it when you know

00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,080
change is going to happen these things

00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:08,000
are come up you might want to talk to

00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,740
them 101 ask them how they feel and what

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,260
they need one of the key things that

00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:14,390
helps me like I'm really terrified to go

00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:16,160
to new places so a lot of people I was

00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:19,250
talking with somebody yesterday he was

00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,870
talking about yeah we go to like a

00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:22,700
not Bermuda he said what is it some

00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:25,310
place in Mexico for like a company

00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:26,300
retreat every year and I would like most

00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,980
people's reaction it's like that's

00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,780
awesome we're gonna go to Mexico and

00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:33,290
it's going to be [ __ ] great yeah and

00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:34,610
my reaction to that is like holy [ __ ]

00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:36,650
[ __ ] I don't know what's going to go on

00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:39,020
there and I do not want to go and I will

00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:40,640
immediately have a very very bad like I

00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:45,350
want to run out of the room and died

00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:48,740
reaction and so migration is very very

00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:51,290
different and so if somebody could talk

00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:53,990
to me about that as to how I feel what I

00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:55,280
need and you know at work I've been able

00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,690
to establish thing where I say you know

00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,920
what I know we're doing on its company

00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:59,720
retreat we're going someplace I'm sort

00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:02,090
of freaked out about it could maybe

00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,140
somebody be like my buddy and like I

00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:04,670
could have a little buddy system where I

00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:07,010
can rely on this guy and he can help me

00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:09,500
out and if I need to do XYZ you can help

00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:11,480
you with that that is massively helpful

00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:14,379
to me and might be helpful for other

00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:16,820
people to the final thing I want to say

00:34:14,379 --> 00:34:19,669
if you are in a position to do this

00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:21,679
encourage them don't go crazy about it

00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:24,919
encourage them but more importantly

00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:26,570
enable them to seek help I don't have

00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:30,440
time to get into a bunch of therapy and

00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:32,899
treatment stuff here but if you are in

00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,000
any kind of position to help them how

00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:38,840
kind of grease the wheels so it's easier

00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,820
for them to access treatment to say it

00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:42,500
do it like if you have a health plan do

00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:44,300
you have a list of like places they can

00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,889
talk to if they don't have health

00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,179
insurance is that maybe you could help

00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:49,460
them out by getting some information

00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:51,020
about places they could go to their low

00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:54,050
or no cost or sliding scale or things

00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:57,080
like that enabling them to seek help is

00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:58,910
really really really key because tons of

00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:02,330
people don't seek help for stuff because

00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:04,400
there's too scared to and there's part

00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:07,070
of that isn't is helping them not be

00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,750
scared and part of that is making it

00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:13,520
easier so that they can overcome their

00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:14,720
fear so if you want to help with this

00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,500
stuff and I've been kind of talking

00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,690
about this at a few different

00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,280
conferences there's a couple of the key

00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:21,020
thing I think is just talk about stuff

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:25,250
that's what I want people to do is be

00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:27,530
talking about this and share resources

00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:29,060
you find share your feelings about this

00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:31,550
kind of stuff things like that the first

00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:33,119
link is to is on my website function

00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:34,799
calm / osm I

00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,839
sourcing mental illness if you go there

00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:38,190
I have all I have a big list of

00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:39,509
resources I've got all the videos of

00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:41,519
other talks like times I've given this

00:35:39,509 --> 00:35:43,140
talk the second thing is there's a cool

00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:45,029
thing ng arts doing called prompt I

00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:48,200
think you should check it out a couple

00:35:45,029 --> 00:35:54,960
people me and another guy who was here

00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:58,380
greggy be Greg bag bag Vegas bagus i

00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,549
always miss france and a prompt is a

00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:01,680
really cool thing that NTR's trying to

00:35:59,549 --> 00:36:04,650
sponsor to really increase the level of

00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,180
this discussion and get and overcome

00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:09,299
that stigma so that we can talk about

00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:11,339
this stuff openly so talk email tweet

00:36:09,299 --> 00:36:12,420
post whatever the hell you do get that

00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:14,640
out there and just get people talking

00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:16,650
about it and that's that I think is

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,150
going to be the key so thank you i know

00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:19,440
i'm over thanks for taking your time

00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:21,769
