Title: Madison Ruby 2013 Psyche and Eros by Leon Gersing
Publication date: 2020-01-28
Playlist: Madison Ruby 2013
Description: 
	There are many forms of love. The word itself is so simple yet overloaded that it's virtually impossible to define but just as impossible to deny. In this session, I seek to share with you a small snapshot of my experience with love in all it's various nuanced forms; From the love a parent has for a child, to the love that transcends companionship, to the love for your colleagues, to the love for simple joys in this life. We'll look at the impact of love and it's relationship to the quest to find ourselves both in the micro and macro levels. We'll draw from history, myth and modern life to better understand this bizarre and wonderful world we inhabit. We've become increasingly negative as a society; culturally we attack others to guard our notions of hierarchy, status, self-identity or hide our insecurities. I, for one, am finished with the self defeating cycle of negativity. Let's find our bliss and celebrate the very best in all of us.

super anticlimactic isn't it hmm yeah so

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:26,460
it's me yay for me just make sure

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,680
everything's on okay so I title of this

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,240
talk and that abstract that Inlet it I

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,279
don't know if anybody does anyone read

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,070
abstracts I don't I don't really I'm

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:39,800
like I'm yeah you do I hope you love

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:42,690
mine it was really hard on to describe

00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,760
so it'll kind of follow some of those

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,949
themes but it will also have its own

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,229
little spin on it too but there's a I'm

00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:51,390
a fan of history i'm a fan of myth and

00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:54,479
fan of storytelling as you may have

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,850
guessed right so usually when I'm going

00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,799
through certain points in my life or

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,830
trials tribulations new learnings

00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:04,530
whatever it happens to be I kind of look

00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:07,260
to other points of view to have it

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,869
mirrored back to me whether that I can

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,700
get that in real life is kind of a

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:14,040
crapshoot like sometimes you're just not

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,260
your immediate circle isn't filled with

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,580
folks who maybe have that kind of mirror

00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,870
image of what you're going through to

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,490
actually be able to articulate it and

00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,320
put it into words it's not for lack of

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:26,790
trying or anything it just kind of

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,980
happens that way so I find myth to be

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,230
one of those things that I constantly

00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:34,530
come back to I find it to be very

00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:37,650
informative the the words the metaphor

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,900
the allegory that people use for

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,690
thousands of years to basically

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,570
described the human condition that we're

00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:48,440
experiencing even today so this isn't

00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:51,360
like a long and like laborious you know

00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,950
examination of psyche and arrows if

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,330
you're not familiar with with that

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,570
particular myth it's been rewritten

00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:59,340
about a thousand times so you can pretty

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,979
much make up whatever you want and it's

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:05,460
basically will fit in it anyway so

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:07,290
instead it's it's what I've discovered

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,259
with it the the pieces of that

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,849
particular allegory that that resonate

00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:14,099
with the journey that I've been on

00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:16,680
lately I thought I just share some of

00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:19,799
that with you today and I might make

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,290
references to my two friends here and

00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:24,270
there their names basically are pretty

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,620
much exactly what you'd expect we're

00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:28,340
gonna have to get caffeine installed on

00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,340
this machine early

00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:35,650
so I you already know who i am i'm leon

00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:38,080
i work at get up that's pretty recent

00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:40,690
and if you want to find me on twitter

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,819
it's Ruby Buddha and if not just you

00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:47,410
know Google becca and green hat you'll

00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:51,519
you'll find me so I'm also using new

00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:53,950
presentation software whoa so please

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,110
don't panic they will have lots of

00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:58,150
moving parts and things flying around I

00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:02,380
couldn't contain myself I was free baked

00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:04,930
when I wrote this thing whoo metaphors

00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,819
are so much better that way so yeah I

00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,310
was basically looking at the Keef garden

00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:13,239
and enjoying all the cool metaphors that

00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:15,489
are for forbearers have have given us

00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:17,230
but a promise if you just close your

00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:20,049
eyes and count to 10 like all the

00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:23,459
spinning will stop and then find me

00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:25,900
after we'll talk up it'll be fun whoo

00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:29,380
yeah you can imagine me right just like

00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:32,230
whoa ha ha ha ha ha that would drive me

00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:35,890
nuts fires watching it but I have all

00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:38,290
the power so whatever you're talking

00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:40,090
about love right there's this there's

00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:42,130
this track deal you could fall into

00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,170
where people give their own kind of take

00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:45,790
on oh this is what love really means and

00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,470
there's this version of love with your

00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,209
family and this is version of love with

00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,799
your mom and dad and your brothers and

00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:52,720
your sisters and your friends and and

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,670
your co-workers and all that and now

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,500
that is great and it works and it's so

00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:59,139
true and I honor all of it and i think

00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:02,019
you should too it's wonderful but that's

00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:04,840
not really what that particular myth is

00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:07,090
about and it's not really that helpful

00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,160
of a tool when you're actually trying to

00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,870
work toward some form of enlightenment

00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:14,350
when you're trying to discover who you

00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:16,479
said who you are but the one thing about

00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:19,209
the myth that that is kind of the

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:22,539
through line of it is the combination

00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:24,729
like these two people we have arrows the

00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:28,500
god of love and we have a mortal woman

00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:31,889
psyche and she of course represents the

00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:34,720
spirit the soul searching that part and

00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:38,470
cupid being the love desire the body

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,030
that kind of thing right for me what's

00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,420
interesting about it is that these two

00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,760
players

00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:45,810
are largely either a separate from each

00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:49,420
other and trying to find their way back

00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:52,050
or someone else neither be circumstance

00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:54,880
or God or whatever it happens to be is

00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:59,020
driving a wedge between them is forcing

00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:01,540
them to constantly re-evaluate what they

00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,160
actually are doing there do they even

00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,720
want to be in the same room as this

00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,880
other person do they really love what

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,400
they're doing do they even know who they

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,010
are at a fundamental level so whether or

00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,720
not you believe in love as a real thing

00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,820
or whether or not it's just some guilt

00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:19,390
delivery mechanism or some other kind of

00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:21,220
arbitrary construct is irrelevant what

00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:24,490
I'm talking about when I talk about love

00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:27,580
is that which motivates you that which

00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:29,590
drives you it's not the point of the

00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,240
story to define love and to define

00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:34,750
happiness and to define all these these

00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,400
are ephemeral emotional constructs there

00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:39,250
are some of those that we really like

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,170
and we'd like to spend more time in like

00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,820
I always hear people say my goal in life

00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:46,240
is to be happy I'm looking for happiness

00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:48,430
and I'm like happiness is an emotion

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,370
within 15 minutes it'll turn to

00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:54,250
something else so good luck hanging onto

00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:57,280
that right it just it's almost

00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:59,530
impossible to do you want a full breath

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,040
of emotions in your life you need to

00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:06,340
have both sorrow and pain to experience

00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:08,530
joy to relish enjoy to understand it you

00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,750
have to know all sides of the human

00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:12,790
experience in order to embrace them in

00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:15,970
order to encompass them and embody them

00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:19,140
so just striving for an emotional state

00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:23,320
a single emotional state loses the point

00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:27,090
and then if I think about that exam kind

00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:29,380
of weird thing in the context of the

00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:31,090
pragmatic in the context of the things

00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:33,730
that the mind is trying to wrestle with

00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:36,850
I also find that I can also be trapped

00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:39,340
down linear modalities linear paths of

00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:41,380
thinking thinking that if I just go this

00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:43,630
direction everything will work if I just

00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:45,730
follow this one path that's been laid

00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:51,400
before me everything will work and what

00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:54,129
I'm coming to is this notion that you

00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,889
have the mind you have the body

00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:59,529
and you have this desire this this sense

00:06:56,889 --> 00:07:01,599
of meeting purpose something to love

00:06:59,529 --> 00:07:04,360
some things really get you going in the

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:07,779
morning and when you can find the

00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,849
convergence of these two things that's

00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:11,409
when you start to feel all of those

00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:14,289
emotions that's when those discoveries

00:07:11,409 --> 00:07:17,679
start to really click and you can take

00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:20,159
those lessons forward and I think we

00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:23,619
live in a time where this is

00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:25,239
increasingly more difficult over the

00:07:23,619 --> 00:07:28,449
last several years I have been talking

00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:30,879
about you know empowerment and finding

00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:33,249
yourself and being an individual and you

00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:35,919
know telling the man to go stuff it all

00:07:33,249 --> 00:07:39,389
the good stuff and then I look and I

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:42,990
watched television and I hear the words

00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:45,849
co-opted and defeated by the very

00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:48,639
institutions that that I was trying to

00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:50,529
get away from and then I hear them again

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,610
backpedaled and moved and I hear people

00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:58,719
say be yourself and I go who is that and

00:07:53,610 --> 00:08:00,879
there's no answer and I'm like whoa got

00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:04,089
miss what'd I missed along the way we

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:07,509
took the words we took the desired

00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:09,999
emotional state and we never found how

00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:12,309
to embody them never found it where they

00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:17,139
meet and they've become part of who you

00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:19,419
are and that's what I'm interested in so

00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:24,519
the convergence of these two things of

00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:28,119
course for me is love and purpose why am

00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:30,699
i doing anything why get out of bed why

00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:36,430
learn the next big thing why talk to new

00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:39,130
people why find who you are I think the

00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:41,829
best thing is not only going on a path

00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:43,539
of discovery not only taking that risky

00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:46,779
step to step out of your comfort zone

00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:49,569
but then understanding the emotional

00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:52,509
reaction you have to it what is my fear

00:08:49,569 --> 00:08:55,149
is my fear about not duta not knowing

00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:58,810
something or being seen as inferior is

00:08:55,149 --> 00:09:03,240
my fear wrapped up in some other maybe

00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:06,370
more tactile experience I don't know but

00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,040
if I'm doing doing doing doing and all

00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,259
I'm doing is learning learn

00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:13,250
and I have no reason for it I have no

00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:16,170
application for it then I have no

00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:21,269
barometer to gauge whether or not it's

00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:22,680
worth anything recently I've kind of

00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:25,019
developed this laissez-faire attitude

00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,670
when people are telling me about new

00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:28,949
things right I'm just like that that's

00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:33,870
great i'm glad that works for you cobalt

00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:35,310
net is the enjoy right and it's

00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,509
true like I don't really don't care like

00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,860
I'm like a look at it but if it's

00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:40,920
working for you all your awesome that's

00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:45,660
that that's fantastic and I felt weird

00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,920
about that I felt I felt like well maybe

00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,690
there are better choices have you looked

00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,850
outside yourself and the question is did

00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,880
I look outside myself did I see his

00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:56,940
perspective this person meeting at him

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:59,310
and did I understand why they chose that

00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:03,350
and and what impact it was really having

00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:06,089
that was the lesson there in not can we

00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:09,660
debate how long it took to do something

00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:12,120
but why did you come to that where was

00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:14,040
the joy in it and when you back off a

00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,720
second and you just listen to somebody

00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,690
tell you about their experience in their

00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:22,260
journey it's amazing how much of that

00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:25,199
emotional side of it is married to the

00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,819
actual path and journey does not just

00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:30,600
repeat these steps and you will find

00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:34,139
mastery it's repeat these steps and also

00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:36,300
be seeking its influence on you where do

00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:40,040
the two come together where we actually

00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:42,029
discover something new for ourselves

00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:45,990
it's very difficult to do especially

00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:49,800
when you're your subset of individuals

00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:51,269
around you becomes static and that's one

00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,040
of these great reasons why people come

00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:55,949
to conferences right so you can actually

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,600
expand your peer set its span other

00:10:55,949 --> 00:11:00,120
people your own journey with other

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,540
peoples and juxtapose it be able to see

00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:06,449
it there is no linear path here right

00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:08,910
there is no simple way to get any form

00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:10,470
of mastery I mean anytime you're looking

00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:14,160
for something that is going to

00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:16,680
fundamentally change who you are there's

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:20,970
not a direct line of sight to it so

00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,779
oftentimes something on taking this

00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,610
journey taking the four

00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:26,689
steps in this journey or even the 30th

00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:30,060
steps doesn't matter feels uncomfortable

00:11:26,689 --> 00:11:32,100
and it's scary and you'll find that

00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:34,769
you'll want to turn back you want to

00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,319
turn around the question becomes is it

00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:40,079
still worth it right so I've been

00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:41,430
programming for a very long time if you

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,749
will like I'm sure there's people have

00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,709
been doing it for like 50 years here and

00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:45,870
they're gonna be like you're not doing

00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:48,709
it for a long time but for me they are

00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:54,059
like 15 years is basically a long time

00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:56,999
and throughout that I had more jobs that

00:11:54,059 --> 00:12:00,120
I just didn't like then I did I had jobs

00:11:56,999 --> 00:12:05,670
that i did--like but i always loved

00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:09,029
software and i couldn't quite grasp why

00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:10,319
I was doing it and so I started talking

00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:13,019
to people start meeting with him start

00:12:10,319 --> 00:12:14,999
going over there's experience is trying

00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:16,410
to find an echo trying to find a mirror

00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:17,939
for someone who was going through

00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:20,189
something very similar to what I was

00:12:17,939 --> 00:12:21,720
going through which was I have all this

00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:24,360
this skill I have all this knowledge

00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:27,089
I've but it but I don't connect with it

00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:30,149
emotionally there's nothing there and

00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:33,750
what is that about and how can i change

00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:36,660
my perception in order to find and

00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:39,180
reconnect with the emotional core of the

00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:42,750
actual practice of writing software and

00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:46,050
that has taken an incredibly long and

00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:49,399
arduous journey and I'm nowhere near it

00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:52,410
I'm nowhere near the answer on that I

00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:53,879
continuously have people ask me you know

00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:56,879
how are you happier how are you do this

00:12:53,879 --> 00:13:00,569
or what is the answer to XYZ and I go I

00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:03,240
don't know 42 is the answer is

00:13:00,569 --> 00:13:11,129
the other is the question done yet do

00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:15,449
it's not yeah taramis damn compilers so

00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:18,300
yeah finding that so this was my first

00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:22,709
answer my first choice was try all the

00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:24,300
things okay you're losing it you're just

00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:28,259
doing the software here just because you

00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:29,910
know how to do it good for you what are

00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:31,589
you missing all right you've tried all

00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:34,470
the techniques you tried all the dd's

00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:35,520
right star DD all the things yay i'm a

00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:39,690
software developer

00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:41,850
now right no lily and I went in our kick

00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:44,120
and then I was like f all the task just

00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:48,060
ship everything rewrite it in production

00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:51,510
like whatever you know i'm awesome i can

00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:56,150
do what i want right and that didn't

00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:59,400
work either like it was really fun but

00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:01,620
but but it didn't actually resonate

00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:04,470
again with like yes you were yes this is

00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:06,390
it like anytime you're doing something

00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:09,600
for ten years and you look in the mirror

00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:11,760
and go why am I doing this is a moment

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,040
for reflection yes it's a moment to

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:17,190
reconnect with the emotional core of why

00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:20,630
you're doing it and I had an experience

00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:22,710
just just in my last employer at neo

00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:27,750
previously new context and then

00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:34,290
previously edge case before that long

00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:38,460
story that was amazing where it was all

00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:40,440
driven by that emotional mean and and at

00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:43,260
some point in that journey I didn't even

00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,790
care what we were shipping anymore all I

00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:47,550
cared about was looking around at my

00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:49,560
peers and feeling like a like a powerful

00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:52,320
mentor for them to inspire them to do

00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:54,840
their thing and and just really being

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,520
that cheerleader sis boom bah like I was

00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:59,730
a den mother at some point they called

00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:01,740
me at that's awesome and it feels great

00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:04,440
and you do that for a year and then you

00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:06,900
realize wait a minute they I'm not even

00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:10,170
writing code anymore what happened here

00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:12,510
and that's when you got to remember that

00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:14,700
these two things the things that you

00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:18,120
love and the things that you do the

00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:21,270
things that you make have to find a

00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,640
common ground they can't just be

00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:26,550
ethereal concepts in your mind they

00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:29,190
can't just be philosophy and they can't

00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:31,500
just be ones and zeros there is a

00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:35,760
delicate balance for each individual

00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:37,610
that finds that point and that's usually

00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:41,160
when I find people are doing their best

00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:43,170
things whatever it is they're making at

00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:48,590
that moment when those two things are in

00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:48,590
harmony they find bliss

00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:55,579
so here's some other little tries right

00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:57,079
so like so what right who cares we know

00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:58,160
that there are two these two things but

00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:00,740
how do we actually put them into

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,279
practice how do we take an abstract

00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:08,540
construct such as happiness or love or

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:11,240
purpose and find ours in it find our

00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:13,040
flavor of it how do we do that well

00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,689
these are just little tips I've picked

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,490
up along the way and there's a your

00:16:14,689 --> 00:16:18,800
mileage may vary this and three dollars

00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:20,959
a buy a tank of gas like or a gallon of

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:25,189
gas I wish it would they do is take a

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:27,980
guess yeah so here's my caveat right

00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:29,569
like I don't know I this is just working

00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:32,529
for me now I don't I don't know about

00:16:29,569 --> 00:16:35,499
y'all give me a call we'll hang it out

00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:40,970
first and foremost you must practice

00:16:35,499 --> 00:16:43,999
love anyone who is on a path that is not

00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:46,459
exactly parallel to yours may actually

00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:49,970
cause some form of cognitive dissonance

00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:54,259
in your own mind in our current society

00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:57,259
it is very common to simply laughed them

00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:58,850
off provide sarcasm belittle someone

00:16:57,259 --> 00:17:00,769
else's journey because you've already

00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:02,389
seen and been down that path and you

00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:04,309
know what it looks like and you think

00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:06,020
they're a fool for going now maybe you

00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:10,309
guys are all cool and hip and lots of

00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:12,220
hugs here this is why I like Madison but

00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:14,689
that hug needs to get out further

00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:17,959
there's a lot of people who stifle their

00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:20,720
own journeys because they feel limited

00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:23,299
by their peer sets because they are

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,909
actively trying to combat shame on a

00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:28,429
daily basis shame of not being able to

00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:31,179
handle the workload shame of not knowing

00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:33,740
what their peers no shame of being

00:17:31,179 --> 00:17:35,450
depressed if they are depressed because

00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:38,720
their life has taken them in a direction

00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:40,909
that they had not foreseen it there are

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,390
all kinds of ways that you could reach

00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:47,899
out to your immediate peer set and

00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:52,190
nurture them and help them grow just the

00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:55,240
practice of love just taking the time to

00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:57,620
do it will inform your own journey if

00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,090
you are at a point where you don't know

00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:01,760
where to go and you're at a crossroad

00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:02,179
and you're a loss simply getting back to

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,889
prac

00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:05,450
missing love and refining the people

00:18:03,889 --> 00:18:08,539
around you and reaching out to them and

00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:10,309
helping them fulfill their goals will

00:18:08,539 --> 00:18:12,649
reinforce your own and help illuminate

00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:16,340
the path that you may have lost it

00:18:12,649 --> 00:18:17,659
certainly did for me but it also opened

00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:19,009
up a whole bunch of new questions which

00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:20,480
is awesome because then you got to go

00:18:19,009 --> 00:18:23,570
find more friends and answer those

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:29,149
questions to a practice love it is

00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:32,749
something that can be done we don't be

00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:34,249
ruled by rules if I hear one more verse

00:18:32,749 --> 00:18:35,419
to tell me that they can't do something

00:18:34,249 --> 00:18:39,529
because someone else told them they

00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:41,480
couldn't I am going to go insane there

especially if those rules are part of

00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:45,169
some weird hierarchy that doesn't exist

00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:47,749
in reality at all it's a complete cop

00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:50,240
fabricated construct by a company that

00:19:47,749 --> 00:19:51,860
could care less right doesn't matter do

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,570
what you were going to do B is amazing

00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:55,399
as you think you're inclined to be and

00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:59,299
you will find this intersection then I

00:19:55,399 --> 00:20:02,149
keep talking about that beads you got to

00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:03,559
invent your elit reality that means at

00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:04,730
some point you're going to look down and

00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:06,049
none of it's going to look right no

00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:07,429
one's going to be agreeing with you and

00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:09,769
everyone's like you're crazy and that's

00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:11,480
fine you go ahead and vent it and I

00:20:09,769 --> 00:20:13,279
guarantee you that you will find other

00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,360
people there's another person with a hat

00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,670
just like mine right there

00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:23,300
look at that rock on see it's catching

00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:26,450
on it's going to happen you may have to

00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:29,090
fight some fights and when I say fight I

00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:33,830
I don't mean physically I don't do that

00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:37,310
that's at the lot of effort okay smoke

00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:38,660
this chill the out no you don't

00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:40,640
have to do that but there are going to

00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,350
be things that are that are that will

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,780
impassion you that that you believe are

00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:46,520
wrong in the universe and they may be

00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:48,440
small and they may be Giants it doesn't

00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,420
matter and it's up to you to actually

00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,630
challenge that reality even if it's your

00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:55,490
peers even if it's not you know someone

00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:56,930
above you who has some perceived like

00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:59,300
ownership of what you do because they

00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:01,940
give you money like that that's not it

00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:05,690
it's challenging the people in this very

00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:07,220
room and when they go to idiomatic they

00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:09,740
have you really thought far enough

00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:12,470
outside of that we can be better

00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:15,350
constantly we can find who we want to be

00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:22,370
as long as we continue to engage one

00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:26,260
another in battle again I'll plug says

00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:28,040
get it done baby and that cool I

00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,870
couldn't even get a higher resolution

00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,790
version of it but I thought it was so

00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:34,220
awesome like you know there's got to be

00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:40,700
someone like come on come on get it just

00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:44,390
it no no no just stay stay okay yeah you

00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:48,710
must venture off into a really really

00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:51,170
scary places you must take yourself out

00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:54,230
of your comfort zone the minute that you

00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:56,120
become complacent and bored the minute

00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,920
that it is too easy the minute that you

00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:02,620
honestly believe that you're going to

00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,620
wake up tomorrow you're too complacent

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:13,370
right yeah that's right that's it I

00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:15,290
mean time is also an illusion and a

00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:18,040
completely imaginary construct we can

00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:20,930
get into that on a totally other session

00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:22,460
but you don't have to be you know you

00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:24,890
don't have to wait for that moment you

00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:26,360
don't have to wait for it to be down the

00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:27,530
road you don't have to sit and go you

00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,000
know what I did it I got

00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:30,770
by the one company I really wanted to be

00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,450
hired by and now I'm just gonna kick

00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:38,060
back you won't do it it'll be death the

00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:40,100
people in this room that is a death

00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:45,350
sentence you might as well not wake up

00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:48,830
tomorrow really you want more you want

00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:51,650
to find that convergence of the heart in

00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:53,480
mind and the only way you can do that is

00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:57,260
to continue to push that envelope every

00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:59,660
single day explore anything that you

00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:01,700
haven't seen before or look at maybe

00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:03,320
those things you have seen before with

00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:11,090
completely new eyes find a new friend

00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:14,390
explore things anew earn your wisdom you

00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:17,450
must earn it it's like mustaches and

00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:21,800
mullets you must earn them cannot rule

00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:23,720
them right except for Ali who will put a

00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,110
mustache just about anywhere in any city

00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:31,160
that she goes to a leaf lucky everyone

00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:33,710
yeah what mustache whatever we honestly

00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,270
not not in this room again right so

00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:37,850
maybe just kind of kick this one out to

00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:39,290
your friends there's this weird thing

00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,880
now that we honestly think we've

00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:42,410
commoditized all the things including

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,350
learning including emotional health

00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:48,470
including discovery and we have it it's

00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:52,160
it's a it's a giant fallacy you must

00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:54,350
earn it you must go out you must meet

00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:57,680
new people you must try new things and

00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:59,780
you must take back that and just sit on

00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,670
it you gotta listen inside you got to

00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:04,970
become introspective and you got to give

00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:08,450
yourself time to acquire and earn wisdom

00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:09,890
we can acquire knowledge like this we

00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,270
can get ones and zeros and we can get

00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:13,160
the answers to any question now

00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:15,110
basically online right you can just just

00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:19,210
google it and boom I'm professional

00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:22,460
programmer here I go yeah yay right no

00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:25,160
no there's time to be bad at things

00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:28,100
there's time to sit in the mud and

00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:30,380
Drudge through it and see it again you

00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:33,680
have to earn it there's no free pass

00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:36,860
there's no easy lunch there's no magic

00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:39,020
bullet for this part and why I say you

00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:40,460
have to earn wisdom is like you can get

00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,059
that ones and zeros you can get the

00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,409
knowledge and you

00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:44,720
can walk the path and you can actually

00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:46,789
ate the motions but if it has no purpose

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,820
that it has no meaning if it is

00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:52,100
worthless to you emotionally then it's

00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:54,169
easily it's disposable it's worthless

00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,639
it's another day that you know you're

00:24:54,169 --> 00:24:58,039
going to wake up and do the same thing

00:24:55,639 --> 00:25:00,080
you're doing the next day and the day

00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:02,419
after and then you're going to look back

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,789
and miss 10 years because you didn't

00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:06,139
take the time to really understand it

00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:08,960
and find the love and the joy and the

00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:12,379
things that you're looking for it's easy

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:17,720
to do it just takes time and being a

00:25:12,379 --> 00:25:21,379
little afraid keep an open mind and an

00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:23,509
open heart an old dog can learn new

00:25:21,379 --> 00:25:26,149
tricks every day of their life look at

00:25:23,509 --> 00:25:28,070
granny here playing beer pong right she

00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:30,559
can do it up she's just like yeah all

00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:35,299
right the same what I did before him

00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:37,759
drink it all right y'all don't had a

00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:39,440
drink I know how to drink ya see ya my

00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:40,669
grandma's she's dead rest her soul but

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,710
she could drink is all under the table

00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:46,899
which I had to learn from her that

00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:49,639
I missed out on I you can keep this open

00:25:46,899 --> 00:25:52,309
when you find other folks that are

00:25:49,639 --> 00:25:54,919
saying things that maybe don't jive with

00:25:52,309 --> 00:25:56,899
you it's easy to shut them down it's

00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:59,929
easy to push them away it's easy to lose

00:25:56,899 --> 00:26:01,490
that information that connection and I'm

00:25:59,929 --> 00:26:02,840
saying that the minute something took

00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:04,999
rubs you the wrong way that's the first

00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,529
person you go talk to that's the first

00:26:04,999 --> 00:26:09,230
person you buy a drink that's the first

00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:10,909
person that you want to have any

00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:12,379
conversation with it doesn't even have

00:26:10,909 --> 00:26:15,320
to be relevant to the thing that you're

00:26:12,379 --> 00:26:17,389
disagreeing with their point of view is

00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:20,299
one that you're probably not having in

00:26:17,389 --> 00:26:22,700
your social circle adult and it's very

00:26:20,299 --> 00:26:25,159
easy to acquire it all you have to do is

00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:27,259
go hi my name is whatever your name is

and those people will give you more

00:26:51,139 --> 00:26:54,590
information to help you along this

00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:58,279
journey

00:26:54,590 --> 00:27:00,320
I love this quote to be nobody but

00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:02,990
yourself in a world that's doing its

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,330
best to make you somebody else is to

00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:14,409
fight the hardest battle you are ever

00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:14,409
going to fight never stop fighting right

00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:29,210
it's hard to be yourself and also be

00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:31,850
part of a community it's hard to have

00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:34,210
your own opinions and also have that

00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:37,039
need to be accepted by those around you

00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:40,399
we are social creatures that's why we're

00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:43,789
here but we are all of us made up of

00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:46,820
just little dots of Awesome each one of

00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:49,640
these chroma lucent dots is just amazing

00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:52,370
and you do not have to suppress it it

00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:54,649
will feel like you do it will feel like

00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:56,000
when I say this wild ass somebody's

00:27:54,649 --> 00:28:00,110
going to make fun of me so I'm not going

00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,510
to say it that's the fight that's the

00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:04,580
part that you got to get up and get up

00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:08,539
and start slugging it out right it's not

00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:11,440
here it's here and here and you can't

00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:14,000
fight if you're missing one or the other

00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,309
all of your arguments will be lost if

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,559
it's all in your head it all just be

00:28:16,309 --> 00:28:20,720
nonsense with no purpose if it's all in

00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:24,020
your heart it'll all be emotions with no

00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:27,580
real context the two coming together

00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:30,490
finding a harmonious nice parallel path

00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:34,760
arm you for this battle of

00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:38,390
self-empowerment and self-discovery take

00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:43,039
the time to go down it and be boldly

00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:46,700
wrong you can change who you are every

00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:48,850
second of your life you can adopt new

00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:51,289
philosophy you can change your mind and

00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:55,130
people will give you the benefit of the

00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:57,649
doubt I promise it may be scary for them

00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:58,970
they want you to be who you are every

00:28:57,649 --> 00:29:00,919
day they don't want you to change

00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:03,289
because that's the way our minds are

00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:05,990
worked right we like stasis the mind

00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:07,270
wants stasis wheel of inertia we want to

00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:08,770
stay at rest when we can stay at rest

00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:15,200
don't

00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:16,490
it's so much more fun to mess it up the

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,700
other thing I'll leave you with has only

00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:22,520
got a minute is that lots and lots of

00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:24,620
these Greek myths on the Roman versions

00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:28,250
and all of them they have really bad

00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:30,020
endings right like someone dies and

00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:32,870
they're like having to push a rock up a

00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:35,030
hill forever and like fairies are making

00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:38,060
fun of them keep pushing that rock

00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:40,580
Sisyphus whatever it happens to be was

00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:51,800
that yes when they have the program go

00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:54,170
home why why they said net but psyche

00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:56,930
and eros in almost every variance of the

00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:58,430
story almost all of them there is one of

00:29:56,930 --> 00:30:02,000
them maybe another one I don't know

00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:05,000
about they all have a happy ending it

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,760
all ends with a lute I mean you just

00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,650
slug it out labor and labor and labor

00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,930
self-discovery after self-discovery

00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:14,180
being beaten down by yourself being

00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:17,870
beaten down by ideas being beaten down

00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:21,170
by the gods and at the end the two of

00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:23,060
them find each other and psychic is

00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:26,330
granted and as a mortal her immortality

00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:30,080
and love and the heart and the mind they

00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:31,220
live together happily ever after and in

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,830
a world where we don't get too many

00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:37,100
happy endings I really enjoy a beautiful

00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:39,410
love story that has a happy ending enjoy

00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:42,190
