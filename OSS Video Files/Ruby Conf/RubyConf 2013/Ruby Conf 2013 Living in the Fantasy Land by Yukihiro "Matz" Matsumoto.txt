Thank you for coming

00:00:18,659 --> 00:00:23,269
and Ruby Conf is always great

00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:30,269
and a keynote make me depressed (laughs)

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:33,659
You know I'm a programmer

00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:35,260
I'm a language designer

00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:42,260
so you know, my main tasks should be is designing language

00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,739
a great language

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,369
I admit that I did great things

00:00:48,369 --> 00:00:49,149
you know

00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,829
that influenced

00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:54,819
so many people all around the world

00:00:54,819 --> 00:00:55,889
including you guys

00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,899
so I'm pretty happy with it

00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,679
but still

00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:01,899
you know

00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:04,250
I'm not really a great presenter

00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:10,159
nor

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,170
I'm very

00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:18,170
I'm not really good at english

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,069
that always makes me nervous

00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:26,789
anyway, today I'm going to talk about the fantasy land

00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:29,759
ok

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:30,039
this way

00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:33,539
fantasy land

00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:37,970
that is a place being away from reality

00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:43,099
the where the unicorn lives

00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:44,649
in Japanese it is called

00:01:44,649 --> 00:01:46,229
genjitsu-tohi

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:49,069
which is escaping from reality

00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:50,920
my dictionary says that is escapism

00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,899
is that correct word or something

00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:55,280
so for example

00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,800
so the starting cleanup right before the deadline

00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,420
is kinda like escapism

00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,030
starting debuging mruby right before the keynote

00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,819
is escapism

00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:12,129
that is what I did

00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:14,980
so today

00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,620
I'm going to talk about

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,110
oh excuse me

00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,610
two fantasy lands

00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:26,249
the first one is kinda like a distopia

00:02:26,249 --> 00:02:29,590
in 1990

00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,590
I graduated from university

00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:36,459
I feel old

00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:39,989
I was hired by a software development company

00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:43,230
which does, which did some kind of enterprise software

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:48,029
in that, that age

00:02:48,029 --> 00:02:52,799
the software development is totally different from now

00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:58,819
so we had some kind of three year project or something

00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:04,219
from the huge company or huge government department

00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:09,189
we had some kind of analysis for months or even years

00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:13,189
then we wrote some kind of very detailed documentation

00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:14,769
this abstract documentation

00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:16,480
the detailed documentation

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,459
then we code

00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:26,260
which is the translation from natural language to computer language

00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,730
so the process was driven by waterfall process

00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:36,299
so the company's decision was very, very, very conservative

00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:42,590
so at that time I felt something was wrong

00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,779
but I couldn't explain why

00:03:43,779 --> 00:03:47,419
just because it was so natural

00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:50,930
everyone was doing it that way in software development

00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,790
back then

00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,389
so I couldn't explain why

00:03:56,389 --> 00:03:57,629
everyone was doing that

00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:01,829
it is quit difficult to tell what is wrong

00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:04,269
when everyone is doing bad things

00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:05,379
right

00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:10,999
so yea I couldn't imagine what was right and what was wrong

00:04:10,999 --> 00:04:14,219
so after more than 20 years of experience

00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:15,999
I was a pretty experienced programmer

00:04:15,999 --> 00:04:16,419
ah maybe

00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:23,419
now I understand, I now understand what was wrong

00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,660
we were wrong in software development

00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:31,900
that depends on some false assumptions

00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:37,290
we were depending on such false assumptions

00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,010
assumption number one

00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,440
we know what we make

00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:49,210
back then we believed we are knowing what we are going to make

00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:54,990
in reality we don't know what software is

00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:59,870
so software does not have any physical entity

00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:03,620
so it is not limited by physical law

00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,620
so it can be very, very easily complex

00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:15,620
so, for example, if I were a building architect

00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:21,920
so I design a building like this hotel

00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,560
so we need to think about, for example

00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:31,250
about weather, or the strengths of the concrete,

00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:37,560
or iron, or something, the building materials

00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,460
then the strength of the building itself can be

00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:47,640
calculated by physically, easily simulated

00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,930
but you know

00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:55,670
when we starting developing software it is easy, like

00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,140
"hello world"

00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,940
that's quite easy

00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,720
there is no room for bug

00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,110
but the software is getting bigger and bigger

00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:09,370
so it's quite difficult to understand say 10,000 lines of code

00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:14,030
but now days software is so huge

00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:21,030
like if I had a Prius here, it is an automobile,

00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:30,080
it has tons of lines of code, maybe hundreds of lines of code, tons of hundreds

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,560
maybe millions of code

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:39,560
so it's like, as a software developer, you can imagine how difficult to ensure no bugs

00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,800
in the millions of lines of code

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,580
yeah

00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,970
I'm sure I cannot do that

00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:53,970
so, the software can be a most complex creation, maybe

00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,220
and no document but code can explain the details

00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:06,220
so the, we believe we knew what we were going to make

00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,610
but in reality, we didn't

00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,020
false assumption number two, which is

00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:16,840
we know what we want

00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,580
in reality, it's quite difficult to imagine

00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:26,580
you know, in a waterfall age I write a code (?? 00:07:27.16) with sophistication

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,770
and I give that sophistication to our client

00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:37,240
then clients said, OK, then we started development

00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,460
a few weeks, few months, few years later

00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,890
the software was finished

00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:44,850
then I wrote

00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:49,330
if we wrote it to the client, then

00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:53,230
can you imagine what the client said?

00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,760
it's not what I wanted

00:07:54,760 --> 00:08:00,520
but, they said yes, this is OK

00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:06,750
but, afterwards, they said, this is not what I wanted

00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:11,310
even, I admit, I said OK

00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:18,310
but, you know, we couldn't imagine what the software appears in reality

00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:26,480
so, like a stupid boss says ?? (00:08:23.56) to the client

00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:31,450
yeah, I complained a lot

00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:34,130
I happened to complain so often, back then

00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:41,130
but one day, I asked my colleague to create some kind of software

00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:46,430
at that time I was so busy, so I

00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:49,050
I explained what I want to my colleague

00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,240
then he created the software, then back to me

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,470
and I said, this is not what I wanted! (laughs)

00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,070
stupid me

00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:06,910
I said I don't know why we should make too maximize business value

00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:13,910
we couldn't, no, we couldn't understand what is gonna bring you success

00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:20,990
so we are stupid, too

00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,580
so, false assumption number three

00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,480
which is

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,560
the situation will not be changed

00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:33,860
in reality, we don't know the future

00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,190
we're not prophets

00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,190
we have wrong forecasts

00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:45,190
so yeah, in this technology field, we have a lot of

00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,250
we're gonna have this technology, we're gonna have this, too

00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,210
we're gonna conquer the world, so

00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:57,090
most forecasts will be wrong

00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,920
so let's face it

00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,760
we don't know anything

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,980
20 years ago

00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,670
we should have admitted our ignorance, but we couldn't

00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:11,390
so instead, we ignored our ignorance

00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:18,370
so, when we know little, we have very few choices, so

00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:23,020
choice number one is a conservative strategy

00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,990
learn from the past

00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:29,850
so, this is very good strategy

00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,980
and the politicians often take

00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,000
conservative

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,810
but it is pretty good unless factors don't change

00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:44,320
unfortunately not in the IT industry, so

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,300
we change a lot, the situation will change drastically, day by day

00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:57,300
so, in our industry it's kind of like the quote from Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland

00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:09,029
"Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.

00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:16,560
If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!"

00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:21,550
It's our situation, here

00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,880
probably, yeah

00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,779
it's our situation

00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:32,480
we have to run as fast as we can to be in the same place

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,190
so, strategy number two is

00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,089
ostrich algorithm

00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:43,360
in the ostrich algorithm

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,330
so when the sandstorm comes, ostrich dig in their head into sand

00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:53,660
and wait until the sandstorm ends

00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:58,040
so the, the ostrich strategy is ignore everything, and wait

00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:05,040
it is a good strategy

00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,440
only when situations will recover

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,760
so sandstorms will end

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:20,760
so, we will have the clear skies and we

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,170
we can enjoy our climate again

00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:31,020
but, you know, in our industry

00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,230
that's not going to happen

00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:36,850
where the situation will change and change and change and not recover

00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:42,480
so we, we cannot go back to the main frames

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,790
we can go back to the, you know, eighty, fifty years or something

00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:52,080
so we must keep forward, keep going forward

00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:59,080
so the ostrich algorithm is very good strategy in the past

00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,440
when the situation will recover

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,310
so the, this strategy, this algorithm, is written in our instincts

00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:10,690
so we are so easy to choose that strategy

00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:17,690
but, otherwise, when the situation will not recover

00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,600
it's kind of like the living in the fantasy land

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:28,560
so, going forward with false assumptions is kind of like living in the fantasy land

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:35,560
so, ignoring reality

00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,279
we had two strategies

00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:42,899
conservative strategy and ostrich algorithm

00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:45,070
which strategy do we take?

00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:48,290
neither of them are good

00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,490
20 years ago

00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:56,959
our goal was to create the software, somehow

00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,930
having computerized system is the power

00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:05,490
it is so powerful, the computer itself is so powerful, comparing to the human creation

00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,190
??(00:14:05.13)

00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:12,550
so it has great power, so software development was pretty expensive back then

00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,480
the computers were expensive

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,720
the network connection was expensive

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,850
the failure never be allowed in that age

00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:26,720
so they needed to optimize, not to fail

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,390
at the cost of satisfaction

00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:33,850
so I don't care you are satisfied our software or not

00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:40,850
but I can re-use some kind of the power of computers with that computerized system

00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,100
so everyone was dreaming

00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:48,190
we believed that the only way to create software

00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:52,060
we tried hard to believe that was the only way

00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,270
but 20 years later, now

00:14:54,270 --> 00:15:00,020
our goal is not really, not just create a software

00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,810
our goal is to create the great software

00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:09,810
you know, nowadays everyone has computer, everyone uses software

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,330
so, mere possession is no longer the power

00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,529
everyone has computer, everyone has software

00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:19,880
so we're saved

00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,839
to differentiate, to have the power over others

00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:30,209
we need to create great software, we need great software

00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:36,520
we got to create great software, but how?

00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,670
of course we don't know

00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,279
we have made false assumptions

00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:42,360
admit our ignorance

00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,899
but, but there's good news, there's good news

00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:49,200
the computers are cheaper

00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,110
cloud computing is even cheaper

00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,769
a network connection is cheaper now

00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:55,610
and ubiquitous

00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,019
everyone has imagination

00:15:57,019 --> 00:16:00,300
even in this room

00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,959
software development is cheaper

00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:04,260
comparing to twenty-something years ago

00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:08,660
so, we can be more productive, more abstract

00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:12,149
and we now have better tools and a better language

00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:19,149
like Ruby

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,980
and we have a lot of open source software

00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,360
so we can rely on that kind of software

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,339
we can learn from that software

00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:38,339
so, old days, it is quite difficult to study from the real source source code ?? (00:16:41.91)

00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:50,620
if you would like to learn about the operating system

00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:57,620
so you cannot access to the source code of, say, Microsoft Windows

00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:04,579
or the ?? (00:17:00.68) or some other operating system

00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:09,179
you, you can access through Linux?? (00:17:08.34)

00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:12,409
or the very old version of Linux

00:17:12,409 --> 00:17:15,269
but not the real software

00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:18,010
but nowadays you can access the Linux

00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:23,209
a whole bunch of Linux code and you have tons of operating systems

00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:27,420
and that is used in reality

00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,740
and

00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:33,960
you can use some software in your system

00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,299
you can learn from that source code

00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:44,299
so it's much easier for us to learn and create the great software

00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:49,960
and we can now have the collaboration via internet

00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,320
it's, it's changed the game

00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:00,320
so, 20 years ago, soon after I graduated the university

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:07,179
I was at the point I was working as a professional programmer in enterprise software

00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:14,179
I was prohibit to write email abroad, outside Japan

00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,220
only 20 years ago - not two hundred years ago

00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:25,220
so, yeah, I, when I was a university student

00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,640
I wrote some kind of software, free software

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:35,640
it was distributed by, it was quite minor, you know client on top of ?? (00:18:32.73)

00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:43,130
and, I got to mail from some other guys, probably in the States

00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,490
I don't remember quite

00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,730
but

00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:52,460
I tried to reply, and soon after that I got error mail

00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:59,460
your company did not pay money to the internet connection

00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:04,809
international internet connection, I mean

00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:10,370
so, I forwarded that reply to my friend in the university

00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:17,370
the university pay that kind of bill so that he could receive the mail

00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:23,490
it was quite awkward corresponding, you know

00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:26,720
he wrote mail to me then I did not respond

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,710
so that, the friend respond because of me or something like that

00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:37,710
but, you know, now we can connect to everyone all over the world

00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:44,380
so we can access through Japan, China, Moscow, everywhere

00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,750
so we can now collaborate over the internet

00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:54,750
so, that allows us to do some kind of social coding, so

00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:59,350
so, GitHub changed everything

00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:06,350
so these good things bring up the new fantasy land

00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:09,520
the new perspective

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:16,520
so we can ignore gory detail of the hardware or the

00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:21,840
and the new operating system, for most of the cases

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:28,030
we can stand on the shoulders of giants, so we can use the great huge software

00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:35,030
of the operating system, framework, language, the tools, editors

00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,419
so a lot of the things

00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:44,419
so we can do great things with very little effort, comparing to the past

00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:52,470
so we can do greater work than our real ability, real power

00:20:54,040 --> 00:21:01,040
so, I think the genius 20 years ago does not recur enough, is not strong enough

00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:09,500
they are almost fame ?? (00:21:05.97), the ability as a human, in genius

00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:16,080
but, now, we can rely, we can collaborate, we can collaborate over internet

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:22,929
we can collaborate on top of open source software, free software, so

00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:26,200
we can do greater works than our past

00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,179
but that does not mean we are greater

00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:32,890
so the situation has changed

00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:38,040
we can have power, we can have more freedom

00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,870
we can have more joy in software

00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:47,870
so I remember that the, working on the enterprises software was not fun

00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:55,419
so, it's quite boring, so translating human sophistication

00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:01,360
in human language into the computer language was so boring

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:07,799
you know, that sophistication once said that, OK, assign this value to this variable

00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:10,990
or something like that, so

00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:17,990
why these kind of genius don't write the code by themselves?

00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:22,429
it was quite boring when I was ?? (00:22:49.51)

00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:29,429
so now, we can do by ourselves, we can have joy in our programming

00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,740
it's kind of like engineers' heaven

00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:36,530
that's where we are, and that's why we are here

00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:43,530
but wait, it's still not real

00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:49,720
in reality is as conflict as past

00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:55,650
so, who maintains this fantasy land?

00:22:55,650 --> 00:23:00,730
in reality, we cannot just ignore mess, so we don't need

00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:07,730
something, so, we can ignore or just forget

00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:14,390
but something's got to maintain this kind of a mess

00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:21,390
so, it's, so somebody's got to work on that kind of mess

00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,080
garbage collectors

00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:29,160
no, that's not the garbage that you imagine

00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:36,160
for that kind of topic you can go to to the Koichi talk

00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:43,500
so, by the term garbage collector, I meant this (picture)

00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:50,500
and, we have to rely on this kind of people in our daily life

00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:55,040
even in our programming

00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:00,410
without them, we would become mess

00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:02,809
so welcome to the desert of reality

00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:06,809
we rely on garbage collectors

00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:10,280
so we'd better appreciate them

00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:17,280
we rely on a lot of garbage collectors who keep the fantasy land

00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,590
who created your favorite language?

00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:25,070
the garbage collector

00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:30,780
or, who created your favorite gems?

00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:34,820
gem creators, raise your hands

00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:38,429
you have to appreciate them (applause)

00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:43,669
thank you

00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:47,350
who created your favorite frameworks?

00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:54,350
who wrote your favorite books? book writers, raise your hand (applause)

00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:04,130
who created your opensource software, we have tons of open source software

00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,980
in and out our Ruby community

00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,440
so we have to appreciate them

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:15,620
so appreciation and respect is the key, I believe

00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:19,299
the key to the open source community

00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:22,240
the key to the moving forward

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,460
so open source community is kind of like a shark

00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,770
(laughs)

00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:32,770
we need to keep moving forward, or die

00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,730
(applause)

00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:43,730
so, we have to, and I would advise to you, keep moving forward

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:51,630
so you have to run as fast as you can to stay in the same place

00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:58,630
and you have to run twice as fast as that to move forward

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:04,030
so run fast, try often, fail early

00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:08,020
keep moving forward, yes, that is my message

00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:11,630
and in addition, appreciation is not enough

00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:18,270
so, we are not creative to the gem writers

00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:22,679
we are not creative to the language designer

00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:29,150
we are not creative to the open source software programmers

00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:32,289
so we became one

00:26:32,289 --> 00:26:39,289
so, take the red pill

00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:45,210
so, you can come join us

00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:49,690
if you are a programmer, that's fine, that's fine you're a programmer

00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:54,539
you take a great step to create something

00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:57,210
you know, the programmer is a creator

00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:04,210
so, you create software, then by your creation

00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:09,720
the world will be better, I hope, I really will hope

00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,880
the world will be better by your creation

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,450
you programmers, you create soft ware, and you make the world better

00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:25,450
but, but you might still living in the fantasy land

00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:31,910
which is kept by the garbage collectors

00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:37,020
and if you're willing, I'm not forcing you

00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:40,490
if you're willing, you can be one of them

00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:44,630
you can be a garbage collector

00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,710
you don't want?

00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:49,309
but this garbage collector is much cleaner

00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:56,309
so, be a garbage collector, take part in keeping the fantasy land

00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:03,840
so this fantasy land, unlike the first one, which ignores everything

00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:11,860
so this fantasy land, we currently enjoy is our result of the effort of the long time

00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:20,350
maybe twenty, forty, fifty years of the great effort of the garbage collectors

00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:27,350
so, I, I invite you guys to take part in keeping the fantasy land

00:28:33,809 --> 00:28:38,640
and for example, so you can join the CRuby

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:45,640
even in writing some reporting some issues the bug trackers or something like that

00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:53,840
so, once you know what we garbage collectors doing behind the CRuby

00:28:54,980 --> 00:29:01,980
you can take the, that session

00:29:04,049 --> 00:29:11,049
so, again, so I ask you to create a great fantasy land

00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:25,140
currently we enjoy, and it can be even greater with your effort

00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:30,570
so you can do as much, many things, so writing software on top of Ruby on Rails

00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:32,220
or the ?? (00:22:49.51) or something like that

00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:39,220
that will enrich the community and communicate with blogs, twitter and social net, social

00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:41,929
coding

00:29:41,929 --> 00:29:48,929
or even, participate in the community, like the GitHub is our friend

00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:55,150
you can do many things, submit bugs, write documents on the

00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:58,159
you know, have a presentation in the conference, you can

00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:05,159
or, write a small piece of software, write a part in the, submit a ?? (00:31:05.62)

00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:11,260
so, so many things you can do, but in any way create

00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:16,179
and try to keep a great fantasy land that we enjoy

00:30:16,179 --> 00:30:16,929
change the world

00:30:16,929 --> 00:30:23,929
so, I believe we've changed the world in better ways

00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:29,230
in the past, say, ten years, so

00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:33,110
a lot of people in this conference, in the past Ruby conferences

00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:40,110
so presented the great things, so now I expect even more great work will be introduced in

00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:48,200
this conference

00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:55,200
so do not be a just a listener

00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:01,190
do not be a passive receiver of information

00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:08,190
so you hear something in this conference, you learn something, take action

00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,909
change the world

00:31:12,909 --> 00:31:19,029
so, this is the key of the open source community

00:31:19,029 --> 00:31:25,390
this is the key of the Ruby community, so

00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:29,250
I know myself, I'm not a great programmer

00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:36,250
so, especially the Ruby commuters in the league knows I'm not a great programmer

00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,440
I create so many bugs

00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:56,620
but, but still, I could, I did great job that influenced the world

00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:03,770
and I respect myself by changing the world better

00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:09,400
so I believe you can do that too in someways

00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,809
so change the world

00:32:10,809 --> 00:32:11,150
thank you

00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:11,809
