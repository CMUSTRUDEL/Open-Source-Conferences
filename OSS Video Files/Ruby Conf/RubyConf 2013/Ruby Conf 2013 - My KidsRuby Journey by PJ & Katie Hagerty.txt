Title: Ruby Conf 2013 - My KidsRuby Journey by PJ & Katie Hagerty
Publication date: 2020-01-27
Playlist: RubyConf 2013
Description: 
	About a year ago, we started a journey to see if kids can code. Guess what?

They can!!

This talk will be a review of the journey itself and a discussion between parent and child on what happened, what's next, and what you should be doing to encourage the next generation of developers.

PJ HAGERTY: Hey everybody.

00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,060
KATIE HAGERTY: Hi there.

00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,140
P..H.: So do you want to introduce yourself?

00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:31,100
K.H.: Sure. I'm Katie. And I do a lot

00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:37,600
of extra curricular activities, like, I'm on the student

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,360
council, and I dance, and I'm in my school's

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,740
musical, which is Alice in Wonderland.

00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,911
P..H.: And anything else?

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,280
K.H.: I code.

00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,020
P.H.: Oh, you code.

00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,400
K.H.: Yes.

00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,700
P.H.: And, for those people out there who haven't

00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,371
met you or seen all of the nine thousand

00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,890
pictures that I've put of you just this weekend

00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:09,080
on Twitter and Instagram -- no, no duck face.

00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,970
K.H.: Duck face.

00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,460
P.H.: How old are you Katie?

00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,130
K.H.: Eleven.

00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,090
P.H.: Yeah, I know that. But tell them that.

00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,930
K.H.: I'm eleven!

00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:23,380
P.H.: So, you started doing this awhile ago, like,

00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,280
and you started with KidsRuby. What got you into

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,000
KidsRuby?

00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,580
K.H.: My brother, Ian.

00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,550
P.H.: What-

00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,100
K.H.: Pretty much, yeah.

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,870
P.H.: What, what, what made you want to do

00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,640
KidsRuby because Ian was doing KidsRuby?

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,700
K.H.: Cause Ian's older, and I really wanted to

00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:43,020
beat him at something. I beat him at very

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,900
few things.

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,860
P.H.: So, it was really all about beating him.

00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,040
It wasn't about, you know, you didn't want to

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,180
be the world's next DHH. You didn't want to

00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,790
be the biggest coder in the world. You just

00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,860
wanted to beat your brother.

00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,260
K.H.: Yeah, but, now I want to code for

00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,990
fun, so, there.

00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,920
P.H.: Code for fun and profit?

00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,920
K.H.: Yeah.

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,920
P.H.: Yeah.

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,980
K.H.: I still beat my brother, though.

00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,220
P.H.: All right. So maybe to make this easier,

00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,600
do you want to do the talk that you

00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,860
gave at Nickel City Ruby?

00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,640
K.H.: Yeah.

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,590
P.H.: All right. Go ahead.

00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,970
K.H.: OK. So, I gave a talk at Nickel

00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:26,260
City Ruby. It was, like, two months ago now,

00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:26,840
right?

00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,600
P.H.: Yeah, it was in September.

00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:35,760
K.H.: Yeah. OK. I noticed KidsRuby just two years

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,730
ago when I was in fourth grade. My brother

00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,200
was doing it, and I wanted to try, cause,

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,840
like I said, I wanted to beat him. After

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,710
my first day, I was almost done with the

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,160
whole thing. I loved it so much, I couldn't

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,580
stop coding.

00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,890
So it went from beating my brother to being

00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,960
absolutely frun- fun, whoops.

00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,210
P.H.: It's OK.

00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,740
K.H.: I used to wonder how this turtle thing

00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:12,170
worked. It, it didn't really, it was a turtle,

00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,980
and you can't actually see it, so I'm like,

00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,600
why the heck is it called a turtle? And

00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,230
I really wanted to know how fast it went.

00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,270
I was never really able, how, able to find

00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,110
out how fast it went, cause it was like

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,290
-- boom!

00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:36,550
So really, I just learned how it worked.

00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:41,530
Before KidsRuby, I thought how I wanted to work,

00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,340
like my dad, a Ruby programmer who works at

00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:52,780
home, in his pajamas. Speaking of which, where's the

00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,440
pajamas?

00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,990
P.H.: Yeah. It is, it is the morning, and

00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,680
it is a Saturday, but I thought that maybe

00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,989
since there are all these other people here, maybe,

00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:04,531
maybe my Batman pajama pants weren't appropriate.

00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,730
K.H.: Well maybe we should have told them to

00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,040
wear their pajamas, too.

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,540
P.H.: That's a good point. We probably should have

00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,000
thought about that.

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,710
K.H.: Go home and put on some pajamas, people.

00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,980
P.H.: Are we, are we just gonna sit here

00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,279
and wait?

00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,560
K.H.: Yup.

00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,800
P.H.: Cause, you know, other people have to talk

00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,040
today too.

00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,900
K.H.: Pajamas first.

00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,381
P.H.: So, no. We'll forgo the pajama party for

00:04:25,381 --> 00:04:25,590
today.

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,239
K.H.: All right.

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,840
P.H.: Next time.

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,520
K.H.: OK. Back to my talk. But I thought

00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,970
kids couldn't use Ruby language. Well, they can, so

00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:42,950
take that me. So when I saw the turtle

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,591
program, I had no idea how it worked, at

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,130
all. I thought it was an actual turtle swimming

00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,680
in a tank.

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,259
But thanks to KidsRuby dot org, now I know,

00:04:53,260 --> 00:05:00,260
so I can code now.

00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,690
You guys probably already know this, but this turtle

00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:09,510
I keep talking about is something called a program.

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,999
A program is set of instructions that, in this

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,890
case, draws shapes the way you want it to.

00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,881
KidRuby taught me how to draw a square on

00:05:19,881 --> 00:05:23,069
my computer at home, to start, and I added

00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:26,450
different code to draw a circle with a bunch

00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:30,231
of sticks coming out -- spokes on a wheel.

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,609
And even a cross. And it was more of,

00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,221
like, a lower-case t cause it wasn't that thick,

00:05:38,221 --> 00:05:40,681
like a cross. You know what I mean.

00:05:40,681 --> 00:05:41,781
P.H.: I know what you mean.

00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:50,919
K.H.: I did all this by writing my square!

00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,471
The first coding thing I did, which I thought

00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,070
was super hard, was commanding the turtle to do

00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:03,099
something. To do this, I used the program language

00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,800
Ruby. I mean, that's why I'm here at RubyConf.

00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,990
I'm not at another conference for another language.

00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:18,100
So what computers don't actually talk like us, we

00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:25,100
use languages like Ruby to talk to them. And

00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,241
we don't, they don't really talk the way we

00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:34,689
do. They're more like, computer-like. And here's what I

00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,161
did, right here, as you can see on my

00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,930
turtle. This is what I did with the turtle

00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,760
a few months ago, which I like playing with

00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,939
a lot cause it's easy to play with it.

00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,660
So.

00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:53,171
Right there is the code, and next to it

00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,339
is the picture. So I did turtle dot draw

00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:00,790
do, because without do you can't actually, it won't

00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:04,701
work, so, after I didn't do KidsRuby for awhile,

00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:07,850
it's like, why the heck is my turtle not

00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,309
working?

00:07:09,309 --> 00:07:12,220
Dad, help.

00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:17,321
Well, I forgot the do, so.

00:07:17,321 --> 00:07:21,820
And then I picked a background color, which is

00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,320
blue-violet, but there it kind of looks like a

00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:32,320
lavender-y purple. And then my pen-color is choral. It's,

00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,389
it's a good color.

00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:38,580
So then I did two dot times do. I

00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:43,560
feel like I just said do two times, cause,

00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,320
it says two dot times two. So you have

00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,281
to do the other do, so it does this

00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:58,419
too. So without the do's, you're not gonna go

00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:03,160
anywhere. The turtle's just gonna sit there. Maybe watch

00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,180
some TV.

00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,230
OK. So then I did forward seventy, which is

00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:13,301
an angle, so, it's like walking forward 70 ti-

00:08:13,301 --> 00:08:14,600
paces.

00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,460
P.H.: Paces.

00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,849
K.H.: Paces. And then turn left ninety. So you'd

00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:26,831
turn left, do ninety paces. And then, that was,

00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,640
and then I did six dot times do, which

00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,050
means it just did that two times. So now

00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:37,091
it's gonna do something else. And that's turn-right forty

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,009
and backward thirty.

00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:42,130
Now, if I did forward again, the picture wouldn't

00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,481
look like this, cause it, it, it, there is

00:08:46,481 --> 00:08:50,160
this one time I did forward one hundred and

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,370
then backward one-hundred, and then it was just a

00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:57,290
straight diagonal line across the screen. So that's how

00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:00,679
that worked.

00:09:00,689 --> 00:09:03,882
And then end, end, end, because I had three

00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,270
do's, as you can see, do, do, do, and

00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:10,749
then I needed three ends, end, end, end, and

00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:17,180
I got that picture right there.

00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:26,400
So this is another part of it, where it's

00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,190
like, it's another part I did in KidsRuby. It's

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,480
another lesson out of the beginning or, it had

00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,790
a title. I know what it is -- just

00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:44,450
can't seem to remember it. It's lost in my

00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,600
mind.

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,029
So, something I didn't show you is alerting and

00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:53,971
putting. With alerting, you can have someone guess a

00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,639
secret number or a type of dance! Cha-cha-cha-cha!

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,900
Anything you can think of. Numbers, words, basically, like,

00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,111
it could be your favorite number. You can also

00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,430
say hello to the world, but this only shows

00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:14,920
up on your computer. So you're really just saying

00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,440
hello to yourself.

00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,450
Yeah. Everybody seems to like that at Nickel City,

00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,440
too.

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,620
So there are, there are lessons on KidsRuby about

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,920
alerting and putting, but I only told you about

00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:39,730
alerting, so here comes some information about putting. Well,

00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:43,740
actually, here's some more stuff about alerting.

00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,119
It will only pop up on your screen, and

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,200
also with the alert, there will be an exclamation

00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,611
point. There will be a white exclamation point with

00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:55,509
a blue circle around it. Well, that's what KidsRuby

00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:58,169
was, so that's what I have.

00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:04,620
However, you're just putting, just puts it on a

00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,120
blank white screen. Like, Google, without the bar and

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,580
and the Google. So it's like plain piece of paper!

00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:24,720
I learned that very expensive and formal, or fancy,

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:31,260
yes, fahncy, applications aren't needed to do all this

00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:36,740
coding. You don't need fancy thingamajigs, big laptops with

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,359
good internet, even though good internet -- it's kind

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,381
of what we need to code. Just make sure

00:11:43,381 --> 00:11:44,859
you got internet.

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,440
And I have a PC with a bunch of

00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,940
stickers on it. And I successfully completed it, but

00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,890
when I completed it, I had no stickers on

00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:03,680
it. Any kid or adult, if you don't code,

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,140
in which case, can get started at any time,

00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,629
and easily. KidsRuby is free, and all you have

00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:15,073
to do is download it on any computer device.

00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:21,160
And that was my talk at Nickel City Ruby.

00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:28,720
It was fun. So.

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,280
P.H.: So we talked a little bit about why

00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,640
you got started in programming, but why is, why

00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,979
is, why is programming, and why is Ruby, why

00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,360
is it fun for you?

00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:44,870
K.H.: Well, first, like I said, I beat my

00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:48,261
brother. So it's absolutely fun for me. And that's

00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,840
kind of why he hates it now, cause I

00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,680
love it. He has to hate it.

00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,360
P.H.: Yeah, he's actually, he's actually now doing like,

00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,889
he's doing, I think, Ember-

00:12:55,889 --> 00:12:56,911
K.H.: Yeah, but.

00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,309
R.H.: Because he doesn't want to do Ruby cause

00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,400
you're doing Ruby.

00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,460
K.H.: Yes. I like pea- no, I don't like

00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,810
peanut butter, he likes peanut butter. I like jelly.

00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,261
He doesn't like jelly.

00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,640
P.H.: But, you know what, the funny thing is

00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,960
is that in the end, you both have sandwiches.

00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,770
K.H.: Yup.

00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,809
P.H.: So it doesn't really matter.

00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:14,231
K.H.: Yeah, but we fight a lot, so.

00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,760
P.H.: Funny, adults do that too. About the same

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,030
things.

00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:23,039
K.H.: Oh, man.

00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:28,060
P.H.: So do you think, when coding stops being

00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,660
fun, that's when people should stop coding?

00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,310
K.H.: No.

00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,741
P.H.: They should keep going then.

00:13:31,741 --> 00:13:32,059
K.H.: Yeah.

00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,019
P.H.: Like it stops being fun, they should drive

00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:34,991
their life into a-

00:13:34,991 --> 00:13:37,769
K.H.: No, they need to try something new. Maybe

00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:44,431
another language or maybe some framework.

00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,560
P.H.: Like, for example, we talked a lot about,

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,451
and we'll talk about the coder-dojo more later, but

00:13:51,451 --> 00:13:53,889
when we started the coder dojo, you wanted to

00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,491
build, like, a blog-y type website, and you immediately

00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,349
said Rails, and I stepped in as professional dad

00:13:59,349 --> 00:14:00,781
and said, Sinatra.

00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,200
K.H.: Yeah, but if you're internet goes out, which

00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,021
in Sinatra is way funny when this happens, it

00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:08,230
says-

00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,710
P.H.: Yes.

00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,520
K.H.: It says, Sinatra has left the stage!

00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,120
P.H.: Which makes it more fun.

00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,289
K.H.: Yup.

00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,480
P.H.: Yes.

00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,310
K.H.: More fun.

00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:16,891
P.H.: And more fun is-

00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,530
P.H.: -really where it's at.

00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,679
K.H.: Since I use it, Ian won't use it.

00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,370
P.H.: Ian won't use it. Well let's, let's leave

00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,320
Ian aside, since he, he could not make it

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,090
down to Miami for various reasons.

00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:27,800
K.H.: Ha-ha-ha!

00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,361
P.H.: That's, you are the worst sister ever.

00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,669
K.H.: But I love him.

00:14:31,669 --> 00:14:34,750
P.H.: So if it's not fun, people are doing

00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,171
it to make money, so is your goal to

00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,810
be like, a gazillionaire?

00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,079
K.H.: Well, I do.

00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:42,341
P.H.: You are, you-

00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:42,679
K.H.: But-

00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,060
P.H.: You do make money doing this?

00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,351
K.H.: I want to, but-

00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,880
P.H.: But there's laws.

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,449
K.H.: You don't -- if coding's fun, you should

00:14:52,449 --> 00:14:55,830
just forget about the money. It's not really about

00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:01,661
the money, it's about helping people with websites, or,

00:15:01,661 --> 00:15:04,749
like, the fun charities you guys do, like Movember!

00:15:04,749 --> 00:15:07,641
R.H.: Yes, we'll talk about Movember later.

00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:09,419
K.H.: You are Movember.

00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:13,111
P.H.: I am -- I am Movember. I'm just

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,300
unshaven. But anyway-

00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,480
K.H.: Unshaven people!

00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,899
P.H.: Stop. So let's go back to how this

00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,580
all started. So you started KidsRuby, you really liked

00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,231
it, you started doing a few other things, and

00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:26,869
then there, you gave a presentation at your school.

00:15:26,869 --> 00:15:27,901
How did that go?

00:15:27,901 --> 00:15:34,568
K.H.: It was -- how do I say this?

00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,961
Awesome!

00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:40,569
P.H.: But, you were also, you were, you were

00:15:40,569 --> 00:15:42,271
basically up, you were in a room, kind of

00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,509
giving like a science fair presentation-

00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,230
K.H.: Well, yeah. It was kind of like a

00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:48,850
science fair, but it was kind of like this,

00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,021
but I wasn't up on a stage. I was

00:15:51,021 --> 00:15:54,069
just standing there by my teacher's u- uh, well

00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:57,110
we were all in different rooms, like, cause there

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,161
were four fourth grade teachers. Didn't matter if the

00:16:00,161 --> 00:16:02,900
person wasn't your teacher. I got Miss Keeper --

00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,859
she was my teacher.

00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:07,690
P.H.: So you, you're getting a little too in-depth

00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,111
on this-

00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,579
K.H.: And so I, it was, it was fun,

00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,520
easy, and I didn't freak out. So there-

00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,681
P.H.: So, it was kind of odd though, because

00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,410
you were doing a big presentation about computer programming,

00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,570
which, if I remember correctly-

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,320
K.H.: Nobody got?

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,311
P.H.: Yeah, we had to, we had to kind

00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,559
of explain to your science teacher why computer science

00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:27,290
is a science, even though science is in, is

00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:27,840
in the term.

00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,481
K.H.: Uh, yeah.

00:16:28,481 --> 00:16:29,959
P.H.: And then he was like, you know, you

00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,400
did that, and you had a couple kids who

00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,340
built a little robot, and basically-

00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:33,750
K.H.: Yeah.

00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,541
P.H.: -everybody else was like, you know, clocks powered

00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:39,360
by potatoes and prismatic colors of the rainbow-

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:39,699
K.H.: How the eyeball works!

00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,541
P.H.: And you walked in and you, you, yeah,

00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:42,530
and you dropped this.

00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:45,689
K.H.: I was the first one, so.

00:16:45,689 --> 00:16:46,720
P.H.: Yeah.

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,300
K.H.: Everybody was like, huh?

00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,050
P.H.: Yeah, if I remember what your principal said,

00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,500
is, I don't know what you're feeding her or

00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,540
what you're doing, but she's pretty dang smart. She

00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,540
may have used stronger languages but, you know, there's

00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,221
kids in the audience, probably. You gotta be careful.

00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:02,720
K.H.: Yeah.

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,230
P.H.: So after that, though, you actually filled out

00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,130
the CFP and got accepted to speak at Nickel

00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,770
City Ruby. Which, for clarity, I did not vote

00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:12,840
on your talk.

00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:17,190
K.H.: No. He just did nothing. I was like-

00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,750
P.H.: I gave you a zero.

00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,930
K.H.: I was like, here, and I was talking,

00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,600
and I was like-

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,750
P.H.: But you had to, you actually had to

00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,370
stand on a box, cause we couldn't see you

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,270
over the podium.

00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:32,530
K.H.: Yeah. I, I had a, I had a

00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:35,800
little crate like that, and I'm only four foot

00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,070
seven and a half, so you couldn't see me!

00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,010
P.H.: Well that's OK. You hold on to that

00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:41,780
half.

00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,080
K.H.: I will.

00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,370
P.H.: You do it. But yeah. I, I remember,

00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,590
we came in after lunch-

00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,040
K.H.: Lunch!

00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,420
P.H.: -and there were gentlemen playing piano on the

00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:49,680
stage-

00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,000
K.H.: Piano!

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,940
P.H.: Because we had one, and -- have a

00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,510
seat.

00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,780
K.H.: Have a seat!

00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,720
P.H.: But, and we went up the podium, and

00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,570
you were not tall enough for the podium, so

00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,880
we had to get you something else.

00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,960
K.H.: Too small.

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,860
P.H.: And, if I remember, it was Flip Sasser

00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,340
who went on before you.

00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,340
K.H.: Correct!

00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:10,970
P.H.: And he said to me that evening, after

00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:13,340
the conference had ended, that if he knew that

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,380
he had to go before you, he would have

00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,000
said there's no way he would have done it,

00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,930
because he doesn't think anybody remembers anything that he

00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:22,450
said, because of the ten minutes that you took

00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,910
on stage and just blew everybody's mind.

00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,580
K.H.: You just won a million dollars.

00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,700
P.H.: I did?

00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,320
K.H.: Yeah.

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,880
P.H.: Well we can talk about that later. I

00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,740
don't even know where that's coming from.

00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,850
K.H.: It's coming from your wallet, technically-

00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:34,940
P.H.: Well, yeah. Basically.

00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,000
K.H.: You already have it!

00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,050
P.H.: Isn't everything coming from, from your wallet. So,

00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,110
the big thing that people took away from your

00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:46,710
talk at Nickel City was that kids can code-

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,420
K.H.: Yup.

00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,270
P.H.: And your HelloWorld comment.

00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:53,110
K.H.: Yeah. I remember, you know, there, we had

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,260
to redo my cards because I had cards for

00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,790
these slides like you saw I was. And for

00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,950
the KIC-

00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,170
K.H. & P.H.: Kids in Query Conference

00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:06,240
K.H.: I had to have a question, and my

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,530
questions were on these cards here. But, it said,

00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,750
can kids code? How does the turtle work? Cause,

00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,830
you have to have the exact question on your

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,450
cards. Couldn't exactly remember what I asked, so I

00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,940
just, it was something about, can kids code, so

00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,520
that's what we wrote down on the card. So

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,090
there you go.

00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,090
P.H.: There you go. So no-

00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,080
K.H.: Just a question-

00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,740
P.H.: But now you're at RubyConf. You're at what's

00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:36,260
basically the biggest Ruby Conference in the world.

00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,060
K.H.: In the world!

00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,410
P.H.: In Miami.

00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,220
K.H.: World, world, world!

00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,930
P.H.: And there's all these people, and I think

00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,830
that, you know, when we were back stage, I

00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,510
think you were nervous.

00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,000
K.H.: Uh, nuh-uh. That was you. You were all

00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,370
like, um, yeah, I'm, and you were like pacing,

00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:58,360
and then you did a power stance.

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,800
P.H.: Power stance. Amanda Coranta?? taught us that.

00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,200
K.H.: Yeah. Use it.

00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,930
P.H.: Use it. So what would you say, cause

00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,310
there's a lot of people out there that I

00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,300
bet have never been up on stage. I mean,

00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:17,740
forget RubyConf. Forget huge conferences. Just, at their local

00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,960
meet-up, they've never gotten up on stage to talk.

00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,790
What would you say to them?

00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:25,610
K.H.: Get up on stage and don't be afraid.

00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:30,090
P.H.: It's just that simple, huh? Put the fear

00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,240
in your back pocket and get-

00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:31,810
P.H.: And get up on stage.

00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:32,550
K.H.: Yup.

00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,910
P.H.: Not right now. That wasn't an invitation.

00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,210
K.H.: Yeah, don't come tackle me on stage. Put

00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,450
the fear- take the fear

00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,630
P.H.: It's not that kind-

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,050
K.H.: -out of the back pocket. Put it back

00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:47,400
in you.

00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:52,400
P.H.; That is not-

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,360
K.H.: I'm sorry, I didn't know what to say!

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,740
P.H.: Well-played madam. Well played. So, let me ask

00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,950
you, cause this kind of-

00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,740
K.H.: Um, madam?

00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,780
P.H.: This kind of-

00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,860
K.H.: Now you're a ma'am. You're a man.

00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,640
P.H.: Yeah man.

00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,160
K.H.: Mah.

00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,260
P.H.: It's up. S'up bro. Do you even lift?

00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,760
K.H.: S'up bro? Let's grow some mustaches.

00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,540
P.H.: Let's grow some mustaches.

00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,780
K.H.: Well, yeah, I do lift, three-pound weights.

00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,720
P.H.: Woo-woo, show off your guns.

00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:24,450
K.H.: Gun show. You got the tickets.

00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,440
P.H.: All right.

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,740
K.H.: That was my joke when I was three.

00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,320
P.H.: All right, let's, let's, I think we've somehow

00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,360
gotten off track, maybe, a little bit.

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,840
K.H.: Who cares? People are laughing!

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,700
P.H.: Yes, I know.

00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,020
K.H.: That was my goal.

00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,850
P.H.: We do have a few more informative questions

00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,470
to get through before we finish this.

00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,030
K.H.: I don't want to finish.

00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,000
P.H.: You can't be on stage forever.

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,780
K.H.: Um-

00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,340
P.H.: All right, focus.

00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,290
K.H.: Get the duct tape!

00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,120
P.H.: All right, are we good?

00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,380
K.H.: I can never be serious, ever.

00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,430
P.H.: I know. I've noticed that.

00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:57,790
K.H.: In my life.

00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,470
P.H.: And now all of these people know, too.

00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,250
K.H.: Oh, wait, you want me to be serious.

00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,300
P.H.: Yes, just for a moment, can we-

00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:05,310
K.H.: Did you know that rainbow trout are in

00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,020
the ocean, but why the heck are they called

00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,280
rainbow trout? Cause they are not in the color

00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,040
of the rainbow.

00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,550
P.H.: Honey.

00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,550
K.H.: They are trout.

00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,300
P.H.: Honey. Honey.

00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,830
K.H.: They're just plain old trout!

00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,420
P.H.: Honey! This is not the rainbow trout convention.

00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:21,480
We can go there another time. But I'm gonna

00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:21,850
ask you-

00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,590
K.H.: That's not funny.

00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:22,950
P.H.: Hey-

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,510
K.H.: I'm serious.

00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,760
P.H.: All right. I'm gonna ask you another question.

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,200
So.

00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,070
K.H.: OK.

00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,790
P.H.: What would you say, first of all, to

00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,880
any kids who want to learn how to program?

00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,970
K.H.: Do it!

00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:34,900
P.H.: Do it?

00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,070
K.H.: Do it!

00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,740
P.H.: Can you elaborate on that further?

00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,560
K.H.: Do it cause it's fun!

00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,990
P.H.: Do it cause it's fun. What about-

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,600
K.H.: F-

00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,580
P.H.: What about-

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,290
K.H.: U-

00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:44,980
P.H.: -adults-

00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,680
K.H.: N!

00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,100
P.H.: -who are out there, who are programmers, what

00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,980
would you say to them about getting kids involved?

00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:53,560
K.N.: I mean, don't walk up to a stranger

00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:58,600
and be like, hey kids, do programming! Hehe.

00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,680
P.H.: Now I can see how that would come

00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,980
off as slightly creepy. Also, probably-

00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,610
K.H.: Here's a random laptop!

00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,680
P.H.: -don't offer, here's a random laptop and some

00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,460
free candy. Come, I'll teach you to program.

00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,310
K.H.: Oh yeah. There's another thing. If you work

00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:14,150
in a coding building, do not put up an

00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:17,000
electric sign that says Come Code With Us! Free

00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:17,330
Candy!

00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,250
P.H.: Also, probably, it shouldn't do that to hire

00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,770
new people. Like, hey, come program with us. We

00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,450
have a ping pong table.

00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:29,080
K.H.: And then, you know, it's like, it's like,

00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,070
it's just like, you can't do that. Plus, it,

00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,660
you're throwing candy at a kid, make sure they're

00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,240
not jolly-ranchers.

00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,890
P.H.: Yeah, those things hurt.

00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:39,240
K.H.: Boom! Ow.

00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,440
P.H.: So, do you think programs for, programming is

00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,060
for everyone?

00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,750
K.H.: Only if they like it. You gotta, you

00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,580
can't just put someone at a computer and be

00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,910
like, code, person, code!

00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,700
P.H.: Right, and we talked a little bit when

00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,130
we were getting ready for the talk, you said

00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,900
that, basically, people who are under the age of

00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,180
two and can barely talk, they probably shouldn't code.

00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,710
K.H.: No. Cause if you can't talk, you can't

00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:03,330
write, you can't type, you can't read.

00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,510
P.H.: That's true.

00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,220
K.H.: And other stuff, but I'm not-

00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:05,520
P.H.: And also-

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,730
K.H.: -not getting into that.

00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:09,650
P.H.: Also, great-grandmothers over the age of one-hundred probably

00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:10,770
shouldn't code.

00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:14,370
K.H.: Yeah. One-hundred. You're done.

00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:20,080
P.H.: So you get ninety-eight- So you get ninety-eight

00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,030
good years of coding in, and then, that's not

00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,860
bad, though. Ninety-eight years. You could probably make a

00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,100
spot of change in ninety-eight years.

00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,600
K.H.: I'm gonna make the world change with my

00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,030
coding.

00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,890
P.H.: Is that what, is that, you got that

00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,110
from Matz yesterday? You're gonna go out and change

00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:37,950
the world?

00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,970
K.H.: Yeah.

00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,450
P.H.: Now how are you-

00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,370
K.H.: With magical unicorns!

00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,330
P.H.: With, with magical unicorns.

00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:44,410
K.H.: And pegasi!

00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,920
P.H.: It's hard- thank you for using the correct

00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,260
plural.

00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,550
K.H.: I hate when people say pegaseseseseses-

00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,900
P.H.: Pegaseseseses.

00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,260
K.H.: Seseseses.

00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,300
P.H.: So do you think people, like, as far

00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,400
as changing the world, you think people should write

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,430
code that, like, helps other people out, like, you

00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,310
know, maybe, gives back to charities or does something

00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,120
to help people who are in need?

00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:05,670
K.H.: Like Movember.

00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,960
P.H.: Like Movember, but there's lots of other things

00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,600
out there.

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,930
K.H.: Yeah. I'm just gonna use Movember for an

00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:13,880
example. Like, if you do stuff for charity, it

00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,610
lets people know you're smart and intelligent to give

00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:21,490
what you have to people that need it. And

00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,000
it lets people know you care and you're not

00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,830
cold-blooded and you have a heart. I know you

00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,890
have one, cause most the time I'll run up

00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:32,680
and hug you and you'll be like, ugh, she

00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,110
hit me in the gut!

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,220
P.M.: And that gets, that gets my-

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:36,620
K.H.: That's lame.

00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,580
P.M.: That gets my blood flowing because my heart

00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,860
beats when you, when you tackle me and hug

00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,300
me.

00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,340
K.H.: You know I can hear your heart go

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:41,970
beat, beat, beat, yeah.

00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,750
P.H.: OK, this is not that time.

00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,670
K.H.: Aww!

00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,840
P.H.: We can go to Karaoke later maybe.

00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,600
K.H.: Oh yeah!

00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:52,610
P.H.: But, so, all right. I've completely lost track

00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,260
of my questions because you're slightly distracting.

00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,970
K.H.: He. He. He he.

00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:57,960
P.H.: Is there anything kids can do on their

00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,100
own to get started?

00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:04,410
K.H.: Yeah. Get interested. Also, they can use those

00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:05,940
resources right there on the screen.

00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,740
P.H.: Do you want me to laser point them?

00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,310
Ooh!

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,030
K.H.: Ooh! Ooh!

00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,160
P.H.: No.

00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,010
K.H.: Oh, come on. Please?

00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,280
P.H.: I don't, I don't feel like it's safe.

00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,600
K.H.: Daddy, I have a lazer pointer at home.

00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,560
P.H.: Yes. And it's been in my eyeball before.

00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,690
So that's why I'm thinking that maybe it's not

00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,070
a good idea.

00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,800
K.H.: Please? OK. You want to do it for

00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,090
me.

00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:27,960
P.H.: Absolutely. So-

00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,540
K.H.: OK.

00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,000
P.H.: You talk and I'll point.

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,100
K.H.: How would you point over there while I

00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:32,340
talk over here?

00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,410
P.H.: I'll point over there and you'll point over

00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:33,840
there.

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,080
K.H.: OK, so let's start at the top. Coder

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,690
dojos!

00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,330
P.H.: What are Coder Dojos?

00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:46,340
K.H.: Coder Dojos? Well, what are Coder Dojos? They're

00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,700
people who code, dojos.

00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,230
P.H.: So they're, they're people who code professionally, and

00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,390
then kids come in with their ideas, and-

00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:57,650
K.H.: Yeah. Pretty much, it's like-

00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,820
P.H.: It's, it's, kid-driven, it's coding by kids for

00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,440
kids-

00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,030
P.H.: With professionals.

00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:04,960
K.H.: Kids wanna code? You get mentors, and we

00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,120
pair them up there. I've worked with my dad.

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:13,730
P.H.: I think they all know I'm here honey.

00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:18,460
K.H.: Just so you're clear, this is my dad.

00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:18,980
And-

00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,040
P.H.: We're-

00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,750
K.H.: I bet most of you don't know his

00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,360
real name.

00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,780
P.H.: OK, we're not going there.

00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,680
K.H.: And also-

00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,190
P.H.: And also in fairness, there's your mom. You

00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:32,640
should-

00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,020
K.H.: Wave mom!

00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:37,990
P.H.: You're fifty percent responsible for this.

00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:43,070
K.H.: That's my mom!

00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,770
P.H.: So let's, so let's focus. Coder Dojos. KidsRuby-

00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:46,250
K.H.: OK.

00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,650
P.H.: -we already talked about that.

00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:48,060
K.H.: Nuh-uh!

00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:48,470
P.H.: Oh?

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,380
K.H.: I have stuff to say about KidsRuby.

00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,760
P.H.: We are running out of time.

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,400
K.H.: Besides the stuff I said about KidsRuby, like

00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,400
I said, kids Coder Dojos, and you can't Coder

00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:02,200
Dojos without kids, just so you know. KidsRuby. KidsRuby.

00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:07,010
All right. So, yup. There it is. KidsRuby. Thank

00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:07,530
you.

00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:14,510
KidsRuby really hit it in Coder Dojos. I recommended

00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,470
it to some of the kids. They started doing

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,490
stuff. They were like, I don't understand. I have,

00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:23,100
I like, like, one of them started Code Academy

00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,450
-- which is down there. Code Academy. And, they're

00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:28,450
like, I'm sorry, I don't get this, can we

00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,840
start somewhere easier?

00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,850
So they went to KidsRuby, even if they didn't

00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,970
want to do Ruby, it's kind of like a

00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:41,870
good place to start. So we started there and

00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,830
they actually got into RubyWarrior.

00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:45,660
Haiah!

00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:52,660
And then HacketyHack. Well, I don't know that was

00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,930
a website at first. So dad?

00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,250
P.H.: Yes?

00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:01,340
K.H.: Why, I-I-I, I had no idea. All I

00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:05,380
know is there's HacketyHack lessons on KidsRuby. And I

00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:05,980
think-

00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,820
P.H.: There's kind of a lot of cross-over between

00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,540
the two things, but.

00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,080
K.H.: I think-

00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,620
P.H.: They teach things slightly differently.

00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,110
K.H.: I think HacketyHack was in the lessons of

00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,850
the turtle, I think.

00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:16,420
P.H.: Yes.

00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,570
K.H.: And the learning putting as well. So I

00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,570
just gave you a presentation on what I did

00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:26,090
with HacketyHack there. Then Code Academy. It's an Academy

00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,610
for people that code.

00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:29,760
P.H.: For people that want to code.

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,930
K.H.: Yup. Adults can do it. I just do

00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,810
it and I'm like sixty-percent through the Ruby. Yay!

00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:37,590
P.H.: Yay! All right, so have a seat.

00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,500
K.H.: OK.

00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:43,860
P.H.: We're done with the pointing. Time, Katie, time.

00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,280
K.H.: OK.

00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,740
P.H.: So we talked about Coder Dojo, and this

00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,110
is a picture-

00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:49,490
K.H.: Coder Dojo!

00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,430
P.H.: This is a picture from our Coder Dojo.

00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,070
K.H.: Yup.

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,810
P.H.: It was the first one.

00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:56,960
K.H.: Yup. At the EngineYard office in Buffalo.

00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,110
P.H.: Yup. But the, the next one that we

00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:02,430
have is actually, like, after we did the first

00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,830
one, a lot of people wanted to come along

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,760
and do it as well.

00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,150
K.H.: Yeah. Two weeks from now is our next

00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,010
Coder Dojo.

00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,180
P.H.: And I think we have, like, fifteen kids

00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,810
signed up. So that's three times as many.

00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:14,300
K.H.: Yup. These are all the kids. See the

00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,050
kids squatting. Yeah, that's funny.

00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,340
P.H.: And that's Ian.

00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,270
K.H.: That's Ian! That's my brother. He was just

00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:23,550
a little bit too tall, like that other kid.

00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,130
That's a kid people, not an adult, there's only

00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:28,830
four adults in the picture. Just four.

00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,500
P.H.: Sometimes, sometimes a teenager kids start to get

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,770
tall. But it was really easy to set up,

00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:36,750
because you basically, you said, daddy, I want to

00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,740
go to West Newark Ruby every month. I want

00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,800
to see all your friends. I want to hang

00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,260
out with Wayne and Nick. And I said- No.

00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,610
K.H.: I, yeah. You said no.

00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:46,270
P.H.: I said no.

00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,990
K.H.: I'm like, but, ahh!

00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:51,940
P.H.: I think there's a certain language of, of,

00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,130
of, a certain amount of language that's used there

00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,440
that probably is maybe-

00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,750
K.H.: Swearing! Like-

00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:59,130
P.H.: I've heard of this swearing before-

00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,530
K.H.: Ple-ple-ple-ple!

00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:03,590
P.H.: OK. So we, we, I helped you get

00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,560
setup, but you basically run the Coder Dojo. Your

00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,000
mom and I just buy the pizza and soda

00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,640
and show up.

00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,280
K.H.: Yup. And you work with me. But hopefully

00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,260
we can get more mentors-

00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,720
P.H.: But next time we, cause I'm not very

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,640
good at this.

00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,380
K.H.: Daddy, we're working on a website together, which,

00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,270
I'll tell you about later. And yeah.

00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,580
P.H.: Yeah, we should actually get to this.

00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:23,080
K.H.: And as you notice, my dad's not in

00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,020
that picture.

00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,240
P.H.: Cause I took it.

00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,320
K.H.: No, actually, mom took it, because she wanted

00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,080
you to get in. You never did.

00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,400
P.H.: That's not the way it went down. I

00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,950
remember this very differently.

00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:40,320
K.H.: Well I was looking at the camera and

00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:40,780
I did not see your-

00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,480
P.H.: I think I was doing some very-

00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,530
P.H.: I was doing some very important logistical work.

00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:46,700
K.H.: Oh, yeah. Logistical.

00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,460
P.H.: So what's next for you?

00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:56,460
K.H.: What's next? Kitter. Kitter for Kids. That's why

00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:05,460
I took the Tw off Twitter. Kitter. That's simple.

00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:11,710
So Kitter is a place where you can crack

00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:16,400
jokes or puns, anything that you think is funny,

00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,740
you can put on Kitter, which I'm actually making

00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,680
right now. So don't go home and look up

00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,950
Kitter dot com because it's not ready yet.

00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:28,580
And, instead of followers, you have fans, because followers

00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,600
on Kitter - not good. Because you'd rather be

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,600
famous and have fans, instead of followers, cause then,

00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,910
you don't want, like, five million people following you.

00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:44,860
And then I'm building, well first, it's gonna be

00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,700
a blog for Coder Dojo, the Western New York

00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:47,960
one.

00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,130
Oh, my god, I messed that up.

00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:52,680
P.H.: It's OK, honey. It's OK.

00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,540
K.H.: So-

00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,960
P.H.: People don't really know where Western Newark is

00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,340
anyway.

00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,290
K.H.: It's technically a blog, for people. It's for

00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:00,690
the kids of Coder Dojo, and it's gonna be,

00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:04,810
like, there's, like, the more you code, the higher

00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:10,950
you get. So it's gonna be like student, give

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,220
me a name.

00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:18,000
P.H.: Steve. That's not what you were looking for.

00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,540
K.H.: No. Like, you have to have like, a

00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,750
crazy nickname. So-

00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,250
P.H.: So it's like, it goes, I think it

00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,570
goes, like, learner, student-

00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:31,580
K.H.: Learner, let's, let's say-

00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,180
P.H.: Apprentice.

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,800
K.H.: Learner.

00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,010
P.H.: Something, something. Prophet.

00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:42,800
K.H.: Learner, student, ninja, apprentice, sensai.

00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,310
P.H.: Sensai. And other than that, you're just gonna

00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,210
be a normal kid, right.

00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:48,050
K.H.: Being a normal kid.

00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:52,300
P.H.: As normal as you get. All right.

00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:56,970
K.H.: I'm pretty normal.

00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,500
P.H.: So we do have to say thank you

00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,460
to EngineYard before we get off stage.

00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,100
K.H.: Thank you EngineYard!

00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,090
P.H.: Because EngineYard was nice enough to fly you

00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:06,900
all the way down here, give you a fancy

00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,450
hotel room, and give you-

00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:08,870
K.H.: Fancy!

00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,940
P.H.: And give you this sweet t-shirt, and-

00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:13,260
K.H.: Sweet t-shirt. See?

00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,419
P.H.: So-

00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:17,321
K.H.: They do have tank-tops.

00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:20,520
P.H.: Can you, can you give- I don't know

00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,270
if we have any left. Can you, can you

00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,869
just look right at the camera, cause I think

00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:26,511
he's watching on the live feed, and say thank

00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,020
you to Engineer and say thank you to Aman

00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:28,760
Leonard?

00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:33,440
K.H.: Thank you, EngineYard and Amond. I think he's

00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,800
in Germany right now, right?

00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,780
P.H.: I don't know where he is right now.

00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,340
K.H.: OK.

00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,139
P.H.: He's anywhere in the world watching you. That's

00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,111
how he's spending his Saturday.

00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:47,779
K.H.: Oh! Hi! I like your Irish accent. It's

00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,409
cool.

00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:50,851
P.H.: Actually, that brings up a good point, because

00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,639
Amond had a, had a young friend who was

00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,150
eleven years old, and now you're talking to Adam-

00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:57,901
K.H.: Oh, yeah. My pen-pal from Ireland.

00:34:57,901 --> 00:34:59,900
P.H.: Who developed a chat-up line app and now

00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,220
likes to talk to my daughter on email.

00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:08,050
K.H.: Yup. We still need to- hello, I'm trying

00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:12,910
to say something dad. OK, so, he's never emailed

00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,450
me any puns, but I do know one.

00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:14,880
P.H.: What's that?

00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,730
K.H.: Are you a keyboard? Cause you're just my

00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,470
type.

00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,280
P.H.: All right, and with that, I think we're

00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,910
ready to wrap it up. So I-

00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:27,490
K.H.: OK.

00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:29,320
P.H.: -wanna say, I wanna say thank you to

00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,430
you, because I don't think you realize this is

00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,520
a, this is a big deal, that I get

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,540
to come up here and sit with my lovely

00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:35,870
daughter.

00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:38,000
K.H.: We'll do a water show. I did a

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,380
water show with you!

00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,380
P.H.: We did a water show at the Reds

00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:39,780
Carl yesterday.

00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,260
K.H.: We were all like-

00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:43,160
P.H.: We did a lovely water show. We don't

00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,750
need to talk about that.

00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:47,130
K.H.: And then you threw me in the air

00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:47,370
and -

00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:47,620
P.H.: Yes.

00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,210
K.H.: and I twirled and we did ripple effects.

00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:48,410
P.H.: OK, all right, all right.

00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:48,720
K.H.: And nobody else was in the pool, and-

00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,040
P.H.: OK-

00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,190
K.H.: -and there was purple spot lights and I

00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,880
was all like-

00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,730
P.H.: All right, Katie. Katie-

00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:57,000
K.H.: We were dancing.

00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,970
P.H.: Katie, bring it down. Thank you.

00:35:58,980 --> 00:35:59,300
K.H.: OK.

00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,560
P.H.: I like to think I'm a cool dancer.

00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,800
K.H.: You were holding me-

00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,800
P.H.: All right, so-

00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,040
K.H.: -while you were dancing.

00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,280
P.H.: Thank you to you.

00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,060
K.H.: K.

00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,670
P.H.: Thank you to all these people for listening.

00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:10,160
K.H.: Thank you for listening, people, you know you

00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,610
didn't have to come if you didn't want to.

00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,700
You didn't necessarily have to come. You could go

00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,340
walk out that door right now.

00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,980
P.H.: OK, so, if anybody has any questions, you'll

00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,210
be at the EngineYard with me later today, right?

00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:22,410
K.H.: Right. Actually, I think I'm going right now,

00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:22,860
aren't I?

00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,010
P.H.: Well, that would, any time after right now

00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:25,660
is later today.

00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:28,440
K.H.: Yup. I'm gonna be at the EngineYard booth

00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,980
if you got any questions.

00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:33,340
P.H.: All right. So thank you very much everybody.

00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,120
K.H.: That's my GitHub!

00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,540
P.H.: That's my girl!

00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:54,800
