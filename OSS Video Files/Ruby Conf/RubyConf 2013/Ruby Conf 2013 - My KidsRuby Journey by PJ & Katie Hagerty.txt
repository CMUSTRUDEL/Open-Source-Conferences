Publication date: 2020-01-27
Playlist: RubyConf 2013
Description: 
	About a year ago, we started a journey to see if kids can code. Guess what?

They can!!

This talk will be a review of the journey itself and a discussion between parent and child on what happened, what's next, and what you should be doing to encourage the next generation of developers.
