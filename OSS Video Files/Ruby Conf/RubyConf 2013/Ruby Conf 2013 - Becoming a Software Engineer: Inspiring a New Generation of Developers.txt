Title: Ruby Conf 2013 - Becoming a Software Engineer: Inspiring a New Generation of Developers
Publication date: 2020-01-27
Playlist: RubyConf 2013
Description: 
	By Kinsey Ann Durham

In my wildest dreams, I never thought that I would become a software developer. I thought that I wasn't smart enough, that I needed a computer science degree and to have been writing code since I was young. But, the traditional path to becoming a developer is changing. This talk will focus on alternative and untraditional paths to becoming a developer such as programs like Railsbridge, mentorship and apprentice programs. These alternative paths ultimately foster a more diverse and inclusive community, which drives economic growth and produces more innovative solutions. 
The objectives of the talk are: 
- to bring awareness to the educational alternatives to computer science degrees 
- to encourage empathy when mentoring a beginner 
- to get the audience to see a different perspective and embrace differences in the industry

KINSEY ANN DURHAM: OK, I'm gonna go ahead and start.

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,619
How's everybody doing today?

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:20,939
AUDIENCE: We're good.

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:21,939
K.A.D.: Good?

00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:23,130
Having a good conference?

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,740
Thank you all

00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:25,820
for coming.

00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,820
I'm Kinsey.

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,560
I'm an apprentice at ThoughtBot

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,419
in the new Denver office, and today I'm going

00:00:32,419 --> 00:00:35,730
to be talking about becoming a software engineer: inspiring

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,489
a new generation of developers.

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:40,149
So if you were to tell me even a

00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:42,350
year ago that I would be standing up here

00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,570
speaking at RubyConf, I would have told you that

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,400
you were crazy.

00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,950
I never dreamt or even thought

00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,710
it was possible to find such a yearning passion

00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,829
for writing code.

00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:55,399
I thought I wasn't smart enough,

00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:58,170
and I honestly build up building ba- grew up

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,040
building Barbie's dreamhouse and not computers.

00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,320
I have been working in ad agencies since I

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,320
was sixteen.

00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,860
I was an advertising major and I

00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:07,860
was good at it.

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:08,860
And the thought of being

00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,960
a software engineer never crossed my mind.

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,960
It honestly

00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,090
looked really boring and intimidating.

00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,500
My step-brother is a

00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,250
really awesome developer, and any time I heard him

00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,070
talk, it sounded like he was talking in an

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,070
alien language.

00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,610
I never understood anything that he was

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:24,610
saying.

00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,909
People are shocked and sometimes even blatantly negative when

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:29,020
they hear about my new dreams of becoming a

00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,780
developer.

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,350
Friends' jaws literally dropped when I told them

00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,750
that I was learning how to write code.

00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:36,750
I've

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,340
also received comments that I'm too sociable and I'm

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,750
the last person on Earth they thought would want

00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:41,750
to write code.

00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,640
That I should be in sales

00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,230
and also I don't think in a way that

00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,450
a developer should.

00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,680
I don't ever want to let these comments discourage

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,799
me, although it's definitely easier said than done.

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,799
There

00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:54,799
are definitely times when I want to give up

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,880
and throw my computer out the door and go

00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,250
back to some of the mindless work I did

00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,750
in advertising.

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,939
So the path to becoming a software engineer, in

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:06,280
my mind, was straightforward and well-defined.

00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,280
You needed a

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,060
computer, you needed a computer science degree, to have

00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,640
dropped out of your computer science degree to work

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,850
for a company writing code, or have been a

00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,830
self-taught programmer who loon- learned to code at a

00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,540
very young age.

00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,480
Recently, the community has seen a rise in non-traditional

00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,420
paths to becoming a software engineer.

00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,420
These paths are

00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,430
the future to building a diverse community and training

00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,540
the next generation of developers.

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,540
So today I'm here

00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,680
to argue that outreach programs, mentorship and apprentice programs

00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,040
are legitimate paths to becoming a software engineer.

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,980
This path is begin, has been the beginning of

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,421
my journey, making me see that what I thought

00:02:46,421 --> 00:02:50,120
was impossible was actually possible.

00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,120
So I first want

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,110
to talk about outreach programs.

00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,110
Railsbridge is a great

00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,980
example of an outreach program that is working.

00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,810
So how many people have heard of Railsbridge?

00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:00,810
Wow.

00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:01,810
That's a lot.

00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:02,810
A lot.

00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:03,810
Awesome.

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:04,810
How many people

00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,360
have volunteered, sponsored, or participated in a Railsbridge?

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,210
Awesome.

00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,540
I can honestly tell you that a Railsbridge workshop

00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,020
changed my life.

00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,220
Railsbridge, for those of you who

00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,989
don't know even though most of you raised your

00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:20,810
hands, is an outreach program that puts on free

00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:25,890
weekend workshops where people learn from experienced Rails volunteers.

00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,810
So these workshop attract, workshops attract a lot of

00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,750
beginners, and in one day you get to build

00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,120
a basic Rails app and deploy it on Heroku.

00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,060
It planted a seed to a career that I

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,709
had always dreamed of but hadn't yet realized.

00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:39,709
I

00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:41,150
not only met Jesse McAdam who would become one

00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,110
of my greatest mentors and influencers, but discovered a

00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,810
passion for writing Rails that I never would have

00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,879
discovered on my own.

00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:50,319
This is a Tweet that I Tweeted when I

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,579
was at Railsbridge.

00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:53,269
I was so excited.

00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:55,569
Railsbridge taught me that writing code wasn't scary and

00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,000
in a few hours I deployed my first application

00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,049
to Heroku.

00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:00,849
I literally remember it like it was

00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:01,849
yesterday.

00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:02,909
I was yelling at my best friend who

00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,470
also was in the workshop at the top of

00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,459
my lungs that I was going to write code

00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:07,650
from now on.

00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,450
And Railsbridge was the beginning of

00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,329
my journey, where I learned that I could actually

00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:14,920
have a passion for writing code.

00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,840
So SarahMay and Sarah Allen started Railsbridge in 2009

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,340
when the San Francisco Ruby community was 98% male

00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,140
and 2% female.

00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,500
Since the program lowered the barrier

00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,300
to entry, they saw an increase of women attending

00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,300
the workshops.

00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,050
In one year, the Sarahs saw the

00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,539
female ratio increase from 2 to 18% thanks to

00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:37,250
Railsbridge efforts.

00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:42,229
And I am - yeah.

00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:47,570
So I am definitely not the only one who

00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,800
has pursued a career in web development thanks to

00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,020
Railsbridge.

00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,180
I want to share with you guys a

00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,900
few of the testimonials from various women who have

00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,560
attended the workshop and who are now full-time software

00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,740
engineers.

00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,590
So Rachel Meyers who is now a developer at

00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,320
GitHub said this about her experience at Railsbridge.

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,320
I'm

00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,740
gonna let you guys read this, cause I don't

00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:14,669
want to just read off the slide.

00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:19,460
Laura Steadman, who is now a developer at QuickLab,

00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,880
said that attending Railsbridge was inspiring because of what

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,200
she built that day.

00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,660
Or not because of what

00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,590
she built that day, but rather the sincere enthusiasm

00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,020
of the volunteers.

00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,300
She was amazed that people were

00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,950
giving up their weekends to volunteer at a workshop.

00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:39,069
Rita Vatshi who is now a developer outright stated

00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:44,030
this.

00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:51,970
So Railsbridge is not the only outreach program that

00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,979
is out there that has been successful.

00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:54,979
Rails Girls,

00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,610
Women who Code, Black Girls who Code are other

00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:00,371
great programs, all of which need sponsors, teachers, and

00:06:00,371 --> 00:06:02,660
volunteers on an ongoing basis.

00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,100
I'm currently the coordinator

00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,940
for the Denver women who code group, and it

00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,729
is truly amazing to see the impact that the

00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:11,770
group has had in the community in one year.

00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,060
The most popular meetups are typically ones that are

00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,860
geared towards beginners, so in them we have more

00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,040
experienced females develop- female developers come in to speak

00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,290
about how they got into programming, what resources are

00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:27,729
out there and advice to becoming a developer.

00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:29,639
So now that I've talked about outreach programs, I

00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,150
want to talk about mentorship.

00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,250
Mentorship is another important

00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,350
aspect to train the next generation of developers.

00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,350
Mentorship

00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,820
is beneficial to me because I look to my

00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,669
mentors not only for technical skills but for soft

00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,150
skills and support.

00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,610
Because, to go from attending a

00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:49,050
Railsbridge workshop to becoming a full-time software engineer is

00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:52,199
way more work than I ever expected.

00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,660
There are days when I come home in tears

00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,470
and I feel stupid and frustrated for not understanding

00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,400
basic concepts still.

00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,630
I'm not only learning how to

00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:03,199
write Ruby, Rails, testing frameworks, use get, but a

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,310
completely new way of thinking.

00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,020
So Jesse who I mentioned earlier is one of

00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,199
my greatest mentors has opened doors to me that

00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,640
I didn't even know existed.

00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,060
She's truly humble about

00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,520
all the work that she's doing and bringing diversity

00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,250
into the industry, but she really is making a

00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,250
difference.

00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,610
She works tirelessly on top of her job

00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,970
and managing her family to reach out through organizations.

00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,210
It's like Dev Chicks and Railsbridge.

00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,289
And I even hear her talking about how she

00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:30,139
wants to open a beginning to code school in

00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:32,580
her house on the weekend.

00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,580
Jesse and one other

00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,069
mentor in particular have been there for me, to

00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:38,289
pick me back up when I'm feeling frustrated and

00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:40,639
that I cannot continue, and they remind me of

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,080
how far I've come in a year and how

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,600
hard it truly is to understand this stuff.

00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,169
no matter how busy they are, they are always

00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:48,930
there to listen to me and help me when

00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,440
I get stuck on a problem and am floundering.

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,379
So they give me the encouragement that I sometimes

00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:56,460
desperately need.

00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,750
So mentoring is also beneficial to my mentors.

00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,750
My

00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,440
mentors constantly tell me how mentoring ultimately makes them

00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,330
a better developer, because it solidifies an understanding of

00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,470
the content being taught.

00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,270
John Fully, who's a developer

00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,520
at Pivotal Labs told me that mentoring elevates you

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,430
from thinking you know to actually knowing you know

00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,620
or not knowing at all.

00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,199
Mentoring not only provides countless and necessary benefits to

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,080
the mentee, but to the mentor perspectively.

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,080
So even

00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,930
advanced developers can learn new things by having to

00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,830
explain it in a way that a beginner can

00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,750
understand it.

00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,289
So I recently came for- full-circle in the Railsbridge

00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:32,920
community and was a TA for one of the

00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:37,000
workshops in Colorado, and teaching basic Ruby conference- concepts

00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,919
was really frightening because I kept questioning myself, and

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,460
I went back, you know, and did more research

00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,061
and made sure that I actually understood what I

00:08:44,061 --> 00:08:45,550
was telling people.

00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,870
So I really did learn a lot that day.

00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,280
Maybe even more than when I was doing the

00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,650
Railsbridge workshop.

00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,530
So I really think that mentorship is worth your

00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,530
time.

00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:56,980
How many people here have been mentored by

00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,980
somebody?

00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,699
Quite a few.

00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:00,699
And did it help you in

00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:02,530
advancing your career?

00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:03,800
Yes.

00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,069
Cool.

00:09:05,069 --> 00:09:06,780
And how many people here have been a mentor

00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,780
to somebody?

00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,780
Wow.

00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,850
That's a lot of hands.

00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:10,850
That's

00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,850
awesome.

00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,850
I want to encourage everyone to be a

00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:16,220
mentor if you have time, resources, and the patience

00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,420
to do so.

00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,420
Mentoring is a really hard thing

00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,440
to do and it definitely isn't for everyone.

00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,440
It

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,230
requires a lot of time and patience.

00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,880
I'm really inspired because I've met a lot of

00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,030
people here this weekend who are mentors and, or,

00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,310
or making the effort to become a great mentor.

00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,820
So thanks to all of you who I've talked

00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,959
to you about this and your efforts are truly

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,530
making a difference.

00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:39,100
Now I want to switch gears and talk about

00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,840
what it means to be a great mentor.

00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,840
I've

00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,770
had so many great mentors this past year and

00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,010
would love to share with you some of the

00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:47,250
qualities that I thought they all shared.

00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,250
Ally talked

00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,920
about this in her lightning talk yesterday and she

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,730
gave a lot of great advice as well.

00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:56,329
So if you were gifted in explaining concepts, complex

00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:59,830
concepts simply, you would be a great mentor.

00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:00,830
The

00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:01,900
greatest mentors that I have had were able to

00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,530
take an abstract concept and make it really concrete

00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,530
to me.

00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:08,170
Emily Saffo, who presented yesterday, she gave

00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,180
an awesome talk in Paris at a conference about

00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,760
concurrency in Ruby.

00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,760
And she gave a really simple

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,340
analogy to explain threading, and it, she compared it

00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,799
with an orchestra, and I thought it was a

00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:21,939
really awesome metaphor, and she took this complex thing

00:10:21,939 --> 00:10:23,790
and really broke it down into something simple that

00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,150
I could understand.

00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:28,720
Last night, Steve Harms who presented here at RubyConf

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,189
yesterday gave us a Star Wars example that was,

00:10:32,189 --> 00:10:33,650
that made it easy for us to understand the

00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:36,590
topic he was talking about in regards to object-oriented

00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,319
programming.

00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:40,420
It's really important to try and explain these things

00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,880
in a simple manner that anyone can understand, at

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,670
least at first, to get the concept through.

00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,670
And

00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,850
you know some con- some concepts are complex and

00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:50,500
can't really be boiled down to something simple.

00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,880
But one technique that one of my mentors does

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,800
with me is ask me, if I had no

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,140
idea what any of this was, how would you

00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,260
explain to me what I was doing?

00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,260
It was

00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,640
really challenging and hard for me to do that.

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,010
It is, once again, beneficial to the mentor to

00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,949
have to explain things in a simple way.

00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:11,179
Awareness.

00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:14,470
Awareness of both yourself and your mentee.

00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,470
Mentors

00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,470
who are unaware of the fact that they are

00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,950
coming off as discouraging could ruin or completely dissuade

00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,150
a beginners' passion for the craft.

00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,150
It is important

00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,380
to be aware of signs of frustration, language that

00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,080
is discouraging, and body language when mentoring an apprentice

00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,880
developer.

00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,780
Great mentors that I have had have also been

00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,290
very aware of my learning styles.

00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,290
The same mentor

00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,990
that would, that would ask me to explain things

00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:40,100
back to him asked me on the first day

00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,880
of being my mentor what my learning style was.

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,689
I wasn't even aware of the best ways that

00:11:44,689 --> 00:11:46,930
I learned, but we were able to up, discover

00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:50,929
that together, and use those, and practice how I

00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:52,260
learned best.

00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,730
I really excelled during my apprenticeship with this mentor

00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:57,480
because we were both aware of my learning habits,

00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,570
my way of thinking and learning.

00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:01,570
I learned that

00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,300
drawing things on the white board, drawing them out

00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,700
was really helpful to me.

00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,400
And I also discovered

00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,820
a lot of the time I need to sle-

00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,550
I needed to sleep on what I had learned.

00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,329
Then the next day I was able to get

00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:13,329
it.

00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:15,169
Also on this note, getting to know your mentee

00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:16,260
is invaluable.

00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,010
Knowing what makes them tick, how they

00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,660
learn, how they think, and how they approach problems

00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,750
can make for a more productive mentorship.

00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,370
Patience is also very important.

00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,850
It's also, it's important

00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,580
for the mentor and the mentee.

00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,580
If you're an

00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,740
impatient person, it might not be best for you

00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,740
to be a mentor.

00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,740
When a beginner is learning

00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,200
to code, you may have to explain things multiple

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,059
times until they get it.

00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:40,059
Things move at a

00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,610
slow pace, and it is important to make sure

00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:44,100
that you're being patient and understanding when working with

00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,020
your mentee.

00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,429
Patience is also a skill that I have to

00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:48,429
learn.

00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:49,429
One of the things that I struggle with

00:12:49,429 --> 00:12:50,830
is when I see an error message or there's

00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,810
a bug, I angrily switch from the failing test

00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,990
back to them without taking my time to read

00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,459
the error message.

00:12:57,459 --> 00:12:58,770
So writing code and mentoring are

00:12:58,770 --> 00:12:59,770
similar.

00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:00,770
Heh.

00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:01,770
I see people nodding.

00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,150
Writing code and mentoring are similar in that it

00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,780
ta- requires a lot of patience.

00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,780
So I've learned

00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,630
a lot in that aspect as well.

00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:10,370
Weekly retrospectives are also very important in a formal

00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,380
mentorship.

00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,390
Once a week, take time and sit down

00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,030
with your mentee.

00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,640
Discuss what went well, what didn't

00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,450
go well, and what to improve on.

00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:19,450
These meetings

00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,150
were invaluable to me because I was able to

00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:24,130
focus on softer skills as well, and overall skills.

00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:27,360
I became aware of my impatience habit and areas

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,860
that I needed to focus on the most, so

00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,829
that really helped me out.

00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:32,069
Pairing.

00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:34,280
I think pairing with my mentors has been

00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,210
the best thing for me from a technical standpoint.

00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:40,050
So it was definitely where I learned the most.

00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,819
Pairing on actual client projects and even on my

00:13:41,819 --> 00:13:44,600
own breakable toy was extremely helpful.

00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,680
Pairing is also

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,150
great because you can speak remotely with a mentor.

00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,799
I was able to learn so much fun, more

00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,990
in a pairing situation than when trying to read

00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,819
the Ruby pickaxe book.

00:13:56,819 --> 00:13:57,880
I was able to constantly

00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,069
ask questions, drive, and really dive into learning the

00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:03,170
Ruby language and Rails framework.

00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:06,300
But the most important piece of advice that I

00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,300
can give to mentors is to have empathy.

00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,300
It

00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,699
is extremely discouraging to be told that this is

00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:13,790
easy and you should be getting this.

00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,790
It's really

00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,429
not easy, especially for someone who has never done

00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:17,429
this before.

00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:18,429
You know, how long have you been

00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:19,429
writing code?

00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:20,961
Something that was easy, that is easy

00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:22,761
to you now, is not gonna be easy for

00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:23,761
a beginner.

00:14:23,761 --> 00:14:26,910
Also, remember that your mentee might have a completely

00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,040
different way of thinking.

00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,650
It's important to put yourself

00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,630
in their shoes and remember what it was like

00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:34,920
to learn how to write code.

00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,549
So my incredible mentors and my experience Railsbridge has

00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:40,310
not only changed my life, but changed others around

00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,449
me in an almost verbal effect.

00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:43,449
These are my

00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,140
two best friends at another Railsbridge event that we

00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,600
did in Denver.

00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,370
We were all three advertising majors

00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,370
at CU.

00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:52,450
Emma, the blond one, she's now doing front-end development

00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:56,290
in San Francisco, and Terra, just, got accepted into

00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,640
an intense Ruby on Rails program in New York

00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,640
City.

00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,030
So Terra had a really great job and

00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:04,700
decided to quit her career to pursue a career

00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,040
as a developer, which I think is really cool.

00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,100
So intense Ruby on Rails training programs like GSchool,

00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,579
Dev BootCamp, are other great examples of alternative education

00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:16,550
options that I unfortunately don't have a lot of

00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,049
time to discuss today.

00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:19,049
I get to spend a

00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:21,000
lot of time around the G Schoolers and Galvanized

00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,520
because we work in the same place.

00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,520
It's amazing

00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,701
to see the applications that they build in a

00:15:25,701 --> 00:15:27,130
short amount of time.

00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,419
We can also relate to the struggles of learning

00:15:29,419 --> 00:15:31,100
Ruby together.

00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,350
I've also gotten to meet a, so

00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,100
many wonderful developers this weekend, who have come out

00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,740
programs like Flat Iron School, Bit Maker and Dev

00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,150
Boot Camp.

00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,920
Talking with all of them about their experiences has

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,470
made me realize how these programs can really open

00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,540
doors for people who never thought it was possible

00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,579
to become a developer.

00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:50,250
And it is truly inspiring

00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,320
to see how passionate they are about the community

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,520
and the craft of writing code.

00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,130
So now that I've talked about outreach programs and

00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,049
mentorship I want to talk about apprentice programs.

00:16:00,049 --> 00:16:01,049
Apprentice

00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:03,130
programs are intense training that you would not receive

00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,770
at a university, and apprentice programs can take a

00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:09,300
passionate learner and turn them into competent, reliable software

00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,669
engineers.

00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:14,169
I'm really, really fortunate because ThoughtBot accepted me into

00:16:14,169 --> 00:16:17,000
their apprentice program this past year.

00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It is one

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,289
of the most challenging things that I've ever done,

00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:21,809
but the amount that I have learned during my

00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:24,860
apprenticeship has been incredible.

00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,000
For those of you who don't know what ThoughtBot

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,179
is, it's a consulting company that builds and designs

00:16:29,179 --> 00:16:30,630
web and mobile application.

00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,980
And they have a program

00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:35,049
specifically for apprentices called apprentice io.

00:16:35,049 --> 00:16:36,559
ThoughtBot's really passionate

00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:38,600
about the learning space and has a learn program

00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,650
where workshops are frequently taught.

00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,100
And twenty-five percent of

00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,720
the employees at ThoughtBot were apprentices at one time

00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,720
in the company.

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,120
So a quarter of the company

00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,940
actually came through the apprentice program.

00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,430
And it is proved to, to be a great

00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:57,660
way for ThoughtBot to train and maintain budding talent.

00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,669
So Dan the CMO describes why the program was

00:17:00,669 --> 00:17:02,610
created in this quote, and once again I'm gonna

00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:08,689
let you guys read this.

00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:16,370
Chad, the CEO, stated, that everyone in the program

00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,039
who has been eligible to get a job afterward

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,450
has gotten a job, with ThoughtBot or another employer.

00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:25,220
That's pretty impressive.

00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,500
ThoughtBot's apprentice program has given me

00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,230
the biggest push in achieving my dream.

00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,230
They believe

00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,650
that I can do it, they support me, and

00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,760
even are taking the time and money that it

00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,360
takes to train me.

00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,850
ThoughtBot rewards and supports its employees for engaging in

00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,950
mentoring programs and for participating in programs like Railsbridge.

00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,760
This is something that I think all companies should

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,100
be doing.

00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,770
So the U.S. Department of Labor did a study

00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:51,261
on apprentice programs in the U.S., and apprentice program

00:17:51,261 --> 00:17:54,640
graduates have much higher earnings than those who did

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,640
not.

00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,790
The study also showed that the social and

00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,880
overall benefits to the company that maintain these programs

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,440
appear to be much larger than the cost.

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,440
So

00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,040
over the career of an apprentice, the estimated benefits

00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,500
to the company exceeded the initial cost by more

00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,920
than $49,000.

00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,381
So apprentice programs are not only a legitimate path

00:18:13,381 --> 00:18:15,940
to becoming a developer, but it's a bridge for

00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,240
people coming out of these outreach programs that I

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,730
spoke about earlier.

00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,670
Even after doing multiple Railsbridges and

00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,980
working tirelessly with many mentors, I wasn't ready to

00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,110
become a full-time software engineer managing large web applications.

00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,650
I needed something like the apprentice program to really

00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:33,070
jump off the deep-end into writing code.

00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,070
And apprentice

00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,220
programs create a structured environment where I can continue

00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,630
to learn best practices and become a developer that

00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,980
produces reliable and maintainable software.

00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,230
So there are many benefits to companies creating a

00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:50,360
formal or mentorship, formal apprentice or mentorship program.

00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,360
So

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,210
if companies invest in apprentice and mentorship programs, there

00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:56,480
will be more highly-trained and prepared candidates out there.

00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,890
These companies can help other companies find, et cetera,

00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:04,340
find highly, find high quality candidates.

00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,050
CSR is also really important in our society.

00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,050
A

00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,310
study showed that 94% of consumers would be more

00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:13,450
loyal to the company if they have CSR initiative.

00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,900
96% of people said that they would have a

00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,780
more positive image of the company.

00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,870
So CSR is

00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:21,530
clearly important and an all-around great way to give

00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:24,080
back to the community.

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,241
So this is more specific to consulting companies, but

00:19:26,241 --> 00:19:28,250
a lot of times projects are lost due to

00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,330
a large price tag, and if companies take in

00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:32,500
an apprentices, they will be able to bill them

00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,890
at lower rates to projects that have a strict

00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,270
budget and not so much of a strict timeline.

00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,270
So there are also a lot of engineers that

00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,760
I have met that are out there who would

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,060
love the opportunity to become a mentor and are

00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:47,300
not sure the right way to get involved.

00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,300
This

00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,030
would create an opportunity for interested parties to teach

00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,820
and mentor in a more formal environment.

00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,860
So, I mean, look at me.

00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,860
I'm up here

00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,090
genuinely talking about ThoughtBot and, because they took a

00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,090
risk on me.

00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,090
SO the message and good will

00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:02,540
of your company will spread throughout the students that

00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,870
you take risks on and train.

00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,180
But why is all of this important?

00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,180
Why is

00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,200
it important to have educational alternatives to training the

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,940
next generation of developers?

00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,170
I have three reasons.

00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:20,380
Diversity, a massive lack of, of supply of engineer,

00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,800
and traditional education that isn't providing with the amount

00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,790
of people that we need.

00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,910
So mentorship Railsbridge programs

00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:31,550
and apprentice programs are absolutely key in getting more

00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:34,660
diversity into not only the web development world but

00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,490
the tech world as a whole.

00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:39,480
As you can see, NCWiT thinks it's crucial for

00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,800
advancing underrepresented employees.

00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,070
So access to the internet is a privilege.

00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,070
White

00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,970
males specifically have access at an earlier age and

00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:51,520
a much higher rate than females.

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,520
And people of

00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,600
different ethnic backgrounds.

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,120
Statistics show that boys get their

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,770
first computers at fourteen, while girls at age eleven.

00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,980
It's even later for people of color, who tend

00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,100
to have a much higher adoption rate of smart

00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,000
phones, and I can't imagine trying to write code

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,250
in a smart phone.

00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,490
So females make up more than half of undergrad

00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:13,590
graduates but only 18% of computer science graduates.

00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,590
There's

00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:17,550
a really high barrier via the traditional computer science

00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:21,770
route in university.

00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:25,440
Financial access, discrimination, lack of role models, lack of

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,040
encouragement in general are creating this large gap of

00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,200
the lack of diversity.

00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,730
These are all barriers that

00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,430
are hard to overcome.

00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,430
So we want to create

00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,800
diversity within the industry, education has to come from

00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,540
elsewhere.

00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,670
outreach programs, mentorship and apprentice programs are all alternatives

00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:44,250
to a traditional education that lower these barriers.

00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,250
This

00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,930
is key in creating a diverse community.

00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:47,930
And I

00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,590
really want to emphasize that this is lowering the

00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,610
barriers and not the standards.

00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:55,390
Alternative education needs to be high quality in caliber

00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,680
in order to maintain the standard in the industry.

00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,240
So we all know that diversity is important.

00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,240
Not

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,060
only does it drive economic growth, it's been scientifically

00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:07,360
proven that diversity fosters innovation and enhances abilities to

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,570
solve problems.

00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,990
And approaching tricky programming problems from many

00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:15,120
perspectives proves to be successful in this industry.

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,400
So another thing to be aware of is a

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,730
lot of these outreach programs and alternative paths are

00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:21,970
in predominately white areas for people of average or

00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:24,890
even high socioeconomic statuses.

00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:25,890
So it would be awesome

00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:29,210
to see mentorship apprentice programs and outreach programs happening

00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:32,450
in rural areas that have a low socioeconomic status

00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:34,520
and ethnic diversity.

00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,620
So secondly, there's a massive lack of quality engineers.

00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,850
How many people here, or their company, is hiring

00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:42,180
on an ongoing basis?

00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,490
Yeah, and is it hard

00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:47,130
to find quality engineers?

00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:48,250
Yeah.

00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,550
So companies continually struggle with this.

00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,630
According to NCWIT

00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:56,250
research, if current trends continue by 2018, the information

00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:59,030
technology industry will only be able to fill half

00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,630
of its available jobs.

00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,850
There are people who never

00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:05,720
considered software engineering as a viable career option because

00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,780
they were discouraged from it, never thought they were

00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,450
smart enough, never grew up with a computer or

00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,680
were intimidated by people who had been programming for

00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,530
most of their lives.

00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,440
These people can discover their passion and take an

00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,740
alternative approach such as the ones I discussed earlier

00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:24,350
and programs like GSchool and Flat Iron School.

00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:27,270
So thirdly, the traditional science, computer science degree isn't

00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:30,550
providing the industry with the developers that it needs.

00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,400
Most people coming out of college are not ready

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,650
for full-time engineering jobs.

00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:35,730
It takes four or more

00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:38,150
years to recieve a degree and not to mention

00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,670
the hefty price tag.

00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,790
So thanks to programs like Railsbridge, my amazing mentors,

00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,650
and ThoughtBot's apprentice program, I am here today to

00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:50,850
speak about the importance of alternative education paths in

00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:51,850
software development.

00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,670
I am almost done with my apprenticeship

00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:55,400
and I'm excited for what my next step will

00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,880
be on this path, and I would be lying

00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,120
if I told you that the path, my path

00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,580
to becoming a software engineer has been easy and

00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,000
constantly rewarding.

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,380
There are times when I'm really close to quitting

00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,450
and there are times when I cry from feeling

00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,630
so frustrated and incompetent when the test suite won't

00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,340
turn green.

00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,340
But I know that I love what

00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,040
I'm doing and I won't quit and I know

00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,070
that it's because sometimes I literally get chills when

00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,100
I manage to get through it, refactor it, and

00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,510
produce some beautiful code.

00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:25,140
It literally moves me and makes me feel like

00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,270
I can do anything.

00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,270
My goal is that other

00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,671
people who never thought that becoming a software engineer

00:24:30,671 --> 00:24:33,670
was possible will become inspired by one of these

00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:38,190
alternative education programs or by an influential mentor and

00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:40,400
discover that they not only can be a great

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,420
developer but find a passion for it.

00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,780
Thank you for your time today and you can

00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,670
contact me through email or Twitter if you have

00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:49,670
any questions.

00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:50,670
And here are some of my works'

00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:50,671
