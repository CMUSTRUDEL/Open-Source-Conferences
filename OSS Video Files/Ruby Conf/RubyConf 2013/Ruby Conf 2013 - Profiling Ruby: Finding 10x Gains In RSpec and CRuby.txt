Description: 
	By Xavier Shay

In this detective story we'll start by identifying and fixing easy performance problems in Ruby, before working our way down to the guts of the interpreter itself. Using concrete examples from RSpec and CRuby we'll cover all the necessary tools including benchmark, ruby-prof, gnuplot, and more, and show how you can tie them all together to solve real problems yourself.
