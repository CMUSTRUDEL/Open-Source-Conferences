Title: Ruby Conf 2013 - Ruby On Robots Using Artoo by Ron Evans
Publication date: 2020-01-27
Playlist: RubyConf 2013
Description: 
	The robotics revolution has already begun. You can buy drones and robotic devices at local retail stores. Unfortunately, it's hard to develop code for robots, and nearly impossible to create solutions that integrate multiple different kind of devices.

Introducing Artoo (http://artoo.io), a new robotics framework written in Ruby. Artoo can communicate with many different kinds of hardware devices, and integrate them together. With surprisingly few lines of code, you can write interesting applications that tie together Arduinos, ARDrones, Spheros, and more... even all at the same time!

Artoo is based on Celluloid, giving it the ability to support the levels of concurrency that are required for industrial-strength robotic applications. Artoo has a built in API-server, debugging console, and even shows you how to do Test-Driven Robotics (TDR).

The time has come for Ruby-based robotics, and Artoo can help lead the way!
