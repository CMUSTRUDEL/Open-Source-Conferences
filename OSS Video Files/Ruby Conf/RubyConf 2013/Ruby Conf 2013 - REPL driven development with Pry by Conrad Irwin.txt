Title: Ruby Conf 2013 - REPL driven development with Pry by Conrad Irwin
Publication date: 2020-01-27
Playlist: RubyConf 2013
Description: 
	Pry is a featureful irb replacement that provides Ruby programmers with a seriously souped-up REPL.

Using some real-life examples, I'll explain how to use Pry to program more effectively.

We'll start with the basics of exploring libaries and experimenting with code at lightning speed. Then we'll move up a level and discuss how to dig into, debug and even modify existing programs. Finally we'll cover a few of the plugins that make Pry a truly indispensible tool.
