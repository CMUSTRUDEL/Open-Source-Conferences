Ruby applications are becoming more complex and unwieldy (think MonoRails). An increasing number of us are trying to address this by separating our apps into gems without knowing best practices on how to write APIs or how to manage dependencies and versioning. The discussion we often have around good APIs should not stop with Ruby OO design, but should also consider the public APIs of gems.

This talk is intended for gem authors and users.
