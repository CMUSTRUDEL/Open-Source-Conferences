Title: Meta-programming for Dummies - RedDotRubyConf 2017
Publication date: 2020-01-22
Playlist: RedDotRuby 2017
Description: 
	Speaker: Weiqing Toh, Software Engineer, Ministry of Education

The construct of the Ruby language allows for meta-programming, or 'code which modifies code at runtime'. However, meta-programming is a double-edged sword; as much as it is useful, it could very easily be misused by teams as well. In this talk, I will cover the benefits of meta-programming and some (basic) fundamentals (in the context of Ruby on Rails) and discuss pitfalls, anti-patterns, and considerations by teams before adopting meta-programming. Don't worry, this is easily digestible for rubyists of all levels!
