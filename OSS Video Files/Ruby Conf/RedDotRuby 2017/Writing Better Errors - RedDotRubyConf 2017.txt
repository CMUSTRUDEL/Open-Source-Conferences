Title: Writing Better Errors - RedDotRubyConf 2017
Publication date: 2020-01-22
Playlist: RedDotRuby 2017
Description: 
	Speaker: Laura Eck, Software Engineer, TenTen Ltd

At their core, all errors trigger the same question, no matter who encounters them: What went wrong, and how do I make it work? At the same time, every error has specific target audiences that are interested in answering exactly that question - but possibly in very different ways. In this talk, we will explore how to design errors so they give each stakeholder the information they need to fix the issue at hand, and how we can use them to make our software even better. Errors might never be something you look forward to seeing - but when they crash your party, they'll at least know how to chat with the guests.
