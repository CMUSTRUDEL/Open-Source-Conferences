	Speaker: Takayuki Matsubara, Software Engineer, M3 Inc

From the conclusion, it is to put a star on projects at GitHub. I'm very happy someone putting a star on my project. So if you already put a star on any projects, it encourage the open source community. But have you put a star on projects developed as oss used in your project? All of them? This talk proposes a solution that activates open source community by putting a star on projects which you depend.

la ostracize and come so I would like to

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:30,480
introduce one way to enter it the open

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:35,640
source community by the way what is the

00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:39,990
top star or someone who puts a star

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:43,310
it means appreciation support or manage

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,310
reverse trajectories

00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:50,840
ossama who has owned projects

00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:55,330
it means fear present like me so

00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:58,670
motivation to maintain or create project

00:01:55,330 --> 00:02:01,280
for someone who use this github project

00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:05,570
it means the aim of the popularity or

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:08,179
Adam the reliability lies in the

00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:11,630
obstruction a result the total number of

00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:15,760
github stars represented represents the

00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:18,410
activity of the OSS community so I think

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:23,140
putting a style ring close to the

00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:26,510
encouragement of the OSS community so

00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:33,170
how will you study our favorite projects

00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:39,819
let the hunt thank you many people next

00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:39,819
have used as a raise project Oh many

00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:48,820
okay next have used as Mary James at the

00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:54,260
rate of the actual Mara depends on oh

00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:57,140
sure that's not a subscription have used

00:02:54,260 --> 00:03:03,310
as the Lima types gels that the male

00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:03,310
gender depends on all its nice Oh friend

00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:09,280
Jerry we do not acknowledge the downs

00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:15,350
but usual gems that we use sometimes

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:17,600
depend on as a gem so there is a gap

00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:20,989
this picture shows that total download

00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:24,470
is is almost the same but those are not

00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:30,170
same so these gems are used as much as

00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:33,739
large labels so I would like to turn the

00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:38,720
spotlight to them because OSS is made up

00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:41,230
of other OSS so I have created under

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,230
stuff

00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:54,140
[Applause]

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,569
what does render so do under self-adjust

00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:59,270
on github projects that your projects it

00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:02,270
depends on when you execute the bundle

00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:05,480
install comment so how to use the

00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:09,500
understa let's give it a try if you okay

00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:12,140
so for the step demo insert one star and

00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,870
then make a directory when the start

00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:18,290
index even do stop and render image to

00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:21,829
create gem file and a go gem bondo start

00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:25,370
to gem file also understands a tiny

00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:28,250
wrapper of the vendor command commander

00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:30,680
line arguments that has two origin open

00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:34,940
the command undersell cusp is only

00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:38,690
putting a staff so let's run bundle

00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:42,380
install bundle stud tries to find a

00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:46,160
github ID and a token from a certified

00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:49,250
rotated Pina system to home directory if

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,950
you don't have an LLC vendor stock

00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:55,850
retreat with the input so please

00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:58,850
investigate already in the total so if

00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:08,870
everything runs smoothly you can see

00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:12,260
something like this so almost the same

00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:16,540
husband during stuff but vendors under

00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:22,700
separate app also gets a tap on general

00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:23,310
so wonder some makes many stuff this is

00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:29,450
a render stuff

00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:33,120
[Applause]

00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:36,900
now we can encourage the OSS community

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,870
with van der stadt but better sighs

00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:42,990
we'll just one way to anchor Italy as a

00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:45,900
community the really important point is

00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:50,940
that we not value of oil sales project

00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:53,910
and try to know more about sound ending

00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:56,790
so we can get new knowledge and

00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:59,730
contribute to those projects we can

00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:01,190
encourage the OSS committee more if we

00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:04,500
do those things

00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:12,860
so enjoy thank you for listening

00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:12,860
