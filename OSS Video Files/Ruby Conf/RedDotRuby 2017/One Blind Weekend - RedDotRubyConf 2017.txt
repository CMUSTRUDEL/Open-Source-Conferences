Description: 
	Speaker: Jinny Wong, Engineering Manager, Carousell

This talk is about the time when I was temporarily blind for a weekend, and how suddenly, web accessibility became both a boon and an annoyance to me. In this lightning talk I share about what I went through while "blind", and tips to improve your website's accessibility in order to enable more people to easily access and use your website, regardless of ability.
