Publication date: 2020-01-22
Playlist: RedDotRuby 2017
Description: 
	Speaker: Jinny Wong, Engineering Manager, Carousell

This talk is about the time when I was temporarily blind for a weekend, and how suddenly, web accessibility became both a boon and an annoyance to me. In this lightning talk I share about what I went through while "blind", and tips to improve your website's accessibility in order to enable more people to easily access and use your website, regardless of ability.

hi my name is Ginny I'm an engineering

00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:16,099
manager at carousel and I have a

00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,609
condition since I was very young called

00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:22,640
strabismus also known as a screen so

00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:25,250
what has this got to do it my talk now

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,869
imagine that for a normal person your

00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:31,730
eyes look like this mine look like this

00:00:28,869 --> 00:00:33,980
so my eye my right eye turns inwards

00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:35,899
towards my nose and as a result of it

00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,910
not being treated when I was young

00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:41,270
most of the time my vision is kind of

00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:43,190
effectively this in order to prevent

00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:46,210
double vision the brain shuts down the

00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:48,500
visual input from my misalign eye and

00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:53,719
generally this can lead to lazy eye and

00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:58,219
loss of vision so this means I have no

00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:59,840
binocular vision objects tend to appear

00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:04,009
in a different spot that where they

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:09,470
actually are and green 3d glasses are

00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:12,080
all just waiting me and about a year ago

00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:16,670
I somehow managed to scratch my left eye

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:20,000
and I ended up with corneal abrasion so

00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:21,650
and it's really extremely painful and it

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,860
makes your eye sensitive too like a saw

00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:27,259
so you can't really open it so this and

00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:30,259
since my right eye is also funky this

00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:33,200
means that for a whole weekend my vision

00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:34,520
was effectively this and suddenly I was

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,350
kind of transported into the world of

00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:42,829
the uncharted well tangles of green

00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:44,630
readers because such as voiceover or

00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:47,090
neck or jaws on windows in my experience

00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:49,040
I was using voiceover on a Mac and the

00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,180
iPhone because frankly is not because of

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,890
it I don't know how I would have

00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:55,360
survived that we can given that I kind

00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:57,380
of chronically addicted to the internet

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,060
but the experience could have been

00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,560
better so here are some quick tips on

00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,119
how you can actually adapt your website

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,310
to play nicely with screen readers and

00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:09,170
improve the experience for the visually

00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:12,650
impaired so first of all use semantic

00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:15,319
HTML for example if the text is not a

00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:17,920
header don't use header text you

00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:20,060
studied some other way using CSS instead

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,829
this is because green readers actually

00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,140
let's when you just skip through header

00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:27,319
text to quickly skim through an entire

00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:29,150
page content so using it for unintended

00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:30,650
purposes can actually mess the scheme

00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:33,140
either experience a little bit and this

00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,480
goes to sit for all other elements as

00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:37,700
well

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,409
the second is consider taking advantage

00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,329
of things like Aria elements such as

00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:43,310
math and section text as well as adding

00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:48,200
role attributes to key content sections

00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:50,439
such as navigation main or such this is

00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,849
because modern screen readers already

00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:54,680
provide for an easy way for users to

00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:58,129
skip across sections of content using

00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,439
landmarks and pitch outlines voice-overs

00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:02,060
roaster for example in conjunction with

00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:04,250
the trackpad or the touch screen on the

00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:07,250
iPhone actually allows the user to

00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:12,139
actually skip through content within a

00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:19,269
page by rotating your fingers on it so

00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:22,970
this greatly enhances the experience to

00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:26,930
give context so for example if you want

00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:29,260
to display an element but that you don't

00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:32,510
want the element to display backs

00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:34,280
visually hide it instead using CSS but

00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:36,470
make sure that the text exist in your

00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,629
Dom screen readers can't focus on an

00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:40,310
empty element so it might be skipping

00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:44,180
over important element that you want to

00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:46,639
tell your user the same goes with

00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,859
elements without names or labels a

00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,840
screen reader would know what an input

00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:53,599
field is for unless you also give it an

00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,060
Associated label for example if you have

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:59,540
a signup form having a label first name

00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:01,639
for the input field this will cause the

00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,780
screen reader to properly say first name

00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:04,780
edit back

00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,390
in this example the screen is always

00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,670
simply say button

00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:16,269
even if visually you can see this but

00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:18,070
some in other words submit in state so

00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:22,419
that the screen reader will say submit

00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:26,980
button and for this it will simply say

00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:32,710
link click here here it will say link

00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:34,570
example comm much better and make sure

00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:37,090
you also put up descriptions for your

00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:39,100
image text and you can omit works like

00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:41,080
image off or picture off because the

00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,650
screen reader already know and they will

00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:47,139
tell the user for example if you have an

00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:50,290
alt text that says get caught up in a

00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:54,070
ball looking suspicious the screen

00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:59,830
reader will say image cat curled up in a

00:04:54,070 --> 00:05:03,190
ball looking suspicious and if you want

00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:05,979
to do things like however my news or you

00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:07,810
know anything that requires the user to

00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:10,120
actually visually see something in order

00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:12,100
to interact with it make sure that the

00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,169
underlying HTML elements and structure

00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,520
of the menu is still accessible via the

00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:19,570
Dom so that the screen reader can

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,190
actually focus into it and if you want

00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:24,220
implement things like infinite scrolling

00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:25,930
consider this scenario the user wants to

00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,100
scroll to the bottom of the page because

00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,630
they you want to see what's down there

00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,539
or maybe you want to click a link on the

00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:34,200
footer but the pitch never ends because

00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:36,639
it keeps infinitely loading more stuff

00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:39,970
so what you can do is to add a lot more

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:44,919
button or just use standard pagination

00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:48,990
instead and a link should be a link not

00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:48,990
some random HTML that a click handler

00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,270
finally consider the font and colors

00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,250
that you use in your website make sure

00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:03,210
that there is sufficient contrast and

00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:05,470
that the size is legible enough and

00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:07,120
especially for mobile websites

00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,830
try not to prevent the user from being

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:14,520
able to zoom in and out or restrict

00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:16,900
their users scalable or max scale and

00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,120
remember that even for the fully sighted

00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,699
people there are those amount of who

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,010
actually colored line so don't depend

00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:25,449
solely on color to deliver context for

00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:28,630
example when you are displaying content

00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:30,160
for stock market try to add shapes to

00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:34,720
indicate whether is going up or down if

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,400
they are just real green so these are

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,290
just some quick tips for adding better

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,169
accessibility support from your site and

00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:43,060
you know accessibility isn't just an

00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:44,680
abstract concept for a small group of

00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:47,590
people who don't know we don't often

00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,810
think about disability can be temporary

00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:51,729
or situational as well just like how I

00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:53,710
was temporarily blind for a weekend or

00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:56,979
maybe when you're just carrying a bag of

00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:59,680
groceries home and adding better

00:06:56,979 --> 00:07:01,120
accessories support helps everyone not

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,389
just the criminally blind

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,669
sorry permanently disabled so Microsoft

00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:08,650
actually has a very good guy on

00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:10,210
inclusive design so you should actually

00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:14,650
go check it out I am turning in my

00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:17,110
resources and I'd like to end by giving

00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:18,360
a special shout out to a special person

00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:22,510
mr. yang dong-geun

00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:24,910
who nearly 10 years ago introduced me to

00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:28,930
the world of accessible tech and how to

00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:31,650
use voice over N in doing so unknowingly

00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:42,880
helped me to survive that line we can

00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:46,150
thank you thank you very much and just a

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,830
little bit of a call-out over here so I

00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:50,229
will share this link on the slides later

00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:52,180
but specifically to call out the first

00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:53,889
link which is the story about how a

00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,840
local company here hired a blind

00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:58,180
developer so you should go check it out

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,759
thank you

00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,759
