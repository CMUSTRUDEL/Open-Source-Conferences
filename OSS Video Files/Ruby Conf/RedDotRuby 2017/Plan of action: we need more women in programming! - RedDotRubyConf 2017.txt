Title: Plan of action: we need more women in programming! - RedDotRubyConf 2017
Publication date: 2020-01-22
Playlist: RedDotRuby 2017
Description: 
	Speaker: Marion Schleifer, Junior Software Developer, Simplificator AG

It is no news that there are not enough women in programming. As a (female) career changer, I know how a lot of people (and especially women) think about programming. I am now a Ruby programmer and programming is completely different than i imagined it would be. And I love it! Therefore, I am putting a lot of my time and energy into educating women about programming. I want to talk about why we don't have enough women in programming, why we need more, and what we all can do to achieve that goal.

Speaker's Bio

Marion is a career changer. She has a Bachelor in Translation, a Master in Economics and just finished a Master in Software Engineering. Changing careers to programming is the best decision she has made. Apart from her job as Junior Developer, she is spending her time encouraging women to program and as a member of the Hanami core team.

I'm very happy to be here I'm from

00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:12,349
Switzerland I network for small and

00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:14,360
where I shop cut simplification actually

00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:16,099
I'm very surprised at how many women are

00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,599
here attending this conference and it

00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:19,670
makes me very happy

00:00:17,599 --> 00:00:21,650
but I'm sure if you're a female

00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:24,980
developer you know the feeling of being

00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:28,730
the only woman in a software team and I

00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:30,680
really would like to change that first

00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,800
of all we have to ask ourselves why

00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:35,899
don't we have more women in programming

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,290
so first of all I think reputation is a

00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:41,510
really big problem many people think

00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:44,390
that we are just nerds and French guys

00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:46,309
that have no lines and code in the

00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:49,670
cellar with no windows or whatever and

00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:51,739
these stereotypes can be very strong and

00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:55,520
people are also not too shy about them

00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:58,250
for example one old Australian guy I met

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,989
in friends told me but you don't look

00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:03,379
like a programmer I thought you'd be a

00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:04,610
fun girl or my grandmother who lives in

00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:06,860
a small village in central Switzerland

00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:08,299
asked me madchild

00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,979
do I really have to tell the other

00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:15,650
village people that you are computer

00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:17,890
programmer now and and my favorite when

00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:20,119
I came here at the airport I was coding

00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:23,390
while waiting for the plane and then a

00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:25,220
small girl was watching me and then she

00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:28,630
turned to her mother and said mommy what

00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:32,000
is wrong with this little lady and and

00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:33,560
then her mother watched me too and she

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,860
said I don't know honey let's go sit

00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,860
somewhere else

00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,280
so this can be a really big problem

00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:43,729
because there are very bad associations

00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:48,170
about programmers and another problem is

00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:49,369
I think sell stamps and I I can totally

00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,860
understand that because two and a half

00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:53,200
years ago I was the thing so people have

00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,610
to think you have to be ridiculously

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,290
intelligent to be a programmer and that

00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:00,469
you have to know a lot about math and

00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:02,060
also when you watch the movies and you

00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:05,090
know the coder has to stop the bomb from

00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:07,670
exploding and then the console goes

00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:13,750
through very fast and then people think

00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:15,980
I would never be able to do them and in

00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:18,590
combination with this I like this

00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:20,840
statement from github CEO he said

00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,670
everyone has the potential to be a great

00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,310
developer but not everyone has the

00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:27,890
opportunity and normally we associate

00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:30,290
opportunities or lost opportunities with

00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:32,030
financial or political restrictions but

00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:34,640
I think it's important to note that

00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:36,230
these can also be due to social values

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,000
and what society thinks about the

00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,440
profession so if someone would be really

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,930
talented and would like to be a

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,440
programmer but decides not to do so

00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:50,510
because of the stereotype it's a lost

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:52,370
opportunity and then you might ask

00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:56,090
ourselves why do we need more women in

00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:58,790
real time so I think diversity is really

00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:01,519
important and people with more diverse

00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:03,440
backgrounds bring different values and

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,120
views into a community and then

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,790
eventually make the community better and

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,459
this again leads to better decisions and

00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:11,840
if we all have different strengths and

00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:13,280
weaknesses and people with different

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,379
backgrounds have different strengths and

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,489
then we have a higher chance to actually

00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:21,319
level out each other's weaknesses now

00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:25,010
the most important thing what can we do

00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:26,660
I think the basic answer is open doors

00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,730
so to spread

00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,380
the word and to tell people how

00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,690
programming is actually a very creative

00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:34,720
job and that you actually have to be

00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:36,920
very sociable and communicate to people

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:43,340
and that you can't be just alone in your

00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:45,170
room and the program and the second one

00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,600
is to provide opportunities if you can

00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:49,250
for example I looked at my company store

00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,260
and asked for an internship even though

00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:53,570
they didn't have one and then they asked

00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,580
me well what can you already do and I

00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:58,280
said well I know about strings and

00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:00,500
numbers and then they hired me anyway

00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,480
and now I'm working at the full time

00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:06,980
developers so they I'm really grateful

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:09,320
for this opportunity and also coaching

00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:11,000
at courses for example I co-founded a

00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,730
free programming course for women and

00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,860
that's happening weekly or I'm

00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:20,000
organizing rails girls in Zurich this

00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:22,250
year so maybe is there's a wrestling in

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,390
your city you might consider coach there

00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:28,670
and also one important thing I think is

00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:31,220
to tell the teachers because children

00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:33,410
and especially girls start very early to

00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,960
think about what they might do later in

00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:37,550
the life and I think it's important too

00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:41,360
that the career of programming is not

00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:42,620
ruled out this early in their lives so

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,200
I'm also in contact with different

00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:48,380
primary schools to to talk to children

00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,720
and to show them some of my coding work

00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:52,730
and if you now say well this one

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,440
consumes a lot of time I don't have time

00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:56,900
to go to schools or to organize event

00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,490
well there's more you can do you can

00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,530
just if you're picked up by a friend at

00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:04,130
work you can show him or her your code

00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:05,960
and to tell people what programming is

00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:08,150
bad and what fascinating things we can

00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,100
create with code because the more people

00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:13,450
know the better and hopefully these

00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:16,910
stereotypes will disappear eventually

00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:18,320
one colleague of mine told me that well

00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:21,380
now you chose a man men's professional

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,320
you just have to deal with being in in a

00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,910
team as the only woman and I really hope

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,919
that at some point we don't have to call

00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:30,910
it a man's profession anymore but it is

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:33,100
normal for everybody to be a developer

00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:41,149
thank you for your time

00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:41,149
