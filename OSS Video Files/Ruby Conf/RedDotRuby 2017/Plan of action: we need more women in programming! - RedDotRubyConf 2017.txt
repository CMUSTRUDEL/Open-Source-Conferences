Publication date: 2020-01-22
Playlist: RedDotRuby 2017
Description: 
	Speaker: Marion Schleifer, Junior Software Developer, Simplificator AG

It is no news that there are not enough women in programming. As a (female) career changer, I know how a lot of people (and especially women) think about programming. I am now a Ruby programmer and programming is completely different than i imagined it would be. And I love it! Therefore, I am putting a lot of my time and energy into educating women about programming. I want to talk about why we don't have enough women in programming, why we need more, and what we all can do to achieve that goal.
