Title: Ruby on Wheelchair - RedDotRubyConf 2017
Publication date: 2020-01-22
Playlist: RedDotRuby 2017
Description: 
	Speaker: Daniel Bovensiepen, Senior Research Scientist, Siemens

What would you do if you end up in a Wheelchair after an accident and you are not satisfied with the feature-set of the chair? You could buy a better one... Or you put Ruby on it and add the features you are missing. This talk will show you how you can hack your Wheelchair by using mruby, Microcontrollers and many other things never seen on a Wheelchair before. Let's put Ruby on a Wheelchair!

Speaker's Bio

Daniel is a research scientist in the field of industrial automation and manufacturing. He empowers Ruby in areas nobody has seen it before. At night he is contributing to mruby to push it to even more areas of his daily job.

okay so before that works I just want to

00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,690
apologize first so I might look a little

00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:12,859
bit higher it's not because I party

00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,539
through the whole night that's actually

00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:16,369
because our flight of the wife six hours

00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:19,070
ago and we were actually one day too

00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:20,539
late so if I say something what doesn't

00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,100
make when we tend to during the talk I

00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:23,630
encourage you to ask questions because

00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,840
it might actually be that doesn't make

00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:29,180
sense okay we set out of the way and hi

00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,890
one I'm Daniel and from the genes I'm

00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:33,649
researching on that's the communication

00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:36,409
automation my private time I'm working a

00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:38,359
little bit on my team and I would like

00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:40,269
to share a little bit about small hobby

00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:44,859
project I have worked on a couple of

00:00:40,269 --> 00:00:47,600
months of a couple of last month or so

00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:49,879
when I just came here actually someone

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,030
asked me was this title if I'm going to

00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:54,049
make fun of you beyond words or so

00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:57,350
obviously that's not going to happen and

00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:58,870
would be a little bit low taste and we

00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,979
are really going to literally talk about

00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:03,289
wheelchairs and how to put movie on it

00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:05,720
and then essentially two things you

00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:08,480
could keep in mind for the talk and I

00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,630
hope in the end for the confusion if you

00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,310
do not agree with me you now confront

00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:14,750
him with some questions so the first

00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:18,020
thing is of course why should I actually

00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:19,460
talk about will be on wheelchair and the

00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,050
second question you should keep in mind

00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,010
of why should you actually care about

00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:25,190
this topic

00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:27,410
so as you see at the moment I can

00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:29,720
actually work but obviously for all of

00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:32,720
us only temporarily

00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:37,250
so am I was not supportive some time ago

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:39,620
we actually rolled my ankle so I landed

00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:43,100
up in a wheelchair for quite some while

00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:46,010
and it was quite painful but the pain

00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:48,770
went away it was the painting and the

00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:52,220
doctors gave us a wheelchair and so okay

00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:53,600
that should work so well and my wife

00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,520
didn't think so because she actually

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,330
told me back all the way from the

00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,800
hospital back to home and and I could

00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:02,420
easily convince at that point to

00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,920
actually stand go shopping to get

00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:07,430
actually a better wheelchair so an

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,099
electrical one and which I bought is

00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:12,049
just actually the lowest type can have

00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:13,579
on an emergency switches are very

00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:15,049
primitive they have two wheels two

00:02:13,579 --> 00:02:16,200
motors have a big battery and a

00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:18,030
controller

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,030
and after using it for while I was

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,950
thinking and what be cool actually to

00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,230
exchange this controller was something I

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,970
have totally control of so that thing

00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,910
cannot be software updated there can be

00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:32,099
no viruses on it so it's needed me

00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:35,340
clicking a lot of features so we can

00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:37,440
improve on that some the first start and

00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,000
we had of course to look on what we want

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,310
to do we want to control motors so

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,160
before I actually cut a part or

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:47,069
wheelchair I was actually making some

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,049
tests because it actually possible so

00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:50,910
the left side is actually a DC motor

00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:53,580
usually used for the session theme and

00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:56,040
it actually works and then fairly easy

00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,900
way so you're switching polarity from

00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,810
the directions and the rest is just

00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,880
power sadly I didn't have something like

00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,670
that at home except for the nutria so I

00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,010
played with smaller steppin steppin

00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:10,200
water as essentially a motor where you

00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:14,220
have called you control individually in

00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:19,049
the direction is controlled by choosing

00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:21,090
which coil to activate so so I made a

00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:25,139
small little demo so I used for that

00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:27,480
obviously I'm Ruben and I had some small

00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:29,880
microcontroller so you cannot see motor

00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,980
was mentioning small systems and to

00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,290
mention something like 2 gigabyte or 512

00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,060
megabytes what as a matter of fact these

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:39,030
devices here server something like

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:43,109
hundred ninety two kilobytes of RAM so I

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:45,900
would never work on that so MB is the

00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:48,120
only choice to go for him and actually

00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,970
implemented quite some years ago and I

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,769
are before and moving and portal also to

00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:55,260
microcontrollers so if you're interested

00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:56,880
about a bus actually another talk two

00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,120
years ago every week I get about this

00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,889
topic and so it's likely possible it's

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,959
not too difficult in the end and so I

00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:06,780
was playing around it's very comfortable

00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:08,819
to use be here which is actually not

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,250
normal for embedded systems so I think

00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:13,319
many of you might do web development and

00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,930
you use IRB probably all the time in

00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,459
embedded system that's quite common that

00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,539
you actually have the huge cross

00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,289
compiling

00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:25,169
cycle so it takes quite long to iterate

00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:27,210
ok so I feel confident enough that I'd

00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:28,990
say okay let's cut my wheelchair apart

00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:31,060
and obviously a remember

00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:34,530
I could still not what so I really had

00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:36,759
to make that work at at this point so

00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:38,759
the data structure I changed a little

00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:40,599
bit so I've dropped away the whole

00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,919
controller actually track in the

00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:44,020
beginning to automate the controller but

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:47,020
that didn't work out so I bought a new

00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:49,000
controller and I used on stm32 which is

00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,949
a very small ARM processor so it's not

00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,590
an ARM processor using your iPhone

00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:56,139
something like an ARM Cortex and three

00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:58,900
which is very small very cheap and very

00:04:56,139 --> 00:05:01,509
low and power consumption I put a movie

00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,400
on that one the stepping algorithm is

00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:06,550
very similar to what I had already

00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,740
implemented on the stepper and it

00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:10,840
actually happened that it was very easy

00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,280
to get started and in the end actually

00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,910
you will notice that this was actually

00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:18,400
the most easiest part of all to make at

00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:20,229
one so obviously this is not only done

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,620
by abhi obviously I do not want to

00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:25,570
control the wheelchair IRB so the next

00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,190
thing was to dig up a proper

00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:30,039
architecture for the wheelchair so I had

00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:31,449
the drive system in the bottom edit of

00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:34,449
course the second motor the second motor

00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:37,180
controller I then decided to use a

00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:38,830
Raspberry Pi but I also played around

00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:41,349
with some other micro controllers and

00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,940
the higher arm class and put MRI on that

00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:46,509
one actually because it's actually

00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:48,280
powerful enough and then I had on top of

00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:50,800
sketch one and user interface which

00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,509
actually could be used by different

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,370
devices because I didn't want to 2d

00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:56,199
tensions on one device so it was just an

00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:58,090
example when I'm sitting on my couch and

00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:59,860
I'm trying to give active me and my wife

00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:02,830
can just get out her mobile phone and

00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:05,289
driving back home for example at the use

00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:07,000
case so to go a little more detail for

00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:09,520
architecture and so I have to motor

00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,610
control on the very bottom I wrote a

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,889
destroyer system some kind of program

00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:16,930
and gets maybe because of my background

00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:18,969
in signaling system so I was a little

00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,380
bit afraid what happens I have a bucket

00:06:18,969 --> 00:06:24,099
endlessly blender which I'll just

00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:25,180
accelerate so I honestly I over

00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:27,310
engineered in the beginning a little bit

00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:29,380
because I wanted to actually have an

00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:31,570
automatic braking system if I do not get

00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:33,070
any controls anymore you know implement

00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,810
a co-driver which then talks to

00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,460
something cause there to net it's

00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:39,010
actually a very interesting so I'm not

00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:42,150
programs of just the C program you run

00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:44,310
on embedded devices or Linux systems

00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:49,590
which actually met serial communication

00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:52,170
- UDP or TCP arm sockets and that you

00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:55,320
actually module eyes very nicely away

00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:57,450
and the whole advice system so I could

00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,520
actually start hacking in the beginning

00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:02,100
just on my notebook in the end after the

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,000
code worked I actually dumped it on to

00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:07,590
the west where I can then use Sinatra

00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,720
because I actually is not really good at

00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:12,270
web development service you swore to me

00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,100
I wrote a small little website to

00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:17,190
generate into the user interface and

00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:20,250
then I actually converted by observer

00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:22,910
script and with that overall and I could

00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:26,930
now actually go out and divide around

00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:29,820
that actually worked pretty well because

00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:31,800
actually after similar days after I

00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:35,420
finished it I was already sealed so I

00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,560
could walk again so at that point then

00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:40,290
actually the top would already be over

00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,330
because after I didn't need to reach

00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:45,290
anymore just ended up in a corner but as

00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:48,720
a matter of fact this thing came and I

00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:50,190
broke something again but it's a little

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:55,890
bit more flexible this time actually I

00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:58,580
broke my tooth so which is a fairly more

00:07:55,890 --> 00:08:01,710
painful than actually the ankle so

00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:03,780
luckily again the doctors gave me some

00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:07,050
nails and painkillers and with the

00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:08,580
painkillers and action I had to - Wong

00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,560
know have my own future that's not a

00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:13,980
problem at all gonna have anything to

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,470
worry but as a matter of fact now I

00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,460
actually depend on this thing it turns

00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:19,410
out if you actually have a lot of

00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,000
problems with something you just make

00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:23,490
for fun and then something actually

00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,550
depend on it so I could not just walk

00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:28,560
away after my Ruby program crashed so

00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:31,800
there were several issues I just

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,960
mentioned forum so for example usually a

00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,390
touch interface to control actuators of

00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:44,010
a pretty stupid idea and it's fairly

00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:46,080
unsophisticated of control then the

00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:49,020
wireless interface actually infer

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,280
it's in stable sometimes sometimes the

00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,320
bill just started to drive and

00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,089
architecture not stop

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,209
another thing what I didn't consider

00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:59,910
actually that the way I control the DC

00:08:57,209 --> 00:09:02,639
motors actually worked and giving us no

00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:04,980
constant power and that actually depends

00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:07,320
if the grant of speed or not steep is

00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,600
not falling down so that which actually

00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,220
doesn't have a constant speed some issue

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,649
and the thing I want to go more into

00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,509
detail is actually the question how far

00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:18,149
can actually survive so maybe some of

00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:20,339
you have heared about us you were saying

00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:23,310
like electrical cars and the concept of

00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:25,709
range anxiety so if you ever come and

00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:27,449
you're actually afraid can actually the

00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:28,829
battery lasts until the hormone until

00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:33,360
the next power source actually has the

00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:36,569
same with a wheelchair so how to look at

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,850
that one well I was thinking researchers

00:09:36,569 --> 00:09:40,529
have a better indicator sort nothing to

00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:44,160
do for me so where's a bit early

00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:46,800
indicator of my wheelchair well it is

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:51,620
there and you have a problem here as you

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:54,000
might now remember I actually made some

00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:56,100
decisions to actually remove that stuff

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,410
so at that point I could of course

00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,850
admitted that well maybe it was pretty

00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,529
smart idea and the guys who designed it

00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,880
which I had actually always thought

00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:05,910
about all those things and I could just

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,399
reconnected but let's not admit a

00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:12,000
mistake let's just build my own battery

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,889
indicator so all of that works of

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,709
everything as simple don't go into

00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:18,720
electrical details iam there's just one

00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:21,240
problem the better we have 24 volt and

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,339
you can actually indicate a load of a

00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:26,190
better way by looking at the watch and

00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:28,829
the water to swap if it gets some load

00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:30,839
on it the problem is with angle B and

00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:34,079
the ARM processor I'm using I can only

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,399
indicate vo to 3.3 volts so what you are

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,959
usually doing then is to implement

00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:38,970
something called the voltage table item

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:42,079
the very simple circuit which

00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:43,380
essentially just Maps the 0.3 board on

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,899
0.2

00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:50,100
2.8 maybe depends on the roster you use

00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:52,380
to the 24 Ward you have a curve and

00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,689
curve will be lynnium if all components

00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:58,050
are proper but how the curve looks is

00:10:54,689 --> 00:11:00,660
actually probably someone who knows we

00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:02,670
deep into electrical engineering could

00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,610
actually mathematically calculated

00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,839
easily

00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm not that kind of guy so I

00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:09,760
experimentally actually an otherwise

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,279
that so what I used years again of

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,350
course would be and again it's very

00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:17,860
beneficial to have an IRB running on the

00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:20,050
microcontroller because you can just run

00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,519
your averaging I'll go button you can

00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:24,040
switch it together with a programmable

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:27,670
power supply you can set a voltage then

00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:30,339
measure then get the approximate value

00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:32,649
put it into a list and then actually

00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:37,510
develop a formula for that from them

00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:39,790
it's straight forward so you now device

00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:42,100
the way to get actually the absolute

00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:46,450
voltage LED end just very very simple

00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:51,160
would be an effort to actually get the

00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:54,519
relations between 0.3 to 0.25 in the end

00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:57,670
again to check if that actually works

00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:59,200
I used again the Amaya beam so I use

00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:01,390
this programmable whole supply it

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:05,290
doesn't matter the better we would be

00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:09,190
the same and I can change the voltage

00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:11,199
and I can indicate it and of course I

00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:13,959
usually we ended up in a pure movie I

00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:19,300
can also use all kinds of Ruby code

00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:21,600
which has a lot by M movie so that I can

00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:27,790
also check down when we clean system

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:30,010
ok so with that one problem left then

00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:31,959
there is a lot of other issues I had but

00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:34,779
just to mention some for the touch

00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:37,930
interface I went to a game pad it seems

00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:40,120
to be a little bit more optimized for a

00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:42,910
redundant scene I actually used an edge

00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,010
e modem so you can actually use two LTE

00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:47,290
modems and you made a peer-to-peer

00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:49,540
connection you actually short circuiting

00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:51,100
the routing so you actually only go over

00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,899
the base station the EPC

00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,579
of the provide networking the latency is

00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:56,620
quite low so they actually work quite

00:12:54,579 --> 00:12:58,390
well and for the steepness actually

00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,310
worked on an automated which actually

00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:02,890
counts how much do we is actually

00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:05,320
turning it is that I can estimate the

00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:06,850
speed and was that I actually became not

00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:12,740
only comfortable of transporting myself

00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:18,970
actually to with the wheelchair but um

00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:21,800
oh it doesn't flame the process okay and

00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:26,779
yeah as long as you say just now you see

00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:28,250
this turbulence was some so I could not

00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:29,630
only control to myself I could also

00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,910
transport other things like here for

00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:36,560
example my iPad or some coke or I could

00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:40,550
change my son now all usual things you

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:44,270
would do now with no resolution okay

00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:47,330
and at that point again actually again

00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:48,920
when I reach that state my my food

00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:51,230
wasn't give you yield again so

00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,330
especially I didn't leave it at that

00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:56,420
point anymore and now I could put it

00:13:53,330 --> 00:14:00,050
again into the corner and let dust

00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:02,000
settle on it but I would expect because

00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:04,250
I didn't became smarter what's on the

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,260
index for would probably come soon so I

00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:08,360
should I should prepare for that so I

00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:10,060
was wondering there but what is an

00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,750
external but what should I look on it

00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:18,910
one thing I notice is actually

00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:22,790
navigation so as a matter of fact if you

00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:26,240
do the navigation for cars for our bikes

00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:27,920
or for pedestrians necessarily this is

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,510
not the optimal way to use it enough for

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,800
wheelchair obviously not anywhere you

00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:32,300
can you walk you can use a wheelchair

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,920
not everywhere you can do the bike you

00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:37,630
can use a wheelchair you need specific

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:40,880
navigations for bleachers it's obvious

00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:42,560
for that I actually use something called

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,209
urban statement which is also a will be

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,920
application probably a lot of people are

00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:48,020
scared of you it's actually the target

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,709
of building an open database of the

00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:52,220
whole world

00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:54,649
and great thing about is actually that

00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,660
you everybody can contribute to it and

00:14:54,649 --> 00:14:59,660
you can define your own text so I can

00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:01,700
say what a services I mean not so the

00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:04,190
guys who actually maintain that do not

00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,990
give me any regulations but I can use so

00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:07,399
there's already one project from Germany

00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:09,470
which is using that quite interesting

00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:11,899
which is called wheel map so your map as

00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:14,990
a project where now people are

00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:18,079
encouraged to map the accessibility of

00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:21,199
locations so for example if I look along

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:23,699
here this would be quite pet X ability

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:26,369
because nobody mobility will get up to

00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:27,540
and there was a crowdsource and they

00:15:26,369 --> 00:15:28,799
actually taking it in their own

00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,350
application and push it back to

00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:33,119
OpenStreetMaps on the other side versus

00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,589
information no you can actually do

00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:36,600
interesting things so there's a service

00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:38,040
called open route service and they're

00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,749
actually using information from

00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,579
OpenStreetMap Street now until making

00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:44,100
have seeped into urban kidnap to

00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:47,009
actually calculate a path so where I now

00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:49,980
see my cell phones actually I would like

00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:52,139
to use the platform I have to actually

00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:54,059
feed the system so I've experimented

00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:56,429
with some vibrational modes and camera

00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:58,739
systems to actually detect its surface

00:15:56,429 --> 00:16:00,720
I'm driving over and actually feed that

00:15:58,739 --> 00:16:02,819
back to actually increase the database

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,040
so at the moment open route service

00:16:02,819 --> 00:16:08,189
which then looks approximately like that

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,839
for wheelchair is mainly focused on

00:16:08,189 --> 00:16:12,209
Germany and a little bit more like a

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,129
Europe but it's not worldwide so we need

00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:16,290
to increase it not data and base for

00:16:14,129 --> 00:16:19,559
that one and as you since you get a

00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:21,149
route calculated from A to B and on the

00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:23,040
left side you also have the material of

00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:25,049
the surface which makes a big difference

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,429
so obviously with a wheelchair you

00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:28,169
prefer something like asphalt or

00:16:26,429 --> 00:16:31,609
concrete and not like these cobblestones

00:16:28,169 --> 00:16:34,319
which are also quite common in Germany

00:16:31,609 --> 00:16:35,399
so again gucchi optimized navigation and

00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:38,730
so one thing I'm working on

00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:40,309
another thing is vision so if you are

00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:44,459
like me and you actually never used our

00:16:40,309 --> 00:16:49,410
c-class and I have a kid you might

00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:52,109
actually use which a little bit too -

00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:54,119
angel I would say so even at one point

00:16:52,109 --> 00:16:56,009
four should bump into something if you

00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:57,660
are happier then we just bump into a war

00:16:56,009 --> 00:16:59,339
if you're unlucky I keep bumping to some

00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,910
other people and maybe music in the

00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:04,860
evening uhm so I have to consider

00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:07,260
protection Australia obviously so one

00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:09,179
thing I looked at a mirror system solar

00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:11,069
systems you maybe know that this Google

00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:12,839
traffic Center use them from the light

00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:15,149
emitting device which does your distance

00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:17,039
measurement from a central point four

00:17:15,149 --> 00:17:18,899
three nine six to the green so there are

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,459
a lot of them available as a matter of

00:17:18,899 --> 00:17:22,049
fact I didn't found a single driver in

00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:25,220
Ruby and I thought okay that has to

00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:28,019
change so the interface actually quite

00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:31,260
simple so they usually provide serial

00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:34,720
interface you can control the motor and

00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:37,570
then you actually get read out over

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,900
soon 60-degree angle about the distances

00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:43,840
and so after working on that what I

00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:46,690
cannot do is actually I have two wheel

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,909
jam and I actually can detect obstacles

00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:53,140
moving around the wheelchair so that's

00:17:48,909 --> 00:17:54,309
of course quite beneficial so we all

00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,289
want to bump into something you can just

00:17:54,309 --> 00:17:58,330
lower the speed the closer you get to an

00:17:56,289 --> 00:17:59,559
object or you can stop if the object is

00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:02,320
too close

00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:05,380
the same thing and it's of course not

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:08,140
only for static environments but also

00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:10,750
for moving environment so obviously if

00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:12,909
you driving around you also would like

00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:14,640
to not collide with other objects or if

00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:17,350
you need to have some kind of vision

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,320
which is of course the same system just

00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:21,820
different useless so if you can see it

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,559
is actually some things you cannot

00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:25,570
really see live like things which are

00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:26,830
reflective true but in the real

00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:29,799
environment it actually works quite well

00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:33,460
if you just estimate a little bit

00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:37,530
conservative and better stop than not

00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:40,630
proceed okay so with that said

00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:42,669
concerning conclusion here so I have

00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:46,059
essentially two things to conclude

00:18:42,669 --> 00:18:50,650
straws about the Ruby ecosystem so I

00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:53,350
mean Yamamoto has talked about now MRI

00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:56,380
how it's improving over time and will be

00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:58,900
and Jeff Rubin so my personal ecosystem

00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:01,090
looks actually like that so I have to be

00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:03,100
rich I have implemented different things

00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:05,650
which has different kind of complexity

00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,150
this one kind of needs the data quantity

00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:09,340
of a device system of the complexity is

00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:14,559
very low to be honest it's very simple

00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:17,230
code and then you go through them and

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,480
you have a romantic Asian slide will map

00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:20,799
and OpenStreetMaps which have a huge

00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,289
amount of data because open students

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,809
want to categorize the whole world so

00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:29,679
the complexity level is different but as

00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:32,169
a matter of fact today we can do on all

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,210
these levels now solve our problems with

00:19:32,169 --> 00:19:37,360
Ruby we have of course MRI as the

00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:40,000
baseline which gives us the most correct

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,250
Ruby but then we have J will be an N

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,570
movie which is for me the more important

00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:48,250
one which actually does something to

00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:52,420
we'll be into new environments so one of

00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:53,920
my conclusion what we consider maybe for

00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:56,560
new areas where you didn't use it before

00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:59,230
I actually do not see that many limits

00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:01,120
which we cannot be used and the last

00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:03,820
conclusion is how to improve from here

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,440
so I personally would be very happy and

00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:08,980
my host slide and everything would be

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:11,380
completely well paid off it's just one

00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:15,250
of you after you come back home to your

00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:18,940
home country and would actually just go

00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:21,820
to rhema.org and they just take one

00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:24,550
element so just say your nice coffee or

00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:26,620
so what would a cafe what kind of

00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:28,960
entrance barrier they have so that that

00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:32,080
would be already great but as a matter

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,150
of fact taking the world is actually not

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,220
solving a real problem is just

00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:38,680
documenting our problems well you really

00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:41,530
have to think about us William Houston

00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:44,260
now the environment for people who are

00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:46,060
not able actually to navigate so as a

00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:48,520
matter of fact that's a difficult

00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:50,320
problem and the reason why certificate

00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:53,740
problem is because wheelchair users are

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,900
a minority so I mean I do not want to do

00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:58,390
finger-pointing but I for myself I can

00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:01,270
talk for myself I would not have cared

00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:04,420
about real map on our chests if I would

00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:06,610
not have signed to a wheelchair so from

00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:10,390
that I conclude actually to solve this

00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:13,690
problem it's actually to put everyone on

00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:15,760
a wheelchair so now you would maybe be a

00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:18,430
little bit confused or maybe hopefully

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,500
nobody's offense but if then please wait

00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:22,990
a moment and let me explain so obviously

00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:26,920
I'm not suggesting to go around and

00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:29,880
break everybody's leg or obviously that

00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,880
would not scare it for me

00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:37,690
what I suggest was what I suggest that

00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,130
we change the concept of a wheelchair so

00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:41,920
at the moment everybody

00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:44,440
most people consider the health of so it

00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,790
is uncomfortable to use a wheelchair why

00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,470
can we not think about the wheelchair

00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:50,500
something which actually improves our

00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:52,120
lives for example in these days at my

00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,470
own work I'm actually in from time to

00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:56,080
time use the future to sit at my desk

00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:58,240
and I'm driving the maybe to the lab or

00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,380
to the fridge with no uhm and I can do

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,690
that more comfortable because

00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:03,550
have to move and I can make it faster

00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,930
and I'm actually good on track that I

00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:06,310
can actually even automate that so in

00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:09,580
the future I do not even have to think

00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:11,380
about how to come from A to B so pushing

00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:13,450
our way forward that actually people who

00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:16,300
can walk the side to use a real chance

00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:18,220
that might actually solve the problem we

00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:20,320
have optimism infrastructure because if

00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:22,180
everybody needs to use the wheelchair

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,790
then they will also push for improving

00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:35,800
that it can be used proper I was upset

00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:43,720
thank you much so we have any questions

00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:47,110
for Daniel we have a question very

00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:49,240
curious person and are you doing

00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:55,150
motorcycle races or something because

00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:57,040
how did you break your leg twice it may

00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:59,610
be a it should probably not admit that

00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:01,660
but I have these end of things and I

00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:03,790
some own little community someone

00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:05,380
shorted xkcd so someone is one on the

00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:07,900
Internet I do sometimes stupid things

00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:09,490
like for example hit a walk rather

00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:12,850
that's not a smart man speaking walls

00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:13,360
yeah I did I didn't target for the wall

00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,360
button

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,710
it was just a on the way I'm feeling a

00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:21,780
little bit in balance of Oracle but I

00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:21,780
didn't make any good now impressive yeah

00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:26,640
all right any more questions

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,110
if

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:37,490
so I've got two the first one is your

00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:41,980
the joystick did you have a second port

00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:41,980
for PvP as well so other people could

00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:50,360
you can now two people codes are not

00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:52,490
controlled at the same time but the

00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,960
interest would be conflicting so the

00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:57,050
result would not be what you want

00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:59,090
so that is I apologize that with the

00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:01,190
facetious question the the second one is

00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:03,080
in terms of like expense and difficulty

00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:05,180
how hard was distributed but together

00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,650
overall okay expensive no this is

00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:08,900
actually one cot soy do not mention it

00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:10,250
so one thing is actually also the whole

00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,950
will journalist we need some kind of

00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:14,780
disruption because with the things I

00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:17,270
have such bought one off I can actually

00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:20,230
build a wheelchair for half the price

00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:22,550
what a usual electrical utility stays

00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:24,560
I'm wondering if it's something like a

00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:25,610
monopoly thing I actually I do not

00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,250
really understand why they are so

00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:30,560
expensive but with all these features I

00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:32,780
have here I still end up cheaper than an

00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:36,590
electrical wheelchairs which is maybe

00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:41,000
something like 900 1000 RMB which

00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:42,830
translate to maybe 100 hundred 20 and

00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,830
140 US dollar something like that

00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:55,330
roughly yeah yay patents regulatory

00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:55,330
capture thank you okay anyone else yep

00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:04,870
you mentioned that Engler OpenStreetMap

00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:08,309
there's a laudable of material aground

00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:11,490
and YouTube were you managing to like

00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:16,419
use some kind of detection to detect

00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:18,549
like material also I didn't understand

00:25:16,419 --> 00:25:19,840
the question so yesterday's and so you

00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:22,510
can define whatever you want in all

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:24,370
these good maps is essentially a wiki

00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:27,280
format but I do not know sent a question

00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:30,280
oh did you did you actually made it so

00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:32,350
you can record what the grounder meets

00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:35,559
you yeah okay an essential question okay

00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:37,140
yes so I added on the GPS and system

00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:40,330
tour to track the location and I

00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:42,580
couldn't mark specific spots as for

00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:45,309
example creating one example a high

00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:46,929
vibration a low vibration but that

00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:48,010
actually is not sufficient so that's

00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:49,600
reason why I said that

00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:51,070
I have to combine it with the camera

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,299
system because web where you can have

00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:54,940
not only because the surface was

00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:57,039
horrible but because maybe and there's

00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:58,929
some other stuff on the ground which may

00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:01,809
be attentive early so my work on the

00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:04,510
bugs a key heart problem and so I would

00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:06,039
like to do that and obviously if in the

00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:07,000
future everyone would be on a wheelchair

00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:08,409
and everybody would collect this data

00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,130
that would be obviously do but at the

00:26:08,409 --> 00:26:14,440
moment it's it's something to play but

00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:16,799
obviously a definite value if only my

00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,799
own wheelchair is creating this data oh

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,799
thanks

00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:25,489
okay any other question Oh

00:26:29,309 --> 00:26:33,460
hey so you use these game apps to

00:26:32,139 --> 00:26:35,259
control to control the wheelchair and

00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:37,570
I'm wondering how did it work in the

00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:40,480
crowd so the video that you saw it I saw

00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:42,399
that it wasn't her own video and ask use

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,259
the other one actually the skewing and

00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:46,389
you saw on the beyond problem is

00:26:44,259 --> 00:26:49,749
actually double on the trees on actually

00:26:46,389 --> 00:26:52,029
the wheelchair and it's not stable for

00:26:49,749 --> 00:26:55,480
both wheels for both wheels and so on

00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:59,559
one wheel and how do you call an English

00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:02,139
Bible that's from its flickering so even

00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:04,149
if you walk straight it will diverge to

00:27:02,139 --> 00:27:05,649
one direction so it did that the problem

00:27:04,149 --> 00:27:08,019
I want to surface the auto meter which

00:27:05,649 --> 00:27:09,159
actually counts two wheel rotation okay

00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:11,110
so there was no problem with

00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:12,399
responsiveness and even like I don't

00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:15,070
know if you were in the crowd you could

00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:18,009
actually use you control the nature of

00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:20,169
your yoga pad without being worried that

00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:22,059
it will accidentally bump into someone I

00:27:20,169 --> 00:27:23,860
was annoyed you shouldn't ever be in

00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:25,749
general reached on a drink anyway

00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:28,149
because it was welcoming you should

00:27:25,749 --> 00:27:31,059
probably be worried but I have somehow

00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:35,409
maybe a deficit on growing both things

00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:37,990
but I I mean again I'm living in Beijing

00:27:35,409 --> 00:27:39,159
so I do not divide the two TM n square

00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:41,230
so because they will shoot me down

00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:46,539
immediately I will not do I pursue rush

00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:48,610
or so now okay is certain and of course

00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:51,410
I do not shake my son I just want to say

00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:52,740
that so there's nobody reporting it we

00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:57,549
[Music]

00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:59,679
government-issued date okay I think you

00:27:57,549 --> 00:28:06,360
can take one more question if there is

00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:06,360
any no okay

00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:17,130
so now you've managed to removal somehow

00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:19,309
remote control your wheelchair when when

00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:21,419
he loved animals which are coming up

00:28:19,309 --> 00:28:25,289
pseudonymous wheelchair when will it

00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:29,159
come up now all tournament so awesome

00:28:25,289 --> 00:28:29,880
okay good so again that that's on the

00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:33,840
plan

00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:36,450
leader system known my HD can create a

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,340
proper planned system so the system we

00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:41,100
actually met an Aryan and then can

00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:43,200
locate myself from the surroundings and

00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:46,379
then navigate myself inside of that so

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:50,279
what we are doing actually it works for

00:28:46,379 --> 00:28:52,230
playing is from that our floor like that

00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:53,789
so that I can at least navigate from

00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,500
point to point but it's very often very

00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:57,659
simple Ottoman so there's nothing to do

00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:04,440
with this fancy machine learning stuff

00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:08,549
so now just a simple knob path routing

00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:10,850
and then following so but that's not

00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:10,850
coming

00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:17,080
all right I think that thank you very

00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:20,150
much Daniel okay

00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,150
