Title: All I'd Wanted to Know about Ruby's Object Model Starting Out...and Mooar!!! - RedDotRubyConf 2017

	Speaker: Jun Qi Tan, Final-year Student, SUTD

One of the most fun yet confusing things about Ruby is its object model. It's something that can seem highly cryptic to beginners, and perhaps not even that well understood by experienced Rubyists. Not too far into my Ruby journey, I began to get a taste of metaprogramming, but even as I learnt and grew more familiar with common idioms, I always had a nagging feeling that my underlying mental model didn't quite cut it, so I decided to iron it out. The more I read, the more intrigued I became, until I ended up diving into the CRuby source itself! Here's the story of what I learnt about Ruby's object model, in a way that's both digestible for beginner/intermediates and also insightful for the more experienced. It will also be the story of my journey from feeling like a newbie lacking confidence in my ability to understand something as complex as CRuby, to taking the plunge and learning how to fearlessly read the source!
