	Speaker: Ankita Gupta, Software Engineer, honestbee

As organisations get bigger, handling large application(s) gets harder - long release and test cycles, higher chances of a small change affecting other parts of the system. Micro-services solve some of these problems, albeit with their own set of challenges. Apache Kafka allows setting up event-driven architectures, wherein the concern of each service can be cleanly separated, and communication among services can happen asynchronously. The transition form a large rails application to smaller applications can be made more seamless with a few easy steps. I will be elaborating steps developers can take to make this process easier.
