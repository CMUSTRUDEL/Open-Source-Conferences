Title: To Code is Human - RedDotRubyConf 2017
Publication date: 2020-01-22
Playlist: RedDotRuby 2017
Description: 
	Speaker: Don Werve, Consultant, Minimum Viable

Programming is a deeply mental art. And as programmers, we invest large amounts of time in mastering new languages and new tools. But all too often, we neglect understanding of the most important tool in the developer's toolbox: the programmer's brain itself. In this talk, we will combine the art of programming with the science of cognitive psychology, and emerge with a deeper understanding of how to leverage the limits of the human mind to sustainably craft software that is less buggy, easier to understand, and more adaptive in the face of change.

Speaker's Bio

Don is from California, lives in Tokyo, and divides his time between cooking and training to survive the impending zombie apocalypse. He has spent the past seven years working around the world as a back-pocket CTO and software engineer, helping companies solve tough team management and scaling issues, and today he joins us to chat about the human infrastructure of software engineering.

anyhow hi I'm dawn people are looking

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,070
very awake today and actually um you

00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,840
know Emily I'm kind of with you on this

00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:20,080
one the audience is looking a bit

00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:22,960
smaller today so I'm guessing that

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:28,200
either last night's dinner had a truly

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:30,970
abysmal survival rate or that

00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:33,850
transportation today is provided by my

00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:36,670
internet service provider I'm not sure

00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,620
which anyhow that's not over here to

00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:40,060
talk about we're here to talk about what

00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:43,300
I like to think of as the human

00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:45,100
infrastructure of code and that's why

00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,079
the talk is called to code as human and

00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,540
to lead into that I'd like to talk a

00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:52,079
little bit about how I got here not in a

00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:54,399
biological sense and not in like a

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,800
philosophical existential sense that's a

00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,250
bit long for this particular talk but

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:03,160
specifically how I arrived here on

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:05,290
Wednesday night so usually when I go

00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,759
into a hotel to check in for a

00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,679
conference here you walk up in the

00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:10,450
concierge very politely smiles at you

00:01:08,679 --> 00:01:13,030
and says so Sarah would you like to

00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:14,740
check in this time I stepped into the

00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:19,840
hotel concierge smiled at me politely

00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:22,299
and just are you okay never gotten that

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,490
before and the reason for this is that

00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:27,700
the flight here I think Olaf ice is the

00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:29,859
worst travel experience of my life I

00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:32,590
don't remember when I booked with China

00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:34,689
Eastern that I checked the checkbox that

00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,429
said yes I want the authentic prison

00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:38,090
experience on my flight I don't remember

00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:41,460
doing that

00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:43,110
but I swear to you that the flight

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,420
attendants were like drill instructors

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,460
they were they were marching up and down

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,399
I do mean marching up and down sort of

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,720
the aisles on the plane they were they

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,549
were making sure that your seats were

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,909
upright that you could not recline that

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:58,830
was not allowed they made me take out my

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:00,960
phone multiple times to prove to them

00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:04,920
that the phone was off not in airplane

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,679
mode off never had that before on a

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,390
flight and it was strict I was actually

00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:11,370
afraid when they like wheel boo-boo cart

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,750
around that you know they were going to

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,220
say like so would you like the chicken

00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,750
or would you like the beef and I was

00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:20,430
afraid to answer it because I knew that

00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:22,260
any answer that I gave would be wrong so

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,269
I snuck my phone out you know when when

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,400
you know the drill instructors were him

00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:28,380
off harassing other people and I took a

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,209
picture of the inside of the economy

00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:34,980
class on trying to Easter night I wanted

00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:37,650
to share that with you today and I'm

00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,120
really disappointed because this is very

00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:44,010
different than the picture that was on

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:47,010
their website so I'm usually a very

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:48,900
solid person I'm not I'm not prone to

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,480
panic I'm not the kind of person that

00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,250
really gets angry but when I got to the

00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,880
hotel I'm not kidding she asked me if I

00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:58,560
was okay and it put me in a hugely bad

00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,450
mood for the chunk of yesterday in fact

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,040
one of the organizers today said oh so

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,109
did you get here did you get here last

00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,579
night like no I arrived day before

00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:07,530
yesterday you probably don't recognize

00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:11,430
me because for most of yesterday I was

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:12,989
merely a hollow shell of a man and the

00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:17,000
reason that I bring this up is because

00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:19,380
I'm a human being we're not robots and

00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,810
unfortunately as programmers we tend to

00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:24,420
kind of look at algorithms and data

00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:27,780
structures and speed and performance and

00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:30,870
benchmarking as our sort of yard sticks

00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,489
for excellence in programming and well

00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,609
these are all important things these are

00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:37,290
very very good things to keep an eye on

00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:38,700
we have to be aware of our human

00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,920
infrastructure of code because that's

00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:44,100
really what drives excellence for us as

00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,950
programmers and so what I this is a talk

00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:49,260
on software engineering but we're not

00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,700
going to talk about refactoring or about

00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,130
the way you should structure your code

00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,930
or

00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,820
functional programming and we're going

00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,100
to talk about maintaining your own human

00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:59,100
infrastructure and leveraging that human

00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,750
infrastructure to be a better programmer

00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:04,390
now there's an old joke I have a degree

00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,770
in math I actually picked this because

00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,350
it had the lowest number of units of

00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:11,080
anything in stem and I'm lazy and

00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:14,080
there's an old joke that mathematicians

00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:16,480
are machines that turn coffee into

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,910
theorems you give a mathematician coffee

00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,080
and you get out like a big blackboard

00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,690
full of stuff that nobody actually

00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:25,000
understands and in the same vein

00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:27,940
programmers are machines that turning

00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,320
coffee into working software and I don't

00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,030
mean to say that programmers and

00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,250
machines like that's that's not what I'm

00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,680
trying to get at here but that your body

00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:39,100
and your mind are incredible tools

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,800
absolutely incredible tools and like any

00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,600
tool they require maintenance and maybe

00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,570
a bit of training and practice to get

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,600
the most out of them and so in the same

00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:50,740
vein that a investment in quality tools

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,390
is one of the best things that you can

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,800
do as a Crouse you have a good laptop

00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:55,440
you have a good phone you have a

00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,610
comfortable chair you have a good screen

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,500
one of the best investments you can make

00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,490
is in your own human infrastructure and

00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,290
we're going to break that into two

00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:04,450
categories we're going to talk about the

00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:05,860
software which is your mind we're going

00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:07,690
to talk about your hardware which is

00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:10,600
your body and we're going to start with

00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:12,100
the hardware I'm a big believer that

00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,960
health is very important towards

00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,490
crafting quality software and the reason

00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,130
for this is something I like to call an

00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:20,200
T work so ant you've heard of antimatter

00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:22,330
I think everybody in here has seen Star

00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,970
Trek and so antimatter is this sort of

00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:26,920
like negamatter stuff that if you take a

00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:29,740
gram of antimatter and a gram of normal

00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:32,020
matter and you say now kiss you get a

00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,730
huge explosion it will destroy

00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,680
everything around it probably for the

00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:38,470
you know the size of the earth and anti

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,680
work is exactly the same thing one time

00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:43,480
many years ago I was CTO for a start-up

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,830
in Japan as part of the the great coupon

00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:49,720
rush of 2009 or so and at this startup I

00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,920
had coded written a bunch of code

00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,380
because we were doing this massive

00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,120
rewrite and of course to do this I had

00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,690
pushed myself very hard was working 12

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,720
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:00,040
sometimes even 16-hour days and we made

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,540
the big launch on time and everything

00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,790
was great the launch actually went

00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,660
really smoothly so I went home to get

00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:07,810
some very

00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:09,970
very much needed rest after about four

00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:12,460
hours my phone rang and it was one of my

00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:15,060
developers saying hey Don I really

00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,010
didn't want to call you about this but

00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:21,670
everything's on fire

00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:23,980
yay and the problem was that there were

00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:25,210
the database they had looked in it you

00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,500
know at the database and for some reason

00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,580
everything was just getting locked every

00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,140
there were this huge number of locks

00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,970
every time they cleared them blocks

00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,140
would just come back immediately nobody

00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:34,210
could figure out what the problem was

00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:38,050
and they called me and they told me this

00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:42,340
and I knew instantly that that's my bug

00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:44,950
I did that sorry because as it turns out

00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:48,820
that cache expert is one of the harder

00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:50,530
problems in computer science and I had

00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,780
made a catastrophic mistake and I did

00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:55,420
this not because I was stupid or

00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:57,100
incompetent but because I was exhausted

00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,620
when I wrote that code and I probably

00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:02,110
cost my team the better part of a day

00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,070
developer of work because I tried to

00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:05,080
push things too hard

00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:06,760
and so we talked about getting the most

00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,740
out of our hardware our bodies what do

00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,510
we really want we probably don't care as

00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,910
much about strength or speed I mean

00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,780
these are great things to have but being

00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,100
the Incredible Hulk

00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:19,030
does not make you a better programmer

00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:21,070
being the credible Hulk does the thing

00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:22,990
we really want is constant energy we

00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:24,610
want to have constant energy that we can

00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,170
use throughout the day and it's really

00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,210
important because it's something that we

00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:30,760
don't really pay attention to very much

00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:33,700
so one of my mantras is that you need to

00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:36,700
manage your energy and not your time we

00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:39,010
obsess over getting more hours more time

00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:41,410
in the day we we pull all-nighters we

00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:44,020
drink caffeine maybe even take nootropic

00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:45,550
drugs to get more time and rather than

00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:48,220
trying to get more hours rather than

00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:50,530
trying to increase the quantity of hours

00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,790
it's to increase the quality of them you

00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,500
know everybody here as a programmer

00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:54,790
knows what the zone is like you know

00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,890
what I'm talking about when I save the

00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:59,110
zone it's when you and the Machine are

00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:00,850
one the code is just flowing it's an

00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:03,070
incredible thing I think it's why we're

00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:05,260
programmers because that that spirit

00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:08,950
that essence of pure creation is what

00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:11,110
makes programming fun and imagine if all

00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:13,510
or at least most of your hours could be

00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:15,790
like that and the most fundamental thing

00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:18,670
to having those quality hours is get

00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:21,310
enough sleep sleep kind of

00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:22,720
use your psychic batteries and one of

00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:25,570
the core parts of getting enough sleep

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,070
is to wake up at a regular time and go

00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,840
to bed when you're tired so that way

00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:30,400
your body will naturally drift itself

00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,780
into the appropriate cycle it's

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,580
important to do this on the weekends as

00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,960
well because if you don't do this on the

00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:37,660
weekends if you stay up in party and I'm

00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:40,120
guilty of this as well very guilty of

00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,110
this then you will give yourself this

00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,270
sort of like a little bit of jet lag

00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:45,790
every single weekend which you have to

00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:47,530
recover from on Monday and Tuesday it's

00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,240
very important that you don't cut more

00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:51,130
sleep to get time remember this is about

00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,350
better hours not more hours so really

00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,630
make sure you get that time in and be

00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:57,700
careful with alcohol because as much as

00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:00,010
I love my whiskey alcohol reduces the

00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,150
amount of REM sleep that you get and REM

00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:03,100
sleep is the stuff that you really

00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,780
really need so you might have noticed

00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,040
that after a night of drinking you'll go

00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,900
to bed and you'll sleep a really long

00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,730
you maybe sleep ten hours but when you

00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:12,370
wake up you don't quite feel rested and

00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:15,220
that's why I have a couple of tools for

00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:16,930
this I use bed time on my phone I also

00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,100
do not disturb so that my phone will not

00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:20,800
wake me up during the course of the

00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,600
night and sleep is really really

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,890
important I have an entire slide for

00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,330
this and I go on about it because it

00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:28,030
sets up your daily rhythm and this is

00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:30,430
critical because we are very rhythmic

00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:31,720
creatures you know our bodies have two

00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:33,520
rhythms actually one is the sleep cycle

00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,740
so and that's nominally tied towards

00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:38,680
sunlight and light and the other one is

00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,970
food so if you aren't careful to

00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,990
actually have a regular food schedule

00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,820
this will also screw up your energy

00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,470
during the day whereas if you establish

00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,420
regular meals if you have your meals at

00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:48,190
a regular time if you have your snacks

00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,780
of regular time rather than having this

00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,820
sort of up-and-down energy during the

00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:53,050
day you'll get a much more level feeding

00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,180
on your G that you can use and that will

00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,770
help carry you forward which is a

00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,120
wonderful wonderful feeling it also

00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:59,890
reduces the amount of stress that you

00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,510
deal with so when you don't have the

00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,710
sort of up-and-down energy levels as

00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,390
much when it's a lot smoother it

00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:06,070
actually does reduce the amount of

00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:08,620
stress that you feel it's really really

00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:10,150
nice and it boosts your focus I actually

00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:13,870
have calendar reminders which I've

00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:15,610
turned off that remind me to eat because

00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:17,140
that's how dedicated I am towards this

00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,820
and I keep the same schedule on the

00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:21,520
weekends because once again you can give

00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:23,050
yourself jetlag if you break it food is

00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,750
really important actually because it's

00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:27,490
what powers your brain and you don't

00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,630
have to let have some crazy diet it's

00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:31,090
it's really about the diet that works

00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:32,320
for you but your brain will only work as

00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:35,410
well as the fuel that you put

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:38,170
and I'm a big fan of watching insulin

00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:39,730
sensitivity so focus like if I can give

00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:41,949
any dietary recommendations another

00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:43,990
dietician it would be focus on

00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:46,240
minimizing the number of sort of high

00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:47,920
insulin carbohydrates so obviously

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,800
modulo your own dietary needs but things

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,209
like pastas Rice's are good avoiding a

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,190
lot of sugar is going to help you keep

00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:56,800
that energy really really stable during

00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:58,300
the course of the week and my tools for

00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,949
this are that I also do weekly meal

00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,480
planning so that I know exactly what I'm

00:10:59,949 --> 00:11:04,410
going to be eating during the course the

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:08,019
week and I also avoid processed food

00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:10,810
last but not least motion is life so one

00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:12,670
of my favorite things as well living

00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:14,019
things move you know when when when

00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:16,389
we're alive or moving around you know

00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:18,370
we're dancing we're running well I'm not

00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:21,759
dancing obviously because nobody needs

00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:23,560
to see that but exercise is really

00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,089
critical towards that energy it boosts

00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,009
endorphins and improves your blood flow

00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:28,389
it's great for your brain and it

00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:30,699
improves your focus during the week and

00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:32,050
a lot of people fail to get into an

00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:34,300
exercise routine because they're always

00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:36,430
obsessed with what is the best what's

00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,750
the best exercise that I could do it's

00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:39,970
not about the best it's about what you

00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:42,550
love so if you love dancing dance dance

00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:44,339
is great exercise if you like hiking or

00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:46,779
walking or running or playing badminton

00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:48,370
all of these things are absolutely

00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:50,170
wonderful things for me it's lifting

00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,899
weights I really like doing that that

00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:54,040
gives me my fix or rock climbers rock

00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:55,360
climbing is great for programmers

00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,430
because it's a very mental sport but

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,709
find something that you really really

00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:00,940
like and make it a point to stick it

00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:02,440
into your schedule and if you have a

00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:04,600
hard time sticking with an exercise

00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,190
routine the one trick that I've used

00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,410
every time I don't want to go train is

00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,970
that my rules I have to go to the gym I

00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,319
don't actually need to do anything when

00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:13,510
I get there I just have to get there

00:12:11,319 --> 00:12:15,839
because more often than not I'm going to

00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:18,189
stand in the gym in my stupid shorts and

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,050
I'm going to want to start and do

00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:22,750
something and you can use that mental

00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,920
momentum to carry you forward and these

00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,329
are really kind of the pillars of your

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,290
constant energy which are what are going

00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:28,420
to drive you through the day as a

00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:30,459
programmer and I cannot stress how

00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,839
important these are because optimizing

00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:34,389
your hardware and taking care of your

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,709
hardware and your body is really what's

00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:38,560
going to drive you towards being able to

00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:40,000
build great software and that's the

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,889
hardware part maybe these are things

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,329
that you already knew now let's go ahead

00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:44,290
and talk about software and because we

00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,430
really need to understand how our

00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,870
software works

00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,339
in order to understand how to get the

00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:50,710
most out of it right like there's this

00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:52,180
great talk about the ruby object model

00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:53,770
and how all of these all of these

00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:57,940
objects tied together with artwork that

00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:59,589
I'm incredibly jealous of and the by

00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,510
understanding that by understanding how

00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:03,010
Ruby's object system works we become

00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:05,140
better programmers we have a better idea

00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,850
of what's going on under the hood this

00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:09,400
is what a good programmer does we

00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,720
understand our tools deeply and so let's

00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,420
understand our minds a little bit more

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,800
deeply there's a lot of limitations to

00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,420
our brain and you may or may not be

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,360
aware of these one of my favorite is

00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:21,430
this that you are blind literally blind

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,620
for 14 minutes every single day every

00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:24,880
person in this room and the reason that

00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,550
you're blowing is because of something

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,320
called a cicada so the fastest motion in

00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:30,940
your body the fastest thing that you can

00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,410
do is call the cicada it's the motion

00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,510
that your eye makes see we don't

00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,220
actually see a full scene as I look out

00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:38,620
on this audience I'm not actually seeing

00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,970
all of you in perfect clarity I'm seeing

00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,470
a little spot here in a little spot here

00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:44,200
in a little spot here as I look around

00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:46,300
the room and my brain is stitching that

00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,400
together into a whole image to test yes

00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:52,900
there is a room that is about 40% for

00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:54,459
people now the thing about the thing

00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,959
about saccades is that there's a limited

00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,640
amount of motion that they have so if

00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:58,870
you were if you take if you if you take

00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,339
your hand out and you hold your palm out

00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:02,230
the middle of your palm is about the

00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,610
your focal area so that's what you can

00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:05,050
see and everything else your eye is

00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,130
going to have to move and if you're

00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,630
holding your arm out straight and you

00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,580
move it to shoulder width that's about

00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,990
as far as your seek aid will go so that

00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,130
means that if you hold your arm out like

00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,570
this look straight forward and then look

00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:15,070
to your arm your eye will turn to that

00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:16,570
if you hold your arm out farther and you

00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:18,790
look your head will naturally turn to

00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:20,440
follow it so if you have something that

00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,940
takes - why - the field of vision in

00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,980
front of you it's going to require a lot

00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:27,640
of neck motion which is smaller and more

00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:29,200
tiring so there's something that this

00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,670
ties into and you might have heard it

00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,410
before it's one of those programming

00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,880
rules that people may think that's like

00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:37,390
wow that just sounds kind of arbitrary

00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,620
and that that long lines we have a line

00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:40,089
that goes really over about 80

00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,070
characters it starts going outside of

00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:43,690
your secada batteries and so if you have

00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:45,459
really long lines on a really big screen

00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:47,070
you start scanning back and forth with

00:14:45,459 --> 00:14:49,240
your neck and it makes you more tired

00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:50,830
this is actually a principle discovered

00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,480
by agent typographers if you look at

00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:54,220
books like a lot of books the size of a

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,540
page is actually quite narrow and it's

00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,490
because it allows you to scan with your

00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,010
eyes rather than having to turn your

00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,900
head

00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:01,190
it's another fun limitation you've

00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:04,040
probably heard of and that's that your

00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:06,560
working memory is limited to about seven

00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,820
plus or minus two items and the

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,560
interesting thing about the way that

00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:12,680
your memory works is that it degrades

00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:14,600
you get lossy compression so for example

00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,120
if you try and remember a long string of

00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,490
digits like you know just you know a

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,110
series of sixteen digits what your brain

00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:23,510
will do is it will chunk it down a

00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:26,360
little bit until you remember maybe like

00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:28,430
the first three and the last four or

00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,440
something along those lines and you will

00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:31,910
think that you have remembered all of it

00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,110
but you really haven't and that's really

00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,920
kind of the evil thing is that when

00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,590
you're working through a really long

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,360
function for example you think it's all

00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:41,030
in your head but you have actually lost

00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,310
stuff and you don't even know this is

00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:47,030
one of the reasons why we talk about

00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:48,620
keeping function small right in that if

00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:50,210
you have a function that goes outside of

00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,620
that working memory size because outside

00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:53,720
of that seven plus or minus two items

00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:55,430
you will drop things and you will make

00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,840
mistakes and that's one of the reasons

00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:58,850
probably the biggest reason I think that

00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:01,010
we want small functions it's why they

00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:02,810
are comprehendible and so these rules

00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:06,110
that you've definitely heard before are

00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:07,370
driven by our limitations as human

00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:12,710
beings the limitations of our bodies and

00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:14,030
our minds and a lot of people I've heard

00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:15,590
that I've worked with especially as a

00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:17,690
manager have complained that these rules

00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:20,000
feel very arbitrary it's like a

00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:23,360
straitjacket but they really are rooted

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,460
in our limits as human beings and this

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,470
why really matters the why is very

00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,120
important because you can follow all the

00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:32,660
rules but if you don't understand why

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,450
you can still do stuff like this this

00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:38,200
follows the rules this this fun this is

00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:41,750
it's a short function it's got one line

00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:45,560
that means it's the best function C we

00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:46,550
got the best functions here and the

00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,900
interesting thing you know people and

00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:49,070
people talk about small code right like

00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,330
you know if you have small code well

00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:52,490
there's few places for bugs to hide

00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:55,970
there are three bugs hiding in this and

00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:58,490
I didn't actually realize that until I

00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:01,220
did something else and we'll talk about

00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:02,270
that later now this is we've got a

00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,040
little thing oh it looks like my phone's

00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,310
decided that it wants to ring there we

00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:09,380
go

00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:10,460
you don't need to ring now so this ties

00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,720
into something else in that this code is

00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,189
really hard to read

00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,929
yes we can make sense of what it does

00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:16,579
but it's not really readable code and

00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:18,740
that's really important because of

00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:20,809
another aspect of how our minds work and

00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:24,169
that is that we are built to remember

00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:27,470
stories we remember we remember tales we

00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:29,450
remember epics and this is because of

00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:31,130
how we've evolved so writing the you

00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:34,700
know human writing has only existed for

00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:36,049
about 10,000 years the modern humans

00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,570
have been around for millions of years

00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:40,130
and that means that for all of that time

00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:41,780
outside you know ten thousand years ago

00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:43,340
all that time before all those millions

00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:45,200
of years we were conveying information

00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:47,630
to each other and we were doing it by

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,610
telling each other stories you know the

00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,559
epic of gilgamesh all of these things

00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:54,890
were passed through oral tradition

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:55,970
throughout history and this is really

00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:57,350
important because some of you might

00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:59,809
actually remember since I told the story

00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:00,980
about a bug that I made and relating to

00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:02,780
cash checks where you probably remember

00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,789
a little bit of that about that because

00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:06,980
I told the story about how it was my big

00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:10,460
mistake because I was too tired and I

00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:12,020
wasn't respecting ante work this is

00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,250
actually there's actually even a thing

00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:16,700
coined about this called the method of

00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:19,400
loci where it was how I believe it was

00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,840
Aristotle once remembered all of the

00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,520
people around a dinner table because he

00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,190
had told the story and a joke involving

00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,270
all of the different guests now we're

00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:28,820
going to get to why stories are

00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:33,140
important in just a second and when we

00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:34,490
when we go into the latter but the I've

00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:37,039
actually gone off the rails a little bit

00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:38,000
stories are are so critical to us and

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,559
the reason why they're critical as

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,600
programmers is because that our code

00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:44,900
should tell the story and if your code

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,669
reads like well-written prose you know

00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,049
you get this cognitive fast-track into

00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:50,360
your long-term memory because of that

00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:52,370
method of low-side so if your code tells

00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,080
the story of what it does that means

00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:56,059
that it goes into the deep parts of your

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,320
brain and six months later when you come

00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:59,450
down the road and you have to touch that

00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,370
stuff again you're a lot more likely to

00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:03,289
remember not only what you were doing at

00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,370
the time but all of the context around

00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:06,320
it because our memories are

00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,789
interconnected we don't remember facts

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,409
we don't remember data points like a

00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:11,450
computer we remember sort of

00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:13,460
intersections of things so for example

00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,690
when you think about a dog you're not

00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,400
thinking of a data point of like you

00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:18,320
know this is a dog it's a Labrador you

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,690
have the sort of intersecting memory of

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,720
everything that is dogness and that is

00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:25,400
what you are recalling in your brain so

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,960
if we go back to that snippet and we

00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,060
accurate understanding the why buying

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,280
this we get something that is I think a

00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:33,110
lot more readable and simply by

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,370
refactoring this we now understand a lot

00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,300
you know a lot more what's going on here

00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,250
it's like oh we're dealing with short

00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:39,340
colors and long colors now so we have

00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:42,620
the short RGB codes and long RGB codes

00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:44,090
but we also solely by refactoring solely

00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:46,040
by refactoring this and by breaking it

00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:47,990
apart uncovered several bugs one of them

00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,870
was and of course I've broken the rule

00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:52,010
of refactoring and then fixing some bugs

00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:54,080
but I'm not doing those on two slides

00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:55,760
and we found things that for example

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,810
like the hex digits were improperly

00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,310
specified there were places where

00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:59,450
punctuation was missing and there was a

00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,830
place where we were actually missing a

00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:03,740
method call so that code would fail to

00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:05,660
even run now another really interesting

00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:07,550
aspect of your psychology that you can

00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:10,130
leverage during the day is that you only

00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:11,840
get a finite number of decisions that

00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:14,330
you can make decisions making a decision

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,130
uses energy remember energy and energy

00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,660
being kind of important well it uses it

00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:19,430
every time you make that decision so if

00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:21,830
you go to one of those sort of coffee

00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:23,270
places that has a million different

00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,920
things on the menu that's actually a

00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:26,480
little exhausting there's a term for

00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,580
this in cognitive psychology it's called

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,990
decision fatigue whereas when you have a

00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,280
coffee shop like the one set up here

00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:35,180
where you walk up and it's like well I

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:39,440
can have coffee with or without milk and

00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:40,310
that's pretty much it easy choice you

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,780
know you don't have to figure out like

00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:43,730
oh god do I want an extra shot in that

00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:46,700
latte mocha frappuccino double-double

00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:48,290
americorps god I don't know you know and

00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,730
so use those decisions really really

00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:51,350
wisely there's that there's a there's a

00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:53,390
really good decision a really good story

00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:55,250
about this that I like which is also

00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:58,070
taken from psychology research and that

00:20:55,250 --> 00:21:02,180
is that so if you're in prison which I

00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:03,320
hope you won't be then you have an

00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,820
option to do something called going up

00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,290
for parole which means that if you have

00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:08,470
been a good prisoner or a model prisoner

00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:11,510
then you can get released a little early

00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:12,650
than you would otherwise and if you are

00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:14,090
put up for parole you have a parole

00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:15,380
hearing in front of sort of a panel of

00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:17,120
people that will determine whether or

00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:19,790
not you can be prison early so this is a

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,500
big important thing for you and if you

00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:23,090
are a prisoner and you are up for a

00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,340
parole hearing you want to go as early

00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:26,870
in the day as possible really really

00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,780
topical advice for this audience I know

00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:30,940
right

00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:32,679
and the reason for this is because early

00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,120
in the day the judges arrested and they

00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:35,289
will actually listen to your case they

00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,429
will look at your evidence they will

00:21:35,289 --> 00:21:38,049
look and say well you know this person's

00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:40,299
been really good you know except for

00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:41,770
that one instance where they they you

00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,909
know they fix the bug and refactored at

00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:47,200
the same time I don't know if we can let

00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:48,490
them out whereas if you go later in the

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,750
day they've already made decisions they

00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:51,429
made a lot of decisions they've listened

00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,559
to a lot of other people and now they're

00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:55,600
tired they don't really care anymore and

00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:58,440
their default behavior for you is

00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,610
probably just going to be to say deny

00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:03,190
decision fatigue is a very powerful

00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:04,570
thing and you will fall back on your

00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,890
path of least resistance which is also

00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:07,419
one of the reasons why discipline is

00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,870
something you need to be very very

00:22:07,419 --> 00:22:09,640
careful

00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:11,080
I don't like discipline I really don't I

00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,140
think that discipline is overrated and

00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,669
that you need to build good habits so

00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,929
habits are decisions you've already made

00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:18,280
and there are things that you've encoded

00:22:16,929 --> 00:22:20,140
in your behavior that you've encoded it

00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,970
in the deep structures of your brain so

00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:23,559
that you automatically do the right

00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:25,150
thing because you can't rely on

00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:27,070
discipline discipline is you making a

00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:28,450
choice you make a decision to do the

00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,890
right thing and you need to teach your

00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:31,750
brain to do that right thing

00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,370
automatically and a lot of best

00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,809
practices a lot of the things that we

00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:37,030
hear about that we really want to be

00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:38,770
doing as programmers are nothing but

00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:41,409
good habits that leverage the way that

00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:43,900
our brain works one of my favorite

00:22:41,409 --> 00:22:45,460
examples is the reward cycle so you have

00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,470
a cycle that operates inside of your

00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,640
brain it's called the dopaminergic cycle

00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:50,409
hopefully I'm pronouncing that correctly

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,270
my pronunciation of where I've read

00:22:50,409 --> 00:22:55,870
these things and unfortunately English

00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:58,390
is part so the way that this works is

00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:59,320
that your brain will when you start to

00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:00,100
actually do something you have a goal

00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,390
you have something you want to

00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,130
accomplish and it doesn't matter what

00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:06,100
this is this could be writing a feature

00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:08,559
this is brushing your teeth your brain

00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:11,440
will pump a little bit of it'll pump a

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,880
little bit of I want to say dopamine and

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,080
rememberings correctly a little bit of

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,280
dopamine did you just say hey you

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,750
totally brush those teeth

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,760
those teeth really need to be pressed

00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:20,080
and as you move towards that goal as you

00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,000
work through the brushing as he do the

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,470
thing you know your brain is pumping a

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,539
little bit more reward chemical a little

00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:27,100
bit more motivation chemical into itself

00:23:25,539 --> 00:23:29,530
and then once you've finally completed

00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,539
the task boom you get this nut this nice

00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:33,010
Rush okay because you've actually

00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:34,210
completed that you don't feel it okay I

00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:36,179
mean I don't think most of us finish

00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:40,059
brushing our teeth and think like yeah

00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:42,710
yeah okay I do they

00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:45,140
okay and this is how people by the way

00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:46,790
get addicted to things because that that

00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:48,770
like if you like you can get addicted to

00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:49,580
exercise because the bigger the bigger

00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,220
the stimuli the bigger the

00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:53,510
accomplishment the bigger that Rush is

00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,590
this is how addiction works and the

00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,940
thing that's really that really is

00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:57,260
interesting about it is that you get to

00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:59,299
strong reward and then it fades away

00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:00,590
really quickly you know you you

00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:02,179
accomplish the thing you're really

00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:03,920
really happy and then you just kind of

00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:06,230
go back to baseline you buy that new car

00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:09,070
that really awesome new car you finally

00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:12,500
got the Mercedes or in my case the Kia

00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:14,419
and you it's a really really really

00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,130
great car for like the first couple

00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:17,270
weeks and then after that it's just

00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:20,090
sorta like well it's just my car now

00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:21,590
because the reward fades and this is how

00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:24,230
motivation works this is literally why

00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:26,780
you do everything that you do including

00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:28,059
writing software and that's why sighs

00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:30,350
Raven development is so important

00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:32,150
because remember the prize goes at the

00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:34,880
end you know you get the rush after you

00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:36,530
brush your teeth not before and so if

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,540
you put that if you do test later

00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:40,220
development which usually turns into

00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,419
test never development what you're doing

00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,799
your goal is not to write the test you

00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:44,600
are not there to write to all these most

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,470
of us are not there to write the test

00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,910
that's not the thing that we're there to

00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:48,710
accomplish we're there to build a

00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:50,030
feature we're there to build something

00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:52,030
that it gives somebody some new

00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:54,380
capability that makes people happy and

00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:55,790
by putting the test first we put the

00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:57,410
tests in the way to that goal it becomes

00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:58,669
something that we need to get over to

00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:00,470
accomplish what we're trying to do

00:24:58,669 --> 00:25:01,730
that's what we're really doing with

00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:03,710
test-driven development is we're

00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:06,620
leveraging that motivation cycle by

00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:07,910
putting the busy work first and so you

00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:09,140
do that and you work through the test

00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:11,390
you get the thing and finally when all

00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,919
those tests are green you're done yeah

00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:14,900
you get them you get the green test

00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:16,549
that's awesome and the feature is done

00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,290
and you can use a little bit of that

00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:19,340
tail rush you know from from actually

00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:21,500
accomplishing things maybe to do some

00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:23,900
refactoring and this is why red green

00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,669
refactor works because it actually

00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:27,919
leverages the way that your brain works

00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:29,690
it doesn't rely on discipline whereas

00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:31,070
have later development when you write

00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:32,840
your code and then you write your tests

00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:34,520
later means you have to be disciplined

00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,990
you have to finish doing the thing and

00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,340
then afterward you have to be

00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:38,840
disciplined while you work to remember

00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:41,450
all the things that you need to test and

00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:43,400
then afterwards you have to then go and

00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:44,419
be like okay I've done the thing now now

00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,390
I'm going to go spend all the time

00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:49,340
writing the tests so TDD leverages your

00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:51,290
brain cycle another interesting little

00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,580
aspect of your brain so speech is really

00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:54,019
distracting

00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:56,240
this is something that's very deep

00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:57,919
within our brains if you it's it you

00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,649
find this all throughout nature birds

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:02,779
chirping so when a sparrow chirps or it

00:26:00,649 --> 00:26:04,159
makes an alarm sound it registers in all

00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:06,649
other sparrows in the area no other

00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,269
words just sparrows because we've

00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:09,320
evolved to have these deep structures in

00:26:08,269 --> 00:26:10,789
our brains in humans it's called

00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:14,029
Danica's area it's literally located

00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:16,519
right behind your ear and that registers

00:26:14,029 --> 00:26:19,070
things like alarm danger things that you

00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:21,529
need to be worried about in humans it's

00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:23,240
hide your names so if somebody is asleep

00:26:21,529 --> 00:26:24,950
you can be talking to them and will

00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,049
happen if you call their name they'll

00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:28,789
wake up and that's because we have this

00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:35,779
deep structure in our brain now it's

00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:41,510
always listening like the NSA sorry I

00:26:35,779 --> 00:26:42,590
didn't mean it and the problem with this

00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:44,330
is that that means it's always

00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:46,340
processing and if you're in a big open

00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:47,870
plan office because as we all know open

00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:50,539
plan offices are fantastic that's why

00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:52,070
everybody uses them then you're getting

00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:53,720
this constants traction of people

00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,889
talking and it doesn't matter if you put

00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,659
headphones on they don't block out

00:26:54,889 --> 00:26:58,039
everything and so you're always getting

00:26:56,659 --> 00:27:01,130
this continuous feed that is keeping

00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:02,510
veronyka's area engaged this is a bit of

00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:04,220
a problem because this is quite annoying

00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:05,419
we've all experienced this kind of

00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:08,029
distraction when you're working in the

00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:09,919
office but there is a solution and it's

00:27:08,029 --> 00:27:11,000
a pair programming pair programming

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,070
actually solves a lot of things I'm a

00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,710
huge huge fan of pair programming I

00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:17,630
literally I will I will talk until Vanek

00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:20,090
Azaria has shut down about pair

00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:21,260
programming now but what it does when

00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:22,429
you're pairing you're working with your

00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,080
parent you're talking to them you're

00:27:22,429 --> 00:27:25,909
going back and forth and you're kind of

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,260
having a ping pong going on and it's

00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:29,960
keeping the speech area at keeping

00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:31,490
veronyka's area engaged which means that

00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,870
that's not processing all the stuff

00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:34,669
going on around you it's not processing

00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:36,380
like the sales calls that are going on

00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:37,700
and the irate customer in the corner

00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:40,610
it's just processing what you're doing

00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:41,960
with your pair so this removes a huge

00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:43,880
chunk of distraction and it makes you

00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,919
happier during the course of the day and

00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,090
pair programming have tons of tons of

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,590
benefits I mean you've got the real-time

00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:50,750
code review remember that reward cycle

00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:51,559
who loves do you know you get done

00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,730
writing something you're like well I

00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:54,190
need to like work on this feature but

00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:57,169
I've got a stack of code reviews to do

00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:59,630
you know doing good code reviews is hard

00:27:57,169 --> 00:28:01,220
you know it is very very hard to be a

00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:02,330
good code reviewer it's actually one of

00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,919
reasons I'm looking forward to a talk

00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:05,090
later on today on code reviews because I

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,740
do want to get better at this

00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:08,270
but if you're in a full pairing team

00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:10,010
you're doing your code reviews in real

00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:11,210
time because you have a pair there you

00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:13,640
have a person there who is saying what

00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:14,990
whoa whoa whoa whoa what is I

00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,610
what is that variable mean why is there

00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:18,320
variable called foo actually why is

00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:19,670
there variable called data there should

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:25,310
never be a variable called data it's all

00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:26,570
data the worst variable name ever and so

00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,530
pair program gives you a lot of

00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,910
excellent eggs there's tons of other

00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:32,660
stuff away I'm not going to go into too

00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:34,130
much detail on it now so we're almost at

00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:37,220
the end of our time here and I think

00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:39,110
that really you know if you can take one

00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:41,450
thing away from this entire talk it

00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:46,850
would be do not fly China Eastern

00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:49,280
Airlines you're all far too young and

00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:52,880
you have far too much to live for and to

00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:55,730
give to the world okay and if you could

00:28:52,880 --> 00:29:00,350
take two things away from this talk the

00:28:55,730 --> 00:29:03,950
second is don't fly China Eastern I mean

00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:05,060
it if you take three things away the

00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,500
third would be that you need to invest

00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:09,170
in yourself which is why you don't fly

00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,490
trying to Eastern okay and invest in

00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:12,140
your health and happiness and you

00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:14,630
leverage those cognitive limits you

00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:15,740
leverage your your psychological courts

00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:17,660
and the quirks of your body and you

00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:19,550
learn to work with it because that is

00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:21,770
what will help you drive excellence in

00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:23,720
your craft as a software engineer and

00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:24,920
this really isn't just about excellence

00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,210
as a software engineer because we all

00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,400
want to be good at what we do we all

00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:30,350
want mastery over what we do but it's

00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:33,530
also about just being happier and having

00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:34,850
a good life so I would forget to do this

00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:35,990
part I always forget to talk about like

00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:37,760
I have like a website where I write

00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:41,390
articles and stuff and I do actually use

00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:43,250
Twitter now finally so if you would like

00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:45,220
to see articles on how to CTO and how to

00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:48,110
developer and I guess how to Twitter

00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:50,150
then you know that's that's all here and

00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:53,750
I believe we have hopefully time for a

00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:56,869
little bit in the way of questions cool

00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,869
[Music]

00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:12,380
each do we have anyone with questions

00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:15,180
okay so yay hi

00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:17,490
so yeah thanks for assault I actually

00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:19,980
have a couple of a point so I'll just

00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:23,130
bring them up sure this one's okay and

00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:25,950
possum eyes no pressure here chill out

00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:30,420
guys so first of all regarding the the

00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:32,370
sleep cycles that you mentioned I read

00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:36,770
quite a bit about the different sleep

00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:39,930
patterns yes who potentiate your your

00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:42,300
productive time by sleeping less without

00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:45,300
filling yet diet without over exhausting

00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:47,960
yourself so I would like to hear if any

00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:50,010
their opinion on that so quest so let

00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,810
you have many points this is the first

00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:53,040
one let's do this if you don't mind I

00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:56,010
just like to tackle that because it's a

00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,970
big one okay so you raise something an

00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:58,350
interesting point which is that there

00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:59,340
are multiple different sleep patterns

00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,360
that you can engage in I think

00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:02,790
specifically you're talking about

00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:04,770
polyphasic sleep yes okay cool

00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:06,240
so polyphasic sleep for those of you who

00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:07,740
don't know is where you can actually

00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,600
break up your sleep nominally into two

00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:11,490
chunks and something that that people

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,960
did actually in antiquity is that they

00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:14,250
would go to bed when the Sun went down

00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,110
and they would wake up again sometime

00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:17,550
maybe around 1:00 a.m. and have about 2

00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:19,590
or 3 hours of productivity and then they

00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:20,760
would go go fall asleep again and then

00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:22,260
they would wake up again with the Sun

00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,870
this is actually a very common sleep

00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:26,430
pattern in fact it's one that I do right

00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:27,990
now not because of choice but because my

00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:30,240
brain is decided that's what it needs to

00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:31,740
do the thing about sleep is that you

00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,870
really do need to listen to your body it

00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:36,030
isn't that you need to set 8 hours and

00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:38,040
you must get exactly eight hours it's

00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:39,480
that by having a regular schedule for

00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:41,220
your sleep and by making sure that you

00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,600
get enough eg not forcing yourself to

00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:44,580
stay up when you're tired saying like oh

00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,440
I need to get this code done you know by

00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:47,550
having that regular schedule not it's

00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,470
not about the number of hours to put the

00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:51,780
quality that's what will give you your

00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:53,130
good sleep and your constant energy so

00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,360
the goal of polyphasic sleep is not

00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:55,530
necessarily to cut out the number of

00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,660
hours because you really actually don't

00:31:55,530 --> 00:32:00,030
cut that many like if having switched

00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:01,520
from a a normally cycle or a sorry a

00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:04,830
constant sleep cycle to a fully

00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:06,510
constants out the right word a there's

00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,930
words that a cellblock continuous there

00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,760
we go

00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:10,230
yeah you can tell I have a math degree

00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,510
so I continue

00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:15,510
sleep cycle in the one that is broken up

00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:17,160
into two different chunks then you

00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:20,490
having made that switch I can definitely

00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:24,330
say that I sleep maybe a couple hours

00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:25,320
less but it's I kind of actually pay for

00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:26,429
that because I end up having to take

00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,870
like a small nap or something later in

00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:29,429
the day like I do still pay a bit of a

00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:31,620
sleep debt and also age as you get older

00:32:29,429 --> 00:32:34,020
you know I'm obviously quite advanced in

00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:35,460
years as you get older you do need to

00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:37,260
sleep lesson so I don't think you're

00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:40,110
really saving that many hours have I

00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:42,720
answered that question yet much more

00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:45,210
okay sweet sweet cool and yeah just a

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,770
note on the the thing of the incentive

00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:48,390
award make your bed in the morning it's

00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:50,840
another make your bed in the morning

00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:54,480
it's again another instant reward

00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:56,190
actually yes and regarding the pair

00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:00,570
programming a bit more serious talk now

00:32:56,190 --> 00:33:02,700
as my we do pair programming in our

00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:06,870
company as well but what I feel is that

00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:09,210
if the pair is an even which is I think

00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:14,059
the more common to find and even bears

00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:17,400
it's very easy for the strongest pair to

00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:21,559
persuade that key solution is better and

00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:26,030
in the weaker bet

00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:29,220
pair just accept it and doesn't refute I

00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:30,870
would always talk about this but this is

00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,820
totally outside the scope of this talk

00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:35,250
I'm actually going so I give a small

00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:37,320
talk at a at a media called pairing for

00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:38,460
happiness and we addressed a little bit

00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,440
of that there so I'm going to pitch that

00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:41,820
at conferences and I'll send you a link

00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,049
to it so if you if you follow me on if

00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:45,929
you follow me on Twitter this is how I

00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:47,220
get Twitter followers by the way yeah so

00:33:45,929 --> 00:33:49,260
if you follow me on Twitter and sign up

00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:50,850
for my blog then you'll get you'll

00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:53,940
totally get a link to that video when it

00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:56,900
comes out cool any other questions I

00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,900
think did you oh yeah

00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:03,710
hello sorry I hope I found a question a

00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,690
few attendants for the things that you

00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:07,790
have said this first one is from

00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:09,679
somewhere in the Y Combinator started

00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:13,280
school lectures that I heard that it was

00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:15,020
about doing one thing at one time it

00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,730
follow from the fact that when if the

00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:18,770
person has more than one thing to do

00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:20,720
they're likely to pick up b1 problems

00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:22,940
rather than the a problems just need to

00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:26,740
be done anyway and it applies to the

00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:29,629
personal life as well in a sense that

00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:31,820
you can't be a superhuman if you try to

00:34:29,629 --> 00:34:34,159
set your targets too high that I'm going

00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:36,379
to improve myself technically improve

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,119
myself personally health night nutrition

00:34:36,379 --> 00:34:40,850
you would end up failing in all of them

00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:44,139
pick one of them do it make it a habit

00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:47,419
and routine then move to the next one

00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:49,520
other is the other again something

00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:51,350
everybody knows but fails to follow and

00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:54,590
follow us on the first one perfect is

00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:56,179
the enemy of good so you don't try to be

00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:58,910
the perfect person or the perfect

00:34:56,179 --> 00:35:01,100
programmer or the perfect look for the

00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:02,720
perfect diet or the perfect exercise if

00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,580
you don't start you never even reach the

00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,740
good stage perfect is the something

00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:11,359
which is very much later in your life or

00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:13,640
stage very much so the surrogate oh

00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:15,200
please yeah another point it is easier

00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,000
to understand it I'm sure a lot of

00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,920
people follow sports and you will hear a

00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,830
lot of prodigies and stuff and then you

00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:24,109
figure out only some of them made

00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:26,240
through and there may be a lot of people

00:35:24,109 --> 00:35:28,040
that you find in sports you will feel

00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,300
that they are not so talented but the

00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:32,930
discipline which brought them forward

00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:35,810
and and the person stayed in gate and

00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:37,220
disciplined which always do better but

00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:39,859
only the discipline one will do but

00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:42,530
better than that they rented one if the

00:35:39,859 --> 00:35:44,600
same level of effort that goes into that

00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:46,130
so you actually raise a really important

00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,450
point and that this is I think part of

00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:48,680
also being a programmer right like one

00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:50,510
of the things that we do is problem

00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,070
decomposition like a very important part

00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:53,119
of being a programmer is when you're

00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:55,190
sitting down to write the code you don't

00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,359
try and code all the things at once you

00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:58,040
break your problem down into little

00:35:56,359 --> 00:35:59,660
chunks and you solve those so when

00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:02,000
you're talking about setting goals goals

00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:03,440
work the same way and it's not just

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,670
about goals it's about having the goal

00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,350
the thing that you want to achieve and

00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:08,119
building yourself a system that gets you

00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:10,080
there every day but that's also another

00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:12,450
talk on habit formation and building

00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,680
in your life I only have so much time

00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:15,030
okay

00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,160
actually I think you have a microphone

00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:19,680
in your question yes so I wanted to ask

00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,570
you how do you keep your habits when

00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,550
you're traveling I always find it very

00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:25,200
very difficult like you know I do 50

00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:26,880
pushups a day and then travel for a few

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,860
days and when I travel I get very

00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,600
different rewards and when I come back

00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:33,030
home I'm like I already stopped doing

00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:36,150
'through jobs for a few days and so the

00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:37,410
habit is gone and how do you so I would

00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:41,420
like a round of applause for this man

00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:44,280
because he has asked a great question so

00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:45,090
it's difficult because travel exactly as

00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,120
you mentioned when you get on a plane

00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:49,410
because nobody here has ever done that

00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:51,210
when you get on a plane you go someplace

00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:53,340
it breaks those habits because you had

00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:54,360
this reset to your cycle number one is

00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,340
that when I land

00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:59,220
I immediately get back on the food cycle

00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:01,020
of whatever my location is so I I have I

00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:02,340
set my watch when I get on the plane to

00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:04,500
wherever it is I'm going so I'm on

00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:06,330
destination time and from that point I

00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,650
try and follow the routine that I would

00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:08,820
I try and sleep when I would even if

00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:09,830
it's just relaxing and I'm not actually

00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,640
sleeping that's fine

00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:13,020
usually the airlines are good about

00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,160
actually having you on the same meal

00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:16,950
schedule that's why those meals are

00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,810
always at weird times and when you land

00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:20,070
have your meal at the right time even if

00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:21,810
you're not feeling hungry like you may

00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:23,550
land you think well I'm not really

00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:25,020
feeling like eating right now and but

00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:27,510
it's dinner time have a little dinner

00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:29,390
have something and force yourself back

00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:31,440
into that routine number one number two

00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:32,870
especially if you're somebody who if you

00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,190
exercise in the morning or the evening

00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:36,660
once you get there set that calendar

00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:38,430
reminder and follow that rule if you

00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:41,100
just have to start like push-ups

00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:43,410
push-ups are a great example I the

00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:45,150
talked about was that we at wheelchair

00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:46,380
hacking your wheelchair really resonated

00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:50,130
with me because I actually spent some

00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:53,010
time in one as well and and so I'm I'm

00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:54,030
finally recovered I'm doing fine but I'm

00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:55,650
building back up to doing weight

00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:57,720
training again and as part of that I've

00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:59,460
been doing a lot of push-ups and I don't

00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:02,550
like doing a lot of push-ups really if

00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:05,880
I'm completely honest I did enough NROTC

00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:07,080
and I'm kind of over them now but in

00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,900
order to get them in order to get my

00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:11,490
push-ups in I have to do one so I have

00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,230
my exercise time and it's like okay I

00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:15,420
have to sit down and do my one pushup

00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:16,620
and if I am do my one pushup and I don't

00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,570
want to do any more push-ups

00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:21,000
that is my push-up for the day I owned

00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:22,800
that pushup yeah that one was mine and

00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,430
so by doing that by leveraging that

00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,230
mental moment

00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:26,790
for those key habits you can't do it for

00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:28,079
all of them but you have just enough

00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:29,460
discipline to do that and you leverage

00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,869
their momentum that helps you get back

00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,950
into that routine back into that cycle

00:38:30,869 --> 00:38:33,030
yeah

00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:34,950
have I answered your question probably

00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:38,900
an ankle so the and second question

00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:38,900
which airlines do we go back to ticular

00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:46,530
yeah well I had options there was there

00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:49,200
was there was some like Conair there's

00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:52,020
an airline that I was going to they had

00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:55,800
a pretty compelling offering swimming

00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:56,940
looked good I was thinking about just

00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,579
going to the airport it's kind of like

00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:01,980
doing this as the flights went by and

00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:03,540
hope that me hope one would stop or just

00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:07,559
moving to Singapore was an option as

00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:09,210
well I could just stay but no I actually

00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:12,000
I'm not kidding I literally booked a

00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:16,829
one-way ticket back on it on a na yeah

00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:19,530
so yes yes I'm glad that somebody got

00:39:16,829 --> 00:39:23,849
the point in my talk all right we have a

00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:27,270
question up here sorry so I'm gonna hi

00:39:23,849 --> 00:39:31,170
so a few friends who always tell me like

00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:33,510
oh I have no time to even start all this

00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:37,920
salty habits what would you tell them

00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:39,690
mmm another great question so the first

00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,650
one is you um you only have a limited

00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:42,809
number of hours in the day right like

00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:44,309
you don't get more and if you really

00:39:42,809 --> 00:39:46,230
focus on quality hours that number is

00:39:44,309 --> 00:39:48,780
not only somewhere around 16 you need to

00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:49,740
prioritize religiously so people who say

00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,910
that they don't have time there's

00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:53,130
probably a lot of stuff that they're

00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:56,780
doing the description in their lives so

00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:58,740
there here's a great example I have

00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:01,380
absolutely adore my brother-in-law but

00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:03,299
he's he's very uh he's the kind of

00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,970
person that has this sort of thing of

00:40:03,299 --> 00:40:08,220
like you won't take one over on me and

00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:10,859
he he once had a case where I think his

00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:13,109
phone company billed him an extra $40 on

00:40:10,859 --> 00:40:17,640
his phone the 40 bucks on his phone bill

00:40:13,109 --> 00:40:20,339
$40 you make good enough money it's $40

00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:21,839
and he went to war over that you know I

00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:24,030
can't I probably spent the better part

00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:27,480
of a week of concentrated effort to get

00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:30,329
that $40 back that's friction and so

00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,530
letting the little things go is a very

00:40:30,329 --> 00:40:32,880
important part of that like learning

00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:34,470
learning to let those things go and not

00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,530
focus them one of the other things is

00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:37,460
that too

00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:39,680
and create your efforts and then

00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:41,180
multiply them so for example I cook I

00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,340
love to cook one of my biggest hobbies

00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:45,440
but when I make pasta sauce my red goo

00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:47,150
pasta I make a gigantic batch of it

00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,250
might freeze the rest so that later on

00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:50,300
during the week if I'm tired I don't

00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:51,920
want to make dinner I have dinner

00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,510
available I have food at home that I can

00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,920
eat and I don't need to go through a lot

00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:56,780
of extra effort to have a nutritious

00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:59,240
meal I'm actually going to be

00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:01,100
investigating I think joylent as well so

00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,330
that I have something at home that I

00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:05,540
don't need to worry about getting a meal

00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:06,830
I do a lot of other things where for

00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:08,450
example my work hours are incredibly

00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:10,430
regular life I follow the same schedule

00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:12,590
every single day part of having that

00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:14,030
regular schedule and that means that

00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:15,620
when I hit the end of the day I'm done

00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:17,480
and I know I have that time available to

00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:19,010
me and i religiously prioritize that

00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,140
time you know I I keep the thing in that

00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:22,760
matter like I really care about making

00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:26,650
sure I get exercise so I don't watch a

00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:29,330
lot of TV I I care about things like

00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:32,630
making sure that I actually go out and I

00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:34,250
spend time with people and so I I kick

00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:35,480
out but I don't want to be drinking too

00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:37,340
much right now so I focused out I'm like

00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,390
okay I'm gonna combine exercise and I'm

00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,980
going to go out with friends so we're

00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:41,090
gonna go climbing together and so

00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:43,190
leveraging things like that where you

00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:44,720
focus you focus you prioritize and you

00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:46,040
also combine like those those things

00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,500
together really help you get a lot of

00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:51,080
quality time back in your debt have I

00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:53,780
have said your question yes I think it's

00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:56,870
like what four four four yeah sorry I

00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:58,310
have to cut it short yeah so if anyone

00:41:56,870 --> 00:42:01,280
knows any more questions you loop up

00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:05,150
them after during the break or an lunch

00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:06,530
