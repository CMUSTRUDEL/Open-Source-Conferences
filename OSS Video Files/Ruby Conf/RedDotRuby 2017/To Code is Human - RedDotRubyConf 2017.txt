Title: To Code is Human - RedDotRubyConf 2017
Publication date: 2020-01-22
Playlist: RedDotRuby 2017
Description: 
	Speaker: Don Werve, Consultant, Minimum Viable

Programming is a deeply mental art. And as programmers, we invest large amounts of time in mastering new languages and new tools. But all too often, we neglect understanding of the most important tool in the developer's toolbox: the programmer's brain itself. In this talk, we will combine the art of programming with the science of cognitive psychology, and emerge with a deeper understanding of how to leverage the limits of the human mind to sustainably craft software that is less buggy, easier to understand, and more adaptive in the face of change.
