	Controlling Telescope Hardware with Rust by Ashley Hauck

Dive into hardware APIs as we explore how the hardware of an 8-inch aperture telescope can be controlled with Rust. In this talk, we'll explore using serial ports to drive complex motors and machinery, and using a native C API to download images from the camera and control the dozens of settings it has. As a bonus, learn some basics of astrophotography and see some pretty pictures I've taken with my telescope! All code is shared on github.
