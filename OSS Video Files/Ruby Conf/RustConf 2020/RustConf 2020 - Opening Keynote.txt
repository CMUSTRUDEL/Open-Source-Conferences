welcome to the russ conf 2020 core team

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,600
keynote

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,600
i'm manish from the russ core team and

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,680
i'll be giving a quick forward

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,359
first a brief note this talk was

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,800
recorded before any of the recent events

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,320
relating to mozilla

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,920
since then we've put out this initial

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,800
response on twitter as well as a post

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,000
you can visit on the main rus blog at

00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,600
blog.ruslang.org

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,040
this talk will be given by five members

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,360
of the core team who will introduce you

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,640
to

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,600
they'll be speaking in the following

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,160
order nico is co-lead of the compiler

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,000
and language teams he works at mozilla

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,440
mark is lead of the release team and is

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,079
the main maintainer beyond perf

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,480
ruslan.org he studies computer science

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,399
as an undergraduate at georgia tech

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,879
aiden is co-lead of the infrastructure

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,079
team and works with rusted hidden

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,160
ashley has been involved in the

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,800
crates.io community and infrastructure

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,960
teams

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,880
she works at apollo graphql building

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,880
rust and webassembly tooling

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,400
nick is a rust engineer at pingcap and

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,680
has been involved in the compiler

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,720
language and death tools teams

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,439
so hello this marks the fifth birthday

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,360
of rust

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,720
that is this year 2020 marks the fifth

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,400
birthday bust

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,000
and what do i mean by the fifth birthday

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,280
i mean that

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,360
five years ago we announced rust 1.0

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,720
for the world right we basically said

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,079
rust is open for business

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,840
ready for use and we're not going to

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,520
break your software anymore and if you

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,600
were using rust before 1.0 you know that

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,600
we broke your software a lot

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,360
we don't speak of those days actually

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,880
that's not true we talk about those days

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,119
all the time at least i do but

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,920
anyway the point is 1.0 release five

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,520
years ago

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,840
very exciting and in the time since um

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,439
we've seen a lot of people using rust

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,000
more and more people it seems like using

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,719
rust for

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,200
more and more things kind of more things

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,719
than i

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,600
ever imagined i guess okay that's not

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,119
true either

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,520
i can imagine quite a bit of usage

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,959
but more than i dared hope for for sure

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,800
and it's been really exciting

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,480
and we figured that now with rust kind

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,000
of growing in use this was a good time

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,760
to step back

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,840
reflect on the last five years and the

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,720
values that that took rust

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,000
from where it is uh where it was that is

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,840
to where it is now

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,920
and hopefully that will see us into the

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,200
future as well

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,800
and it turns out that when we were

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,080
coming up with the current bus slogan we

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,319
actually put quite a lot of thought into

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,080
it

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,000
into what was a slogan that really

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,599
captured what rust was about

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,519
and this is the slogan we wound up with

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,440
and i've highlighted two words

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,360
empowering everyone because i think

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,519
those are the two crucial words

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,280
that have been the through line for rust

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,599
from its first inception

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,560
to its current incarnation let me

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,319
explain

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,080
um because i think we've come to

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,640
understand those words even better over

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,040
time

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,239
right initially we did think about

00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,840
empowering because we thought about

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,800
empowering c plus plus programmers we

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,519
knew that we had

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,360
existing systems programming experts

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,879
like the ones who are working in mozilla

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,400
they were maintaining million line code

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,200
bases and they were struggling it's a

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,440
lot of work

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,480
there's a lot of bugs tracked down a lot

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,239
of subtle bugs with

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,920
just segmentation faults and

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,680
irreproducible problems

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,280
and we knew that if we wanted to take

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,000
those code bases to the next level like

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,519
if we wanted to

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,280
extend firefox with full parallel

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,760
programming features and so on doing it

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,319
in c

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,879
plus was probably beyond our resources

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,680
it was just

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,360
more than we could muster but if we

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,040
could find a new language

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,560
that would solve automatically a lot of

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,159
those problems and let us focus on the

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,920
things we actually wanted to do

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,280
then we could do it and that's what rust

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,760
was all about right

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,360
and of course you do see a lot of usage

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,280
across in firefox today

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,680
and more every year and that's super

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,959
exciting but along the way this initial

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,400
goal of empowering c plus plus

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,040
programmers turned out to have a side

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,280
effect

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,480
that we didn't anticipate and i first

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,200
kind of learned about it

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,480
watching this talk from yehuda cats

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,080
yehuda cats

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,799
uh in 2014 talking to ruby programmers

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,239
and what yehuda was saying here was hey

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,640
rust is a new language

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,920
a lot of you have problems that were

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,599
well suited

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,519
to systems programming and you need to

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,360
make this bit of code more efficient

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,519
and before it may not have made sense to

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,880
use a c or z plus plus extension because

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,799
the maintenance hassle wasn't worth it

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,880
but rust changes the calculus

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,040
and opens the door it makes a lot more

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,720
accessible and so that began this really

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,160
cool blend that i think we've seen to

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,440
this day of

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,440
programmers from a bunch of different

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,600
backgrounds coming together

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,560
to work in the same language and in the

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,680
same community

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,240
and bringing these different experiences

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,040
and i think that has been really great

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,120
for rust

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,800
and one of the key things that you can

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,160
see even in this first example

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,680
is that while we often think of

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,360
programming communities as different we

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,479
think of like cbos plus programmers and

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,000
ruby programmers

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,440
that's already a bit silly right because

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,240
many of us love to use more than one

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,360
language

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,240
uh it's we're not like distinct things

00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,840
but also

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,360
that the problems and the experiences

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,160
from one community can really help the

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,160
other they're not

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,759
separated at all um and we saw that with

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,800
rust right the goal here we were

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,960
targeting the problems

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,479
of systems programmers it turned out we

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,320
were opening doors and solving problems

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,479
for other communities too

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,039
um these are some slides from julia

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,120
evans 2016 keynote which i love

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,720
and you know we were by making

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,360
improbable programs possible

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,759
she says now we were empowering lots of

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,520
people

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,960
from lots of different communities and

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,240
that first time i think it kind of

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,759
happened by accident

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,000
right but after that you started to this

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,120
take this approach more deliberately of

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,800
looking for problems

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,560
to affect one group and trying to solve

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,520
them in a way that benefits

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,560
the whole community let me give you a

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,160
few examples

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,240
first one is going to be cargo and

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,440
crates io

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,520
so i have a confession when i first

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,919
started working on rust around 2011 or

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,520
so

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,120
people were talking about you know

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,080
adding a build system to wrap the rust

00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,919
compiler

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,120
and i kind of thought i don't know if we

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,039
should try to do this

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,560
it seems too hard we're probably just

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,319
going to end up recreating make files

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,560
but worse

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,160
it seems like not a good use of our time

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,759
now why did i think that

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,199
well you know i thought makefiles were

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,919
good enough but

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,080
i hadn't used systems like rubygems and

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,919
i hadn't used npm

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,280
i didn't really know what software reuse

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,280
could really feel like luckily there

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,600
were a lot of people who had and who did

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,319
and luckily we did build cargo and we

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,720
also built

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,680
crates io right this repository that now

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,000
lets you

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,440
upload your packages and download and

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,240
reuse and now

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,960
i totally get it uh it's obviously it's

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,639
a really

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,440
powerful tool to be able to just add one

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,360
line of code and use somebody's package

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,360
and a key part of rust's kind of

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,960
empowerment story a key part of making

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,160
rust programming productive

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,919
by the way i'd like to give a shout out

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,360
to the crazero team that tirelessly

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,280
manages this website

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,039
um and sean one of the team leads we'll

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,319
be talking later today although not i

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,759
hear about crates io

00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,599
i'm sure it will be really cool exposing

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:03,840
keynote check it out

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,840
anyway um so

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,000
yeah and in fact i'm really you know

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,840
it's great that we did because if you

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,599
look at messages about what people

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,120
love about rust or about their first

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,720
experience with rust or something like

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,680
that what you're going to notice is time

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,440
after time again

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,120
cargo comes up every time um

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,800
maybe not every time most times it's

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,479
really cool and

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,840
i mean look there's some quotes i

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,919
scraped off of reddit and so forth

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,880
but this person they hate

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,400
everything about rust they hate the

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,759
moduluses

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,520
however both sitters they think it's

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,880
ugly they wish they were javascript they

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,840
were reciprocals i don't know

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,960
but they love cargo right i think that

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,080
kind of tells you everything you need to

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,080
know

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,360
another page i thought was interesting

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,000
was this one

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,199
this talks about if you're coming to us

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,919
from different backgrounds what to

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,199
expect

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,120
and it says when you're coming from c

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,639
plus plus it may take you some time to

00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,840
get used to the type system to get used

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,440
to lifetimes

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,440
but in the meantime you can enjoy using

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,840
cargo right and you'll get hooked on

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,759
that

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,039
and then you'll figure out the rest and

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,000
i think that kind of tells you what you

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,840
need to know

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,280
that a lot of times you might be

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,879
thinking like

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,080
there's existing systems programmers

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,599
they're the experienced folks they

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,120
should be the ones leading the way

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,400
that's not always true sometimes there's

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,599
people from other communities who have

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,919
solved this problem

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,039
and it's often those experienced people

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,800
who are kind of trying to tell you

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,440
that's not a problem we're solving

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,919
that benefit the most from the solution

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,560
uh

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,199
and i can say personally that i have

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,360
benefited

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,959
right hacking on rust we used to have

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,240
this make file to build rust

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:37,440
it was an interesting make file i

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,240
learned a lot about make from this

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,599
makefile

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,519
i like how it starts with reading

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,599
adventure uh

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,880
you know it had lines like this one let

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,160
me just blow that up for you a little

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,000
closer in case you can't read it

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,760
there's six distinct dollar signs there

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,279
each of one each one is like one level

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,080
of escaping or something luckily i've

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,720
forgotten all

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,240
of how this worked uh we've replaced

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,680
this since with cargo

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,760
it's a much better experience um

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,120
and you know crazy and cargo and crates

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,519
are great tools

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,120
they're one tool of a large family of

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,040
tools and i think that's a key part of

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,519
the rust experience too that we really

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,240
tried to keep our tooling and our uh

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,360
accessible

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,160
and fill the needs that people have to

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,600
be productive

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,279
and enjoy using west

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,839
let's look at another example error

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,839
messages

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,920
so rust error messages around the 1.0

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,080
time period

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:34,160
they were functional right they told you

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,320
they usually told you the line of code

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,000
that caused your problem and they tried

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,920
to tell you why but they didn't

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,600
necessarily do a very good job i think

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,959
most of us since you've got experience

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,320
with russ you learn not to read the

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,760
error message and just to jump to the

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,200
line of code and like look around and

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,519
figure out what was going on

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,120
now that all changed around 2016 when we

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,880
started doing this big push on new era

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,680
messages led by jonathan turner

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:59,120
the idea here was that we want to

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,440
well this was part of i should say a

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,800
bigger push to improve new users

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,399
experience with rust

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,320
right and one of the key things that new

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,959
users like to do when they want to learn

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,760
rest

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,200
is run the compiler on some code and

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,560
they're going to get errors and so if we

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,040
can make those errors better and help

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,640
them

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,399
understand the problem they're more

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,519
likely to stick with rust that was the

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,519
idea

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,200
and that's what led us to these awesome

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,600
error messages we have today

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,600
uh it's also kind of what you know we

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,279
were taking some inspiration from elm

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,720
and from some other packages in elma so

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,320
i don't know about uh

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,480
different dif there's now like some of

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,680
this friendly competition where

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,200
people are really fighting to have the

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,399
best error messages and copying ideas

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,880
from one another and i think that's

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,360
awesome

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,079
right i love that uh and i'm glad that

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,279
russ is

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,880
is in that as part of that movement and

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,880
in these error messages we've really

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,720
focused on

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,240
bringing your code to the front and

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,880
actually explaining the problem giving

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,519
you suggestions on how to fix it

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,120
uh and it was not i should say just one

00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,240
person's work it was a lot of people who

00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,760
participated in this was a real

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,000
community effort where we had to go

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,519
through

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,880
every one of the old error messages and

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,720
there are hundreds and hundreds and

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,760
convert them to the new format

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,360
and as part of that uh we brought in a

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,399
bunch of new people including esteban

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,079
who has since

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,079
kind of taken up the lead of the

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,360
diagnostics effort in the compiler

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,680
and i love this tweet where he talks

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,519
about his goal of can we make it that

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,920
you don't even need the rest book

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,440
just get all the information you need

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,440
right from the error message

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,800
um i don't know if we'll ever get there

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,040
but i think we're getting

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,640
closer and closer right it's really cool

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,000
esteban also is talking

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,839
later in muscov check that out

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,839
now all of this stuff was focused on

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,519
helping new users learn rust improving

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,720
the experience when people first start

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,880
with rust

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,079
but is it only new users that benefit

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,279
from good error messages

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:49,040
no everybody benefits right even people

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,639
have been using rust a long time

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,720
uh and in fact we're all just kind of

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,720
accustomed now to actually getting

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,399
useful information out of our errors

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,920
so it's been something that really

00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,440
worked for the whole community even if

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,200
it came out of

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,800
focusing on the needs of new users

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,240
now one last example is the code of

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,560
conduct

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,440
i think most of you know it should come

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,680
as no surprise

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,800
that the internet can be a hostile place

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,120
there are a bunch of jerks

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,040
they like to say things they're not

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,000
often that constructive

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,959
um and that kind of gave rise to a

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,200
movement

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,160
amongst software packages and open

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,440
source

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,440
communities and just communities in

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,279
general to establish

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,279
codes of conduct right and rust is one

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,880
of those projects we've had a code of

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,959
conduct from the very beginning

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,639
our code of conduct says you shall not

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,760
use harassing language

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,360
demeaning language and so forth but it

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,480
also says things like

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,880
you should appreciate that there are

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,360
design trade-offs that not every

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,160
design has a single best answer and you

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,600
can have

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,839
disagreement about which one is the best

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,880
and you know the goal of a code of

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,000
conduct

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,279
part of it is to make the language a

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,279
more inclusive space

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,800
to help get more people in and you might

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,680
think then that that's really what the

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,040
audience is for

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,480
people who aren't currently part of the

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,920
community trying to make their

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,880
experience more pleasant when they first

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,240
join

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,160
that's true but interestingly

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,399
if you look at what motivated graydon

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,279
he's a founder of rust

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,839
initial person who started the project

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,360
and who

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,240
insisted on the code of conduct at that

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,600
time why did he do it

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,279
it's not that it wasn't for other people

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,760
but it was also for himself

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,200
right because he had been a part of many

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,760
different open source projects in the

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,959
past

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,639
and language projects and he found that

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,279
you know if he was going to work in this

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,560
space he wanted to work with people who

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,920
are respecting

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,920
these uh precepts um and so

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,079
i think it's a good case of focusing on

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,000
the needs of

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,279
sort of newcomers to the community who

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,120
might be turned off by the

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,040
kind of style of discourse that have

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,959
been happening actually makes the life

00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:01,040
for everyone who's participating

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:03,680
much much better so

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,560
um i do say when we talk about code of

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,000
conduct

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,360
another key part of having a code of

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,079
conduct is having an enforcement

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,720
mechanism

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,600
which implies moderation and we all have

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,680
a big

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,959
thank you for the moderation team that

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,079
does a very difficult job

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,839
if you'd like to appreciate how

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,680
difficult it is i can't recommend enough

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,000
this comment by burnt sushi

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,360
the urls there it's unread i've pulled

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,720
out one particularly interesting quote

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,199
but it's a much longer comment

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,000
and all of it's worth reading about how

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,760
hard it can be

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,120
to have to try to sit stand in a

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,519
conversation and

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,800
draw the line of what is acceptable and

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,920
what is not

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:40,160
so thank you to them now

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,959
i've given three examples but there's so

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,240
many more

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,320
all right once you start looking for

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,360
empowerment as this theme and especially

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,279
this idea of

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,279
kind of newcomer they're learning from

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,480
newcomers to benefit the whole community

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,480
and learning from different communities

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,720
to benefit one another and so forth

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,760
you start to see it everywhere it goes

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,959
from the language design

00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,040
we have things like the ergonomics

00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,760
initiative to the way that we run our

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,480
project

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,120
right focusing on efforts like the rusty

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,199
dev guide or having rfcs and teams

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,360
to the tools that we use to run the

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,920
project like github and so forth

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,600
they're all oriented at empowering

00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,199
people to participate empowering people

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,600
to use rust and to learn

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,639
um so i think it's really this this

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,440
central story

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,120
of rust itself but i'd like to hand it

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,639
over now to mark

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,320
who's going to give us another look at

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,760
the history of rust this time from a

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,560
more numerical

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,519
perspective the key element in making us

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,800
the language it is

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,800
the people who participate in our

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,639
community

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,839
the rust team also tries to automate

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,120
what we can to keep our human population

00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:43,360
happy

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,800
but we currently have 305 team members

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,240
there are many more people discussing

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,880
and contributing to us on github

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,639
and our forums we are also seeing

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,079
hundreds of people joining conversations

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,279
for the first time just this year

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,320
not only are people joining

00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:00,160
conversations on github

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,800
and the user form but we are also seeing

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,959
much more issue traffic

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,720
over 2 000 issues are being filed each

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,959
month

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,560
we can also see that ever since 1.0 we

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,399
have been steadily accumulating issues

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,120
across the organization

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,639
more issues are being opened and closed

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,399
this is one of the reasons the language

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,000
compiler and library teams are looking

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,759
at restructuring their interfaces to the

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,360
wider community

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,120
we don't yet know if the ideas we've

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,759
identified will work out but experiments

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,759
are ongoing

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,120
data contributions are great but aren't

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,399
the only way to participate in the

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,079
community

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,680
we've had more people publish grades in

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,240
2020 than commit to our github

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,240
organization

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,079
create. has not only seen thousands of

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,360
publishers but we are also seeing many

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,360
new versions being published

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,600
and of those versions over time we're

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,360
increasingly moving towards stability

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,279
around 20 of the versions published in

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,279
the last six months or 1.0 or greater

00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,600
having taken a look at all of these

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,320
statistics it is clear that rust is

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,320
growing rapidly

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,520
and growth means change and although

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,240
things can feel permanent when you join

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,439
a project

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:14,319
the people that you're working with the

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,280
uh structure that you're working within

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,480
will last forever

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,880
that's not the case people will leave

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,480
join new projects new people join and

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,600
this is okay

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:28,880
in fact evolution can be a good thing

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:31,440
um so

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,000
it means the project is adapting to

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,120
growth

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,960
and changes and as an example of this

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:41,679
the teams within rust didn't exist

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,520
when the project first started it was as

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,960
a response to

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,840
the growth and the emerging

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:51,200
responsibilities

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:55,200
and rfcs are another

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:58,240
example of an evolution in rust

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,919
but change can be disruptive and you may

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,960
have encountered cynical takes on this

00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,039
such as

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,960
talking about the good old days or

00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,240
referencing something called the eternal

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:11,440
september

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:14,000
which is an event where a large influx

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:17,360
of new users into a community

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,400
overwhelmed that community's ability to

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:23,280
induct those users and introduce them to

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:26,640
the culture and norms

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,559
and this is important for us because

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,039
it's a consensus-based project there's

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:34,000
no benevolent dictator for life

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,679
as you may have seen in other projects

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,840
um

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,360
we have to we have to deal with this by

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,679
coming to an agreement

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,000
around what the roof around routes

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,600
forward

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,840
and the way that we can overcome

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,799
disruption here is with a set of

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,559
shared values and alignment around the

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:55,039
things that we believe are important for

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,039
the project

00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,679
note that values aren't optional not

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,120
having a set of values

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:05,840
is in itself a value choice

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,360
and in order to choose a set of values

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,240
we need to

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,600
consider what uh what's cause of the

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,919
culture of rest

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:18,559
what do we want to preserve about it

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,799
and the answer is people the rest

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:24,400
project focuses its values

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:26,360
on people i'm going to go through um

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,840
three different kind of concrete

00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:31,600
manifestations

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:36,720
of this where you can see this

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:39,120
uh hopefully more clearly

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,120
so the first is in eliminating things

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,400
that don't need to be hard

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:47,600
so one of the core promises around rust

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,640
which nico touched on earlier was

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:53,520
around making it feasible

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,720
to write applications of a particular

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,760
kind

00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,559
and part of this is about reliability

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,360
one of the key promises of rust it just

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,320
eliminates

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:07,840
certain classes of bugs at compile time

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,840
you don't have to think about them

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:15,520
it doesn't need to be a hard thing to do

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,559
another example of this is the module

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,440
system

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,400
and this is something that the rust

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,640
project

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:27,039
uh iterated on so the language team

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,400
as part of a project to identify the

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:31,679
things that people

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:34,960
found difficult to understand uh

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,799
or work with observe the

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,320
module system that was released in rus

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:42,320
1.0

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:45,440
was confusing and so

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:48,080
i actually created a set of rfcs

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,440
to discuss and design a solution for

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,799
this

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:55,280
which was eventually landed and

00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,080
is now the uh is now available in russ

00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,480
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,480
so if you

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,080
from this download and this desire to

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,400
eliminate

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,400
eliminate confusing or difficult things

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:17,039
the next example is educating on things

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,440
that are hard so

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,400
we recognize that we're not going to be

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,080
able to get rid of

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:26,480
everything that's difficult

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,919
but we can try and help people when they

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,360
encounter them

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:34,960
so one example is errors

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:38,000
which was covered earlier on by nico

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,720
which has had a lot of effort put into

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,840
it

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:45,039
and this user has in

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:47,039
years of using rust encountered an

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,120
unhelpful error message for the first

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,520
time and

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,200
as it happens this was improved shortly

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,559
afterwards and it kind of

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,559
demonstrates the um

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:01,440
it demonstrates the success of errors

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:05,039
that this is the first one

00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:07,840
uh in those years the other example

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,919
of this education is around the focus

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,840
that russ puts on docs

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,840
so rust has a

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:19,200
a standard for creating documentation

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:22,080
rustoc that's distributed with the

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,559
compiler it has high quality

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,400
documentation for the standard library

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,000
and it has automatically built

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,640
documentation

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,760
for every version of every crate that

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,039
gets uploaded

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:37,760
to the package registry

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,159
and this is an incredibly impactful

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,400
thing

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:45,360
when you're trying to start on a project

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,520
trying to figure out how to use it you

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,120
know that

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,720
there will be some documentation

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,720
available for you to use

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,720
the final example is providing access to

00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:02,799
spaces and power within the project

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:05,200
so the most uh the most

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,640
obvious example of this is in the rfc's

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,240
process

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,720
which is the way in which decisions are

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,919
made

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:17,120
in the rus project to

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:20,320
post a proposal

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,559
in a public forum let anyone comment on

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,840
it

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:25,039
discuss it and then have the team come

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,559
to

00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,960
one of the rust teams come to a decision

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:31,200
on it and it's a very

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,200
uh open process where anyone can have

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,120
their say

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,559
another example of this is the code of

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:40,400
conduct which

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:43,520
nico covered earlier as being a way to

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:46,320
provide spaces within the project for

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:49,840
people to participate

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:52,960
finally the team structure

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,520
the creation of teams uh is something

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,360
that

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,080
gives people power within the project to

00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:02,159
have their say to contribute

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:04,880
and this is something that is uh

00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,880
we've been talking about for a while so

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:10,640
this is a slide from the

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:13,039
2018 ruscom court team keynote

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,320
and talks about making a space for

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:19,840
people to

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,840
uh step into to help out in the project

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,880
and ultimately the reason we center the

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,919
our values around people is because

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,200
technology is by

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:34,880
people for people and so

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,400
focusing uh your values on people and

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,440
caring about people

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,320
actually makes great technology thanks

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,120
aiden

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,480
um so we've just heard that you know

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,919
great technology

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:50,799
is built both for and by people

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,320
and that is a critical value involved in

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,720
building great technology

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,000
but i do think that the term great

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,559
technology can be

00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,080
somewhat kind of ambiguous or at least

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,720
vague maybe to the

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,559
point of meaninglessness and so i'd

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,559
really like to bring definition to that

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,880
term by centering it around this concept

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,640
of

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:13,120
impact uh and so i think one can say

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:16,080
that great technology is technology that

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,039
has impact and i think that begs the

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,679
question then

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,679
of what does it mean for a programming

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,880
language to have

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:26,720
impact uh and this can feel like a very

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,279
philosophical question which may be

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,600
coming from me is unsurprising to many

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:34,400
but i actually think this is a question

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:37,760
that rust has been asking itself since

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,679
very very early on and i think it has

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,520
you know centered a lot of the

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,000
conversations and questions and

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,320
decisions

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,279
that the project has made over time and

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,520
hopefully you've seen

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,200
a fair amount of that from what my other

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,520
presenters have talked to you about

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,640
today

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,400
but i think one of the moments where we

00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,480
became most explicit

00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,919
about the type of impact we as a

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,600
programming language rust

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:05,360
wanted to have was during the release of

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,480
the 2018 edition

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,679
which certainly had its uh bumps it was

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,840
a really

00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,440
i think emotional but like critical time

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,559
for the project but one of the biggest

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,600
portions of it

00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:20,159
was at least to me um releasing

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,240
a new website for the project and also a

00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:25,919
new slogan

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,760
and so the slogan that after some hard

00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,480
conversations with the community

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,279
that we uh eventually came up with was

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,919
this

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:36,000
um a programming language empowering

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:40,480
everyone to build reliable

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,919
and efficient software uh and

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,520
so this was not something that i had

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,200
originally chosen um

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,720
though i had originally included the

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,640
language of uh

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,039
empowering everyone and that's the part

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,400
that i really think is by far the most

00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,320
interesting

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,799
but also the most critical as we think

00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,840
about the type of impact that rust wants

00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:01,000
to have

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:04,400
so what do we mean when we say

00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,760
empowering and empowering everyone

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,760
so russ wants to be empowering uh i

00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,200
think this is really central to a lot of

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,279
the reasons why people like

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,200
working on rust i also think that the

00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:17,679
concept of empowerment is central to

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,799
a lot of rus ability to be incredibly

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,919
successful

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:25,360
uh but i think the term

00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:27,279
empowering hides within it a lot of

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,480
interesting and like really poignant

00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:31,200
complexity

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,039
so it's not a talk right if we don't

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,720
like look something up in the dictionary

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,760
and we're gonna do that for a while in

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,039
this section

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,520
um but the term in power uh here is a

00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,399
verb

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,320
meaning to give someone the authority or

00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,600
power to do something and

00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,120
i don't think that that should blow

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,000
anyone's mind but something that i think

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,159
is really critical

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,919
in here is that at the center of the

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:55,279
word empowering

00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:56,240
is the word power and power is a really

00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:59,919
really interesting

00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:02,320
and really important concept so

00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,159
here what i've done is kind of an

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,720
inverse lookup but i've looked up the

00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,520
term

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,120
politics which now people might be going

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,640
ashley what are you doing

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,399
this is a talk about programming

00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,520
languages and now you're bringing

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,000
politics in it

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,799
don't be that person but what i want to

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,960
say is

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,320
by bringing up our slogan that we seek

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,080
to empower everyone

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,679
i've actually already we've already

00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,399
brought politics into it

00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,840
because what is politics so the first

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,080
half of this definition says

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,159
activities associated with governance of

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,720
a country and so that's probably what

00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,399
most people think of the term politics

00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,720
when they originally think of it

00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:40,399
but i think this second portion is the

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,200
part that is significantly more

00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,919
interesting

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,559
so here it says especially the debate or

00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:51,360
conflict among individuals or parties

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:54,320
having or hoping to achieve power

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,279
and if you recall we have this key word

00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,320
empowering

00:28:55,279 --> 00:29:01,039
inside of our slogan so

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,840
the idea of politics which i would just

00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,440
define as

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:08,480
systems of power right because rust

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:11,679
seeks to be empowering we are

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:15,360
already seeking to be political

00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:17,919
right rust wants to be political

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,600
and this may be a controversial thing to

00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,520
say i could imagine that there are

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,320
people who are frustrated by this

00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,919
but at the end of the day i think it is

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,760
by far one of the most core and

00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,840
foundational concepts in rust

00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,840
to the point where it's not just that we

00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,880
want to be political it's

00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:37,039
that we always have been political

00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,240
um and that's something that we think is

00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:41,919
really important

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,320
now this also isn't terribly surprising

00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,799
right

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,080
it's true that ex rust is trying to be

00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:50,080
explicitly

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:52,840
political but all technology

00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:55,039
is political because technology

00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,760
fundamentally gives

00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:59,279
certain sets of people power and the

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,120
ability to achieve

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:03,120
all sorts of things the way we've seen

00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,520
software completely changing

00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,360
our society and our world right so

00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:10,399
technology is political

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,000
whether it wants to be or not um and i

00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:15,600
think it's great that rust

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,080
really wants to explicitly be political

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,360
uh howard zinn and i think many other

00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,000
people have said something to this

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,840
effect

00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,919
have kind of said you know you can't

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:26,960
stand still on a moving train

00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:29,600
right technology is political so we can

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,960
we can choose to say oh russ it's just a

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,679
programming language it can't be

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,080
political

00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,279
or we can embrace that and and try and

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,440
do our best to be

00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:41,120
as deliberate and focused on our

00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:43,760
political aspects as we possibly can

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,760
so what i think what i think about our

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,640
slogan of russ wanting to

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,480
empower everyone to empower people is

00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,640
that our fundamental relation

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,320
to power is that we're really interested

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,519
in redistributing it

00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:00,640
which is an incredibly you know

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,919
powerful idea no pun intended right so

00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,559
what does this mean

00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,120
so we've talked about how the rust

00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:08,240
project

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,399
focuses its values on people

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,679
and i don't think that many people would

00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,720
think that that is terribly

00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,960
controversial

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,760
but i think it starts getting really

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,240
interesting

00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,880
when we acknowledge that well we want to

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,760
help

00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,159
everyone and we want to empower everyone

00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,960
at

00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,480
some point when we think about things we

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,360
need to choose

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,360
certain people and so while in our

00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,279
previous conversations we've referenced

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,880
the idea that there's false dichotomies

00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,080
that like a seepless plus developer and

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,159
a ruby developer

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,559
still aren't really all that different

00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,720
and i genuinely believe that to be true

00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:44,399
i think that that can be true while at

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,200
the same time acknowledging

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:48,159
that as we seek to be a project with

00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,679
impact

00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:53,200
uh we cannot be everything to everyone

00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,600
and so we have to make

00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,120
choices about the types of people we

00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,480
focus and center on

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,600
in the project so in the rest 2018

00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,720
keynote i made this

00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:07,120
captain power uh captain planet

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,559
uh captain planet slide where i talked

00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,399
about all the different audiences that

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,760
we see in the rust community you know we

00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:13,679
have like the rust rust

00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,039
die-hards that have always been rust

00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,880
always forever

00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:18,960
we've got folks from academia we've got

00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,600
folks coming from lower level languages

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,000
like c

00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,000
people's plus assembly we've got some

00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,320
higher level scripting language people

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
javascript python ruby we've got people

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,480
who have never programmed before

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,440
who come to rust wanting to be

00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,799
programmers so

00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,880
brand new folks and this is part of the

00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:37,200
like really vibrant diversity that i

00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,120
think

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,960
makes rust really really amazing um

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,200
but we cannot all these different

00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,279
audiences have very different needs

00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,320
they are very very different types of

00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,480
people and

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,159
we want to embrace all of them at the

00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,440
same time but focusing on

00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:57,679
all of their needs equally at all times

00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,880
is not something that any project is

00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,399
capable of doing

00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,880
and it makes it incredibly hard to focus

00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:06,320
and so we've heard this slogan right

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,120
like a rising tide

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,559
lifts all ships uh and what's

00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,640
interesting about this i looked up this

00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,000
wikipedia page for this slogan y'all

00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:17,200
should check it out because

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,519
it's not nearly maybe what i think the

00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,960
rust ideology has kind of adopted this

00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,279
slogan to mean

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,760
um but in here there's like a hidden

00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,440
judgment right i think and the judgment

00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,600
is is something that i think we can all

00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,960
agree on which is so we say a rising

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,440
tide lifts all ships

00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,480
the judgment here is that a rising tide

00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,600
should

00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,440
lift all ships uh and that's something

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,559
that we'd really want to be the case but

00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,600
now this is an

00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:45,279
aspirational slogan right and then if we

00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,760
really think about it we say a rising

00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:49,120
tide

00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,240
should lift all ships you know it often

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,720
does it

00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,159
um and that's something that we don't

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,480
think is acceptable right

00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,399
like we think that a rising tide should

00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,960
lift all ships

00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:02,960
so as i said before focusing on the

00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,000
needs of everyone all at once can be

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,840
incredibly difficult

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,679
and i think for a project that's largely

00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:10,480
built of volunteers

00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:12,159
uh our focus and our attention is by far

00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,760
our greatest resource and it's certainly

00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,639
the resource from which we can derive

00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,520
the absolute

00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,159
most value uh and so the real question

00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,359
here

00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,159
is as we focus ourselves on people as a

00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,520
project that

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:27,760
values like the humanity of technology

00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:30,079
like what should we focus on where

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,240
should our focus be

00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,919
and so what we've settled on is we

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,359
really genuinely believe that we should

00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:39,200
center on people who

00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:41,520
have the most need so

00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,599
these are people who you know have the

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,119
least amount of resources

00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:47,599
um the least amount of ability to help

00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,240
themselves uh we think that those are

00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,639
the folks

00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,159
who need the most help and as a result

00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,040
are the ones who deserve

00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:57,280
our focus um and the awesome thing about

00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,000
this that we've heard from nico is that

00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,440
when we focus and center on the people

00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,440
with the most need

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,480
the things that we're able to produce

00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,200
actually end up

00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,119
helping everybody sometimes in really

00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,119
surprising ways

00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,320
but at the core of this this is our

00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,160
political choice

00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,160
that we want to center the folks with

00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,560
the most need

00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,280
so as we look at this slogan a language

00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,359
empowering

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,119
everyone to build reliable and efficient

00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,000
software i don't want you to think that

00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,800
we've thrown this

00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,760
everyone out however i think that this

00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:32,560
is true but there's a core of it that is

00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,240
truer which is we are a language

00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:37,119
empowering everyone

00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,440
but especially folks who didn't think

00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,160
that

00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,160
systems programming was for them there

00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,920
was a big argument about whether or not

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,599
we should include the term systems

00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,079
programming in our slogan

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,359
and we ended up taking it out largely

00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,400
because it's been such a

00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:54,240
gatekeeping term it's kept people away

00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,839
because so many people self-identify as

00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,640
someone who could never be a systems

00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,800
programmer

00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,839
and while it's not in our slogan because

00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,680
that sentiment

00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,960
around the gatekeeper-ness of the idea

00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,079
of systems programming

00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,640
is a hundred percent true at the core we

00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,960
still

00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,880
want to take that concept of systems

00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,520
programming and break it free from that

00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,119
sense

00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:16,160
because we want it to become something

00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:18,800
that is accessible to everyone

00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,920
and in that sense we're trying to

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,320
redistribute

00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,079
the power of systems programming and

00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,200
that redistribution

00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:29,839
is our impact and it is fundamentally

00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:32,480
political whether or not you find that

00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:34,240
distasteful um and it's something that i

00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,760
think the rust project is incredibly

00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,280
excited about

00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,880
and so we've done a lot of really

00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,000
interesting things there's things where

00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,079
we've been able to see this

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,560
today so this is rebecca rebecca is one

00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:47,200
of his speakers today here at ruskoff

00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,079
um and she had tweeted that it kind of

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,480
owns that

00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,760
more than 50 of the ruscom speakers are

00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,400
trans this year

00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,040
and i gotta say like that is so freaking

00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,119
cool

00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,240
i have never been to a conference where

00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,440
that is true

00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:03,359
and i am really proud that that

00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,040
conference that i get to experience that

00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,880
at is rustcoff and i

00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,720
i also don't think it's a coincidence i

00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,440
do not think it's by mistake

00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,000
uh and it's really really exciting to me

00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,400
but

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,400
simply because we have wins like this

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,960
like doesn't mean that we can just like

00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,920
fly

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,760
the mission accomplished flag right we

00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,880
have done some amazing things

00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:27,359
but there's so much more

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,680
that the rust project wants to do if we

00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:32,400
really want to achieve that ambition

00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,520
of redistributing the power of systems

00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,040
programming

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:39,839
um we we've got a lot of work to do

00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,040
right and if there's anything you hear

00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:44,240
from me today

00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:46,240
it's that rust has some pretty amazing

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,400
ambitions and these ambitions are what

00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:51,680
motivate me to work on rust

00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,599
uh and that's awesome but

00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,880
but our ambitions right now are

00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:58,240
currently greater

00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,000
than our capacity we we've got dreams of

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,839
doing some pretty big things

00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,240
but we want to do them right and doing

00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:07,520
them right means that we need to

00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:09,680
create more capacity for ourselves to be

00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:12,000
able to achieve those goals

00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,960
um i was talking with my friend jenn

00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,720
schiffer recently

00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,119
and we were talking about these concepts

00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,440
of accountability and aspiration

00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,720
i think i've covered pretty seriously

00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,720
that we have

00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,720
some pretty huge aspirations here at the

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,480
rust project

00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,400
but what we really need now is

00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,440
accountability and i think that

00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,680
we know what we want to do and

00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,359
we now need to build the organization

00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,079
that's going to get us there

00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:39,359
and to do that we're going to need all

00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:42,480
of your help

00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:44,240
so it's time for us to grow and

00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,240
everybody who's in this audience today

00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:49,200
who's watching this at home

00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,680
uh we we really need you to get involved

00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,599
and so

00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,440
if these ambitions and these aspirations

00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:56,240
that i've shared about uh

00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,160
haven't scared you have excited you uh

00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:01,440
describe a future that you want

00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,160
uh we we need you to come help us get

00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,320
that done

00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,480
and uh here's nick who's gonna tell you

00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,480
a little bit more about how to do that

00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,079
so we've got to grow to achieve the

00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,280
things we want to achieve

00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:14,480
but we've got to grow sustainably you've

00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,960
probably all seen

00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,560
that rust for the fifth year running was

00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,359
the most loved programming language

00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,400
according to

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:24,480
the stack overflow survey

00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,520
i want to look back in another five

00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,240
years

00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,839
and see us getting that spot you know

00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,760
for the 10th year running

00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:32,880
and i want to look back and see rust

00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,760
getting better and

00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,480
better i don't want to look back and

00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,000
think

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,040
well that was a project with amazing

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,440
potential

00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,560
and it's such a shame that it burnt

00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,200
itself out

00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,240
so how are we going to achieve that

00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:57,839
there's a well-known

00:39:48,240 --> 00:40:01,520
proverb in new zealand

00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:02,640
and it means what is the most important

00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,680
thing in the world

00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:09,599
the people the people the people

00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:11,040
this holds i think for every project and

00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:14,240
every organization

00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:16,480
very much including rust we

00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:20,079
we have to look after our people in

00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:22,319
order to have a sustainable project

00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,160
so how can we look after each other

00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,760
let's start by

00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,359
having a look at some of the concrete

00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,640
things we're going to be doing over the

00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:32,560
next year or so

00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,560
with this goal in mind

00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,480
the first thing i want to talk about is

00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,839
the 2021 edition

00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,839
and for some of you who were part of the

00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:44,000
2018 edition then this might

00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:46,720
seem like the absolute opposite of

00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:50,400
looking after each other

00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,960
if you look at uh rfc 2966 and the way

00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,280
that

00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,800
lays out how we'd like to to run the

00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,880
2021 edition

00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:00,000
the idea is that we're going to have

00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:03,520
additions on a regular cadence

00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,200
much like our six weekly releases that

00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,800
ride their trains the addition are going

00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,440
to ride their own trends it's just going

00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:11,839
to take three years to come

00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:14,079
so that means that there should be no

00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:16,880
high pressure deadlines

00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:17,440
to to get stuff finished for for the

00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,280
addition

00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:22,640
and hopefully that will make it a much

00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:25,920
less stressful experience

00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:28,800
we are intending to continue

00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,880
to improve our governance and

00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,560
organizational structures

00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,480
and now's a good time we'd like to say

00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,960
thank you to the governance working

00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,079
group

00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,599
they've been active for the last year

00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,480
roughly and they've done some really

00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:42,720
great work

00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,760
uh looking into the the various

00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:47,040
governance

00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:49,839
structures that we have and ways that we

00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,839
could make them better

00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,760
we're also gonna we're also actively

00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,440
exploring

00:41:53,760 --> 00:42:01,280
starting a rust foundation the primary

00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:03,280
motivation for that is financial and

00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,560
that's an important part of looking

00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,640
after each other in

00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:09,520
the capitalist societies in which we

00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,880
live we we talked about rfc as earlier

00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:14,400
in this talk

00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:17,119
and rfc is a really important way that

00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,000
we we keep the the evolution of rust

00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,119
open

00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,480
but they can also be uh

00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:26,800
hard work uh we're we're looking

00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:30,800
at a whole bunch of ways that we can

00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:32,480
improve the the rfc process the compiler

00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:36,079
and language teams are experimenting

00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,079
with some of those changes already

00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:41,920
we are trying to make what the core team

00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,560
does more transparent

00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,920
now some of the work that we do

00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,640
necessarily has to

00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,520
remain private but a lot of it doesn't

00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,079
and

00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:54,960
we have a large part of our weekly

00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:58,640
meetings of public

00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:01,599
pietro announced back in july that we're

00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:03,520
experimenting other way to open up the

00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:04,000
the public part of the core team agenda

00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,960
for

00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,240
so that everyone can follow i also want

00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,880
to go over

00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:14,480
some of the concrete ways we hope to

00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:16,560
continue to empower our users

00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,640
on the language side of things we're

00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,920
going to continue to focus on ergonomics

00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,560
and on usability

00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:25,119
and i think the development of async

00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:28,319
await is a great example of that

00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:30,079
async programming is difficult but

00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:31,520
async and weight certainly makes that

00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:33,280
much easier and

00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,960
as we go forward hopefully we're going

00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,520
to have uh

00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:41,760
to make it easier still and to have a

00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:44,720
more complete solution

00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,480
cargo clippy is a great tool it's really

00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,800
helpful for beginners to learn

00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,520
what idiomatic rust looks like and it

00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,760
can be

00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,280
useful even for experienced users to

00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,480
avoid some of the

00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,480
possible foot guns

00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:02,880
cargo clippy is

00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,560
getting a fix feature so that it can

00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,560
actually fix your code

00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:12,000
as well as just tell you what's wrong

00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:15,119
ide support is uh really important

00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,920
in to to rust it's

00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,720
something that is asked for or for

00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:22,319
better support

00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:23,760
every year in our surveys and i think

00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:27,280
again like as a

00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:30,160
learning tool and as a tool

00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,160
for improving the effectiveness of

00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,720
programmers id support is a really

00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,720
empowering

00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:39,599
technology

00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:43,119
analyzer is an alternate ide back end

00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:46,560
that is not based on the rust compiler

00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:50,000
and it's because it's purpose-built it's

00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:52,800
uh faster and more responsive than

00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,800
the rls

00:44:53,760 --> 00:45:00,079
and rfc 2912 lays out

00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:00,560
the the path for making rust analyzer

00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:05,599
the

00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:08,800
the default for um for rust ide support

00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:10,400
and uh rust analyzer is available right

00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:13,599
now on rust up and

00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:19,520
the the vs code plugin supports

00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:22,240
both the rls and rust analyzer

00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:25,119
we want to empower users to become

00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:28,160
contributors to the rust project

00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,640
and the rust forge and the rusty dev

00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,839
guide

00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:34,800
are two great resources that

00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:36,640
have been really developed over the last

00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,760
year or so

00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:42,560
for exactly that purpose

00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,280
the infra team have also done great work

00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:47,359
to make

00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:49,520
our infrastructure easier to contribute

00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:51,680
to

00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:53,200
it's hard to think of anything more

00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,240
important for

00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:59,359
building a sustainable community than

00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:02,240
safe inclusive spaces

00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:03,200
and i'd like to say thank you to the mod

00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,359
team at this point

00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,119
because they're a big part of that and

00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:10,000
they do a really difficult job

00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:10,000
so thank you

00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,319
as far as maintaining our inclusive

00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:17,119
spaces i think that

00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:17,839
the rust project started uh really

00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:22,319
strong

00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:25,599
we've had moderation a code of conduct

00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:27,599
and then an official mod team from very

00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:31,040
early on

00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:31,040
as the community's got bigger

00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:34,400
maintaining these spaces has become

00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,640
harder

00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,640
and

00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:43,359
a lot of the work that the core team

00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,240
has been doing but we can't really talk

00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,839
about in public

00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:48,319
has been dealing with a lot of these

00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:51,440
issues and i think that

00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,920
um the work we've done over the last

00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,720
year

00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,599
should uh help us much more effectively

00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,760
to

00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:00,000
maintain the inclusive spaces we have

00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:02,000
going forward

00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,079
we believe that having a diverse

00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
community is really important

00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:07,440
and to be honest this is somewhere where

00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
we haven't done as well

00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,520
as we would have liked there have been

00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,920
some

00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:15,119
good bits some highlights uh rustbridge

00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,240
increasing

00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:21,599
reach just to name a couple but

00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:23,359
overall this is not somewhere i think

00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:26,400
that we've excelled

00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:29,920
we need to do better and we will uh

00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:32,079
over the the coming uh year and

00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,920
into the future we're gonna make uh

00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:35,040
building a diverse community one of the

00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:39,119
highest priorities

00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:42,480
for the rust project

00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:45,119
so that all reflects our strategy but

00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,160
um culture eats strategy for breakfast

00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,720
apparently

00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:50,839
let's have a look at how we'd like the

00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:53,119
the culture of the rust community to

00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:55,599
look

00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,800
first of all uh please look after

00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:00,079
yourselves

00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:03,200
uh it's tough times around the world for

00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:06,480
in lots of different ways

00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,440
and for different people don't let

00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,640
yourself get

00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:14,319
burnt out that added stress is

00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:17,839
makes burning out so much easier

00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:18,240
uh if if it's helpful for you to do less

00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:21,520
work

00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:22,480
please do do less work be kind to

00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,920
yourself

00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:28,480
we we don't

00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,440
kind of need heroes to to be a

00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,119
sustainable

00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:35,359
project but we do need people who are

00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:39,760
going to be around for the long term

00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:39,760
and please look after each other

00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:44,000
again in when times are tough we just

00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,440
need to

00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,119
treat each other with a little bit more

00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:53,040
kindness than usual

00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:57,680
a really important part of uh of that

00:48:53,040 --> 00:49:00,880
is mentoring and community building

00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:02,079
it's really essential work to to do if

00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,240
we're going to have a

00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:06,800
sustainable project and a sustainable

00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,800
community

00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:10,880
and i think rust really does have one of

00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:14,000
the best

00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:16,960
tech communities around

00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,040
but we can always do better and as it

00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,160
grows we've got to keep doing this work

00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,079
in order to

00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,960
to keep it good and to keep it getting

00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:27,119
better i just want to shout out to the

00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,920
awesome rust mentors

00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:31,119
website which was put together by jane

00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:34,160
lusby

00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:37,200
this is a great website

00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:40,880
which simply connects mentors with

00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:44,720
with mentees to to help facilitate

00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:47,200
mentoring we talk about empathy

00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,800
in the rust project probably more than

00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,720
than most

00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,839
tech projects do but i think it's really

00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:55,280
important

00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:57,920
um empathy is how you

00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,359
understand the needs of another group

00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:03,920
and

00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:07,119
being empathic to our users is how we've

00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,760
developed the language into being a good

00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:12,160
language

00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:13,040
frankly and being empathic towards each

00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:16,640
other

00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:19,280
is really important for

00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,079
having productive and enjoyable

00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,599
discussion

00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:23,599
rather than uh

00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:32,640
horrible stressful uh arguments online

00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:35,680
i think uh to prioritize empathy

00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:38,480
is a a great ask to

00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,480
to finish on

00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,319
that's all from us uh i hope you

00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,559
recognize

00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:45,440
uh the community you're you're part of

00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:48,079
in this talk

00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:50,480
and hopefully it's something to to think

00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:52,839
about about how we can keep it awesome

00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:55,680
uh as we grow and as the language

00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:58,000
matures

00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:00,079
we'd like to finish by saying some thank

00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,160
yous

00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:03,680
we'd like to thank the ruskconf

00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:11,680
