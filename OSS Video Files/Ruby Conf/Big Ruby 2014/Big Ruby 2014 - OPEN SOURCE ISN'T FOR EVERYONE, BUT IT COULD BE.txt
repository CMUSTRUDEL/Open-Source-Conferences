Title: Big Ruby 2014 - OPEN SOURCE ISN'T FOR EVERYONE, BUT IT COULD BE
Publication date: 2020-01-24
Playlist: Big Ruby 2014
Description: 
	By Ashe Dryden

The state of diversity in open source contributions is abysmal. With the number of female OSS contributors at a shockingly low 1.5% and other groups not even documented, we need to ask what we can be doing better as a community. We'll discuss the barriers that people face contributing to our open source projects and what we can do to increase participation.

so sorry I just got sick like last night

00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,980
this morning so if there's a lot of

00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:33,440
coughing or excessive water drinking

00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:35,840
that is why so um my name is ash I'm a

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,020
programmer most people here probably

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,600
know me because of my diversity advocacy

00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,590
work that I do in the Ruby community but

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,050
I've been a programmer for about the

00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:47,420
past 13 years 11 of that has been in

00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:50,420
open source communities for the past

00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:53,300
four or five years I've been pretty

00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:55,430
solidly planted in the Ruby community so

00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,719
a lot of my work kind of revolves around

00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,309
what we can do better is a ruby

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,949
community what I've learned from other

00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:02,629
communities and kind of the good stuff

00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:05,390
that we have well we can export other

00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:07,400
places so I'm a stride and pretty much

00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,190
everywhere on the internet feel free to

00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,650
ask me questions later if you like so

00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:14,450
I'm very lucky that the internet is

00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:16,070
actually my employer which is a really

00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:18,050
weird thing to say like a bunch of

00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:20,180
anonymous strangers I saw people way so

00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:23,780
thank you a bunch of anonymous strangers

00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:25,189
basically pay my salary to be able to go

00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,479
and do this stuff and one of the

00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:27,799
companies has kind of stepped up to

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,439
sponsor a lot of fun worth the series

00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:32,390
fendi works it's a rails and Ruby

00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:34,130
consultancy in Madison and they gave me

00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:36,140
a bunch of these cute little software

00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:39,110
craftsmanship notebooks so come and talk

00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:42,560
to me later and I'll give you some so

00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:44,840
the reason that I do this i really like

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,430
solving hard problems that's probably

00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,439
the reason that i became a programmer in

00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:50,360
the first place and after being a

00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:52,490
programmer for so long i can tell you

00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,770
that the hardest problem are always the

00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:56,180
people problems it's the problems that

00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,280
people bring when they write software

00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,630
the problems that people bring when

00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,090
they're trying to work together to write

00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:06,619
software so a lot of my work lately is

00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:10,070
focused on this so why do I do this well

00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:12,260
I love open source software I love that

00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:14,690
the ability for anybody to kind of come

00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:16,190
in and make something amazing and be

00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,900
able to have it shared with a lot of

00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:20,570
other people I love that we can

00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,610
collaborate around the world on a tiny

00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:24,019
bit of code and that's really cool now

00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,910
something a lot of other people and

00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:27,890
other professions get to kind of have

00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,660
their hands in but

00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,370
also believe that the software rewrite

00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,470
today is a reflection of the people who

00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,510
wrote it so the more different kinds of

00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:37,730
people we have involved the better our

00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:39,650
software will be so I my work

00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:42,560
specifically focuses at getting more

00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:44,240
different kinds of people to be coming

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,680
to our events to be working at our

00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,640
companies and to be contributing to our

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:52,250
software so what is open-source look

00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,890
like now well unfortunately it's largely

00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,980
homogeneous the vast majority of the

00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:59,569
people that contribute to open source

00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:02,959
look very the same they come from very

00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:04,070
similar backgrounds and something that

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,050
we have to keep in mind when we're

00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:08,239
writing things is that we're not the

00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:10,700
only ones using our software there are a

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,170
lot of experts that are coming to the

00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,080
table and you know picking up our stuff

00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:16,940
using it but it's also governments that

00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,420
are picking up you know new things it's

00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:22,940
cools its students who are brand new to

00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,709
writing software you're using software

00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,640
that are picking our stuff up too so we

00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:29,090
have to keep that in mind while we're

00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:31,130
writing it so like I said the community

00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:33,470
is very homogenous if we look at

00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:36,110
specifically the contributors to open

00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:38,450
source only 1.5 for son of all of them

00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:40,760
are women it's an extremely low number

00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:43,970
considering about twenty to twenty four

00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:46,190
percent of our community is women so we

00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:48,170
should expect to see at least 10 x 10

00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:50,329
times this number for the people that

00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:52,430
are contributing to our software now as

00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:55,010
far as other marginalized groups go

00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,260
people of color LGBTQ people people who

00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:59,000
don't speak english as a first language

00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:02,150
people with different disabilities we

00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,130
have no idea we the groups are small

00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:08,170
enough and unfortunately the funding is

00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:10,700
so specific to women that we just don't

00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:12,290
write down any of these other attributes

00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,360
we're not pulling people to figure out

00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:17,570
you know what the representation is like

00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,729
for these other groups so why is it so

00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,140
low there are a lot of different factors

00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:22,700
that contribute to this and I'm just

00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:25,430
going to kind of glanced over them

00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,960
briefly I do have a blog post that I

00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,370
have in the resources that you can check

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,430
out if you want to dig a little bit more

00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:33,229
into each of these things so the first

00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,430
one is time and this is probably the

00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:35,660
hardest one because it's not something

00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:37,789
that we can give other people or

00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:41,240
something that we can help other people

00:04:37,789 --> 00:04:41,520
create we have a lot of people that are

00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,319
in

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,090
marginalized communities that have far

00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:47,340
less time to contribute to open source

00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:50,009
software when they go home they're far

00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:52,110
more likely to be doing other kinds of

00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:54,150
unpaid labors whether that's taking care

00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:57,330
of family members we're running errands

00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,979
dealing with medical concerns all of

00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,530
those things that keep them from being

00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:05,039
able to have the time to sit and write

00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:07,740
software we also have an issue of paying

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:10,139
equality and this one I think is one

00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,750
that most people are familiar with women

00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:15,060
that are in the software industry earn

00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:17,490
about 80% of what men do so that's a

00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,889
pretty big difference it's slightly less

00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:21,840
bad than the US average but it's not

00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:23,819
super great but if we add one other

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,889
attribute to that race we know that

00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:28,020
women of color make about fifty-five

00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:29,909
percent of what white men do so there's

00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,979
a very big difference in the amount of

00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:35,069
time and money people have when they

00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:37,770
have to work almost twice as hard they

00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:38,880
might have to have extra jobs or other

00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,409
ways that they're kind of cutting

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,270
corners to be able to make it on a much

00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:44,060
lower salary so like how many people

00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:47,509
would like a fifty percent raise today

00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:50,340
yep far fewer hands than I expected

00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:51,419
ahaha so that's the reality of a lot of

00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,039
people's lives and something we don't

00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:54,750
necessarily think about when we talk

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:58,020
about the people who contribute to open

00:05:54,750 --> 00:06:00,240
source additionally very few people are

00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:02,370
actually compensated for contributing to

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,190
open source well we do have a number of

00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:08,370
companies that have become very visible

00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:09,840
for either paying somebody full time to

00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,779
work on open source full time and that's

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,240
their whole job or giving them 4 hours

00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:16,740
or eight hours a week or a month to be

00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,889
able to do that that's great but those

00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:22,529
jobs are very few and far between as far

00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:24,479
as the industry as a whole goes those

00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:26,159
jobs are also a lot more prestigious

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,349
there at much larger companies that

00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:30,029
require a lot more background than other

00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:31,289
companies do so they're much harder to

00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:33,300
get to for people that are coming from

00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:35,009
marginalized backgrounds this means that

00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,779
people don't necessarily have the time

00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:39,599
at their jobs be able to contribute to

00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:41,880
open source this is a really great way

00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:43,710
to get people interested in contributing

00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,789
to open source feeling like it's

00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,930
something that's important to them is

00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:47,789
something like they could be proud of

00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:50,070
and that's something that they could

00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:52,139
take on with them to their next job or

00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:53,460
for the rest of their career so we need

00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:54,000
to have more people who are in these

00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,130
kinds of

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,640
more companies that are offering these

00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:01,830
kinds of things oh one more thing that I

00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,990
forgot to mention is that unfortunately

00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:06,090
because of the size of these companies

00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,170
and how prestigious a lot of these

00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,510
companies are they're also very

00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:11,550
homogenous so you look at a lot of these

00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:13,830
companies and the vast majority of the

00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:16,230
makeup there is a very homogenous group

00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:18,060
so even though those opportunities do

00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:21,960
exists they're not necessarily being

00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:25,800
evenly dispersed this is probably the

00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:28,500
most difficult one to talk about um we

00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,470
don't always treat people the best it's

00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,820
probably the nicest way to put it

00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:35,330
unfortunately we see a lot of things

00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:37,710
like people being outright dismissed or

00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:42,270
belittled in issue cues we see people

00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:43,470
being harassed in IRC so a lot of those

00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:45,330
things kind of contribute to an

00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:47,310
atmosphere where people feel like it's

00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:49,470
not safe for me to be here people don't

00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:51,540
want me here why is this something that

00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,070
I should spend my free time doing when

00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,270
I'm going to be treated this way so

00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:58,260
that's something else we have to keep in

00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:59,940
mind now this is a kind of a common

00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:02,669
reaction that I get from a lot of people

00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,990
that I talk to who I ask you know why

00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:06,330
aren't you contributing to open source

00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:07,950
mostly I fear the excessive spotlight

00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:10,140
for being a sole female programmer and a

00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:11,460
publicly available project and light of

00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,710
how women are treated on the internet

00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:16,020
this fear does not seem unreasonable so

00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:18,900
a lot of people are worried uh you know

00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,760
not only just that you know contributing

00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:23,250
to something new as scary showcasing

00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:25,140
your ignorance is scary working

00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:27,960
alongside people that you consider your

00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:29,250
software heroes scary but you also have

00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,830
to worry about the fact that people are

00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,789
going to treat you differently or

00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:35,669
potentially attack you because of the

00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:39,810
person that you are so that is an extra

00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:41,159
barrier to entry for a lot of people so

00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,630
what can we do about this how many

00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:45,390
people contribute to open source right

00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:48,020
now whether that's actually writing code

00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:50,880
testing things writing documentation

00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:52,860
running meetups raise your hands again

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,690
sorry more time okay so it's a good

00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,720
number so so a lot of these things kind

00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:59,400
of apply to everybody this all of these

00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,070
things can be worked on by basically

00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,830
anybody who has a job anybody who sits

00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:06,630
in a chair in this room anybody who

00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:09,720
enjoys going to conferences

00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:11,850
who contributes to open source in any

00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:17,040
kind of way or who just wants to see the

00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:18,450
movement grow so possibly the hardest

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,710
thing is that we have more and more

00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,330
people that are coming into open source

00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,920
all the time which is great but it's

00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:26,340
really hard to maintain a cohesive

00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:28,140
culture it's it's one thing to go to

00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,000
your local meetup and it's the same 15

00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,230
or 20 people who always show up and the

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,600
way that you treat each other is very

00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,760
respectful you kind of know what each

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,920
other's boundaries are you know what

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,940
their levels of expertise are you can

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,130
kind of gauge you know when they're

00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,750
asking a question what kind of answer

00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:45,000
they want when it comes to something

00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,380
like you know being online and so many

00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,450
new people coming in you can't

00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,370
necessarily know that additionally it's

00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:52,500
really hard to make sure that everybody

00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:54,000
is on the same page and kind of

00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,530
propagating the kind of culture that you

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,640
want to see in a project that you work

00:09:55,530 --> 00:10:01,230
on so the kinds of things that we can do

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,180
make it obvious that you want people to

00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:05,520
contribute this seems like a no-brainer

00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,900
and it seems like something that a lot

00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,760
of people would say well yeah of course

00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,320
I want people to contribute to my

00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,640
project why do I have to tell them that

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,190
I that's kind of why I put it up on

00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:16,140
github and its public but lot of people

00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,790
who haven't contributed before or

00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,680
haven't contributed to a project like

00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:22,140
yours don't necessarily know what you're

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,030
looking for one thing that I would

00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:26,400
recommend is having a contributor file

00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:28,380
put in there you know how how should you

00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,120
contribute what should we what should

00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,620
you be putting in when you are

00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,230
submitting an issue or when you're

00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,240
submitting a pull request start labeling

00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,920
the issues and your issue queue is being

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,870
beginner-friendly don't necessarily go

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,390
and fix all the easy things that seem

00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:44,490
inconsequential to you when that might

00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:47,040
be somebody's you know very first easy

00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:50,190
commit to a project kind of save those

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,300
things for other people if you can try

00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,700
and get beginner eyes on your

00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,410
documentation the best documentation

00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,810
that i have read has been written by

00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:58,650
people who are brand new to a project

00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:00,420
because they don't make assumptions

00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:02,100
about the person that's sitting you know

00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,720
at a chair trying to figure out how

00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,480
something works somebody who has

00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:09,060
absolutely no context so find out what

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,580
is hard about this you know is is this

00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:15,600
up to date what kinds of problems did

00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:17,730
you run into trying to do this so this

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,639
is a good example this is middle man's

00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:22,399
contribute

00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:23,930
kind of policy doc here so it showcases

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,670
a lot of different things you know what

00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:28,009
what we consider to be a contribution to

00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:29,720
our project most people think that if

00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:31,160
they haven't contributed before the only

00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,259
thing that they can contribute is code

00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,819
and I don't know the code base I'm not

00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:36,259
well versed with this project how could

00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:38,329
I possibly know enough to be able to

00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:40,459
contribute so lay out exactly what you

00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:44,209
need from people what you expect to see

00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:45,589
and how they can help make it easy for

00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:48,110
people I've seen a lot of other

00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:50,389
communities that offer office hours on

00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:53,000
IRC this is a time where basically you

00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:54,649
can come and ask me questions I won't

00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,079
make any assumptions about your

00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:59,689
knowledge you know ask me anything you

00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:01,250
want asked me to pair with you on an

00:11:59,689 --> 00:12:02,990
issue so you can kind of get better

00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:05,060
acquainted with how everything works

00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:06,290
they offer pairing which is something

00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,870
that actually I've seen the Ruby

00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:10,879
community do more than any other

00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:13,670
community you know if you have those

00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:15,649
beginner issues that are labeled write

00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:17,689
in the comments you know if you are new

00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:19,730
to this project and you want to work on

00:12:17,689 --> 00:12:21,740
this let me know I will pair with you

00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:23,209
because it kind of takes away some of

00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,560
the fear then oh you will walk me

00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:29,480
through it if i have questions you'll be

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:32,209
able to help me be vulnerable this is a

00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:34,459
tough one there was a time when all of

00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:36,350
us were new to the internet when all of

00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:39,019
us were new to software and it was scary

00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:41,509
we didn't know how people were going to

00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:43,100
react to when we asked questions if we

00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:45,829
tried to contribute something somebody

00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,120
might attack us or kind of berate us for

00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:48,439
the way that we wrote something the fact

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,750
that we didn't follow style guidelines

00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:53,509
which we didn't know existed so it's

00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:55,970
it's tough remind people that like hey I

00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:57,889
was in your shoes once it was scary for

00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:00,290
me I'm still intimidated I don't always

00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:01,730
know everything I think one of one of

00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,839
the coolest things that I've seen since

00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:04,910
I've been in the Ruby community are a

00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:06,500
lot of very high profile people that

00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,449
will pair with people and say you know I

00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,040
don't know the answer to this which

00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:11,660
right there that's really empowering wow

00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,309
this is somebody that I really respect

00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,449
and they don't know the answer all right

00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:17,870
well this kind of happens to everybody

00:13:14,449 --> 00:13:19,069
then so kind of put people in a place

00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,809
where they don't feel like you're going

00:13:19,069 --> 00:13:23,209
to treat them like they're dumb this is

00:13:20,809 --> 00:13:25,100
something that i found on twitter she

00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:26,329
says one of the nicest things anybody's

00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,589
ever done for me and open source

00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:30,620
software is to tell me that they're

00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:31,720
intimidated to so just let people know

00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,430
that you know you're

00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,139
that level you know you've been there

00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:37,209
you'll do what you can to help them

00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:38,620
which is hard when you know we already

00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:40,240
have a lot of other things on our plates

00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,129
we can't necessarily do that with every

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,540
single person but maybe refer them to

00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:48,629
somebody else who has little spare time

00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:51,550
or a little extra slack be patient I

00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:55,360
used to be in a open source community

00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:56,680
that had a support IRC Channel and it

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,269
was great with the exception of one

00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:02,319
thing that they thought was very helpful

00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:03,759
which was a question bot so basically

00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:05,500
the only thing i would do is somebody

00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,509
would come in and they would say can i

00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,579
ask a question and the bot would say

00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:12,189
don't ask about asking a question just

00:14:09,579 --> 00:14:14,199
ask the question that's the only thing

00:14:12,189 --> 00:14:18,100
the bot was there for which kind of made

00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:19,829
people feel like okay so I'm already on

00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,089
the defensive I've already you know

00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:24,519
offended somebody in some way this is

00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:26,259
very uncomfortable situation kind of

00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:28,930
meet people where they are this is kind

00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:30,850
of a weird thing as it is so try not to

00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:33,759
push them back when you're trying to

00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:35,500
help them I have a friend who

00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:37,120
contributes to a lot of different Ruby

00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,470
projects and one of the things that he

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,569
does is any time he doesn't recognize

00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:43,000
somebody his name in the issue queues

00:14:40,569 --> 00:14:45,069
before he responds to them he goes and

00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,360
checks their github profile and he's

00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:48,009
just trying to see what level of

00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,199
understanding do they have about this

00:14:48,009 --> 00:14:52,029
have they ever worked on this before are

00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:54,490
they new to reveal all together are they

00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:57,309
ardent a brand new programmer what kinds

00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:59,500
of responses are they expecting from a

00:14:57,309 --> 00:15:02,189
pull request from me do they want me to

00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:04,809
look at their style do they want me to

00:15:02,189 --> 00:15:06,430
nitpick everything that they do to kind

00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:08,410
of you know try and make their code as

00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,819
good as possible so they need me to walk

00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:13,569
them through how something works because

00:15:09,819 --> 00:15:16,480
they don't necessarily understand be

00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:17,860
helpful this seems like it should be one

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,529
of the main things that we think about

00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,610
as open source contributors

00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:22,930
unfortunately it's something that we're

00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,639
not super great at because we always

00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:25,779
think that we're being nice and helpful

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,110
who are not always being nice and

00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:30,850
helpful so a friend of mine said this

00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:32,319
even it's nice and smart people do on

00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:35,259
helpful things which is totally true

00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:36,819
we've all had somebody who comes in and

00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:38,439
asks us what we consider is a silly

00:15:36,819 --> 00:15:40,779
question a question that we've answered

00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:42,420
a hundred times it seems obvious to us

00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:44,459
you're wasting my time I've

00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:47,519
other things going on and you're just

00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:49,980
kind of adding to that pile so be

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,690
patient understand that people don't

00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,730
always know the answers and they're

00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:57,149
asking because they probably genuinely

00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:59,010
want to know make it safe for people

00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:01,769
this is something that's gotten a lot

00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:03,810
more traction lately a lot of projects

00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:05,459
are adding codes of conduct to their

00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:07,380
projects which if you're not familiar a

00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:09,149
code of conduct is basically a policy

00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:11,730
that says this is the kind of behavior

00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:13,709
we expect from you if you exhibit

00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:15,769
behavior other than this these are the

00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:18,120
kinds of things you can expect in return

00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:19,860
additionally if you have a problem with

00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,810
somebody these are the people you can

00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,240
contact and we will do what we can to

00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:25,620
help make the situation better so it's

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,980
important that everybody in a project

00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:31,980
especially the core team especially very

00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:33,839
common contributors know exactly what is

00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:36,449
in this code of conduct what's expected

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,430
of them but also that they're available

00:16:36,449 --> 00:16:41,070
so if somebody has a problem they can

00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:42,630
approach them and say okay I understand

00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,949
let me investigate this I'll get back to

00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:45,959
you I'm very sorry that that happened

00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:48,180
that's not the kind of atmosphere that

00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:49,529
we want to excuse me it's not the kind

00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:52,680
of atmosphere that we want to create

00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:54,560
here so make sure that all of that

00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,850
information is publicly available

00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:00,870
anybody who's contributing to your

00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:02,760
project knows a very easy way to do that

00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,930
is if they exhibit some kind of behavior

00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:06,299
that seemed like it seems like it's on

00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:07,829
the edge just kindly link them to the

00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:09,419
code of conduct you know this is this is

00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:13,459
what kind of what we expect from people

00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:15,990
that are in this community pay for it a

00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:17,850
lot of the open-source work that's being

00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:20,189
done right now is unpaid there are a lot

00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:21,900
of people who do it for fun a lot of

00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:24,299
people do it because they're giving back

00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:26,130
and they love it and I totally

00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:27,449
appreciate that but like I said before

00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:29,820
there are a lot of people who can't

00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:31,530
contribute because they don't have the

00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:34,260
luxury of time they're making far less

00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:36,179
money so not being paid for it is kind

00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,830
of a hindrance if you work at a company

00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:39,780
that pays people to contribute to

00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:41,460
open-source make sure that that's in

00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:43,140
your job description make sure that

00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,120
that's what gets posted to the world so

00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:47,549
people know when they're applying for

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,809
your jobs that that's a perk because it

00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:50,750
is it's something that you know you can

00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:55,409
take with you long after you've left

00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:56,140
make sure that that that people

00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:57,460
understand

00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,540
also what that means you know does that

00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,700
mean that does that mean that you're

00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:02,980
doing it full time all the time just a

00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,600
few hours other ways you can kind of

00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,790
contribute to this if you're not able to

00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,070
talk your company into giving people

00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:12,490
hours to do that is to sponsor a program

00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:14,530
that does that so rails girls summer of

00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:16,810
code for instance last year paid quite a

00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:19,300
few women to work on open source

00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:21,670
projects like bundler for three months

00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:23,140
during the summer so it gave them not

00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:25,660
only the time and the money to be able

00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:28,240
to do it but hook them up with mentors

00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:29,470
with project owners so they could kind

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,390
of get the feel for contributing to

00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:36,160
projects how what it's like to

00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:38,620
communicate with the community lastly

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,240
what you can do is volunteer has

00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:43,000
everybody heard of rails girls or

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,650
railsbridge most people okay so if

00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,350
you're not familiar it's a program that

00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:50,110
helps women and their friends get into

00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:51,940
Ruby and rails programming so that's

00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:54,190
something that you can do that costs you

00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:56,770
no money a lot of times they're paired

00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:59,410
up with conferences or their run from

00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:01,900
say inside of a ruby meetup that brings

00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:03,790
experts in to come and teach people a

00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:07,000
specific curriculum and you can

00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:09,010
volunteer to be a TA for that so that

00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,740
really helps also there's a program

00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:15,250
called open hatch which kind of works

00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:18,190
like that beginner tagging issue that I

00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:19,990
was talking about before it takes the

00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:22,060
issues that are open on open source

00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:23,650
projects and helps people work on them

00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,090
they've also started a program where

00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:26,590
they go around to universities and they

00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:28,120
teach people this is how you use get

00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,680
these are the different ways that you

00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,840
can contribute to open source projects

00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,430
you know here's where you go if you have

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,800
questions about documentation things you

00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:37,000
can work on so both of those are really

00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,130
great ways that you can help people

00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,580
locally otherwise they're always

00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:45,400
accepting donations so like I said

00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:47,350
before here's some resources the first

00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,970
one kind of dig a little bit deeper into

00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:50,620
what I talked about in the forefront the

00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:52,320
kind of issues that people have not

00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:56,470
being able to contribute to open source

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:58,270
the second one is the the contributor

00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:00,580
doc that I was talking about instilling

00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:01,870
in programs and then the last two are

00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:04,420
codes of conduct that have been

00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:06,190
implemented in open source projects the

00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,960
first one is a bundler code of conduct

00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:09,360
which I helped them and the second one

00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,250
is a contributor covenant

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,370
which coraline actually started who's

00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:17,220
here and I can't see her back there to

00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:19,260
basically be able to give open source

00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,809
projects a template that they can fork

00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,880
and pull into their project so they

00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:25,170
don't have to kind of do all the

00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,600
research and everything upfront she

00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:30,900
helps with that so that's all I've got

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:33,230
thank you very much all right thank you

00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,230
