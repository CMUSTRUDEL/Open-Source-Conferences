past time if you would say rightful

00:00:53,420 --> 00:01:00,530
extra time on big Ruby I'm an elixir

00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:04,340
language enthusiast right thank you and

00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:06,050
I'm kind of got a user group for elixir

00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:08,750
going and we'll get some more of that

00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:12,230

I love bacon so who here is awesome and

00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:16,250
by awesome I mean you go to user groups

we'll get everybody so why should you go

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,860
to a ruby user group well make a lot of

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,439
friends plenty of networking to be had

00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,110
plenty of learning to be done you can

00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:33,950
also do some teaching and as we all know

00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,210
when you're teaching you're also

00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,640
learning at the same time you're

00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,960
becoming really good at your craft a lot

00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,640
of times there's hack nights so you work

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,689
on code and coffee shops with other

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,100
people you can do speaking like this and

00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:47,659
don't be afraid to speak new developers

00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,750
are always welcome to come speak there's

00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:52,040
listeners at all skill levels and

00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:54,439
speeches can be short it can be five

00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,390
minutes and it turns out if you package

00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:58,840
up for lightning talks you can get to a

00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,840
conference

00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:06,590
there you go that's a that's krismo

00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:09,259

00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:22,130
up with cool new toys right the latest

00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,270
gems the latest vulnerabilities so

00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,860
here's some local user groups I know

00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:29,840
there's a lot of y'all from like not

00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:31,820
Texas sorry there's my favorite of

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,200
course Dallas Ruby group we meet every

00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,670
Tuesday presentations on the first

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,120
Tuesday heck nights other Tuesday's

00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:40,220
address stuff we're on freenode there's

00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,739
Ruby Fort Worth i'm totally jealous of

00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:46,190
their name they meet on the fourth

00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:48,140
Tuesday for presentations there's this

00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:50,870
obscure downtown Dallas Ruby on Rails

00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:53,000
group and yeah I wish they'd just come

00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,860
to Dallas roomy but they're on meetup

00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,430
they meet once a month sometimes usually

00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:01,130
on a Tuesday there's also some Ruby

00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:05,060
groups in Austin there's one for Ruby

00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:08,000
one for rails they meet on Tuesdays so

00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,950
spread the word bit ly / Ruby groups

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,329
should be easy to remember and I'll put

00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:14,090
the rest of this lightning talk on that

00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:17,150
blog soon so get everybody you know to

00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,950
to a ruby group we're nice people we're

00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:23,570
here to help and we'll make you better

00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:25,430
all right thanks Ben so my name is erin

00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,600
was saying I work for orgsync there's a

00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,190
number of us here you might have seen us

00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,829
walking around and I want to talk to you

00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:33,920
about interactions so I want to start by

00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:37,010
actually talking about hello there we go

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,480
um a controller and an action within a

00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:40,280
controller so when you first started

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,750
with rails you probably saw like I don't

00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,670
know a video about how to make a blog or

00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,989
something maybe you scaffolded something

00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,070
and it looked nice right it was pretty

00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:47,810
clean you could understand what was

00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:50,329
going on it was concise and you were

00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:53,090
pretty happy with what you had you

00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:54,590
wanted to then notify a new user you

00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:56,750
know you want to welcome then your app

00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:59,000
wanted to be friendly so you get some

00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,890
more people on and now you've got

00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,239
communities and you've got groups and

00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,709
communities have default groups and you

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,060
need to put the person into a default

00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:06,500
group when they join and then you need

00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,930
to notify the admin so that they know

00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,730
about it and what was kind of nice and

00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,950
clean has started to look a bit more

00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:14,270
like this it's still not

00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:17,090
rendus but it's more than you'd probably

00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:19,400
like to happen there and so you hire

00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,810
some more developers maybe a year goes

00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,690
by you reopen the thing and it's gone

00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:25,210
from this to like 500 lines and it

00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:28,730
you're kind of like this now right

00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:30,110
things have gotten bad so a lot of us

00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:32,090
had this and there was a rallying cry in

00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,290
the community skinny controllers and fat

00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,700
models we're going to take all that

00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:36,650
business logic and shove it down into

00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:41,300
the model because then MVC we decided

00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:44,330
that's where it belonged well we fought

00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:46,370
back we refactored we got there users

00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:49,250
can now join groups right they could

00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,570
send password reminders you know find

00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:54,320
other users start dating see other

00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:56,240
models that kind of thing and suddenly

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,190
we open that file a year later again and

00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,380
we had got objects we had 1500 line

00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:02,870
models everyone's had these in their

00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,430
code base at some point and the dis

00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,930
horrendous and we basically had the

00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,760
exact same problem and we yelled more

00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:11,090
models we're going to we're going to use

00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,680
the M in the MVC more the thing is I

00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:14,479
think rails has a tendency to point us

00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,030
toward nouns when we're thinking about

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,740
models and only nouns so we have

00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,330
persisted models we save them into the

00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,280
database and it took us a while to get

00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,570
our heads around not doing this even

00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,490
after blog posts like the kingdom of

00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:27,229
nouns we still do a lot of this kind of

00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,880
stuff and we sort of just take all of

00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:31,250
our actions and we drop them on these

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,430
nouns as kind of second-class citizens

00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:35,870
in our code but what we need to do is we

00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,460
need to upgrade these verbs we need to

00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:39,289
make them first-class citizens they

00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:41,139
deserve the life of their own we need a

00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:43,520
place for business logic to be held and

00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:45,620
not spread across five models where it's

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,560
hard to understand and hard to refactor

00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,270
and this is where interactions has come

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,979
in handy especially for us at orix think

00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,360
we've found these really helpful and the

00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:55,610
pattern is essentially to take your

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,550
business logic and encapsulate it push

00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:59,840
your models into it and it gives you a

00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:03,139
place to really kind of keep everything

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,370
together in a tight package so we tried

00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:05,690
a few different methods of going about

00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:09,530
this and we ended up writing our own gym

00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:11,870
and it's called active interaction so if

00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,979
we go for a user sign up I know this is

00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:16,130
a little small but we'll kind of go into

00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:17,330
it we can create this interaction for

00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:19,639
signing up a user where all of the

00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,660
logics contained solely within this

00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:22,550
interaction if you need to know about

00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,960
signing up the user this is where you go

00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,130
if you got to have multiple controllers

00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,460
where this happens for some reason

00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:30,110
they're all going to call this

00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:32,900
so when we call it it's just sign up

00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:34,910
user run and then whatever parameters we

00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,520
want to pass in run is the only option

00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,990
you get it's a very single

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,350
responsibility it's going to sign up the

00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:44,720
user that's all when you pass that in

00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:49,430
your parameters come in and we provide a

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,900
mechanism to essentially parts your

00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:52,880
parameters into what they should be and

00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,130
if they're not for instance a date right

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,840
if you try to pass in like a word where

00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:59,450
you should have a date it'll throw an

00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,700
error and yell at you about this you can

00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:03,889
have defaults including nil which makes

00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,479
it optional and we've added the ability

00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:07,220
to do things like make sure that your

00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:08,419
array coming in is all strings if you

00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,830
want or maybe you've got room

00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:12,260
preferences and within their there's

00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:15,919
keys on this hash that our boolean czar

00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:17,510
integers it'll cast those as well it

00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,280
also has validations we should look

00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,780
really really familiar because they're

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,680
active model validations there things

00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,810
we've all worked with and we're all

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,970
familiar with and once again if you do

00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,860
stuff like custom validations maybe

00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:30,410
you've got a password validator you can

00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:32,720
use that in there no problem if we get

00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:35,110
past all of the validations we call

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,910
execute you can kind of think of this as

00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:40,700
the initialize on a new newly

00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:42,530
constructed object same kind of deal so

00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:45,169
we come in here we go through what we

00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:46,850
need to do and all of our things all of

00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:50,030
our business logic is contained within

00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:52,610
the executes statement in this case we

00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:54,740
can actually build other interactions

00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:56,450
like joining a default group compose

00:07:54,740 --> 00:08:00,139
them in if they fail the errors get

00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:02,470
propagated up to the primary object so

00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:05,570
the call now looks something like this

00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:07,940
user signup run you get an outcome the

00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:09,950
outcome has errors has the valid

00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:12,080
predicate you can shove it in the forums

00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:14,410
it works with form tastic it works like

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,960
you would expect because it quacks like

00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:21,200
an active model it works in all the same

00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,150
ways so that code now starts to look

00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,530
more like this a lot closer to what we

00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:27,380
had to be getting a lot closer what we

00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:29,419
were happy with and a lot more simple to

00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:33,709
grok when you're trying to figure out

00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:36,080
what's going on so active interaction we

00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:38,360
get some controllers and slim models its

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,320
rails and forms ready and it gives you a

00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,310
really good place to encapsulate

00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,830
business logic

00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:44,900
so if that sounds good to you you can

00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:47,120
find it on github at OrgSync / active

00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,560
underscore interaction myself and Taylor

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,210
are the primary developers on this we're

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,010
both of the conference feel free to grab

00:08:50,210 --> 00:09:00,850
us and ask questions if you have any and

00:08:52,010 --> 00:09:02,900
thank you I thanks meeting y'all here um

00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,490
so I want to talk a little it real quick

00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:08,240
about the lone star ruby foundation

00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:13,670
right um little star ruby foundation is

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:19,580
a soon-to-be 501c3 organization that's

00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:21,890
dedicated to the guess overall health

00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:25,100
and well-being of the texas software

00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:27,620
development community right we started

00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:31,670
off doing mainly ruby events and movie

00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:37,390
functions we've helped organize the last

00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:39,700
two LS RCS but we want to do more right

00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:41,870
we're not doing an lsr see this year

00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:48,170
primarily because we want to kind of do

00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:50,920
other some other things right so no ll

00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:54,140
start see this year we want to do more

00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,220
small events other small events and

00:09:54,140 --> 00:10:01,960
we're looking for better ways to help

00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:06,080
out about the community um we we want to

00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:07,850
be a place where user groups can come

00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,740
and if they need sponsorships or if

00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,380
they're trying to attract speakers that

00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:14,450
we can help out with that right if

00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:16,430
conferences find themselves short on

00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:19,790
cash or they need a big sponsorship to

00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:22,130
help pay Con freaks for to come out or

00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,900
something like that we will Lone Star

00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:29,810
Derby Foundation wants to be that kind

00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:33,260
of organization right so we do

00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:37,880
sponsorships we do scholarships we we

00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:39,920
want we want things like lsrc to be not

00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,420
only an awesome thing right we're

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:47,620
dedicated to Texas as a whole not just

00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:51,680
often not as Central Texas right are our

00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,740
idea our view our vision for lsrc is to

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,720
be

00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:57,149
like Cascadia right where it kind of

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,380
moves around from year to year or two

00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:03,450
years to two years because we're going

00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:04,260
to have won again in 2015 right but we

00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,990
don't know what it's going to look like

00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:10,020
we want it we want it to be personalized

00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:11,779
right we wanted to showcase Texas as a

00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:15,060
whole right so if else are seized in

00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:16,800
dallas right it wanted to be in a place

00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,029
like this or something like this right

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,820
there's going to be in houston we wanted

00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:23,520
to showcase houston cider etc etc so if

00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:26,880
you have any ideas you know send us an

00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,170

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,089
reason I'm up here is because we've done

a really bad job up until now about

00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:34,350
talking about ourselves and and reaching

00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:36,060
out to the community and letting them

00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:37,980

00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:40,190
in the bank and we want to help right so

00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:43,589

but yes please feel free to send an

00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:47,940

and goals right we're committed like I

00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:55,560
said we're committed to helping out

00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,980
developers in any way we can write we're

00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:01,380
committed to encouraging diversity in

00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:02,700
the Texas developer landscape right we

00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,709
want to sponsor things like rails girls

00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,680
in railsbridge and events like that we

00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:11,130
want to get kids interested in software

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,329
development and maybe Ruby in particular

00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,950
but maybe not right whatever floats

00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:15,720
their boat you want to do a minecraft

00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,950
kind of school session thing that'd be

00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,950
super awesome we'd love to help with

00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:21,930
that so yeah send an email follow us on

or guess just need help that's it thanks

00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:34,200
all right now my name is jeremy and i

00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:36,779
work for Cal come on and around this

00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:39,810
time last year I got my first interview

00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:42,899
ever for web web deposition and hakama

00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:44,550
hired me on as an intern and about a

00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:48,300
month ago they actually made me

00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:50,540
full-time so that was a great a big step

00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,540
for me

00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:59,150
so um because of that I'm decided to

00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:03,300
come to a talk a little bit about it so

00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:05,640
so what is this about well it's kind of

00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:09,750
like my story about how I started from

00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:14,790
the bottom now me know really what is

00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:16,560
this about um well I the inspiration for

00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:19,110
me doing a talk basically started with a

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,810
question I was asking the day so I was

00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,220
sitting in on an interview with a

00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:26,460
candidate for an intern for this year

00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:28,050
and the guy asked me well you know how

00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:30,630
did you make the jump from intern to

00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:32,420
full time and I know that the

00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:36,710
translation of this question was really

00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:40,470
how can I make the jump from intern to

00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:44,130
full-time employee as well and my answer

00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:45,840
was kind of like that cuz I didn't

00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:48,000
really thought about I you know I

00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:51,570
basically just try my hardest and and

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,060
worked and eventually they like me so um

00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:57,540
but after spending a few days thinking

00:13:54,060 --> 00:14:00,570
about it I was able to come up with kind

00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:05,630
of what I did and and basically to

00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:09,900
answer that question I made the app or

00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:12,180
actually mean app so i basically came up

00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:14,550
with three things that I feel like or

00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:18,750
the real keys for me making the jump

00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:19,740
from intern to full-time employee and if

00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:23,640
you take the first letter of each word

00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:29,310
you get app so so each letter stands for

00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:30,840
something the first a is I mean the

00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:34,470
first letter is a and that stands for

00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:36,540
ask questions so cray low it's kinda

00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,920
like a mentor mine and you know I work

00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,750
with the Milan he's always you know

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,920
really telling me like you could have to

00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:43,860
ask questions you have to ask questions

00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:45,840
and you hear this a lot but sometimes it

00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:49,620
can be intimidating but it's really

00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:54,180
crucial in learning and taking the next

00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:55,350
step because and also one thing I've

00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:59,100
learned about asking questions is that

00:14:55,350 --> 00:15:00,570
it really is a skill and it's a and it's

00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,680
it's an art form really like and it's

00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,560
something that you can develop and get

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,350
good at

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,120
and you have to be able to ask the right

00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:09,390
questions and when you ask the right

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,040
questions you'll get the right answers

00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:14,470
and when you get the right answers look

00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,180
at the right strategy and when you get

00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,710
the right strategy you'll get the right

00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:21,220
results so it's important to ask

00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:25,950
questions and who you ask questions can

00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:30,610
look like this cool or really like this

00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:34,870
your boss precaution when you ask people

00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:36,820
who you work with because I know this

00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:39,700
very well sometimes it can be a little

00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:41,470
intimidating and you know at first the

00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:44,410
first time you asked a question okay you

00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:47,350
know good job asking questions second

00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:50,290
time has question or even better third

00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:52,040
time you asked question and then the

00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:56,420
fourth time

00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:58,490
now this mad so yes this this can be

00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:02,480
very intimidating but it is necessary

00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:04,040
for learning and and the reason why is

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,480
necessary is because when you don't ask

00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,690
questions you really don't know what

00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,970
you're doing you always risk the the

00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:14,600
possibility of that moment when you

00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:19,639
realize that all of the code that you

00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:22,009
wrote doesn't work and you just want to

00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:23,149
get away but you can and you realize

00:16:22,009 --> 00:16:27,860
well I should have just asked a question

00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:30,110
about this so the P in the app that I

00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:33,560
helped me was something I came up with

00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:35,990
called a pee dee dee and I know most of

00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:38,149
you probably heard of TDD test-driven

00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:40,490
development or BDD behavior driven

00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:43,610
development so I kind of came up with

00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:45,769
purpose driven development and it's

00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:48,759
basically like a software development

00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:51,860
process that I kind of require myself to

00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:53,690
answer three questions before I ever

00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:57,139
write a single line of code those

00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:58,610
questions are first deals with the

00:16:57,139 --> 00:17:01,639
intention of this code so what does my

00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:04,130
attention or my intentions in writing

00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:06,140
this code is it too am i creating

00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:09,500
something new am i adding to something

00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:11,390
is it to test is it to refactor just you

00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,730
know make more make my code cleaner and

00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:17,179
more readable so what is the intentions

00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:20,059
behind the code a second question what

00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:22,970
does the unmet need so I guess if you

00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:25,640
view code is simply like a means of

00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:28,100
addressing a problem well it's important

00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,750
to know what that problem is and I take

00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:32,929
that just a step further and say okay

00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:34,580
well if there's a problem well well

00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:37,309
where is that problem come from and I

00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:41,330
think really the root of any problem is

00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:45,470
there's an unmet need so what is the

00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:48,350
unmet need and then the third and last

00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:50,840
question for our PDD is what

00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:53,809
significance and you know really it's

00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,429
just like um kind of like you know is

00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:57,320
anybody really going to use this like is

00:17:55,429 --> 00:17:59,210
this significant like am I gonna get

00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,080
anything out of this like you know you

00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:02,330
don't want to waste your time doing

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,520
something that really has no

00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:05,380
significance so I thought that was

00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:09,220
important question

00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:13,330
as well and the last P in my app for

00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:14,980
making the jump is practice and I know

00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:16,660
we kind of know practice like this and

00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,970
it's just repetition doing it over and

00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:21,340
over and over again but I actually I

00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:23,800
really want to encourage for anybody

00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:26,460
who's new and really trying to like get

00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:29,290
better that you almost kind of have to

00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:31,720
practice / be obsessed with code and

00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:33,310
I've noticed this from the people that I

00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,950
admire the most or really great

00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:38,590
programmers that you know if not now at

00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:40,450
one point of time in their life they

00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:42,250
were obsessed with this and and it

00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,780
really kind of you know that's all I

00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:46,780
thought about that's what they really

00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:49,660
look forward to doing and it kind of

00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:51,820
made me think of this question well you

00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:53,800
know this balance versus unbalanced and

00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:56,440
I mean that as far as like your life you

00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,150
know typically we hear that you know all

00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:01,090
your life should have balance like you

00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:03,340
should you know kind of keep everything

00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:05,890
in in proportion and not too much of

00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:08,170
anything and obsession kind of has a bad

00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:10,480
connotation to it so I decided to do a

00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:14,740
comparison so here's balance of guy

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:16,270
that's me I'm kind of like scuba diving

00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:21,670
in South every well I'm actually just in

00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:23,680
front of a fish tank um so uh well so I

00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:25,960
take myself for example before I started

00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:28,450
working as a web developer I was a

00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:30,810
barista I was still I still consider

00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:34,360
myself a web developer rock climber

00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:35,950
basketball player traveler you know all

00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,800
these things I was kind of dabbling into

00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:40,570
and uh you know I considered myself you

00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:44,950
know an overall cool guy but in very

00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:48,070
balanced and then an unbalanced guy this

00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:50,470
is Peyton Manning and in this picture

00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:52,720
he's actually he hurt his ankle so as he

00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:54,550
was icing it to double task he was kind

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,310
of like whoa let me put my helmet on and

00:19:54,550 --> 00:20:00,460
listen to messages from the coach and

00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:04,060
also like look over game film this is

00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:05,800
unbalanced guy and you know we've all

00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:09,180
heard the same things of how people

00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:11,700
describe on about unbalanced guy or

00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:14,290
Peyton Manning know he's a workaholic

00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:18,270
his life is out of balance he's obsessed

00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:18,270
he needs some balance in his life

00:20:18,669 --> 00:20:24,519
but is it possible that just perhaps

00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:26,859
that uh unbalanced guy you know Peyton

00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:29,619
Manning who spends countless hours of

00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:31,389
looking over game hip game film and

00:20:29,619 --> 00:20:32,859
preparing for the game and you know

00:20:31,389 --> 00:20:34,029
every day just you know trying to get

00:20:32,859 --> 00:20:36,999
better trying to get better trying to

00:20:34,029 --> 00:20:40,769
get better is it possible that just may

00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:47,619
be unbalanced guy is just as happy as a

00:20:40,769 --> 00:20:49,720
balanced guy or even goal may be

00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:54,549
unbalanced guys even happier than

00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:58,690
balance guy so that's all that you

00:20:54,549 --> 00:21:01,629
decide that so yeah I'd say the the

00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:05,019
three keys from my making the jump from

00:21:01,629 --> 00:21:06,850
intern to FTE ask questions have a

00:21:05,019 --> 00:21:10,059
purpose in you know your development

00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:16,509
process and practice be obsessed with it

00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:19,239
that's it thank you and there we go okay

00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:21,129
so my name is Jeff Davis you can find me

00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:23,889
on the interwebs and github and

00:21:21,129 --> 00:21:26,230
everything else at penland 365 I work at

00:21:23,889 --> 00:21:28,359
sabor in the labs group mark is my

00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:30,220
direct boss so if you don't like what I

00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:34,600
have to say just blame him because he

00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:36,700
gave me the time off to be here so I was

00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,869
thinking that I wanted to give a talk I

00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,369
wasn't sure what it was going to do I

00:21:37,869 --> 00:21:41,619
wanted to stretch myself and do this and

00:21:39,369 --> 00:21:43,029
then the inspiration for this talk came

00:21:41,619 --> 00:21:44,919
yesterday morning when I was sitting in

00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:47,859
traffic and I learned about the passing

00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:49,059
of a gym why rich and I'm relatively new

00:21:47,859 --> 00:21:50,980
to the community and y'all have heard

00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:53,559
some very kind of touching tributes by

00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:55,210
people that have been at it longer and I

00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:57,700
was here last year is kind of my first

00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:59,200
I'm joining into the Ruby community and

00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,450
I went up and asked him what I thought

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,549
was a very noobish question in fact it

00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:06,609
was and he didn't treat it that way at

00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:09,460
all he gave a very thoughtful response

00:22:06,609 --> 00:22:11,080
he took his time he didn't rush me out

00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:13,269
of the group to go talk to somebody else

00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:16,450
that he'd known for 15 years I was very

00:22:13,269 --> 00:22:17,529
kind of honestly touched by that and I

00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:19,389
went home later and I would kind of

00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:22,029
looked him up and I came across a talk

00:22:19,389 --> 00:22:23,350
that I really really liked and I think

00:22:22,029 --> 00:22:26,169
many of y'all have seen before and

00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:27,669
that's called why not adventures in

00:22:26,169 --> 00:22:29,619
functional programming he gave that at

00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:31,100
Ruby cough at 2012 I'm be willing to bet

00:22:29,619 --> 00:22:34,280
there's people that probably saw

00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:36,320
live and as someone that kind of came to

00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,610
Ruby at a later date I have kind of

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,789
recently fallen back in love with

00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:42,679
functional programming I love Ruby but

00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:45,140
my kind of first love is more right now

00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:47,720
Scala and a little bit of closure and so

00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:50,210
this talk is very brief it's going to be

00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:52,850
three functional programming tools or

00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:54,650
three punk excuse me three functional

00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:56,330
programming words that the functional

00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:57,770
programming guys like to say a lot and

00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:00,500
like to be kind of honestly a little

00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:02,539
condescending about that's okay but all

00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,520
of these things actually exist in Ruby

00:23:02,539 --> 00:23:07,970
and that's what we're going to talk

00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:10,640
about real quick so the first is a

00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,870
closure I'm sure a lot of you I'll

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,280
probably heard this but go through this

00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:15,650
real quick if we have an array of numb

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,179
and we want to do it numbs not select we

00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:19,580
passed it a block every Ruby programmer

00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:23,720
has seen this from the beginning but the

00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:25,880
question is is X X mod 2 equals 0 a

00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,470
closure technically it is not it's what

00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,510
is known as an anonymous function but

00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:31,309
this is Ruby we got ducks to go walk and

00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:32,929
talk all over the place so we're going

00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:34,700
to call it a closure if you want to

00:23:32,929 --> 00:23:37,190
actually make it a closure you might

00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,630
have something like this same thing

00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,070
where you define the numbers array and

00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:42,890
then evens we're going to define a proc

00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:45,350
and then here we do puts num select and

00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:47,450
we pass it that specific block I don't

00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:49,250
know if that's very idiomatic Ruby code

00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:52,789
I have started doing this more and more

00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:54,169
in mind where instead of using a instead

00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:56,059
of using a private method that has a

00:23:54,169 --> 00:23:57,860
side effect I'll simply declare

00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:59,809
something like this if I'm going to use

00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:03,230
it more than once just so I can return

00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:05,090
it to myself moving forward next step up

00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:08,090
is tail recursion which is something

00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:09,559
that we use for in functional

00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:11,360
programming the world to do it

00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:13,070
iterations basically the difference

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,600
between recursion and tail recursion in

00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:16,280
recursion you perform your recursive

00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,559
calls first until you hit your lower

00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,720
bound then pass the calculator result

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:23,179
back up the stack tail recursion is

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,620
similar but it's got one different one

00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:26,809
important difference you perform your

00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:28,940
calculation first then pass the

00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:31,280
calculated result into the recursive

00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:33,559
body the differences this turns out is

00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,880
entirely when the compiler runs the

00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:38,360
stack the amount of memory that you have

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,950
to allocate go forward real quick here's

00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,840
an actual code example if we're going to

00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:44,360
some like say numbers 127

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,940
return X if X is equals to 1 otherwise

00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,919
step into the function but if we want to

00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:51,200
do it in a tail recursive manner we

00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:53,659
might say def some X and then the

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,429
running total so in this way we keep a

00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:56,960
balance total and we do the calculation

00:24:55,429 --> 00:24:59,570
the important thing here is running

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,429
total running over square total plus X

00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:04,190
that means the calculation has been

00:25:01,429 --> 00:25:06,289
moved before we have actually made the

00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:08,059
call why would you actually use this in

00:25:06,289 --> 00:25:10,220
Ruby and not a block to be honest

00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:12,710
they're not a lot of serious use cases

00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:14,600
but there is one if you have to walk a

00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:17,240
recursive structure like a tree or a

00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:19,070
rather complex API endpoint that you

00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,929
know we've all week they're out there

00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:22,399
move all we've all dealt with bad API

00:25:20,929 --> 00:25:23,539
endpoints if you ever have to walk one

00:25:22,399 --> 00:25:25,309
that's difficult and very memory

00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:28,330
intensive this will dramatically reduce

00:25:25,309 --> 00:25:31,700
your memory costs Ruby does not perform

00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:33,169
TCO but tell call optimization by

00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,929
default you do actually have to specify

00:25:33,169 --> 00:25:36,950
that I believe someone can spin someone

00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:38,899
could probably yell at me when I'm over

00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:41,120
I think this was introduced of 19 I

00:25:38,899 --> 00:25:43,880
don't know a hundred percent on that

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:47,210
though and then finally the last thing

00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:50,059
that's something that I like is monads

00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:51,679
this is something that if you have ever

00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:54,799
programmed in haskell or if you have

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,090
heard the Twitter people the Twitter

00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,260
guys that kind of go into this this is

00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:59,570
something that's really seen a

00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:03,110
resurgence recently there's a very

00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:06,049
popular description for this it's kind

00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:07,789
of legendary all told a Monette is just

00:26:06,049 --> 00:26:10,909
a Mon would in the category of endo

00:26:07,789 --> 00:26:13,580
functors what's the problem this

00:26:10,909 --> 00:26:15,620
actually is a sarcastic quote given by

00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:17,390
james re and a brief incomplete and

00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:20,539
mostly wrong history of programming

00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:22,309
languages it's specifically to make fun

00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:25,789
of the common list people that love it

00:26:22,309 --> 00:26:27,590
so much in reality a monad is simply a

00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:31,429
structure that defines multiple

00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:33,350
operations as one step think of it in a

00:26:31,429 --> 00:26:36,230
way in the Ruby world as programmable

00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:38,750
ends it's not an if else if else if else

00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:41,210
it's a one structure call that defines

00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:43,820
all the possible paths that an object

00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:45,710
can take we actually have something like

00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:47,380
this that's very actually I think

00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:49,880
probably most people use this every day

00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:53,200
my favorite term for this is called a

00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:56,529
duck monad and it's this

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,539
so this is actually a monad it's not

00:26:56,529 --> 00:27:00,340
it's not technically a moat and that

00:26:58,539 --> 00:27:02,019
it's not a type but in reality it's a

00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:04,960
monett because we are short-circuiting

00:27:02,019 --> 00:27:07,600
the assignment of X we're saying if X

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,340
does not have a value go ahead but if it

00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,620
does short-circuit it we don't need to

00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:13,269
go on this isn't effective it's a very

00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:15,639
simple monad but it's a moment that

00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:18,220
defines the structure and then finally

00:27:15,639 --> 00:27:20,529
go through that we're doing that through

00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:22,779
basically nil punting is x defined if

00:27:20,529 --> 00:27:25,360
yes Lee would be if no go ahead and

00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:27,309
assign it to Y so that is the short

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:30,210
functional programming world and upper

00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:30,210
shell listening to that

00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,170
