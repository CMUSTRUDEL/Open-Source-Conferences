Description: 
	When you think "GitHub", you're probably thinking of what we lovingly refer to as GitHub Dot Com: The Web Site. GitHub Dot Com: The Web Site runs on an incredibly interesting infrastructure composed of very powerful, cleverly configured, and deeply handsome servers. This is not their story. 

This is the story of the other 90% of our infrastructure. This is the story of the 350 AWS instances, 250 Heroku dynos, and dozens of Rackspace Cloud, Softlayer, and ESX VMs we run. This is a story of tooling and monitoring, of happiness and heartbreak, and, ultimately, of The Cloud.
