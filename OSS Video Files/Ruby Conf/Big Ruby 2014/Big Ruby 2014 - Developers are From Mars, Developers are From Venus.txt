Title: Big Ruby 2014 - Developers are From Mars, Developers are From Venus
Publication date: 2020-01-24
Playlist: Big Ruby 2014
Description: 
	By Adam Keys

Working well with other developers: it's difficult and it's crucial. Many projects that fail do so due to social problems, not technical problems. The ability to communicate and work with lots of different kinds of developers and stakeholders can be a superpower almost as awesome as writing software. 

Sadly, there's no manual for developers to read about effective collaboration. But we can still try to better understand different kinds of developers and how to work with them. We can pick up some ideas for how to survive working in a team, or how to lead a team. We can learn how to get from our imperfect teams now to a better team in the future. 

Collaboration is hard, but we can learn it and make it our superhero power.

alright so first of all I have to thank

00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:27,860
you all for choosing to either wait the

00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,680
traffic out or not be in traffic here

00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:32,750
that is a cray mazing thing this slide

00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:36,130
is really just for Christmas he wanted

00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:39,860
me to play yes I'm doing so little

00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:41,810
alright so this talk is called

00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,210
developers are from Mars developers are

00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:47,120
from Venus and that's a kind of a play

00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:49,100
on a self-help book that was available

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,579
in the 90s when I worked in a Barnes &

00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:54,559
Noble the idea of the book was that it

00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:59,140
was the book was men are from Mars and

00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:03,410
then a minute women are from Venus and

00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:05,870
the idea was that men and women men and

00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:09,290
women are very different think different

00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:10,880
etc so you can better understand your

00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:13,550
spouse or your girlfriend or whatever or

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,410
your husband whatever your partner by

00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,600
understanding how they're different and

00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:20,390
that might be a whole bunch of schlock

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,119
but the underlying notion that we're all

00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:26,750
different and that there are ways we can

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:29,210
think ways we can think about each other

00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:33,799
to better get along and work together I

00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:40,130
think is a really rad idea so this talk

00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:42,710
is kind of my a journal of me diagnosing

00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:47,450
myself as a jerk and troubles trying to

00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:51,619
troubleshoot that code out of my manner

00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:53,299
I had realized several years ago that a

00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:56,420
lot of the problems I was facing as a

00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:59,750
developer were social problems and not

00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:02,049
technical problems they were working

00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:05,539
with some people and some developers

00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:08,440
just wasn't very easy or possible for me

00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:11,990
because of personality conflicts or

00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:14,810
disagreements or whatever and I made it

00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:18,080
I was lucky for the first several years

00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:21,620
of my career to work with people who had

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:25,610
the sympathy or empathy to know how to

00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:28,130
work with me as a wily young upstart but

00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:30,380
eventually that's not going to carry

00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:32,870
you carry me through my whole career so

00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:34,910
I'd real i realize i had to level up my

00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:37,040
people skills but the tricky part is

00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:40,370
there's no read me for people and

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,680
there's certainly no manual page so all

00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:44,210
of this i had to i felt i feel like i

00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,900
had to reverse engineer it myself

00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:51,350
luckily there's a lot of books in non

00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:54,890
schlocky self-help stuff out there and

00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:58,250
i've tried to collect the things I

00:02:54,890 --> 00:03:01,790
figure it out as I go I blog about it a

00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:06,280
bit I tweet about it and Here I am

00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:11,600
presenting about it so as I grew into a

00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:15,710
elder age developer a very elder as you

00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:18,560
can see I reached a point where I you

00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:20,180
know I said I was limited by who I could

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:25,880
interact with in the kinds of situations

00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:27,050
I could successfully negotiate so I felt

00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,330
I figured out basically I could

00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:31,160
accomplish very little on my own so I

00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:33,560
better get this teamwork and

00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,790
understanding people's stuff together or

00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,270
else how's this gonna be stuck in the

00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:41,090
corner doing uninteresting things so

00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:44,060
once upon a time I realized that

00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:48,590
everyone is different not everyone is

00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:51,230
like me for better for worse and so I

00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:52,760
have to figure out how like you know

00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,110
when I meet someone or what I'm

00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,060
interacting with someone working with

00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:58,700
someone I figure out what's what's going

00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:02,120
on in their head and how can I better

00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:05,300
communicate with and engage with that

00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,730
thing so I started debugging myself and

00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,380
reverse engineering those I work with

00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,670
because I can see what's going on in my

00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:13,400
head but I don't know what's going on

00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:16,370
their head so it's a black black box

00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,290
situation and I tried to learn how to

00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,760
work with teams and communities that I'm

00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,440
a part of because every team and

00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,180
community is a little different just

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:27,460
like every person is a little different

00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:30,830
so the headline things here are to know

00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:32,960
people in general know yourself and know

00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:38,600
how what your tendencies are and

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:41,000
practice empathy so the way I want to

00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:45,860
get start with this is no knowing people

00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,990
I like to well we all like to put things

00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,340
into their places put things into their

00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:51,470
buckets or their pigeon holes or

00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:54,560
whatever and so I have developed some

00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:57,170
characters some personality types of

00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,260
developers and this helps me get a rough

00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:02,360
feeling of what what is motivating what

00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:04,990
is important to someone I might be

00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,850
working with in a team or a community

00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:09,440
these are not after these are absolutely

00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:12,560
not science these are just my

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:17,030
observations one or more of these a few

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:19,250
caricatures maybe you and one or more of

00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:22,270
them may be on your team or people you

00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:26,890
see it really group meetings conferences

00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:29,330
on the internet etc so the really the

00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:32,810
useful thing here is to recognize each

00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:35,480
character character type and then how

00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:39,710
how can I work most effectively with

00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:41,419
that character type so the first

00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:43,970
character type that I ever realized like

00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:47,419
oh this person is different from me with

00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:50,419
we're grinders grinders are people who

00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:53,000
just hack out a bunch of code really

00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:54,919
quick who get features done really

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,550
snappy who are pushing to production

00:05:54,919 --> 00:06:00,979
rapidly iterating quickly their product

00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:03,650
and feature obsessed all they want to do

00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:06,440
is get new stuff out experiment with it

00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:08,690
see if it works and they're very

00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,680
cutthroat in their methods for getting

00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:16,490
software in a production one grinder

00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:19,010
that I worked with a few jobs ago he

00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:20,690
would push you know every 30 seconds and

00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,850
sometimes it wouldn't even be

00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:24,770
syntactically valid Ruby he would just

00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:27,290
type some stuff in be like yeah I think

00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:29,419
this works deploy it look on the server

00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,950
and be like oh this page blew up and now

00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:32,330
people on my Twitter are being like hey

00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:34,130
why is this thing not working and then

00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:36,260
he would make a fix and immediately

00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:40,220
deploy it in that works fine because our

00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:42,770
deploy only took like 30 seconds and so

00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:46,100
and he didn't write any unit tests and

00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:47,750
so to me this this guy was terrifying

00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:51,740
just absolutely like how is this

00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:54,770
actually working but the answer is he

00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:57,620
was obsessed with getting that feedback

00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:59,720
and moving quickly so he made he made

00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:05,050
mistakes and he moved quickly to fix

00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:09,860
them and he was super iterative and

00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:12,229
sometimes grinders can be stormy if and

00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,569
that's a kind of a way of saying you

00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:20,659
know aggressive or not not aggressive

00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:25,270
like like a lion but not as thinking as

00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:30,349
I am for instance so the core question

00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:33,110
for me as a more contemplative sort of

00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:34,970
developer a little bit of a

00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,979
perfectionist the key question for me

00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:39,560
when I'm working with a grinder is how

00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:42,530
can I explain to them why what I want to

00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:46,099
do is better than their current approach

00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:51,050
how can I sell this guy on TDD or how

00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:55,699
can I sell this person on you know doing

00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:57,680
AV tests something like that to help

00:07:55,699 --> 00:08:00,590
them so I can help them do a better job

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,349
as a person who's enthusiastic about

00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:05,900
languages and design and architect by

00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:09,289
saying hey if you do if you change from

00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:11,150
what you're doing from just trying

00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:13,460
whatever you think might work to doing

00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:14,659
TDD then you get a quick or feedback

00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,210
loop because it's running on your

00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:20,810
machine you don't have to deploy or I

00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:22,340
can say you know hey if you use a if you

00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:24,469
don't just cram a bunch of code into an

00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:26,210
action if you put it in this method then

00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:30,740
later you can reuse it or it'll be

00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:33,409
easier to to change so you can go faster

00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,640
again and sometimes they'll say Adam

00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:35,930
that doesn't make any sense I don't

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,760
understand how I could write more code

00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:42,860
to go faster and so there's a feedback

00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,260
loop there or you say oh yeah I see what

00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:47,360
you're saying let me think about that

00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,680
and you come back and say oh well it's

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,560
because later you're not going to break

00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:55,730
the site like you did and you fix it and

00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:58,279
that's great but we can do better so

00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:59,540
list so so I have to listen and act if

00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:02,480
they tell me my software design isn't

00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,800
helping them out so there can be a

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,520
really nice feedback loop between

00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,150
grinders and another personality type

00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,010
coming up

00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:14,300
that i like to call geniuses just for

00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:16,910
the letter semilla symmetry so tour

00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:19,940
guides are another really awesome kind

00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:22,810
of developer these are the people that

00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:26,930
know the code and the domain in and out

00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:28,970
if you're working on what we have

00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,950
youthfulness we'vewe've appropriated

00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:33,440
this word legacy systems someone who

00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:36,350
really knows a legacy system is a tour

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,420
guide they can ask you you can ask them

00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:40,100
why is this why is the code this way and

00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,840
they can give you a really good answer

00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,060
we can say why do we do it this way and

00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:48,470
they can be like oh well one day Bob etc

00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:50,120
etc etc so they can they know the code

00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:53,150
and domain extremely well and so they're

00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:56,540
super useful when you're like what's

00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:58,370
going on here and they can work across

00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:01,160
the complexity of the system if you have

00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:02,840
like a service-oriented system they were

00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,000
probably around when it wasn't a

00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:08,030
service-oriented system or when it was a

00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,650
smaller system or they're just they just

00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:11,840
know all the pieces will enough they can

00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:13,430
say okay well if you want to add a new

00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:18,010
authorization type you need to make a

00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:21,140
change in system a B and service see so

00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:23,420
they're super valuable to organizations

00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:27,020
because they can work on anything and so

00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:28,940
they're often heavily guarded people who

00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:31,820
like if you say I want this that this

00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:33,470
tour guide on my team then you're going

00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,090
to have to go to the you know you're

00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,770
gonna have to really maybe fight with

00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:41,720
someone to get that person on your team

00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:45,950
but they're super useful sometimes tour

00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:47,900
guides are also not so much about your

00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:51,890
code the specific project your honor the

00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:53,660
domain but they are super intent

00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:56,240
intensely useful when you need to know

00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:58,610
special specialized things about kernels

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,410
or compilers or your programming

00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:02,960
language stack distributed systems

00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:06,680
cryptography info security there's all

00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:11,810
sorts of tour guides out there in the

00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:13,370
world the really crwth the the thing

00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:17,570
that i found that makes working with

00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:21,529
tour guides even better than the so like

00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:23,480
I said they're often heavily guarded

00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:25,870
fools who only have to work on the most

00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,069
critical critical projects because

00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:30,649
that's what the organization thinks is

00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:33,889
best but what's really best is for them

00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:36,259
to split their time teaching all this

00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:40,249
tour information that they already know

00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:42,680
to other developers so really a 50-50

00:11:40,249 --> 00:11:45,170
split between the critical things and

00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:49,699
helping everyone else know the system is

00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:53,059
a really is the best way to work with

00:11:49,699 --> 00:11:54,199
tour guides always if you have to ask a

00:11:53,059 --> 00:11:56,660
question of a tour guide make sure

00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:58,639
you're always like writing it down and

00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:02,569
and figuring out how to spread that

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:05,439
information outside of their head okay

00:12:02,569 --> 00:12:09,499
so geniuses are kind of the

00:12:05,439 --> 00:12:13,339
complementary the yin to the grinders

00:12:09,499 --> 00:12:17,629
yang these are people who are thinkers

00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:19,399
and sometimes warriors some grinders who

00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:22,600
don't like geniuses will call them

00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:25,069
architecture astronauts sometimes I

00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:29,269
personally especially suffer from second

00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:31,160
system syndrome so I see an existing

00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:32,959
system and and the temptation is to be

00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,000
like wipe the slate clean we can do it

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:39,139
all perfectly again which is never ever

00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:43,970
true but there's a big focus on quality

00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:46,430
and experimentation geniuses know all

00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:47,750
the patterns know the design literature

00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:50,029
or know the programming language

00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:53,329
literature or distributed systems

00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:57,290
literature etc they really want to focus

00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:59,000
on building small correct really great

00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:01,329
systems that they're extremely proud of

00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,990
and they want to experiment with

00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:04,929
different things with different

00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:08,209
databases different languages different

00:13:04,929 --> 00:13:10,009
libraries etc they're always looking to

00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:13,279
hone their craft these are the people

00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:19,910
who often this is often the people who

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:22,660
practice Cowen's at home so the like I

00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:26,059
said the these people can become

00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:28,519
architecture astronauts and fall prone

00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:32,209
to reap the big rewrite or second system

00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:34,790
syndromes so the way to work with

00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:35,510
geniuses especially if you feel like

00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:38,990
you're

00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:42,020
a you know a fast iterative grinder type

00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:44,360
is to help them figure out how how we

00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:47,110
can iterate towards that better vision

00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:51,350
that exists in their head you can't just

00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:54,080
hit stop on moving the product or you

00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:57,320
know getting features and getting

00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:59,930
features done the fixing bugs etc but

00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,570
you can say okay we want to get from A

00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:04,880
to B and there's 10 steps in between and

00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:07,430
if we do only four of them we're awesome

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,950
and if we do a 10 then we're we're at

00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:11,840
amazing so helping them figure out how

00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:15,620
to iterate helping me how to figure out

00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:20,900
iterate and divides problems up is super

00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:23,390
useful t-shaped people like generalists

00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:27,230
people who are broadly generalized and

00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:30,830
deeply specialized are another kind of

00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:32,930
developer you'll come upon they're

00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:35,000
focused on one area of skill development

00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:37,070
so if you think of all the things you

00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,210
need to know in order to program

00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:43,250
computers as a spectrum and different

00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:46,060
skill in their skills all along so

00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:48,590
there's like touch typing using get

00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:52,130
knowing how Ruby works knowing how rails

00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:57,050
works design unit testing deployment

00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:59,150
databases etc people some people will

00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:01,370
specialize like deeply in Ruby they like

00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:05,270
they know they're Evan Phoenix they know

00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:06,800
how to write a ruby or they are the

00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:12,530
Sinatra team they know how to do a web

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:15,440
framework so that's a kind of t-shaped

00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:17,210
person and they might be mediocre in

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,490
other skills you might if you have the

00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:21,590
wrong conversation with one of with a

00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:24,200
t-shaped person in an area not of their

00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:27,070
specialty they might seem like they're

00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:29,360
really mediocre developers or barely

00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:31,310
computer literate they might not be able

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,550
to touch type they might suck it text

00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:36,650
editing or something like that but

00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:38,210
there's one skill that they're really

00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:40,370
good at and if they choose the right

00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:43,730
skill to specialize that then they're

00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:45,710
amazing to work with because you there's

00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:48,240
just a ton of things you can learn from

00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:51,420
them i work from i work with

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:58,500
an individual who is deeply specialized

00:15:51,420 --> 00:16:01,920
in design and so at first I was like oh

00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:04,020
I'm not sure if he really understands

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,510
rails that well but it doesn't kind of

00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:10,529
matter because he's really good it's

00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:12,600
solid at the solid principles so I can

00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:14,630
learn about solid from him and learn

00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:18,120
about teaching him oh well here's how

00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:22,160
you know solid does or doesn't apply to

00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:26,040
action controller or something like that

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,810
the so to work with them you want to

00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,640
listen patiently to whatever they're

00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:32,940
focused in if you can learn about get

00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:34,290
from them or compilers or whatever you

00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,360
want to focus in on that when they're

00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:38,940
talking about that when the problem area

00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:43,529
is that and then when areas where

00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:46,320
they're not so strong you just that's a

00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:48,660
place to practice empathy to just say oh

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,130
hey yeah here's how you do that so

00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:54,600
there's a there's a nice give and take

00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:56,550
that can occur there so the fun leader

00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,339
is the last sort of character character

00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:04,319
that I've come across this is someone

00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:06,150
with amazing technical chops plus people

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:09,770
skills someone who's really good at

00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:12,720
listening to people hearing two to two

00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:14,160
opposing sides and finding some middle

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,760
ground so that we can start getting

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,530
stuff done they're able to get dogmatic

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:23,459
and opinion people opinionated people

00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:25,949
together and bridge that gap so that the

00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:28,559
all everyone can get together and get

00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:33,300
some get something done make an awesome

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:37,290
thing they can't be called on constantly

00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:39,600
there's a temptation to be like Oh John

00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:42,120
can fix any kind of technical problem or

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,820
people problem these two guys these two

00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:47,280
groups don't agree we need to get John

00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:49,380
in between them and then have him fix

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,300
that situation and then oh no now

00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,670
there's this other situation we have to

00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:58,380
have we have to have our foot our fun

00:17:53,670 --> 00:18:00,419
later fix that too they need time cool

00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:03,749
down time to do

00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:04,950
ooh awesome technical things because you

00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:09,119
brought them on because they're also

00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:11,609
awesome a technical stuff and if you

00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:14,129
need to lean on them constantly then

00:18:11,609 --> 00:18:16,889
honestly your team and culture is just

00:18:14,129 --> 00:18:18,570
broken and you need to fix it higher up

00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:20,519
in the management and leadership chain

00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:22,739
than in having someone at the

00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:27,989
development and technical lead level

00:18:22,739 --> 00:18:34,080
having to always fix these these gaps in

00:18:27,989 --> 00:18:35,999
your team so those folks are awesome so

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,369
the other thing that you have to do that

00:18:35,999 --> 00:18:41,580
I found I had to do besides recognizing

00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:45,659
these kinds of people is to learn about

00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:48,899
myself and learn about how to think

00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:53,100
about other people so I had to realize

00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:55,739
my own tendencies there are words or

00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,899
attitudes that put me off and put me in

00:18:55,739 --> 00:19:02,340
a bad defensive place or paint me into a

00:18:57,899 --> 00:19:04,499
corner so I had to realize windows what

00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,669
those things are and be able to step

00:19:04,499 --> 00:19:08,669
back and say okay this thing is

00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:12,359
happening I need to be very tactical you

00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:16,739
know consider my words not get too amped

00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:19,649
up about this and what figure out what

00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:24,419
seems natural to me what when and what

00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:26,249
is difficult to me doing what or what is

00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:28,470
intimidating to me like doing a sales

00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:30,749
and negotiation is very intimidating to

00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:37,669
me and completely unnatural that kind of

00:19:30,749 --> 00:19:40,129
social situation so I I want to either

00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:42,809
kindly get out of that situation

00:19:40,129 --> 00:19:45,919
delegate it to someone else or figure

00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:51,090
out a annual way to do this without

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:53,070
leveraging weird inequalities and I'd

00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:55,289
learn how to have patience with the

00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:59,129
tendencies of others some people are

00:19:55,289 --> 00:20:01,559
annoying to me and so have to be like

00:19:59,129 --> 00:20:03,299
okay this this guy's telling is not not

00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:04,889
jokes I'll let them tell us three

00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:07,019
knock-knock jokes and then we can and

00:20:04,889 --> 00:20:10,379
then you know I'll just think about

00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:11,309
football for a minute or two and then we

00:20:10,379 --> 00:20:13,519
can go back to having a cool

00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:13,519
conversation

00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:18,280
and or I might just need to know to

00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:20,620
breathe deeply and step back and say

00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:23,950
okay this conversation isn't going the

00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:26,800
way I want to I'm you know pulling all

00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:29,290
of my people tricks out of my bag of

00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,640
tricks it's not working I should

00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:33,670
probably just figure out how to step

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,740
back and find some way out of this

00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:37,840
conversation where I don't regret it

00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:40,240
later where I don't look back and say

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:43,240
man I wish I'd done that better later so

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:46,840
just knowing how to step back and when I

00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:50,230
feel exhausted from dealing with some

00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:53,020
kind of team or person situation knowing

00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:56,290
how to recharge my batteries so for me

00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:59,170
going running going to workout going to

00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:03,550
and improv comedy classes all that helps

00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:06,070
me recharge my batteries for people

00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:07,840
situations at work where sometimes

00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:09,010
they're my friend sometimes I've chosen

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,130
to hang out with these people and

00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:16,150
sometimes I haven't chosen to work

00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:19,510
closely with these people knowing

00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:21,840
personality types the the the straight

00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:25,360
oh the straight old conventional

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,470
myers-briggs personality type tests

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,030
where it tells you if you're an

00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:30,100
introvert or an extrovert thinking

00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:34,630
perceiving feeling judging and there's

00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:38,140
another one knowing all that stuff no

00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:40,240
knowing approximately where you land it

00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:42,910
sets up like the myers-briggs sets up

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,610
like eight personality qualities and you

00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:51,970
can be anywhere on a spectrum on the

00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:53,770
four qualities and and it's not a

00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:55,660
constant you're not like always an

00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:58,150
introvert or always an extrovert so

00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:00,460
really it's more useful to know which

00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,710
way you trend I trend extrovert but have

00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:04,690
introverted moments so that's useful to

00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:07,840
know and then it's useful for me to know

00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:10,930
i feel like i just recently became able

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,300
to identify when I'm annoying an

00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:15,970
introvert and when I should just shut up

00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:18,580
and put this bring this conversation to

00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:23,950
a close so they can go recharge and not

00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:27,430
be exhausted by me Brett and outside the

00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:29,770
Myer Myers Briggs I've noticed like

00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:34,720
there are brash talkers people like to

00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:37,420
talk pointedly and brunt Lee and there

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,820
are kind talkers I'm a kind talker I can

00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:41,980
sugarcoat something I will try and

00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:45,850
sugarcoat it because I don't like to

00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:48,460
argue vehemently debating is okay

00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:50,590
arguing is not much fun but some people

00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:54,070
another thing some people like angry

00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:57,850
rants some people love to hear someone

00:22:54,070 --> 00:23:02,800
yell about politics or sports teams or

00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:05,860
active record or whatever I don't that's

00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:10,450
just the way we not everyone is like me

00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:12,370
that's okay and so and then realizing

00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,930
like I said with introvert and extrovert

00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:16,390
sometimes I have to realize when my

00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:19,000
personality type is in conflict with the

00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:20,170
other person an introvert probably just

00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,080
wants me to tell them what I need to

00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:24,970
tell them and then let you know and then

00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:27,400
that's it whereas if I'm talking with an

00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:30,400
extrovert we can joke around and rip a

00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:32,920
bit and it's fun but I don't want to

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:36,040
force an introvert to riff around with

00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:38,640
me because that's just taking that's D

00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:41,410
charge just taking from their batteries

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,750
so a lot of that all of this isn't

00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:46,270
leading into empathy like feeling for

00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:49,120
the other person understanding the other

00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:50,740
side's wants and needs what what the

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:54,100
pressures are on them what their goals

00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:56,310
are what the norm like the social norms

00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:59,470
that they're trying to play to our

00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:02,020
whether they need to defend their ego or

00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:05,710
not knowing all of these sayings is

00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:08,650
really useful especially online when

00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:12,870
there's a bike it something like Twitter

00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:16,120
where all sorts of context is shift away

00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:20,520
so trying to figure out like why someone

00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:23,620
would say something is really useful and

00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:27,400
two frameworks I found extremely useful

00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:30,040
and they have awesome names are Hanlon's

00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:35,080
razor and Occam's razor so Hanlon's

00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:37,180
razor is just a guy law as a is a way of

00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:41,020
thinking and it says for any given

00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:43,720
choice choice of action or thing

00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:46,540
someone might say when you're trying to

00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,670
explain why they did it or set it choose

00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:53,440
that they were stupid over that they

00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:57,310
were evil or that they were naive or you

00:24:53,440 --> 00:25:00,340
know not that they were evil and then

00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:02,140
similarly Occam's razor says choose any

00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:06,880
simple explanation for something over a

00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:10,570
complex explanation so if you if you're

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:13,290
like oh hey my pencil broke I wonder why

00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:16,090
that was it can either be because of

00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:17,770
physics and you pushed on it too hard or

00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:21,370
it could be because of space alien broke

00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:24,340
it you should probably choose that

00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:26,650
physics broke your pencil and not a

00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:29,290
space alien and the same thing for like

00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:32,260
handset and so for Hanlon's razor it's

00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:37,630
like well why doesn't why is I message

00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:40,810
so broken from Apple is it because they

00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:43,660
don't want you to use some other system

00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:46,180
is it you know are they trying to lock

00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:48,010
you in is it because they don't want you

00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:52,090
to send text messages or is it just

00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:54,430
because Apple isn't very good at global

00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:56,110
scale web services yeah it's probably

00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:58,390
because they're just not that good at

00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:59,860
web services yet because that's kind of

00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:02,680
new stuff for them they haven't been

00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:07,360
doing it for 30 years so you can apply

00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:09,850
this to what way online in your team's

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:13,750
like why did why was this code it this

00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:15,400
way this is obviously stupid it's

00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:18,330
probably that they didn't know something

00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:20,950
so Hanlon's razor super useful for

00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:23,710
legacy code systems it's not that they

00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:25,240
no one wakes up and says man i'm going

00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:26,860
to write some terrible codes as it later

00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:32,050
someone is going to curse my name when

00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:37,300
they look at the blame so this one gives

00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:40,270
me all the time when you're so right in

00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:43,300
our in our modern computer society we do

00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:45,130
a lot of communication by reading a

00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:48,220
bunch of things and then typing a

00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:51,970
response into a text box and all that

00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:53,410
there is all the context is the words

00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:56,110
that appeared and

00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:58,390
besom emoji and an avatar that is either

00:26:56,110 --> 00:27:01,210
the person's face which is making some

00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:03,880
kind of neutral face hopefully or it's

00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:06,820
some cartoon that they chose because it

00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,860
portrays their character so there's all

00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:11,290
this context that stripped away you

00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:13,750
can't see if they're angry or happy or

00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:15,690
having a good day or a bad day or if

00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:20,140
they love a good rant or if they don't

00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:22,420
and so you really have to and that

00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:24,340
person on the other side has emotions

00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:28,960
and feelings and stuff that's going on

00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:32,020
in their life so think before you type

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,390
into a text box stop before you send it

00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:36,850
even if it's as short as a tweaked read

00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:39,070
what you said you read what you wrote

00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:40,540
and figure out what you're asking of the

00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:42,250
other side are you asking them to

00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:44,680
understand that you're making a joke or

00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:48,340
that you are you know you're like oh

00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:50,260
this really annoys me but only really

00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,940
annoys me in a little way and not like a

00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:55,630
huge this is making my life worse

00:27:51,940 --> 00:28:01,000
problem sort of way say what you mean

00:27:55,630 --> 00:28:04,240
and not what you feel or separate how

00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,780
you feel and try to separate how you

00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:10,030
feel and what you think is rational that

00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:12,100
helps me a lot lately because I tend to

00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:14,950
think in terms of what I feel but if I

00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:16,990
can step back and be like okay I feel

00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:19,630
this thing but I realized that only

00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:21,520
these things are rational so let's try

00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:25,060
and make these things fit together

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:28,560
better and again don't confuse social

00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:33,460
problems for technical problems

00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:35,470
sometimes you know we'll try and be like

00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:38,770
oh well we clearly just need more

00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:41,230
moderation on forums and that might help

00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:43,870
or it might help to just have a nice

00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:45,610
nest policy or not a niceness policy if

00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:49,000
that's the kind of community that we're

00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:52,120
talking about having adult supervision

00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:56,710
and upstarts mixed in a community or a

00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:59,680
team is really useful so adult

00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:01,360
supervision is my term for people who've

00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,670
been around in technology for more than

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,530
one hype cycle so anyone who's been

00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:07,120
doing rails for more than like six or

00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:10,960
seven years anyone who remembers

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:16,680
like the rails can't scale memes and

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:19,450
like the scent of rails before that

00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:21,040
anyone who's done like Java or visual

00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:24,280
basic or whatever anyone who's been

00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:27,160
through more than one tech rodeo is sort

00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:30,280
of adult supervision who says okay well

00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:33,309
I has someone who has history and then

00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:35,950
there's upstarts people who just got

00:29:33,309 --> 00:29:40,000
into programming one two three years ago

00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:41,260
and everyone has been been here at some

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,910
point when they're like this is new

00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:45,809
technology and it's way better than this

00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:48,220
other thing that the old we're using and

00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:49,360
it's going to change the world and

00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:52,450
theirs I just want to take the bull by

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:54,429
the horns and go you want both of those

00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:57,760
things because you want the energy and

00:29:54,429 --> 00:30:00,340
the excitement and the new ideas of the

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,950
upstarts but you want the adult

00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:06,490
supervision to be like and we've done

00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:10,690
this whole application container thing

00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:13,360
and j2ee wasn't that great or or to say

00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:16,240
oh hey yeah what you're doing is also is

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,490
you know this distributed systems is

00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,260
it's pretty fun you should look at land

00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:25,840
port clocks because those will help you

00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:27,550
figure out how to converge state so you

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,050
can kind of you need the calming

00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:33,420
influence of those not in their first

00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:36,190
rodeo in the energy of the upstarts and

00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:39,460
then the youngs and the olds can learn

00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:42,250
from each other so what we've learned

00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:44,590
you need to know yourself know others in

00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:46,360
practice empathy practice being a more

00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:48,760
pleasant person learn how to think about

00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:50,950
people and know yourself as a developer

00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:53,530
no other developers and know how to work

00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:58,270
with them you can go out and practice

00:30:53,530 --> 00:31:01,840
this stuff on literally anybody you can

00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:04,540
use it on your on your partner your your

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,340
mom your team your barista whatever get

00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:08,800
to know people you see every day I know

00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:10,630
one of my baristas really well and it's

00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,950
really awesome to just stand and chat

00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:15,640
with him for a minute if there's no one

00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:18,360
behind me in the line curate your social

00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:20,559
network to filter out dumb angry people

00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:23,559
there's no sense in putting up

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:26,950
with that especially if you're like me

00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:30,519
and you don't like angry conflict angry

00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:34,149
smart people are a kind of a special

00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:39,789
case but smart print smart happy people

00:31:34,149 --> 00:31:42,909
are super awesome and yeah pat yourself

00:31:39,789 --> 00:31:46,659
on the back when you succeed or don't

00:31:42,909 --> 00:31:50,080
say something stupid I do this I see

00:31:46,659 --> 00:31:51,999
like okay that previous me previous Adam

00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:55,029
ten years ago Adam would have said

00:31:51,999 --> 00:31:58,179
something really mean or asinine or

00:31:55,029 --> 00:32:00,190
jerky there and I didn't so good on me

00:31:58,179 --> 00:32:02,950
I've made some progress towards

00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:05,019
recovering from being a jerk when I

00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:06,700
don't when I do emerge from some

00:32:05,019 --> 00:32:10,389
situation I wished something had gone

00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:12,909
better than you know I take a breath

00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:15,119
cool down maybe go for a walk go for a

00:32:12,909 --> 00:32:17,379
run and then ask myself okay next time

00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:18,549
what am I going to do better what am I

00:32:17,379 --> 00:32:20,980
going to do but it's not about what the

00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:25,149
other person did to me or at me or

00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:28,269
whatever its how can I be better every

00:32:25,149 --> 00:32:31,840
time so everyone is you know one is like

00:32:28,269 --> 00:32:33,369
you or no one is like me we can all

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,080
start the process of working with

00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:38,169
someone by identifying their character

00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:41,379
and play to the needs of that person and

00:32:38,169 --> 00:32:44,350
we can learn and practice empathy so I

00:32:41,379 --> 00:32:47,289
just want to make nicer people and

00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:49,389
better people on the internet and I want

00:32:47,289 --> 00:32:51,149
a head desk last when I work with other

00:32:49,389 --> 00:32:54,519
people and I see other people

00:32:51,149 --> 00:32:57,070
conversatin so we can all be better all

00:32:54,519 --> 00:33:01,679
the time to everyone we meet no work

00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:01,679

00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:18,050
