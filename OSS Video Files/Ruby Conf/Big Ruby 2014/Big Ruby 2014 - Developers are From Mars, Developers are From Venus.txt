Working well with other developers: it's difficult and it's crucial. Many projects that fail do so due to social problems, not technical problems. The ability to communicate and work with lots of different kinds of developers and stakeholders can be a superpower almost as awesome as writing software. 

Sadly, there's no manual for developers to read about effective collaboration. But we can still try to better understand different kinds of developers and how to work with them. We can pick up some ideas for how to survive working in a team, or how to lead a team. We can learn how to get from our imperfect teams now to a better team in the future. 

Collaboration is hard, but we can learn it and make it our superhero power.
