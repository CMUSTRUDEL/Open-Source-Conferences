Title: Big Ruby 2014 - REFACTORING WITH SCIENCE by Wynn Netherland
Publication date: 2020-01-24
Playlist: Big Ruby 2014
Description: 
	Changing code is easy. Changing code with confidence isn't. Even the most robust, mature test suites have blind spots that make large scale changes difficult. At GitHub we use Science to instrument, compare results, and measure performance of parallel code path experiments to see how new code runs against a current production baseline. This talk will show you how to Science, too.
