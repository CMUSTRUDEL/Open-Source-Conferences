Publication date: 2020-01-24
Playlist: Big Ruby 2014
Description: 
	Getting big things done is important. We praise big accomplishments, but those involved can usually point to the small decisions and actions along the way that made it all possible. Structuring teams, projects, systems, and processes to embrace smallness enables the big things to evolve and succeed. This talk will cover ways in which the teams behind TripCase have succeeded and failed while making big things happen one small step at a time.
