hi these are my slides I came here a

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:26,970
long way from Berlin that is if you want

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:31,770
to walk there from here that is a two

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:34,410
and a half month walk and why I'm

00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:37,559
mentioning this is because apparently

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:42,030
there is a theme here who was here for

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:45,120
last year's conference and last year the

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,950
keynote speaker Chad was also from

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,380
Berlin this is a photo of us obviously

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:53,750
in Berlin hanging out on a camel that's

00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:56,130
what we do in Berlin but so next year

00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:59,310
your keynote speaker will probably come

00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:03,030
from Berlin to I guess it's like just a

00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:04,860
given anyhow I think we're already

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,950
behind in time so let's get started with

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:11,640
the talk I'm not actually really going

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,140
to talk about Sinatra um in case you

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,979
didn't notice that's what I'm the

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,530
maintainer off I'm going to talk about

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:23,789
abstraction and I'm going to talk about

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:29,399
abstraction on the quite an abstract

00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:33,170
level but I'm also going to talk about

00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:42,119
color I'm going to talk about magenta

00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:45,709
not magento not make nido magenta or

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:53,549
anything from the purple violet spectrum

00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:56,520
the sock is very very meta and I like to

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:58,789
open with a quote that is kind of my

00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,340
motivation why I want to talk about

00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:04,020
abstraction from Douglas Adams who says

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,599
that anything that's in the world when

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,660
you're born is just normal anything

00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:13,349
that's invented between your 15 and 35

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:16,110
is interesting in new and shiny and

00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:19,520
anything that's invented after this is

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,520
against the natural order of things

00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:25,770
and I want to talk about computer

00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:29,700
science and color perception and this

00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:31,350
talk might be kind of confusing because

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,560
I'm jumping back and forth between

00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:37,350
things so I thought I just going to

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,090
start with a conclusion usually you put

00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,190
the conclusion at the end I just put it

00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:45,600
at the start of the talk just to be sure

00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:49,430
what I'm talking about I think that

00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,430
abstraction happens in our minds

00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:55,440
abstractions shape how we perceive

00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:59,520
things changing abstractions is a basic

00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,320
principle of innovation in progress an

00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:05,070
abstraction I think its basis of

00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:09,600
computer science would you agree with

00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:13,680
this this is on nodding or head shaking

00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:17,720
I actually think abstraction is the

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:21,570
basis of science and science rocks

00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:24,030
without abstraction in computer science

00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:26,400
we will always be talking about

00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:30,060
transistors actually that's already an

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:33,540
abstraction over how electrons move in

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:37,310
medium but without abstractions when I

00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:39,480
write my web app obviously in Sinatra I

00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:42,120
would just be thinking about the

00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:46,290
transistors I need to serve HTTP

00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:50,120
response but instead we can write code

00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:54,380
like this without having to worry about

00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,380
the hardware it's actually running on

00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:58,730
speaking of electrons

00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:08,600
so this is an electron or this is a atom

00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:11,150
with electrons and the lowest energy

00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,340
that an electron can have and its

00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:16,880
current saponin state is called the

00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:19,400
ground state and when the electron or

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,040
the atom has a higher energy than it

00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,650
slows energy it's said to be in an

00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:29,060
excited state and because these states

00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:31,640
are of the electrons are core occur only

00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:33,200
on distinct levels there is set to be

00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:37,790
quantized and that's what we call

00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:41,030
quantum mechanics and so these electrons

00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:43,430
are excited which means they are flying

00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:46,730
on a higher level farther away from the

00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:48,730
from the core and then at one point they

00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:54,260
just jump to watch the ground level

00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:56,990
releasing a photon and then that is what

00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:59,480
we generally you refer to as light well

00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:01,430
actually only a fraction of that it's

00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,830
what we refer to as light because that

00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:10,130
is the visible spectrum that is the

00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:13,400
light that we can see and the the

00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:18,770
frequency here depends on how far the

00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:20,419
electrons electrons jump so therefore we

00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:22,479
see different colors for different

00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:31,490
frequency within the visible spectrum

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:36,460
and humans have have their vision works

00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:36,460
by principle is called try chroma see

00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:42,770
that means the retina in our eyes are

00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:47,750
contains two types of photoreceptors

00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:50,960
rods and cones and the rods of the more

00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:53,780
numerous and they're more sensitive but

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:58,460
they're not sensitive to color and and

00:05:53,780 --> 00:06:01,610
the cones of which we only have six to

00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:05,450
seven million compared to 120 million

00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:08,750
rods they're sensitive to color and

00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:11,940
they're more concentrated in in the

00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:14,700
center of the retina

00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:20,850
odom macula and there we have three

00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:24,560
different types generally we have cones

00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:27,240
that are more responsive so this is the

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,130
sister frequency and this is the

00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,490
sensitivity of the different types of

00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:34,800
cones to light at that frequency so we

00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:38,750
have currents that are more responsive

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:41,940
to blue so we will if there's light of

00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:44,460
that particular frequency then the blue

00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,840
cones will have a very strong sensation

00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,540
whereas all the other curves will have a

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,250
very weak sensation and the same happens

00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:54,510
on the other end of the spectrum where

00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:56,070
our red cones will have some sensation

00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:59,580
but our blue cones won't have any

00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:03,000
sensation at all and you might notice

00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:06,630
I'm jumping a lot this is intentional

00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:14,700
and I hope it will all make sense in the

00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:19,770
end so patterns and our tourism there

00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:21,830
was a very interesting book that I

00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:28,710
already recommended to someone yesterday

00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:31,980
or two days ago came out in 1977 called

00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:34,950
a pattern language by Christopher

00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:38,340
Alexander and others and it's the second

00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:39,690
book in the three book series the first

00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,390
book being the timeless way of building

00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:46,290
and the third book being the Oregon

00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:52,280
experiment and in this book Alexander

00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:54,630
argues that to be able to talk about

00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:57,270
architecture in general and starting

00:07:54,630 --> 00:08:00,900
from interior design to building your

00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:04,410
house to designing a city you need to

00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:07,169
have a common language to refer to the

00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:08,940
patterns you're using the style you're

00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:12,510
using for building the principles you

00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:17,490
using for building and this was so

00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:19,890
influential that is inspired software

00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:21,800
developers to try to apply the same

00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:25,699
principle to software

00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:28,819
what came out of this is a book called

00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:32,419
design patterns by what's usually

00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:35,450
referred to as the Gang of Four came out

00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:38,659
in 1994 and that's where we get

00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:40,849
principles are like singleton classes

00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:45,019
flower wines and so on and a lot of

00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:48,370
things we use today to communicate about

00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:51,079
software comes from this book and

00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:54,200
there's also a nice quote by Christopher

00:08:51,079 --> 00:09:02,329
Alexander the architect who then wrote

00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:05,800
the foreword for one of the authors no

00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:08,000
actually not for Richard Gabriel's book

00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:11,300
patterns of software which came out two

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,310
years later and in that book he says I

00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:16,310
would hope to see examples of programs

00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:18,920
which make you task because of their

00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:21,620
beauty herbs to a knowledge more

00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:24,200
widespread in our culture so that people

00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,930
outside the field lay people like me

00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:31,970
could also begin to grasp the beauty of

00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:35,570
programs and I think for that we need

00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:37,610
abstract concepts like those patterns to

00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:42,829
reason about software to reason about

00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:47,029
what is beautiful software we need

00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:50,510
concepts like algorithms which is a word

00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:54,410
used by programmers if they didn't want

00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:58,209
to explain what they did so who can tell

00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:58,209
me what algorithm this is

00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:09,890
all quiet is it's a sort algorithm but

00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:11,930
quicksort yes feel free to just yell at

00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:16,000
me I'm probably not taking questions so

00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:19,490
just yell things this is quicksort and

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,020
this has nothing to do with what does

00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:22,760
actually the program do that using

00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:27,380
quicksort it's just an abstract

00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:34,130
algorithm so let's talk about those

00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:37,490
cones these dots recommend represent the

00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:41,240
cones and where they are in the slide

00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:44,110
represents their sensation on your

00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:47,000
excitement and I simplified there

00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:49,850
pretending that they're very distinct

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,350
for certain frequencies so imagine those

00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:54,110
are your cones you don't see anything

00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:56,450
right now they don't have any sensation

00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:59,870
it's dark out and then there comes red

00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:02,750
light and your red cone fields sensation

00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:06,980
and your brain says yes this is red I

00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:11,290
notice or green light and your green

00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:14,390
cone feels the sensational same for blue

00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:16,700
now there are more frequencies than just

00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:20,510
red green and blue so when you see

00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:23,030
yellow light both your red cone and your

00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:26,120
green cone both feel a sensation and

00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:28,730
your brain will then know that the

00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,700
frequency has to be somewhere in between

00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:35,630
those two frequencies so it will show

00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:39,500
you yellow but what happens if you feel

00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:43,690
a sensation in both a red cone and the

00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:46,940
blue cone but not in a green cone in

00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:52,130
that case your your brain would assume

00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:54,260
that the frequency or by the logic with

00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:56,180
frequencies being in between the cones

00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:58,670
that feel the sensation it should

00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:00,290
probably assume that it's in between red

00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:03,230
and blue and right in between red and

00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:05,450
blue screen but it can't be green

00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:08,570
because otherwise you would feel a

00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:10,550
sensation in your green cone so your

00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:13,370
brain at that point you could argue your

00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:18,230
brain makes up a new color outside the

00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:21,710
spectrum that is magenta while what

00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:23,660
actually happens at that point is you

00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:26,930
see light that is a mix of two different

00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:31,520
frequencies red and blue our brain just

00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:35,680
cannot tell the difference so it's

00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:39,820
magenta real and you actually see this

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:43,550
when you write CSS when you this is the

00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:47,360
CSS hash code for the color magenta and

00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:51,910
you see it has all the red light or the

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:55,300
blue light none of the green light and

00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:58,160
this representation is an abstraction

00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:00,620
over how we represent color on our

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,800
monitors our monitors aren't actually

00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:06,440
able to produce all the colors they just

00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:12,260
have red green and blue dots three of

00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:14,180
them make a pixel and you might argue

00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,830
that for some this is a leaky

00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,930
abstraction I going to go into this into

00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:20,360
detail later but an interesting thing

00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:22,820
that comes from that is if you take

00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,400
color pictures some cameras take

00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:30,800
separate pictures for contrast and the

00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:33,670
red red green and blue and an example

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:36,080
for this is satellites so Google Maps

00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:39,470
takes pictures in that way and if you

00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:44,240
have a fast moving object you will see

00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:47,120
the different colors on this photo so in

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,240
the world of computer science the

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:54,140
different kinds of abstractions the

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:56,150
first one I'm going to take a storica

00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:59,180
look the first one that really came up

00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:01,250
as shortly after we had the abstraction

00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:04,339
of software to begin with state

00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:08,480
abstraction so the first book I read

00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:11,390
when I was a kid on on programming the

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,820
first chapter was about picking your

00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:16,670
grade right data types your data

00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:19,700
structures it's your data structure

00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:21,000
determines if your program is a good

00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,700
program or

00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,920
program if it will perform well I won't

00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:29,700
perform well so this book was arguing

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:32,670
that before you write any code sit down

00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:34,650
and think about the data structures

00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:36,720
you're going to use and who here who

00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:40,590
here does that raise your hands who here

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:43,110
does that okay maybe I should talk to

00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:49,410
you guys later because I don't do that

00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:51,120
and in 1967 there was a paper arguing

00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:58,010
that you should do that it's called data

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:58,010
less programming that said that

00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:02,190
basically how people I would just

00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,320
explain it how people write software

00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:05,850
right now is they think about the data

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:11,910
types they pick them and then they write

00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:13,230
the code accordingly and that might get

00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:15,780
you into trouble when you later on

00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:17,820
realize you need a different data

00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:20,430
structure so you basically need to

00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,890
rewrite your program and it argues that

00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:26,390
we should have programming languages and

00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:31,620
use them in a way that they allow us to

00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:35,730
write our code independently of the data

00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:38,250
structures we will be using which today

00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:41,100
is the thing I would argue most people

00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:46,170
do and we refer to this as our business

00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:56,580
logic vs our persistence layer or memory

00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:58,370
management etc space space is big it

00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:01,650
just won't believe how vastly

00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:03,900
mind-bogglingly big it is I mean you may

00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:06,510
think it's a long way down the road to

00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:08,780
the chemists but that's just peanuts to

00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,780
space

00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:18,850
who here is fascinated with with space

00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:21,819
okay it's more people than thinking

00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:27,220
about the data types I like it but that

00:16:21,819 --> 00:16:29,199
they have structures so there's a lot of

00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:31,769
space out there but then in dec space

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:38,910
there are also some interesting things

00:16:31,769 --> 00:16:41,470
like planets and stars and apparently

00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:46,119
we're all supposed to be made out of

00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:54,429
star stuff or today sometimes it's

00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:57,189
called it's referred to as Stardust well

00:16:54,429 --> 00:17:00,069
actually as a side note i like to geek

00:16:57,189 --> 00:17:02,290
out on things if you ignore all the

00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:04,990
space between the atoms that we have in

00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:07,569
our body and just count the atoms we're

00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:13,769
actually just thirty eight percent start

00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:18,309
stuff because the rest is hydrogen and

00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:20,949
hydrogen is the base state the atom that

00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:24,659
has not been created by fusion so it's

00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:27,159
not actually made out of a star factory

00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:30,000
this point you might say wait wait what

00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:36,250
are we still talking about abstraction

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:40,870
yes at least I think so maybe because

00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:43,029
I'm talking about the periodic table so

00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:44,740
the interesting thing is in the

00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:47,230
beginning I talked about the electrons

00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:54,940
jumping towards the core and then

00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:58,659
releasing photons and the how they jump

00:17:54,940 --> 00:18:00,610
depends on how or the light they emit

00:17:58,659 --> 00:18:03,730
depends on how far the electrons jump

00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:08,710
and that depends on how many quantum

00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:13,480
states and adam has and that relates to

00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:15,250
how many protons and adam has and as you

00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,889
know they're all the numbers in the

00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:22,169
periodic table correspond to the numbers

00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:26,869
of protons they have so from the light

00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:31,759
that atoms emit when you make them glow

00:18:26,869 --> 00:18:37,649
you can tell what kind of atoms they are

00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:42,330
so you get emission lines and do you

00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:45,029
know what the emission spectrum and the

00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:50,580
emission spectrum of iron and a cat have

00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:56,580
in common they're both felines anybody

00:18:50,580 --> 00:19:00,830
know could be a dad joke I guess so this

00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:06,210
is very very useful for determining

00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:10,649
what's in a star because stars do fusion

00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:13,289
and they have glowing atoms and then we

00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:16,289
see the light and then we just need to

00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:22,919
measure the wavelength and then we get

00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:26,629
those nice diagrams this one's actually

00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:29,730
better that shows the different

00:19:26,629 --> 00:19:33,450
different stages stars go through so you

00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:36,330
can determine their content and combined

00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:40,350
with their size you can then determine

00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:43,289
how old those stars are there's a

00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:46,619
problem here you can't really use a

00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:49,559
normal camera for this because a normal

00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:52,049
camera doesn't store the wavelength it

00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:55,440
just saw some value for red green and

00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:57,419
blue because that is how we see so that

00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,090
would be a leaky abstraction at that

00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:02,909
point that doesn't allow us to use

00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:04,350
normal cameras if you want to know how

00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:07,289
you actually do it comes from you later

00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:10,950
that would be too much for the stock so

00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:13,049
besides data abstraction there's control

00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:15,359
obstruction and this is something we

00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:17,940
take for granted today but those were

00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:20,669
groundbreaking ideas at the time the

00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:23,220
first idea for control abstraction worse

00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:25,440
up routines it's a piece of code you can

00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:28,710
put somewhere else and then you can jump

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:32,659
to it and then it jumps back this also

00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:35,610
later on brought with it reusability and

00:20:32,659 --> 00:20:39,270
a lot of public debate

00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:41,670
so in 1968 Dykstra published his famous

00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:46,130
letter was not a paper it was a ledger

00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:53,010
go true statement considered harmful and

00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:57,090
then in 1973 came another paper or this

00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:59,010
time the real paper james by james h

00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:02,970
morris jr called projection and

00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:04,830
programming language in which he argues

00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:09,390
that the ability of programming language

00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:12,360
to isolate program in modules is vital

00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:16,290
in that paper he also argues that you

00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:18,000
should be enforcing this isolation and

00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:20,400
he then goes on about protection

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,110
mechanisms and how you can sign or

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,390
encrypt data structures so that other

00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:26,940
parts of the Quran meddle with it which

00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:29,700
I do think today is no longer really

00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:32,309
necessary because we have the conception

00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,630
of Public api's and data you're supposed

00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:35,520
to manipulate and data you're not

00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:37,020
supposed to touch but the important

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,480
thing that came out of this paper is

00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:42,510
that you should be able to reason about

00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:44,429
modules in isolation and this then for

00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:46,460
me lies the founding stone for things

00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:50,970
the foundation for things like

00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:55,500
test-driven development and libraries

00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:58,080
reusable code in general other things

00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:01,400
that came out of the 70s where ideas

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:04,040
like global state global variables that

00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:08,610
those are things you should avoid

00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:11,280
whenever possible so they said humans

00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:13,890
have try chroma see but there is also a

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:17,760
condition called tetra chroma see we

00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:19,440
have four different cones and typical

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:24,960
beings that have four different cones

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:29,400
are zebra finches and gold fishes so

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:34,610
therefore different cones are sensible

00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:37,460
to four different wavelengths I did

00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:41,510
the last one is in gray it probably

00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:45,350
isn't gray for them but we can actually

00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:48,559
tell what color it is well it would be

00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:54,049
an ultraviolet but what color is

00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:57,799
ultraviolet and this allows them to see

00:22:54,049 --> 00:23:01,730
millions of more colors so you could

00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:05,020
argue that our screens are not really

00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:08,240
made for zebra finches and gold fishes

00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:10,280
because pictures in red green and blue

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:14,059
do not fully represent the world they

00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:22,160
see for what do we care we're not making

00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:24,770
video games for zebra finches yet so it

00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:27,799
turns out this is a condition that is

00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:33,830
also relevant in humans this paper

00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:37,910
specifies a method to figuring out how

00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:39,830
many different cones you have and if you

00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:43,190
look into it there there's a wide range

00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:44,929
of statements of how many people are

00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:49,870
affected by this there's a genetic

00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:49,870
mutation where more than three cones and

00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,049
depending on the source you read it's

00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,299
anywhere between two three percent of

00:23:54,049 --> 00:23:59,230
all women that paper in particular says

00:23:56,299 --> 00:24:02,690
it's twelve percent of all women

00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:10,790
statistically it could be fifty percent

00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:13,610
of all women why why women well so our

00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:20,030
cones come from a gene on the X

00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:25,820
chromosome or actually are 20 p n 1 and

00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:28,040
w and w 2 and so that can give you three

00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:30,320
different color codes so if you only

00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:32,990
have one X chromosome and one y

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,450
chromosome you can have up to three

00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:39,140
different color codes but if you happen

00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:42,080
to have two X chromosomes you can in

00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:44,380
theory have up to six different color

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,380
codes

00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:50,630
those are mostly dysfunctional there are

00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:54,410
actually a few confirmed places I found

00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:56,840
at least six different cases of which

00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:59,930
two are one hundred percent confirmed

00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:02,900
with the method described in the paper

00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:05,960
to have true try crook a tetra chromic

00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:09,760
vision and the first truly confirmed

00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:13,910
case was in 2012 and as I said they see

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:17,300
99 to 100 million more colors than we do

00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:20,840
and this phenomena was actually known

00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:23,950
before because this also happens in New

00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:25,940
World monkeys where the male monkeys

00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:29,390
usually only have two different-colored

00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:32,150
cones and then the female monkeys three

00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:35,240
different color cones now interestingly

00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:40,070
there's actually an artist from San

00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:43,550
Diego she has cetera chroma see and she

00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:46,810
is painting the world the way she sees

00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:49,160
it um I don't think you can really tell

00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:51,920
with the light but there is a lot of

00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:53,660
pink going in there and the interesting

00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,910
thing is they don't just see more colors

00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:58,300
from the spectrum if you imagine to have

00:25:55,910 --> 00:26:02,420
four different color cones there's also

00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:05,600
more colors that are not on the spectrum

00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:07,670
that your brain needs to make up there

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,650
there is not just the one where you just

00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:12,440
have the outliers but there are all

00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:16,550
kinds of combinations and you could

00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:19,070
argue that for them having RGB as our

00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:25,400
generally accepted color representation

00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:29,300
is a leaky abstraction its object

00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:31,600
oriented programming who knows with this

00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,600
guy is

00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:42,340
yeah come on and he guesses Santa Claus

00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:44,650
it's Ellen K so when I first saw this

00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:47,020
picture I when I first use the picture

00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:48,880
in slide the short ribs holding things

00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:52,870
meme was very popular has anyone seen

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:55,030
that know me am I the only one such on

00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:59,200
cribs is a developer and he's holding

00:26:55,030 --> 00:27:03,550
things so I did the Allan K whole wing

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,230
things and then at the time someone took

00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:10,720
a picture of me while I was talking

00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:16,330
about this and created LMK holding me so

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:18,700
this is Ellen K who is heard of LMK okay

00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:20,170
he's generally referred to as the

00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,240
inventor of Joe object-oriented

00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:24,040
programming and many more things

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,890
actually also the inventor of the laptop

00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:29,950
computer graphical user interfaces and

00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:36,250
so on obviously he didn't do it alone he

00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:39,280
worked at xerox parc at the time and he

00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:43,090
worked with another guy called dan

00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:45,640
ingles and one day at xerox parc they

00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:50,140
got a visitor and then showing him

00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:55,240
around and the visitor was this guy who

00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:59,250
knows who that is yay raise your hands

00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:04,799
or whatever very quiet as an audience

00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:08,650
yes this is steve klavik

00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:10,840
now Steve Jobs and there's this famous

00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:15,309
quote about his visit weird i'm turning

00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:19,540
around saying that they showed him three

00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:22,000
revolutionary things and he didn't see

00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:24,910
the first one which was object-oriented

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,990
programming he also didn't see the

00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:32,190
second one which was networking they had

00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:34,920
all the computers there in one network

00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:37,059
which was revolutionary at the time

00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:41,020
because there's the third thing they

00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:43,090
showed him graphical user interface this

00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:46,150
is the graphical user interface they

00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:51,970
shown him and it was a major influence

00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:57,250
on Mac OS this particular graphical user

00:28:51,970 --> 00:29:00,010
interface this small talk ad which is

00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:05,290
both a programming language and an

00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:07,210
environment to program it in today the

00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:10,290
successor of smod or one of the

00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:14,559
successors of small talk Eddie is a

00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:19,620
squeak and this is what it looks like

00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:22,750
today and this was one of the very first

00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:24,640
fully object-oriented languages where a

00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:28,480
lot of the ideas of how object

00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:30,280
orientation works comes from and when I

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:34,150
talk to people about object orientation

00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:35,710
so two days ago I was told the

00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:38,770
javascript is not object oriented

00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:40,480
because it doesn't have classes so you

00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:42,970
could make a point that javascript is no

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,549
object oriented but it has nothing to do

00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:48,870
with classes because object orientation

00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:52,240
does not has nothing to do with classes

00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:55,390
Alan Kay says that object orientation is

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:58,140
message passing hiding of state process

00:29:55,390 --> 00:30:01,630
and extreme late binding of all things

00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:03,790
so you could argue that object

00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:08,320
orientation is what you get if you

00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:10,640
conduct combine data abstraction control

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:13,330
abstraction

00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:18,800
so why are those cones dysfunctional

00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:20,960
this is my own ideas of why they why

00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:23,870
they are dysfunctional from reading

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,370
different papers and resources I think

00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:30,880
it's because we don't see colors with

00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:33,640
our eyes we see colors with our brain I

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:37,130
mean think about it our brain adjusts

00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:41,150
colors like the light coming out there

00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:43,760
is red and blue yet this looks somewhat

00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:46,550
white to me and it's because my brain

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:53,750
tells me it's why not because it is

00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:56,510
white moreover I think that we don't see

00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:57,950
colors that we don't have an abstract

00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:59,390
concept for and there's actually

00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:02,450
something that's called the Sapphire

00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:05,150
Whorf hypothesis or linguistic

00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:09,230
relativity which says that the structure

00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:13,370
of language affects the way in which its

00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:15,380
speakers perceive the world and there's

00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:16,910
a strong version which says that it

00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:19,100
determines how we perceive the world and

00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:21,050
we personally tested we in fluent the

00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:25,190
degree in that it influences how we see

00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:29,000
the world and think about it how many

00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:41,210
colors are in a rainbow any guesses five

00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:43,460
seven ten it's 10-7 wrong millions those

00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:45,770
are fine gradients there's no border

00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:48,440
between one color on the other yet we

00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:50,960
see I see distinct colors that is

00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,970
because I don't train my brain to see

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:56,680
those distinct colors I've trained my

00:31:52,970 --> 00:32:01,190
brain to tell apart green and blue

00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:03,560
interestingly when we learn to speak the

00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:05,240
color perception our brain switches from

00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:07,760
the left brain side to the right brain

00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:11,510
side and it's because the part of the

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:15,010
brain that is used for color perception

00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:19,160
before we are able to speak is then used

00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:24,120
for language that to me also means that

00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:28,500
there is a certain link between language

00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:31,490
and color the thing I love most about

00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:38,300
programming is that we make the rules

00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:41,820
and some rules enable good programs is a

00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:47,130
single responsibility principle the

00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:49,020
heart of this no yes yes there's a list

00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:51,360
craft substitution principle can anyone

00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:53,400
has anyone heard of this this cough

00:32:51,360 --> 00:33:03,780
substitution principle can can you

00:32:53,400 --> 00:33:06,120
define it no that's wrong he says you

00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:09,750
should so what he's trying to say I

00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:11,760
think is that if you write code for a

00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:14,870
class that should work with the server

00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:17,340
class then you should be able to

00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:19,620
substitute that object of that class

00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:21,210
with an object of the subclass of that

00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:24,410
class now what you're trying to say that

00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:30,000
is wrong because when this cough

00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:31,110
formulated this principle in 1994 not

00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,950
even calling it liskov substitution

00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:40,650
principle she didn't really know about

00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:45,150
classes it's about types so it's almost

00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:50,720
correct but instead of class and

00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:53,850
subclass it should be type and subtype

00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,990
it's a law of Demeter they're solid

00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:59,280
which is actually multiple principles

00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:01,610
does anyone know which the principles

00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,610
these are

00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:12,340
yes gold star and then the principal I

00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:14,620
don't know if this is really a principle

00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:18,090
but something that I myself think it's

00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:20,440
don't abstract too much too early um I

00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:24,040
once in a while I get a pull request for

00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:27,250
Sinatra replacing those one line methods

00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:29,530
with code to generate those online

00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:32,940
methods that stand only two line shorter

00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:35,860
and harder to read in my opinion and

00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:38,679
strong external abstractions allow weak

00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:40,810
internal abstractions or what I mean by

00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:44,260
that is imagine distributed applications

00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:48,700
so we a travesty I wear a fully

00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:52,389
distributed application and the best

00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:54,100
thing if you start having small apps and

00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:57,700
only really do one thing and have a

00:34:54,100 --> 00:35:00,640
well-defined say interface API over HTTP

00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:02,260
is in that small app you can use

00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,330
whatever technology you want you can

00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:05,890
write the crappiest code ever because if

00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:09,820
there's a problem with it you can

00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:14,550
probably rewrite it in a day or two so

00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:20,440
it's magenta a color yes no any takers

00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:24,940
what will you say yes yes yes yes so

00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:28,480
those are all the colors that or these

00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:32,740
are the colors we generally see and only

00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:35,260
the colors on the on the outermost line

00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:38,590
are colors with a single frequency and

00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:43,390
then here's cut off so this is all wear

00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:49,750
green is missing and all that in there I

00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:52,750
would refer to as colors so yes so I

00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:55,360
need to hurry emit inheritance we just

00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:57,730
talked about this inheritance is used

00:35:55,360 --> 00:36:03,040
for multiple things it's used for type

00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:05,350
hierarchy and my sound is off it's used

00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,770
for type hierarchy and implementation

00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:07,770
sharing

00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:30,710
those are two different things oh yeah

00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:33,510
just give me that hello hello so our

00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:34,530
inheritance classes are used for type

00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:37,320
hierarchies and for implementation

00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:40,620
sharing and this gets even more complex

00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:42,630
with mix-ins and I think both use cases

00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:45,120
are valid but really need to think about

00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:48,990
when to use going to use inheritance and

00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:52,140
I think people should especially in Ruby

00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:54,150
rely more on composition because mixing

00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:56,580
type hierarchy and the moment Asia

00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:59,330
sharing can be very hard and you can

00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:01,590
even have type hierarchies without our

00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:04,530
inheritance for instance with black

00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:05,940
typing so are we doing it right I think

00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:08,310
that's something we should really think

00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:10,280
about and as I said classes are not

00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:14,700
necessarily object-oriented programming

00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:16,950
so color and abstractions and this is

00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:19,710
where we come to why I keep talking

00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:22,920
about color in this talk so this is

00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:26,340
theory of language evolution with how we

00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:29,850
perceive colors and this particular book

00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:33,360
is very very much debated because not

00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:36,060
not because so everyone agrees in

00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:38,670
linguistics that the further we go and

00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:40,710
civilization from hunter-gatherers to

00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:43,190
farming and so on the more colors we

00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:47,490
learn the thing that's controversial is

00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:49,290
the order in which we learn colors so

00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:52,860
many languages especially in the early

00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:54,780
stages do not have separate terms for

00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:59,100
green and blue which makes it really

00:37:54,780 --> 00:38:01,590
hard to tell apart green and blue so

00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:03,870
these are the civilization stages in the

00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:05,670
book and which color trends

00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:08,520
civilizations have at one point and

00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:10,980
there's a Himba tribe in Namibia which

00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:15,110
is well known for putting clay in their

00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:16,200
hair and they have different vocabulary

00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:18,510
for

00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:21,930
or four colors and we have a different

00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:23,490
at different lines so especially green

00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:26,160
and blue are all over the place or what

00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:28,530
we would refer to as green and blue I

00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:30,780
think at least in Hindi is very similar

00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:34,740
to an English to English where the

00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:37,410
borders are but in their language not at

00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:38,940
all so they did a test with them where

00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:40,440
they shot in two different pictures this

00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:42,030
is the first one and it was supposed to

00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,280
show which square has a different color

00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:47,550
and it's blurred out but can you spot

00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:53,970
which squares a different color so

00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:56,130
they're like 12 squares here yeah that

00:38:53,970 --> 00:39:01,109
one that one's blue and the rest is

00:38:56,130 --> 00:39:03,510
green so they sit there for quite a long

00:39:01,109 --> 00:39:05,300
time staring at it and after a few

00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:09,270
minutes they can point at this square

00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:10,920
however shown this picture they

00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:13,530
instantly see this credit has a

00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:15,180
different color it's hard to see but

00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:17,760
it's even hard to see on my screen here

00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:19,500
but it's that one and I know that

00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,329
because I watched a video of them

00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:25,319
pointing at the square they see it

00:39:21,329 --> 00:39:30,540
instantly abstraction is also a security

00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:33,089
issue most attacks rely on switching

00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:36,119
abstraction levels when the people

00:39:33,089 --> 00:39:38,550
building the system didn't expected and

00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:40,680
you might be switching down like in a

00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:43,440
heart bleed attack where you switch down

00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:46,020
to the implementation level conceptually

00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:49,890
SSL is secure but this implementation

00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:52,079
was lacking a check so heartbleed or you

00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:56,130
could switch a level up where your for

00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:58,170
instance just rely on people reusing

00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:59,910
their passwords for all the services and

00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:01,530
then you can just log into their iCloud

00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:04,589
account and steal all their private

00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:10,680
photos or even go to social engineering

00:40:04,589 --> 00:40:14,310
someone was adding fake entries for the

00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:17,040
US Secret Service and the FBI on google

00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:20,880
maps right next to where the actual FBI

00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:22,920
and Secret Service was with a fake phone

00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,740
number and then he was proxying the

00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:27,569
phone call to the FBI so people called

00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:29,600
the FBI complaining about a potential

00:40:27,569 --> 00:40:31,220
terrorist attack they were actually call

00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:36,920
that guy he was recording the whole

00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:41,150
thing and no one knew extractions are

00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:44,120
just everywhere but abstractions only

00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:45,710
exist in our mind business logic it's

00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,900
not something the computer actually

00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:51,380
knows about the computer only has

00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:53,930
transistors business logic except exists

00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:59,080
in our minds object-oriented programming

00:40:53,930 --> 00:41:03,710
exists in our minds colors UI elements

00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:06,890
countries and this doesn't mean they

00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:12,550
don't exist or are bad but they only

00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:14,780
exist as concept in our minds conclusion

00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:18,950
abstraction happens in our minds are

00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:21,950
abstractions abstraction shape how we

00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:23,840
perceive things changing abstractions is

00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:28,160
the basic principle of innovation and

00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:30,610
progress thank you and may the force be

00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,610
with you

00:41:49,809 --> 00:41:51,869
