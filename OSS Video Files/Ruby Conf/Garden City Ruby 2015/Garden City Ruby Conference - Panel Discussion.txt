okay so instead of having a traditional

00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,940
panel discussion what what we're going

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,760
to have and we should get off stage by

00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:26,970
the way it is a fish bowl instead so how

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,930
many of you know what a fishbowl is ok

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:33,720
so um a fishbowl is we're trying to make

00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:36,180
it much more interactive than a

00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,640
traditional panel discussion so here's

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,260
how this is gonna work a swan and and I

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,840
are going to moderate this sort of like

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,060
a regular panel discussion but you'll

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,559
notice we have five chairs over here but

00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,899
there are only four people sitting in

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,730
these chairs the fishbowl basically

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,670
states that anyone who is currently

00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,230
sitting is allowed to speak all at the

00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,210
same time whatever but like anyone who's

00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,910
currently sitting is allowed to speak so

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,039
swan and i are going to like try to

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,140
guide the conversation or whatever in

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,390
general and whoever sitting here is

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,190
allowed to answer the questions or put

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,770
in their thoughts on whatever the points

00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:12,360
are now you as the audience right you

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,990
obviously know much better than these

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:18,869
panelists so are you you are gonna get

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:22,110
here yay I get to speak all the time

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:24,299
this work so on so if you and the

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,799
audience wants to put in your two cents

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,740
and you want to make your points known

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,320
just come up on stage and just sit in

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,210
the empty chair the rule is as soon as

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,579
someone sits in the empty chair one of

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,890
you four people have to leave and what

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:41,579
if we're off us leave together make you

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,799
say that we are here for so one of you

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,110
have to leave in case of none of you

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,430
leaving we are going to choose we were

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,840
going to be the tiebreakers to figure

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,439
out which one of you were going to boot

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,299
off um can I ask people on over here to

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:57,420
kind of occupy the sits in the middle

00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:00,090
please so um you can enter the stage

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,079
from over here so we expect if people

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,460
are going to queue up because they

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:08,310
really want to say something about this

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:11,460
topic this is the area what if the fifth

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,840
person doesn't come nobody has not met

00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,670
then then you just you just continue

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:20,490
talking in that case you can continue

00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:22,470
you can use come back so so we're going

00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,540
to ask like a couple of questions and

00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,970
we're going to just see how it goes

00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,540
right okay at the very first question

00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,250
you

00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,349
start with is going to be Ruby because

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,810
this is ruby conference so I want to ask

00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:36,420
all the panelists here what is the one

00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,920
thing that confuses the most about Ruby

00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,599
to you or what is one thing that you

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,239
really dislike about Ruby even if

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,730
hearing a lot of good things about to be

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,709
so far so this is now is the time to

00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,569
speak up something you don't like about

00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:50,250
to be or orbitz very confuse what that

00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:51,569
you don't know how to use or what is the

00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:55,170
one thing that makes you wanna strangle

00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:57,569
someone every time you see this every

00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:03,239
time you see this and something ideally

00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:05,340
unique to Ruby can I go first so others

00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,439
not really specific to Ruby but ror

00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,269
which I'm assuming a lot of people here

00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,189
use I think one of the things that I

00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:12,659
find all you always find really

00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:15,180
confusing is you know everything is

00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:17,939
super easy to do but you don't realize

00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,950
what queries or DB queries end up

00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:22,290
happening when you do a very simple you

00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,359
know look up maybe you're just accessing

00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:26,310
something from a product from a bunch of

00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:27,930
tables and multiple joins are happening

00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,269
or n plus 1 queries are happening and

00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,400
you don't find out about it until you

00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:34,199
really start digging deep so everything

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,879
seems super easy but to really do it

00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:38,069
well and to do it right you need to

00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:39,540
understand what kind of queries end up

00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:42,419
happening because of what you're trying

00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:44,790
to do so that was like too much magic I

00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:46,829
thought that you could get good minuses

00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,810
that's why I like to recommend to people

00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:51,299
to have all the database queries in

00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:59,489
their views because then they're really

00:03:51,299 --> 00:04:01,530
easy to find sure so I'm going to go

00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:03,209
little make on this question and not

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,370
talk about the Ruby language itself but

00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:07,530
I'm talking we'll talk about more about

00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,659
people and lot of people in Ruby

00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:12,209
community and overall across all

00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:15,239
communities is this habit of you face a

00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:16,859
problem and you see that there is this

00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,500
one particular gem which is in you know

00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:21,090
zero point zero point one version but

00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,440
it's also a problem just want to go and

00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:24,389
install it without even looking at the

00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,949
code without understanding what exactly

00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:28,169
that gem does what impact it is going to

00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:30,630
have on your overall ecosystem when you

00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:32,490
know when you go for upgrade and this

00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:36,240
you have to upgrade every six months

00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:38,130
that's like and gems don't work you can

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,320
just not upgrade forever I mean that's

00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:41,200
what I usually do yeah and if I see

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,390
those projects those are

00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,580
most confusing projects if you see a

00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:47,230
race to lotto project right now you

00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,390
wouldn't know what to do do dodo that

00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:51,130
your friend if there is a security issue

00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:55,990
that is fixed then it like you'll have

00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:57,190
to upgrade and then good stuff well she

00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:03,670
do it sounds like you want to come up

00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:05,770
here and say this yeah for me or what

00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:10,900
confuses me most is more than Ruby third

00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:12,820
Ruby used to actually like good it's

00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,680
it's actually like how you take one

00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,420
pattern one person speaking very good

00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,830
about that and the door you display you

00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:20,050
speak on the same topic there would be

00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:22,000
another person would be like totally

00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:24,160
speaking the other way over it like

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,990
rubies like not one way to overtly that

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,090
is like no one right way to do it and

00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:41,710
then it's always like many more ways to

00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:45,130
do so I personally dislike it when so

00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:46,930
there this is really productive part of

00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:49,210
the Ruby community that writes a lot of

00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:52,900
gems we all rely on their mostly in

00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:56,200
Seattle and they all use this project

00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:58,360
management library called ho and I just

00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,280
dislike it every time they start in your

00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,570
project like Aaron suds in your project

00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,270
the first thing I want to do is send him

00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:06,520
a pull request to remove home all right

00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:08,340
is it's just way too much magic for what

00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:11,530
you could just write in your gem file

00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:13,080
your jumps back sorry I mean I just put

00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:16,180
the whole gem in the jump I'll right

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:21,910
yeah yeah we could also all just use

00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:26,110
just and github I usually run into this

00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:28,570
problem where someone's work on a code

00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:32,880
base especially in rails with all of

00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:37,930
these super nice high-level declarative

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:40,270
extremely expressive api's without

00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:43,720
understanding how any of that translates

00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:46,570
into plain vanilla Ruby which and the

00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,580
code that produces is is really hard to

00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:50,110
understand because the whoever wrote it

00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,420
hasn't paid attention to what it's

00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,430
actually doing sometimes it's even buggy

00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,700
because

00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:58,710
you know I mean that there is a common

00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,870
thing we hear about this red rails

00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,760
program are not a Ruby programmer and I

00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,980
think that rails program is easily

00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:10,170
produce extremely extremely difficult to

00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:12,240
understand Ruby code i want to say i

00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:17,150
love flip-flops is anyone no flip-flops

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:22,140
and Ruby yes they're the best thing ever

00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:25,650
okay one thing that I'm not sure whether

00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:29,060
I like it's not technical it's a let's

00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:32,040
say culture thing that if you are not

00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:34,410
changing everything every other week

00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:37,290
then you're just not cool in there will

00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:39,420
be community so I don't remember whether

00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:42,870
I don't know whether anybody remembers

00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:45,900
Weber at which used to be a thing okay

00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:50,040
and then I I kinda got distracted for

00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:52,530
like 10 days then I got back to Ruby I

00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:55,470
try to use a web right and its budget I

00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:58,380
mean it's seriously pocketed with

00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:01,380
something core doesn't work and I II

00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:04,260
asked on Twitter and people are like oh

00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:06,930
man where breath that's you're so last

00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:10,140
month now everybody's using capable and

00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:12,300
this looks cool to us but there are

00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:15,210
people like operations there are people

00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,940
my age in operation so who are really

00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:20,040
rubbed the wrong way by this so they

00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,470
poke fun at me oh you're doing your

00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:24,570
rubia yeah you're young me your hipster

00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:26,660
what did you change tonight does it

00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:30,750
still work this morning you're not and

00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:34,980
i'm a bit fed up with that ok so maybe

00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:37,380
playing in sorry good so i wanted to

00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:40,860
share this I have seen most people are

00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:44,040
getting confused with how scoping

00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:47,160
working works in Ruby so many people

00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:49,650
right class method private class methods

00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:52,350
in the wrong way even in today's one of

00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:56,130
the talk one of the slide I have seen

00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:59,310
they have written private class method

00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:02,010
under just privates that scope that

00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:03,870
doesn't make it private so people have

00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:05,280
to really read about how scoping words

00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:08,320
in rupee

00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:11,740
yeah the one thing that is the smallest

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,510
piece of stuff which always bugs me and

00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:16,360
get me you know really pissed off our to

00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:18,400
be is the Equality part you have equal

00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,880
to equal to you have the case equality

00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:26,800
operator eql method you equ al ? method

00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:29,050
at that's crazy for me okay um one thing

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,510
which I want to say is interview people

00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:34,090
a lot of and they are ruby-on-rails

00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:36,310
programmer and I ask them question sorry

00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:38,470
Ruby programmer and they say no no no I

00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:41,170
am restore amar and that'd be like

00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:43,870
anything okay other people are

00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:46,120
completely about soils developers so the

00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:48,760
next question what I find most annoying

00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,840
on Facebook is people with DSLR cameras

00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,180
you know like taking photos on

00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,490
themselves what I figured out is DSLR

00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:57,310
stands for dsl's and Ruby are this the

00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:59,950
most annoying thing you've ever seen DSS

00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:06,760
in Ruby I have another complain to you

00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:12,190
cannot leave this cool though all right

00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:13,720
let's get can you that it on the deer

00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:15,400
cells and Ruby are they are they an

00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:20,500
amazing thing to happen or are they

00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:22,630
horrible oh no nad is it oh I'm saying

00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,880
us make us an amazing amazing so but

00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:27,370
does it like does it hide like what's

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,100
actually happening underneath it like so

00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:31,540
obviously uh you cannot say that I'm

00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,740
going to use this DSS and I'm not going

00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,690
to read about that Jen that was my first

00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,790
complaint right whenever you are using a

00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:38,470
DSL you have to dig into it you have to

00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:40,120
understand how that library is actually

00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:42,880
working how that library is actually

00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:45,730
converting that dsl into runnable code

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,110
when you in r-spec right it should

00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,820
something where that hit method is

00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:50,680
coming from you need to go and dig it

00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:54,550
unless a little you dig that yes it is

00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:56,620
annoying let's say that for dsl like

00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:59,380
anything else it should be easy to do

00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:02,380
simple things impossible to do complex

00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:04,780
thanks so a if it works the other way

00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:07,600
around then it probably sucks but for

00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:10,390
example rake it works like that and it's

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,730
great because you can use the rake and

00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:14,620
then go deeper when you need it yeah and

00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:16,720
one more thing is that dsl's are very

00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:19,110
opinionated like the person who is

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,420
trying to solve a genetic problem

00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:24,160
it's his point of view and unless he

00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,380
fails to match her it over the period of

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,019
time or the committee then things like

00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:31,060
folks happen like like I don't want to

00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:33,070
get into this butthole puppet chef thing

00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:35,230
happened because of that because it was

00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:37,180
very open reason if anyone has anything

00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,800
else do I don't hesitate just just

00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:44,019
reductions if body ones have like

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:45,610
questions let me complete know okay I'm

00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:46,570
actually interesting that you brought

00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,370
this up because the other thing that

00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:50,230
really bugs me about dsl's is pretty

00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,480
much all you're doing is depending

00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:54,640
heavily on that particular specific API

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,300
and when the library doesn't respect

00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:01,870
versioning I mean is just appalling like

00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:03,579
I just did this this coaching session a

00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:06,310
few months ago and I was like well rails

00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:07,750
for obviously we gonna use can can and I

00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:10,570
hadn't touched rails in two months and

00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:12,760
can can can can was broken I mean what a

00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:15,880
chemical game was broken that was also

00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:18,820
broken everything was broken and watch

00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:25,899
and what what can can can can I got that

00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:28,600
bad the joke was can can count the

00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:30,220
problem with DSS is that when you start

00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,510
designing a dsl you have to name it

00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,060
properly and if you actually get it

00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:36,790
wrong it can be pretty stupid you know

00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:40,149
when when it should and it should not it

00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:42,190
really doesn't make much sense then so

00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:44,770
the next question oh before you continue

00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:47,740
I just realized that it just happened by

00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:53,709
coincidence is the rubicon organizing

00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:55,779
team city on stage you're going to move

00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:57,700
the next question if the question is

00:12:55,779 --> 00:13:00,310
when you're starting on a jujube project

00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,079
what's the one gem that must exist in

00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:05,199
your gemfile not counting rails and

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:08,620
bundler I can tell you what I don't like

00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:14,020
is a race bootstrap gem and i'll tell

00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:15,790
you what i like is our state though the

00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:18,940
one I don't like to have is the Ruby

00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:21,579
racer obviously there has to be one of

00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:26,150
either PG or my cigarette or sequel on

00:13:21,579 --> 00:13:31,730
mon good i'm going to okay all right

00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:33,470
summer book dude the gym for me I used

00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:36,440
by default days I could just started I

00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:38,270
just and add using device but I think

00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,130
rails the latest version has got a

00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:43,850
secure password now so I don't feel

00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:46,940
really needed okay so since we have the

00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:48,320
Rubicon team on stage let's break you

00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:51,070
guys up a little bit said oh can you

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:57,560
stay where you are a Jay onwards please

00:13:51,070 --> 00:14:01,580
and can I have Lena on stage you know

00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:07,850
please maybe Steve and Satish thallium

00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:12,980
if he's around oh yeah sorry Paolo you

00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:14,210
want to come on stage also yell at

00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:21,020
Stevie didn't actually pay for his

00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:23,210
conference ticket up ok later ok so good

00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:25,520
so the next question actually we want to

00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:27,800
put foot to everybody not just the panel

00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,630
is about like building a career in

00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,730
software should should you be a

00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:33,560
general-purpose programmer knowing and

00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:35,710
your entire stack or should you be

00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,700
building your carrier towards focused

00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:39,680
towards a particular technology or a

00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,030
particular part of the stack that's the

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,860
larger question I want to put forth and

00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:45,740
I want to hear what everybody all of you

00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:47,330
have to say on this so remember these

00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,420
four get the first shot at this question

00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:51,890
but everyone else feel free to come and

00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:53,480
displace any of them yeah these are the

00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:56,710
kinds of things where everybody does

00:14:53,480 --> 00:15:00,020
have an opinion so folks please come up

00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:02,480
are you trying to run away for free are

00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:14,180
you trying to to go away from the stage

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:17,740
is that self-serving any sure so we have

00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:21,500
a few folks in our office actually who

00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:23,330
who don't speak English and who a couple

00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:26,920
of guys in the office have been teaching

00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:29,330
English to for the past month or two and

00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:33,380
conversely I've been trying to learn

00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:35,000
Hindi and part of why I haven't learned

00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:38,330
Hindi in four years of living in India

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,540
is because it's very painful to go back

00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:42,420
and be a

00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:44,070
vegan and when I'm learning Hindi I am

00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:46,079
younger than two years old like I'd

00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:49,230
sound completely ridiculous my accent is

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:52,170
wrong all the letters are wrong and if

00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:54,420
you step out of your comfort zone you

00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:57,180
are doing exactly that right so if I go

00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:59,190
and try to do operations I am a

00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,630
two-year-old trying to do operation so

00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,889
like oh I don't know how to set up the

00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:03,899
diagnostics and I don't know how to

00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:07,050
automate this thing I don't know pretty

00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:09,509
much everything in the stack right but

00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:11,550
what's fun about that is that when we're

00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:14,009
teaching the folks in the office english

00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:17,370
i can draw comparisons to computer

00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:19,410
science right and as I'm learning Hindi

00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:22,470
or at least attempting to learn handy I

00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:24,930
can draw more comparisons to teaching

00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:28,319
English and to computer science and two

00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:32,130
operations and to Ruby and to see and to

00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:36,180
whatever other parts of my job exists

00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:38,430
and so I think those there's been pushes

00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:40,620
from both sides to become overall

00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:44,130
generalists or overall specialists and I

00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:46,949
think that they're both wrong right and

00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:48,779
I actually had a mental answer to the

00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:51,209
very first question which is what

00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:54,480
bothers me about the Ruby community and

00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:57,300
it's not on the whole but it's something

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,760
that I see in every community a little

00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:03,209
bit and will be more than others

00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:05,010
sometimes is that you've stopped

00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:08,250
learning if there isn't a point where

00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:10,949
there's no magic right so the first time

00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,850
you come to Ruby movie itself is magical

00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:14,730
and then when you come to ruby-on-rails

00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:17,370
ruby on rails is magical if you feel

00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:18,630
like you know it all then you need to go

00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,880
find the thing that's magical and

00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:23,010
confusing and makes you feel stupid so

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,900
that you can learn and relearn the

00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:32,850
things that you already know again in my

00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:35,909
opinion okay here someone else um I have

00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:38,400
a more so this is this is the question

00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:40,500
that I got a lot i was i was at at the

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,000
college i graduated form for the for the

00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,010
batch which was starting to do

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,919
placements and i got a very specific

00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:48,780
aspect of this question depth versus

00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:51,840
breath right do i go really deep down

00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,440
and specialize on in one language even

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,379
vs

00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,480
and I think that's a very difficult

00:17:55,379 --> 00:17:59,610
question to answer because it

00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,259
fundamentally depends on what you want

00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:03,929
to look your working life to look like

00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:05,190
over the next five to ten years because

00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:08,789
this is not a question that you take

00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:12,149
lightly I think the trade-offs are lie

00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:14,370
between say something like becoming an

00:18:12,149 --> 00:18:16,529
expert with the jvm or with a particular

00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:18,450
kind of database now what this means is

00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:20,220
it puts you in a position where all the

00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:22,710
hardest problems in the space come to

00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:25,740
you because that's why people hire you

00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:27,990
to crack that problem but you are taking

00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,190
the risk that if something changes in

00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,750
the industry and your area of

00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:32,879
specialization becomes obsolete

00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,990
overnight which does happen you left

00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:37,259
high and dry and you're looking at a

00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:38,639
fairly steep learning curve the other

00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:40,289
advantage with this is if you're a

00:18:38,639 --> 00:18:42,840
freelancer your rates are really good

00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:44,460
because again I mean you're you've got a

00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,980
depth of knowledge which which very few

00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:49,049
people have but on the flip side yet

00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,659
again you're talking about Nash

00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:54,629
relatively more skill sets so you may

00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:57,960
have a hard time finding a suitable role

00:18:54,629 --> 00:18:59,750
to to to you know that sort of fulfills

00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,129
you in terms of what you want to do

00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,870
people abroad on the other hand have

00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:05,519
have a different set of advantages and

00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:08,070
disadvantages you get a much wider range

00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,779
of work the work is likely to be more

00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:11,429
choppy because you're doing so many

00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:14,610
different things so they may be some

00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:16,169
things you enjoy and don't but I think

00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:17,730
it's completely a personal choice as to

00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:19,289
what you when how you end your way

00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:24,740
between these two I don't think anybody

00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:28,679
else can tell you hi can you hear me

00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:31,700
good hold of my closet you're all right

00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:35,100
with somebody else like coconut okay um

00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:38,370
what I I mean just do a quick background

00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:41,700
okay I'm actually ASAP professional I'm

00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:43,649
an enterprise architect i work for HP my

00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:48,029
primary it's not at all related to roomy

00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:49,440
but um the point the I'm a software

00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:51,090
engineer I mean I started a software

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,320
engineer I'm still a soft when Geneva

00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:56,070
know him an enterprise architect have

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:58,200
pins of different roles and what I have

00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:59,399
not I have been learning from being

00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,009
rails and stuff for the past two years

00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:03,869
as a hobby and now I'm a lot more

00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:05,549
interested but what I have figured out

00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:07,080
is that

00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:08,669
the question was you know whether you

00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,789
have need to have depth in one area or

00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:13,980
just have a broad classification what is

00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:15,330
important I mean if you call yourself a

00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:18,239
software engineer or the developer

00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:20,190
program or whatever the first thing is

00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:22,799
you're an engineer I mean you want to be

00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:24,659
an engineer and the point of being an

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:27,840
agent is one you need to understand how

00:20:24,659 --> 00:20:30,989
it works and the first thing you need to

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,820
know very well before you even go into

00:20:30,989 --> 00:20:34,379
the depth of a particular language or

00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,450
what ways you need to get your

00:20:34,379 --> 00:20:38,249
fundamentals right and you need to be

00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:40,499
constantly learning like the

00:20:38,249 --> 00:20:43,200
fundamentals I learned in 98 it is cuz

00:20:40,499 --> 00:20:45,419
I'm that old okay here in a graduated a

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,210
very different from now I mean we had

00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:51,149
totally the paradigms were different but

00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:54,299
the paradigms are now even more are

00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:57,600
better out saying some expert in some

00:20:54,299 --> 00:21:00,600
areas but unless your fundamentals are

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,789
good and proper I mean it's very

00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:07,230
difficult to actually be a good

00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:08,509
developer just a good programmer so once

00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:11,279
you get your final fundamentals right

00:21:08,509 --> 00:21:14,580
it'll guide you on whether you want to

00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:16,739
go dep in depth or broader either way

00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,389
you'll be a good developer but if

00:21:16,739 --> 00:21:21,179
animals are not good it doesn't really

00:21:18,389 --> 00:21:24,389
matter I mean you could be you could

00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:27,570
study and whatever but somewhere your

00:21:24,389 --> 00:21:32,429
code was not be proper sometimes amay or

00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:34,559
um why she's shaking right some

00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:36,899
somewhere your architecture your the way

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,820
you design stuff I mean even you even as

00:21:36,899 --> 00:21:40,289
a programmer the first thing you do is a

00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:42,059
program is you sit and design in your

00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:44,970
own mind how's the logic is going to

00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:48,720
flow right and unless you're fun amounts

00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:50,580
are good and this is something I see and

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:54,210
when we have new staff or we have you

00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:55,529
have new hires coming in the if the

00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:56,909
funny memes are good we can do

00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:58,799
everything else I mean your

00:21:56,909 --> 00:22:01,259
communications we can improve everything

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,690
else we can work on we can even teach

00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:05,399
you to code but the basic software

00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:07,379
fundamentals they have to be really good

00:22:05,399 --> 00:22:09,149
like we're talking ruby rails we're

00:22:07,379 --> 00:22:13,529
talking so the fundaments we're talking

00:22:09,149 --> 00:22:15,899
our SAS IAS pass those need to be very

00:22:13,529 --> 00:22:17,999
strong you understand those well then

00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:20,759
you know what language is just is just a

00:22:17,999 --> 00:22:23,129
matter of couple of months oh yeah I

00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:27,090
think it depends that's the easier

00:22:23,129 --> 00:22:30,269
answer right both has pros and cons of

00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:33,359
going into whether but you need to get

00:22:30,269 --> 00:22:36,269
some breakfast to go into depth to

00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:39,600
understand okay to experiment many

00:22:36,269 --> 00:22:41,309
things and then go into depth so I and I

00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,889
think I completely agree with stephen

00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:45,659
what he mentioned earlier if you are

00:22:43,889 --> 00:22:47,970
ready to go outside your comfort zone

00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:49,559
you can always get into actually guys I

00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:51,539
disagree video by the way I notice all

00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:54,149
five chairs are filled someone needs to

00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:55,859
get up and leave actually I disagree

00:22:54,149 --> 00:23:00,090
with all of you all to a certain extent

00:22:55,859 --> 00:23:05,999
waited totally ignore what i said let's

00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:07,950
do that again so depends knowing that we

00:23:05,999 --> 00:23:09,840
are at a ruby conference i'm assuming

00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:11,220
everyone here is at least a developer

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,950
are there any managers in the house are

00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:16,830
there any solution architects in the

00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:19,190
house i actually can't see any edge are

00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:21,899
there any people really do any work here

00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:23,970
and when you are actually doing this you

00:23:21,899 --> 00:23:26,519
can become a solution architect and you

00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:27,899
can become a managers only if you

00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:29,879
actually have the technology depth to

00:23:27,899 --> 00:23:32,849
get into a technology role and when you

00:23:29,879 --> 00:23:35,399
are doing this as as early as possible

00:23:32,849 --> 00:23:38,099
the deeper you dig into any to any sort

00:23:35,399 --> 00:23:40,409
of poured actually makes a difference so

00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:42,179
whether you are getting to learn ruby or

00:23:40,409 --> 00:23:43,980
if you're looking at our spec dig as

00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:45,749
deep end if you get the good part is

00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:47,999
that we working on sometimes open source

00:23:45,749 --> 00:23:49,980
systems you can dig as deep as you want

00:23:47,999 --> 00:23:51,960
to learn as much as you can and Tony you

00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:53,789
in going to improve your knowledge so in

00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,879
my opinion if you're a developer and you

00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:58,950
enjoy it just keep digging deeper and we

00:23:56,879 --> 00:24:00,570
you know question everything and it will

00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:02,279
make you better better programmer if

00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:03,480
that's what you intend to be if if

00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:06,149
you're not a programmer then you

00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:08,279
probably shouldn't be sitting it yeah i

00:24:06,149 --> 00:24:12,809
just take this point forward that you

00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:15,480
know i got this job because you know and

00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:17,759
one of the best database company in the

00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:21,450
world well because in the last five

00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:24,059
years i have explored or have worked on

00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:26,700
almost all the web frameworks mobile

00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:27,750
frameworks and all so i am not a master

00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,960
of all but

00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:33,030
you know jack jack off all but now but

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:37,560
what i would recommend is you need to be

00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:39,600
good in one area at least and then you

00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:42,150
have to spread out and broad base

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,310
yourself so if you want to be a solution

00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:47,790
architect then you need to broad base

00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:49,200
and if you want to be a specialist then

00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:52,350
you need to stick that's actually

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:56,250
completely / 04 lean acid okay I have a

00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:58,260
different question because in a row has

00:24:56,250 --> 00:25:01,860
been talked about are you saying our

00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:05,400
questions aren't good enough it's asking

00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:08,820
a question okay so basically when I was

00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:10,740
starting my last company that time we

00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:13,590
chose PHP I had a lot of prejudice with

00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:17,520
it but eventually it worked out very

00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:19,140
well but in Ruby I am starting my next

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,360
company and the biggest problem i am

00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:25,430
facing right now of choosing rails as

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:29,010
the primary technology is basically

00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:33,420
ubuntu it has LTS it promises something

00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:35,280
for a longer time there is PHP in PHP

00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:38,670
people actually criticize it to the

00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:40,590
depth I have spoke a lot of people and I

00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:43,440
don't like it myself but it worked for

00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:45,420
me but the most important thing is they

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:49,050
said that five years will support this

00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:51,240
framework in Ruby world I did not code

00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:53,670
for three and half years and two major

00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:55,650
language changes happen and the

00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:58,650
framework was changed completely over

00:25:55,650 --> 00:26:00,180
sorry man now the thing is I am NOT

00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:02,400
against moving fast the biggest problem

00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:04,740
is if I'm basing my next company on it

00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,500
and I have to actually support that

00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:09,510
product for 45 years am I going to

00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,900
rewrite that whole product in twice

00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:14,910
during that time are i am going to

00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,680
actually start losing gem like my

00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:19,650
soldiers on the ground one by one and

00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:24,240
these people don't support me at all so

00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:25,770
I am always in this perplexing what is

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,230
the right thing what people do think

00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:31,080
about this is it really bad to support

00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:32,760
something for a long time or is it just

00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,020
not good enough to support something for

00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,370
a long time okay and I think we're

00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:38,400
coming to the last five minutes so let's

00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:39,480
just keep all our show in one word each

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,100
table you should write everything

00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,840
changes and one

00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,520
of the keywords in Ruby is always called

00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,049
refactoring you always end up

00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:49,080
refactoring what we actually miss out on

00:26:46,049 --> 00:26:51,960
is in production environment you need to

00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:54,049
have the I wanted to say the right word

00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:57,000
you know it's a round spherical thing

00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:58,710
you need to have the guts to actually

00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,190
say that you know what i am going to

00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:04,200
upgrade my systems i am going to do this

00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:05,940
weather if your own product you should

00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,370
upgrade to the latest version you should

00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:10,860
take a take the leap of faith don't if

00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:12,270
you are saying what i am getting at if

00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,590
you're in the services company it's a

00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:15,000
big issue i know there are a lot of

00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:17,460
people who work in services companies

00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,730
are customer did not allow me we've

00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:22,890
actually got that is more like an excuse

00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:24,840
is that we actually have an unwritten

00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:27,059
rule don't tell the customer just create

00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,710
a gator branch upgrade it make sure it

00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:31,230
works make sure text passes you have

00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:33,390
good you know code quality and just run

00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:35,400
with it it just worried yeah you didn't

00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:37,320
ask the customer when you shut down with

00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:41,460
raised so why should I ask you when when

00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:43,500
you have the upgrade so I have two

00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:45,179
things to say here so one is something

00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:49,919
related to the current discussion which

00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:51,210
is instead of putting it as the issue it

00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,500
is something which keeps you going so

00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:54,630
which keeps your meter running because

00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,909
the customer always needs you dependency

00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:58,890
doesn't go so that is one way of putting

00:27:56,909 --> 00:28:01,440
it so people in this do make money

00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:03,750
because of that anyway coming to the

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,630
original question I have one more angle

00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:08,940
to the whole thing which would be it

00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:11,490
depends on how comfortable a person is

00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:14,909
in adapting to new things and picking up

00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:17,280
new skills and learning okay so if if

00:28:14,909 --> 00:28:19,860
somebody is really good I myself have

00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:22,080
worked over different domains and

00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:23,669
verticals all together okay i was in

00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,270
infrastructure space and now i'm a

00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:29,370
solution architect and blah blah blah i

00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:32,340
am comfortable picking up things okay so

00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:35,309
we're a full stack programmer programmer

00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:38,610
I mean diversified skill set everything

00:28:35,309 --> 00:28:40,770
works yes if you find picking up new

00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:43,710
things working outside the comfort zone

00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:44,760
everything takes time i would say stick

00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:47,760
to the particular thing what you are

00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:49,200
doing do it good it will be helpful so

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,340
we're open to audience QA now anybody

00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,990
has any question we're going to just

00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,610
take one question for the audience again

00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:54,580
like whatever whatever you guys want

00:28:53,610 --> 00:29:00,510
just anything

00:28:54,580 --> 00:29:00,510
yeah everybody raised their hand Gotham

00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:12,100
what after Ruby what language if you had

00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:14,649
a choice what would he choose so the

00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:16,630
question is what's next after Ruby if

00:29:14,649 --> 00:29:20,860
you had a choice what would you choose

00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:24,250
next functional stuff whatever pays my

00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:26,320
bills which one I would wear with

00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:28,419
anything which makes money if I have to

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,429
do that after yours I like the way you

00:29:28,419 --> 00:29:36,340
say like we finally have one honest man

00:29:30,429 --> 00:29:38,590
is on you you keep talking about

00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:43,570
solution architects I don't exactly know

00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:45,760
what that is it sounds like fun because

00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:53,049
everybody's loving but what the heck is

00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:55,360
that that is too tempting man a solution

00:29:53,049 --> 00:29:56,830
architect pardon the if anybody has that

00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,610
title in your company I'm really sorry

00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:02,470
about it but in my opinion my opinion a

00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:04,750
solution architect is a person comes

00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:07,950
there how many of you have seen

00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:12,519
MasterChef right masterchef australia

00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:15,029
like hmm i think the consistency you

00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:19,600
know of this the database is not right I

00:30:15,029 --> 00:30:24,700
think the scalability this is pretty

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:29,620
cool made anything I have just tasted it

00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:31,330
but i have given an opinion ok so that

00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:33,210
is a solution architect of bigger

00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:35,919
companies typical big companies groups

00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:37,510
solution architect for smaller startups

00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,779
and growing companies are much different

00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:44,919
I mean you are one it's the same thing

00:30:40,779 --> 00:30:46,720
without the scale really oh the bigger

00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:48,940
companies yes what he said makes a lot

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,799
of sense there but startups and growing

00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:52,870
companies it's more like where you need

00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:55,779
to be hands-on you need to have depth ok

00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:58,960
any other questions and I think I think

00:30:55,779 --> 00:31:00,519
we're out of time I think we're all the

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,090
time so on that happy note we're going

00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:04,669
to move over to the keynote situation

00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:06,820
unchanged

00:31:04,669 --> 00:31:06,820
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,320
