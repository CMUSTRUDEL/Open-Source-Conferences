Playlist: MWRC 2013
Description: 
	Ops at GitHub has a unique challenge - keeping up with the rabid pace of features and products that the GitHub team develops. In this talk, we'll focus on tools and techniques we use to rapidly and confidently ship infrastructure changes using Campfire and Hubot as our primary interface, and the benefits we've seen from this approach.

00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:28,130
everyone so uh I'm Jesse and I do

00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:31,040
opposite github or DevOps or whatever

00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:32,870
the kids are calling it these days so

00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:37,400
today I'm going to be talking about chat

00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:38,570
offs at github so what is chat Ops chat

00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,910
ups is what we've been calling the

00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:43,250
pattern of automating common operational

00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:45,680
tasks with Cuba before I go any further

00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:48,110
I just want to get a show of hands how

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,120
many of you use some type of group chat

00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:53,230
like IRC or campfire in your daily

00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:59,540
development cool how many of you deploy

00:00:53,230 --> 00:01:00,880
from that environment ok how many of you

00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:08,119
deploy from the command line

00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:11,390
all right cool so Hugh bot cubot began

00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:13,550
as a simple campfire bot but it's

00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,690
evolved into a lot more a lot of people

00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,670
have a perception of Hugh bot is

00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:19,550
something that just shows funny pictures

00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:22,820
and cat pictures for us it does a lot of

00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:25,069
that I promise but it's not just that

00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,700
Hugh BOTS really the primary control

00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:30,110
service for our infrastructure so

00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:32,090
explaining the principles of chat ops

00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:33,800
uniform the outside and it's it's really

00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:36,979
kind of hard so I'm just going to start

00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,630
off with an example let's say that we've

00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:40,940
made some updates to our internal get

00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,990
package and we think it's ready to go

00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,399
but we want to roll down in the

00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:45,590
controlled fashion and establish

00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:47,750
confidence in it right so we use puppet

00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:50,259
for configuration management apologies

00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,729
to all the chef folks in the house but

00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:54,950
we use Hugh bot to interact with puppet

00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:57,950
so here's how we manage these changes in

00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:00,349
a chat op style so we have a github repo

00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:02,060
for a puppet repository this is all the

00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:04,250
boring stuff you guys you all know how

00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,509
this works we check out a branch we make

00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:08,450
the change to the version number of the

00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:10,580
package we make a commit and then we

00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:14,930
push that up to github and create a pull

00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:16,700
request so once you're you know once

00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,870
you're writing the pull request in the

00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,940
middle of writing the pull request in

00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,040
campfire we have a CI bought that

00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,209
pipes in the output of the build every

00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,040
branch it's pushed up to github as

00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:29,469
automatic is automatically sent through

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,489
CI so that's generally pretty helpful so

00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:34,069
what now that you know that branch is

00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:37,189
green you use Hugh about to deploy

00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:38,120
that branch to production that just

00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:39,290
means in this case that we're updating

00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,629
the puppet master so it has an

00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:45,200
environment set up that's called the

00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:47,389
same thing get gh 13 when you do that

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,069
cubot gives you the deploy output it

00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:52,430
tells you we've restarted the puppet

00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:54,769
master so a puppet has a no op mode that

00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,510
we'd like to use to establish confidence

00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:57,709
we were rolling out changes to make sure

00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,560
they don't have any unintended side

00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:02,629
effects it stimulates what would happen

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,049
if you ran puppet with this branch so we

00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:08,060
run that with you bot - and who bought

00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:10,760
returns the output you can see here that

00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:17,150
the version number of get would have

00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:18,230
changed so now that the no op has given

00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,230
us some confidence that this is going to

00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:22,849
do what we want we're gonna roll out the

00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:24,949
new get version to one file server maybe

00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:27,530
to keep you know keep the possible

00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:30,919
impact of regressions small so we'll

00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:32,750
roll it out to file server one and when

00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,099
we do that again if you bots showed us

00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:38,959
the output lets us know the package

00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:40,669
actually change looks good so now this

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,109
new package is out and we want to check

00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:44,840
on some stuff and see that it's actually

00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:46,220
working right we've added support the

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,129
Hugh bot for showing us graphs from

00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:52,069
collecti and graphite so we asked you

00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:53,780
about for that graph we take a look at

00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:55,310
this it looks you know it looks

00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,400
relatively normal this is within normal

00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:00,199
bounds so feeling pretty good about it

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,509
maybe we've checked a couple other more

00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:03,889
places and if we're confident that this

00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:06,919
version looks good let's we're gonna

00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:11,090
roll it out everywhere so from there we

00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:14,209
merged the pull request you bot lets us

00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:16,220
knows that know that that happened to CI

00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:18,099
fires again to make sure master is green

00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:22,759
you about till you see that

00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:25,460
and once CI passes the master branch is

00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:27,080
automatically deployed to production of

00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,610
course cubot late lets you know that

00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,020
that you were the one that merged the

00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,440
pull request so you're actually doing

00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:35,120
that even though he's doing it for you

00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:40,909
and when it's done you get the same

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:43,099
notification so now that the new version

00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:45,139
of git is on master we can force the

00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:46,360
ship of it everywhere puppet runs on an

00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:48,729
interval you know kind of like

00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,289
or whatever but sometimes when we're

00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:51,939
doing a controlled rollout like this we

00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:53,949
want to want to force it out and make

00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:57,759
sure that it's happening all at once so

00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:59,680
we roll it out everywhere and here again

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,539
cubot tells us that the packaged version

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:06,069
was changed on all the different file

00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:07,300
servers so again to check the impact of

00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:10,120
the deploy we checked the load on all

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,919
file servers looks good

00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,819
that red ones a little weird but it's

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,819
probably unrelated

00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:20,560
it'll be fine so take a quick peek at

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,930
the logs and make sure we didn't break

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,599
anything else just you know just to

00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:27,939
check and we're still seeing hooks fire

00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:32,740
for posts receive and upload packs so

00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:35,740
everything looks good so so that's chat

00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,300
ops it's really simple it's doing all

00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:41,279
the things that you do in a daily basis

00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:43,870
in camp fire all right

00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,939
simply put Hugh bot is the star of our

00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:48,699
ops team you bot does a lot of things

00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:50,379
for us we you see you bot day in and day

00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:52,810
out to interact with other simple tools

00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:55,839
we've written over JSON API Xand and

00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:57,039
over little bridge low bridges we have

00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,909
heaven which is our deploy

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,120
infrastructure

00:05:57,909 --> 00:06:02,289
Genki which is our CI server graph me

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,180
which is the automation that we've

00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:06,490
written around graphite to show us these

00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:09,279
graphs and shell which is a repository

00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:12,520
of bash scripts I know everyone has

00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:14,219
something like that sitting around so

00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,419
Hugh bot interacts with all these

00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:18,639
internal tools for us but it interacts

00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:20,620
with external API is just as simply if

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,759
you have a JSON API making your service

00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,370
work with Hugh bot it's pretty simple

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,139
the log example I showed was using paper

00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:28,599
trail which is a software-as-a-service

00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:29,979
logging logging tool and we just make a

00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:35,139
rest call out to it and search through

00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:38,169
search three logs so but why don't we

00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:39,969
obsess about Hugh by this is just a chat

00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:43,029
bot it's all about it's all about cat

00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:44,379
pictures so there's some distinct

00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:46,449
upsides to this approach that we've

00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:50,139
noticed as our use of Hugh bot in Ops

00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:51,969
has grown so this this whole flow that I

00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:54,610
just showed to you the rolling out of a

00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:56,199
new version of get across all of our

00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,819
infrastructure what's really neat about

00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:59,460
this and why Hugh bot is so cool and

00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:02,759
white shadow ops is so need to sit every

00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:05,520
seize that happen you don't have to tell

00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,870
someone to do something sorry you don't

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,759
have to do something and then tell

00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:10,710
someone you've done it you just do it

00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:12,990
and then everyone sees rate in the flow

00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:15,000
of conversation that's really powerful

00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:17,190
and not only does everyone just see that

00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,370
happen everyone sees that happen on

00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:22,550
their first day right there's no you

00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:25,590
don't have to show someone how to deploy

00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:27,419
they see it immediately it's there

00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:32,370
passively aware of how to do all of

00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:33,870
these things in yuba and we don't just

00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:35,039
do this with puppet right we do this

00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,169
with tons of other things in our

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,849
infrastructure have a few examples here

00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:42,750
we can use to be about to check the

00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:45,030
status of any branch that's built we can

00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:46,860
deploy a branch of any github app to any

00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:50,039
specific server if we want to test a

00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:53,639
branch in one place we can get graphs of

00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:55,470
the apps recent performance you can

00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,259
check the status of unicorn across all

00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:01,710
front-ends we can check the status of a

00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:04,470
rescue queue you can check load on all

00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:06,810
the front ends with the graph we can

00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:08,310
check current connections to a fronting

00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:10,560
that we think might have a problem since

00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:13,110
we deployed a branch to it we can get

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,820
live logs for our smoke RPC service on

00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:17,490
that front end and figure out that we

00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:20,340
actually did break it and then we can

00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:22,530
take it out of the load balancer we can

00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,729
update the status site these are all

00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,770
things that happen in the flow of every

00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:27,330
day right we can determine who's on call

00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:28,380
so we can apologise to them for taking

00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:31,680
the site down

00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:33,719
we can check Pingdom to see if we have

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,870
broken everything or just something

00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:38,099
small and because we're kind of freaking

00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:39,390
out because we broke something we

00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:41,360
couldn't chill ourselves out a little

00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:43,740
bit

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,170
once we've realized that the branch that

00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:48,270
we just deployed was what was bad we can

00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:51,300
revert back to master on the broken

00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:53,190
front-end and then check the logs again

00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:56,250
to verify things have returned to normal

00:08:53,190 --> 00:09:00,149
and then get yourself pumped up because

00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:01,680
he fixed it right and then once that's

00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:02,820
done and you've confirmed it you can

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,579
bring the fix for an end back and

00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:09,839
rotation and update the status site and

00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:10,890
once the outage has been resolved you

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,080
know maybe when you were looking through

00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:14,820
the logs we saw a weird IP

00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,950
can look that up and see that it's from

00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:22,530
China and realized that maybe it's a

00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:23,730
spammer and then someone might queue up

00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,110
the song that popped in their head when

00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:29,700
they thought about drums and gorillas at

00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:31,110
the same time and then you can finish it

00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:34,770
all off with a tweet about our drink up

00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:38,480
tonight so all of these things that

00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:41,670
happen in the flow of a campfire for us

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,290
that's what that's what chat ops is chat

00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,640
ups means building tools that make it

00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,250
easier to operate your infrastructure

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:50,790
with cubot rather than maybe terminal or

00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:54,600
Chrome or Safari and this is the key of

00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:56,390
the whole talk by placing tools directly

00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,760
in the middle of the conversation

00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:01,740
everyone is pairing all the time even if

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,630
your remote and I say that again

00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,270
by placing tools directly in the middle

00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:11,300
of a conversation everyone is pairing

00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:14,930
all the time that essentially leads to

00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:17,670
accidentally teaching by doing right

00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:18,930
Ryan Tamiko is the creator if you bought

00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:21,240
and you had this in mind from the very

00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:22,680
first commits to Hugh bot it initially

00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,200
was just a simple wrapper around a

00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,210
repository of shell scripts that we used

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,700
for you know managing and monitoring our

00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:32,610
infrastructure but it's turned into so

00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,770
much more it's turned into one of the

00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:40,530
main ways that we do training it's just

00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:43,770
by doing for example this is how I often

00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:46,740
respond to how do you do X in camp fire

00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:48,920
I just do it and someone sees how it

00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,920
works

00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,720
placing tools in the middle of

00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:56,460
conversation means that you get

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,320
communication of your work for free

00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:01,230
right if you're doing something in a

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,270
shell or on a website on a dashboard you

00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:07,110
have to do it then tell people about it

00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:10,350
right if you do it with Hugh bot in a

00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:14,370
chat room that your company uses that

00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:16,350
comes for free when you're internetting

00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:19,350
right you're just sitting there typing

00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:21,390
in campfire moving along you don't have

00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:23,820
to ask things about what the status is

00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:26,880
right you don't have to ask what are

00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,560
what are you doing here are a few things

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,089
for example that I haven't asked

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,400
recently because Hugh bot has told me

00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:36,200
the answer to by seeing people actually

00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:39,750
do the work how's that deploy go

00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,580
are you deploying that or should I is

00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:45,290
anyone responding to that not just alert

00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:47,970
is that branch green how does load look

00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:50,430
did anyone not be the Status page and

00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:53,220
did that deploy finish right these are

00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:55,080
questions that if you're in a physical

00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:59,220
environment you might ask cube to queue

00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:03,740
day in and day out but github doesn't

00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:05,940
have cubes in any given day and this day

00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:08,820
56% of people were we're not in the

00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,680
office I think that on a daily basis

00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,540
that's gone up last time I looked it was

00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,700
like you know 70 or 80 percent at that

00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:17,940
at that point in time weren't in the

00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,920
office so we can't just lean over and

00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:22,760
say are you deploying are you going to

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,800
respond to that not geo so Larry and

00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:28,170
that allows us to work from wherever our

00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,330
ops team is entirely remote we actually

00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:32,190
only have one member of our ops team in

00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:34,650
San Francisco the rest of the team is

00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:36,240
distributed if you can communicate

00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:38,010
freely from wherever that means you can

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,959
work from wherever which means that you

00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:41,550
can hire talent from wherever you don't

00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:44,130
have to be restricted to the people in

00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:46,440
Atlanta or the people in Salt Lake right

00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:50,120
you can hire the best of the best of the

00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,120
best wherever they might live

00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,620
and chat ops is really extremely useful

00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:58,790
during outage situations or anything in

00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:02,240
any other situation that requires

00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:03,620
tactical response people often I've seen

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,960
this a lot people get into the mode of

00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:07,760
you know internetting right in typing in

00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,590
their terminal hold on I'm gonna fix it

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,900
and then they're silent for three or

00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:13,250
four minutes they're fixing it whatever

00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:16,550
it is and you have no idea what they're

00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:17,870
doing but if they're responding to an

00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:20,600
outage you know responding to an

00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:21,980
incident using commands with Cuba that

00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,530
communication comes for free and you

00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,640
don't have to wait for them to emerge

00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:30,500
from terminal and tell you what's

00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:32,450
actually going on another benefit of

00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,190
chat offices that lets you hide ugly

00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:36,320
interfaces and decide exactly the

00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:39,710
interaction you want with porcelain you

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:44,740
can build nice interactions around bad

00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:50,210
tools my favorite example is that thing

00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:51,460
right so when a new alert comes in if

00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:53,720
you bought let's just know about it

00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:57,290
politely delivers it to us without any

00:13:53,720 --> 00:14:00,640
unnecessary eye bleeding and we can

00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:04,040
interact with this directly in campfire

00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:05,990
making this easy means that other

00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:09,830
developers developers and other ops

00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:13,670
engineers actually do this right I I

00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:15,530
wonder how often developers actually

00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:17,270
mute services if they're going to

00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:19,640
perform maintenance on them I don't know

00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:23,360
I it never happened ever happened at

00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:25,910
github before we did this asking someone

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,010
to use the Nagios web interface is not

00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:30,260
something that I would ask any of my

00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:33,020
friends right

00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:36,790
so why not give them something like this

00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:38,810
instead and then they'll actually do it

00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:41,350
another one of these services that I

00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:44,630
love to hate on this page of Duty right

00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:46,370
so we've built some cubot integration

00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:49,630
that I actually just opened sourced a

00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:51,440
couple days ago at Montserrat that

00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:56,050
automates some interaction with pager

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:58,430
duty you can ask pager what's going on

00:14:56,050 --> 00:15:00,350
let you bot let's you know it's okay

00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:02,240
but the biggest benefit that we've

00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:04,880
actually seen from this is I added a

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,760
command to our page of duty Hugh bot

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,530
integration that allows you to steal the

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,960
pager from someone for a certain amount

00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:13,940
of time if I was a type page 360 in

00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,170
campfire right now I would take the

00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:18,590
pager the page would be assigned to me

00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:20,420
for the next 60 minutes and in the world

00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:23,570
of ops there are some things that we

00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:26,150
can't necessarily avoid especially in

00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:29,030
you know week-long on-call schedules

00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:32,090
there's showering this is important and

00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:36,590
maybe eating a burrito and maybe driving

00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:40,400
to or from the office right if you don't

00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:41,900
have an ability to easily help your team

00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,540
right in the existing page of duty

00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:46,070
integrate the API or the website to set

00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,680
up an exception requires lots of like

00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:50,540
time zone math and manual clicking and

00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:54,020
setting of dates and that's complex

00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:56,960
right if I want to get in the shower I

00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:59,360
would feel bad asking someone to just do

00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:03,950
this thing that's gonna take a minute to

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:06,200
help out right but if it takes that long

00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:08,930
this has really inspired a culture of

00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:11,120
sharing on the pager at github which is

00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:12,890
completely unintended I just added this

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,680
as a convenience method but now people

00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:17,390
pedra me 10 pages in me 30 I'll be on

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,280
call and say I'm gonna go to a cafe and

00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:23,260
I don't ask and people say paging me 30

00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,260
it's pretty amazing how that's helped us

00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:31,480
one last benefit of chat ops that we've

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,790
seen is that you get mobile support for

00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:37,900
free right if you have views the

00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:40,080
campfire app you can do things like this

00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:44,110
is a camper app that we're hacking on

00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:45,940
you can grab the status of an adios

00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:49,810
alert or not do a service or any of

00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:51,970
those things from your phone which means

00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:54,760
that you can do anything Hugh bot can do

00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:59,380
from your phone or your bed or a beach

00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:01,600
in Hawaii or a jeep right you can fix a

00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:03,250
lot of things that are simple and have

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,319
clearly defined defined resolutions

00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:07,839
without pulling your laptop out of your

00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:12,300
back and that makes it easier to be on

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:15,100
call which I know that we all want and

00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:17,860
that's chat UPS its finest right making

00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:21,339
it easier to be on call making it easier

00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:23,140
to interact with your infrastructure so

00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:25,180
who better to summarize this all this

00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,560
than he got himself I asked you about

00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:31,870
what he thought about chat ops and he

00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:33,490
said chat ops all the things so listen

00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:34,540
to what he but said you'll love it your

00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,490
ops team will love it

00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,600
you'll help other developers learn how

00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:40,060
to interact with your infrastructure

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,940
without writing lengthy documentation

00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:44,680
because they'll see it if you get this
