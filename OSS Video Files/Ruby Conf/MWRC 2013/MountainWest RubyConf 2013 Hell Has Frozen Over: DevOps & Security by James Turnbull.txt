Title: MountainWest RubyConf 2013 Hell Has Frozen Over: DevOps & Security by James Turnbull
Publication date: 2020-01-28
Playlist: MWRC 2013
Description: 
	A lot of Dev and Ops people look at their security teams with disdain: "Those guys are arseholes. All they ever do is sit in meetings and tell us no." They know there's no way Security will ever embrace DevOps. In turn many security folks see the emergence of DevOps as the inmates being put in charge of the asylum. It'll all end in chaos and disaster.
So who's right? Can DevOps and security co-exist? Can they be friends? We will take a deeper look at:
What DevOps means for Security
How DevOps can be sold to Security
How DevOps changes the risk landscape for the better
How those Security folks might know some things that could make DevOps better
You'll see how DevOps and Security can have a long and prosperous friendship that makes more awesome.
