Description: 
	Look, I know you love your sprinkler timer, with its endearing little dials and simple, easy-to-use interface, and its killer dot-matrix LCD.
We thought we could do better, and we thought Ruby could help us. With the awesomeness of things like the Raspberry Pi and maybe a little Arduino, who's to say I can't use Ruby to water my lawn, remind me to fertilize, or let me know where I could save a little water?
We'll take you on a quick tour of the automated sprinkler system world and the problems it has, and how we're solving them with Ruby, Raspberry Pi, and about 24V of DC power. We promise not to electrocute you, but we can't guarantee you won't get a little bit wet.
