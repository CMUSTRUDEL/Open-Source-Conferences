	00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,110
you

00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,170
mmm

00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:25,610
okay just want to do a quick recap of

00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:28,970
the 5k and how it went today we had a

00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:31,190
really good time we had 21 runners which

00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:34,010
i think is the most we've ever had or

00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:36,320
maybe a tie for the most it was a nice

00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:38,360
50 degrees we actually missed the rain

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,710
by just a few minutes spray after we

00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:44,090
finished and people were leaving it

00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:45,170
started to rain and what's up yeah we'll

00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:50,840
get to that in a minute there was a

00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:53,230
panda and prizes and glory so I'm just

00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,129
going to share a couple pictures we

00:00:53,230 --> 00:01:00,320
here's everyone kind of gathering around

00:00:55,129 --> 00:01:02,120
waiting for Ben maybe to show up we we

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,690
actually started without him but he did

00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,250
catch up and came in third place so so

00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:10,700
if he had started with us I think you

00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:14,510
would have won yeah you'll notice here

00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:16,130
we have a panda hiding there and we

00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:20,120
actually have some footage of the

00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:22,580
elusive panda running here and you can

00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:26,780
see the handler trying to capture the

00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:30,469
panda yeah so yeah we had a good time is

00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:32,509
fun one more thing i do want to point

00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:34,340
out though is we we had a lot of swag

00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:36,439
and stuff there at the event we do have

00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,960
a few more shirts basically this one I'm

00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:40,549
wearing here so we have like four or

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,189
five more larges and a couple of extra

00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:45,079
large or double XLS so afterwards just

00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:47,119
come up and see me I'm just sitting up

00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:50,090
there by the door just come grab assured

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:55,340
if you want one it might be a race so

00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:56,570
that's kind of a theme though and yeah

00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,450
last of all just want to say thanks to

00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:01,460
instructure my employer for sponsoring

00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:04,609
this was a lot of fun we hope to do

00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:06,049
again next year a couple links up here

00:02:04,609 --> 00:02:08,810
the first link for those of you that

00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:10,520
participated or those who care those are

00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:13,520
the results so if you want to see what

00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,560
your time was we got it up there also

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,450
check us out on github and in structure

00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,900
we've got a lot of interesting projects

00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:23,590
we're doing and thanks again to Ben and

00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,590
everyone else who helped

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:35,440
so it's story time very brief lightning

00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:38,830
talk oh the places you'll code you can

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:44,080
code on some rocks you can code on the

00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:49,300
docks you can code on a boat you can

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:52,690
code with some goats actually cows you

00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:57,730
can code near train you can code on a

00:02:52,690 --> 00:03:03,640
plane you can code when it's still you

00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:07,319
can code when it's chill e you can code

00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:11,019
in the green you can code by a stream

00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:14,140
you can code by the light you can code

00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:17,739
just before night don't just code in

00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:19,709
your lair write code everywhere last

00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:24,130
summer when I was working on talks for

00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:25,750
Cascadia and other conferences Ryan and

00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:28,030
I visited most of these places and wrote

00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,769
code at all of them if you like to write

00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,140
code if you love something do it as many

00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:37,359
places as possible it's awesome thank

00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:39,880
you hey i'm ryan florence work with john

00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:42,400
actually on his team at instructure i'm

00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:47,230
not a ruby guy i'm more of a javascript

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:51,070
guy thank you and but i wrote a whole

00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:53,410
bunch of ruby a couple weeks ago i am in

00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,760
charge of our CSS and every day someone

00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:57,489
comes to me and asked me how do I build

00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,260
a table to look like this and tired of

00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:00,850
answering those questions and need to

00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:04,180
save them some time so we built a thing

00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:06,850
called dress code it's ruby gem so you

00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:09,400
can just including a gem file it's

00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:13,810
mostly a command-line tool so the way

00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:16,720
that works is in your project you define

00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,760
a style guide gamal or name it whatever

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,070
you want and it's just got a few

00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,740
properties like the glob to find the

00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:26,889
style sheets that you want to pull

00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,300
documentation out of and then a couple

00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:31,510
other things and let's see this thing

00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:33,690
happened so if I put the mic down for a

00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,690
sec

00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:44,900
so you just hand it the config file that

00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:50,230
you want hit enter and then it writes

00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:54,050
your style guide open this guy up and

00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:55,340
I've got a style guide so probably

00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,930
wondering where did we get this style

00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:01,970
guide if i go to my style sheets under

00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:03,530
boxes you just mark up your CSS with

00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:06,080
that style guide and in the name of the

00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:08,390
component and then give it a fence block

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:12,980
for your HTML that makes it come to life

00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:17,570
and over in dress code it will not only

00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:19,250
show the demo but it renders the demo so

00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:21,620
that people can copy and paste this

00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:23,240
stuff and they know that it works and

00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,490
it's also great for developing your CSS

00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,550
components because you just write your

00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:30,680
test case next to your CSS and just

00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:36,320
refresh the page you can do custom

00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:38,270
templates like here in our app in canvas

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,840
I've got a custom template that actually

00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:44,150
just gets put into our appt views folder

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,010
and then it gets rendered with our app

00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:47,420
so we get all of our style sheets in

00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:52,120
there all of our JavaScript behaviors

00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:52,120
and everything else so really handy

00:05:53,290 --> 00:06:06,140
inline Styles man hey sorry about that

00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:09,110
hi I'm Nick Howard so I had this I work

00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:11,690
on this project called Mira in which I

00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:14,630
do a lot of JVM bytecode writing and I

00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:16,760
wanted to practice my stuff so I decided

00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:18,770
to make this calculator I called oh god

00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,660
why calculator because I was like you

00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:23,960
know when you're using IRB as a

00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:28,190
calculator you're using this really

00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:31,710
heavy interpreted language to do all

00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:35,520
this math you know so

00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:37,320
and you know like you're pulling in this

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,180
huge run time when you're doing that and

00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:43,190
that feels kind of silly to me so I was

00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:48,090
like well I could make a compiled

00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:52,520
calculator you so what what oh god why

00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:55,770
calculator is is I take K peg and I

00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,750
parse a calculation expression and then

00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:01,290
I compile at the bytecode and then

00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:03,810
execute it so the run the runner looks

00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:06,150
kind of like this so basically you know

00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:09,030
you're in a loop you print a prompt do

00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:11,190
you get the prompt and then there's

00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:13,410
someone types exit you exit I know if

00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:16,590
otherwise you take the expression and

00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:21,270
you compile it and then you put the

00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:25,230
result of evaluating yeah so it's

00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:26,400
terrible so so so it you know when

00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:29,040
you're running it looks kind of like

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:33,120
this so you know you can say one plus

00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:36,630
one and it doesn't have read line so it

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:43,290
doesn't do anything fancy apparently 1-1

00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:45,630
doesn't work uh so how it works is jpg

00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:47,850
gives you the ability to define a

00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:50,400
grammar and then say what you want it to

00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:52,800
do when the grammar happens so like if

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,930
if there's an integer it pushes it in a

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,810
drawn to a stack if if there isn't a

00:07:54,930 --> 00:08:00,090
term an ad in a term it puts an ad

00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:03,840
operator onto the sack it does the same

00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:05,310
thing with sub and what have you so if

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,690
you've ever written assembly before or

00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,270
written a compiler it's kind of like

00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:10,800
that um and then there's a lot of tricky

00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:12,510
set up things because i'm using this

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,380
library called bite script to write all

00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:18,980
the the bytecode so basically i'm

00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:21,090
building a class file in memory and then

00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:23,390
writing all the bytes to it and then

00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:26,570
loading it and having JRuby execute it

00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:26,570
that's it

00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:36,570
I was trying to think of a good idea to

00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:36,570
do during the hackathon in the vein of

00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:43,440
Ryan and Aaron Patterson's talk at Ruby

00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:46,180
come for railsconf the worst ideas ever

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:52,000
it's not quite approaching that level of

00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:53,470
awesomeness but sort of okay so that's

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,670
me that's where you can find me on the

00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:57,220
internet that's what I look like it on

00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:58,840
the Internet I work at that thing which

00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,310
is the same thing that oughta work said

00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:04,570
that she talked about yesterday so only

00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:06,700
to waste time with that so okay so you

00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:09,430
guys are probably familiar with what

00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:12,160
array map does you have an array you

00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:15,010
pass a block to it and it returns you a

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:18,220
collection of calling that block on all

00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:21,940
the things you can also use this

00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:23,470
shorthand syntax ampersand and then just

00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:27,010
a symbol of the method you want to call

00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:32,020
does the same thing so what the is

00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:35,020
that ampersand right so I come up with

00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:36,970
the idea a long time ago of getting rid

00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:41,530
of it you know if I could just pass a

00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:43,630
symbol to map it i'm passing the same

00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:47,440
amount of information and actually i'm

00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:50,920
passing more information because instead

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,960
of just this opaque blob of code that

00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,180
could have side effects and all sorts of

00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,220
things I just want to I just want to

00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:02,920
tell it do this on all the things and

00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:05,710
return it so so it seems good right less

00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:08,140
typing there's fewer hoops to jump

00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:11,230
through possible optimizations right

00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:16,030
that's always good and I pitched this

00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:18,220
idea to both a eric hotel AK dr. brain

00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:19,930
and Aaron Patterson tender love at

00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:23,280
Seattle RB and they were just looked

00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:23,280
like that's the stupidest idea

00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:30,879
so I wanted a word of warning I haven't

00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:33,339
written any C code since I was in

00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:37,870
college and then last night at like 2am

00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:40,240
and also I've only like glanced at

00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:42,459
Ruby's C code and been incredibly

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:46,480
confused so I'm not like some kind of

00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:49,360
Ruby API expert so this is what it looks

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:53,220
like this is this is what it looks like

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:56,470
now okay so it's very simple it

00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:59,019
initializes an array and then does a for

00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:02,170
loop over it and then pushes onto the

00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:05,399
array the result of yielding all of the

00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:08,290
things very simple as far as C code goes

00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:11,079
so unfortunately my new version is too

00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:12,519
much code to put on one slide you can

00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:18,160
look at it later if you write this down

00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:22,930
really quick uh so this is this is the

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:25,750
good part okay so i turned the RB re

00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:28,420
collect into now taking arguments

00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:31,660
because it didn't do that before i use

00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:33,100
the RV Stan args to actually see if

00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:37,509
there's anything in the arguments and

00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:39,519
put it into the OP value and then it is

00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:42,370
now in s nested-if else because those

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,050
are awesome and it's pretty much the

00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:46,870
same structure other than that except

00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:50,040
you can see there I'm doing our be fun

00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:53,230
call because it's a fun call and

00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:57,120
surprising everyone it actually worked I

00:11:53,230 --> 00:12:01,569
couldn't believe it but it happens so

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:04,240
possible optimizations right okay so i

00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:06,519
wrote a benchmark i have an array of 10

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,490
things and i'm calling to eye on it

00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:10,600
because i figured you know to eye on an

00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:14,649
integer that should be pretty much a

00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:17,050
no-op right so the test at the bottom is

00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:19,029
commented out because I first ran it on

00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:25,180
the code before I did any modifications

00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:27,459
and so the the block syntax is about a

00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:32,170
second to proc is slightly faster than

00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:33,910
that so this is the same thing except I

00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:36,140
uncommented the last line this is after

00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:42,200
i compiled with my change in it

00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:43,760
and look at that if you need to map over

00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,520
an array of 10 things a million times

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,550
this is going to do it three tenths of a

00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:51,110
second faster so you're definitely going

00:12:49,550 --> 00:13:00,080
to want to apply this patch to the

00:12:51,110 --> 00:13:09,140
latest version of Ruby so uh yeah there

00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:10,400
we go thank you hi everybody so a couple

00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,990
gentlemen up here I was eavesdropping

00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,220
before the lightning talks and they said

00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,890
that all the Lightning talks are about

00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:18,290
the people giving them this is not

00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:19,400
really about me I decided rather than

00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:22,370
having lightning talk and have a

00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:26,210
lightning call for help so last night

00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:27,920
after Ryan's boarded talk and we

00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,910
followed to the hackathon everything I

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,760
was sitting around I've been thinking

00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:33,770
about how to deal with active record

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:37,160
objects and as anybody played with

00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:39,130
virtus the gym virtus it's it's Rocking

00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:42,620
you should go check it out it lets you

00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:44,300
include a module into your class and you

00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:47,770
get model like behavior without all that

00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:50,930
nasty table stuff so let me show you

00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:52,820
where I started out I and I need help

00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:55,310
naming something so naming as we've

00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:57,050
heard the last couple days is hard so

00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:59,420
what I want to be able to do is have a

00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:00,920
class and then have so I'm dealing with

00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,870
an aggregate class is anybody read

00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,520
domain driven design I'm kind of

00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:06,260
thinking about aggregate classes here

00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,120
and so I've got this top-level root

00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:10,550
aggregate a and I want to have this

00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,950
class inside of it that has a few fields

00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:15,530
on it right few attributes and and then

00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:18,650
I want to be able to use a setter and

00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:22,580
getter and have those values pass

00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:25,190
through to the underlying model but the

00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:27,200
sub the little B class I also wanted to

00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:28,610
encapsulate the validations so my

00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,620
eventual goal is that not only what i

00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,030
have class b include virtus which gives

00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,800
me the nice little attribute syntax but

00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:38,870
then I'd have some validates blah blah

00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:40,250
blah down below is sort of the syntax I

00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,750
want it wanted to be able to do I want

00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:45,020
to be able to have the setter and getter

00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:48,660
on there and this is the this is sort of

00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:52,990
the code that I eventually want to have

00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:54,970
up here down below it just basically

00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:57,370
says you know pull the attributes off it

00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:58,959
uses a property of from virtus attribute

00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:00,130
set and it says hey you know just put

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,410
these on the hash and pass them through

00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:04,540
to the model if you set equal down on

00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:05,649
line 18 and if I get it I just want to

00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:08,260
pull them out unless it's there already

00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:09,519
or if it's there already and this is

00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,870
kind of what I want to do and this is

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,209
where I need your help line 3 I don't

00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:15,579
know what to call this thing so I have

00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:17,860
an aggregate class class a on five but I

00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:19,810
don't know what to call it and you'll

00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:22,720
notice on line 8 i'm still very vague

00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:23,920
about what i want to do here so I before

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,660
we're done before the five minutes is up

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:29,560
i just want you to shout out some names

00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:30,940
keep them clean but you'll notice i just

00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,640
want to be able to use some block syntax

00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:35,230
and I want line 8 I want that to be able

00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,459
to just go generate the class for me

00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:39,130
I've already got this code working this

00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:44,459
this actually works just fine at the

00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:46,600
risk of having you all see it this is

00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:48,640
this is the way that I've got it wired

00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,490
up I don't really need the class now I

00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:53,170
can extend the module this will go away

00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:55,240
obviously what I have the table

00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:58,360
underneath it and this is the block

00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:01,480
syntax that I want to use and this

00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:03,100
module does crazy things like just build

00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,140
up an anonymous class that's a constant

00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:08,050
this is all very late night stuff I'm

00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:11,079
sorry maybe if you see something in here

00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:12,550
you don't like please correct me and

00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:14,470
then I just set some instant variables

00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:15,579
and stuff and I create the getter use

00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:17,260
define method there's a little bit of

00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:19,589
everything in here I'm hoping that the

00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:22,600
project i'm on everyone really loves it

00:16:19,589 --> 00:16:26,579
but what would i call it so Class A is

00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,579
the aggregate ryan's waving his hand

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:40,170
just named me okay but does it say well

00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:43,600
what does that tell you it does my so i

00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:45,130
think so i was thinking these kinds of

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,649
things at the risk of you know showing

00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:49,420
my hand here it's a lot of letters yeah

00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:51,279
i felt the same thing and I couldn't

00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:54,220
figure out you know cuz aggregates a

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,779
noun but it's also a verb and this you

00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:59,820
know language sucks the dictionaries no

00:16:55,779 --> 00:17:04,520
help I even tried to British thesaurus

00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:07,770
Aggie I'm gonna write that down aggro

00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,970
i'm writing this stuff down i'm pretty

00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,140
sure a few of the guys I work with her

00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,579
actually watching this right now I'm

00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:14,480
sure they're groaning because they're

00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:14,480
gonna have to see this when I'm done

00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:22,829
that is a scalable idea my friend

00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:24,720
scalable any thought anybody else

00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:26,550
anybody got an idea if I've got a thing

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,620
called an aggregate this a thing and

00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:31,830
I've got stuff that lives inside of it

00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:34,380
imagine at line 11 that's some class and

00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:36,750
it's going to be called B Class B or in

00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:40,140
this case in the project it's in three

00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:42,390
would be a quote possibly and 11 would

00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:44,550
be some dates in that quote and these

00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:46,470
also the fun part is I want to use a gem

00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:48,390
called wicket to do like a wizard based

00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:50,340
step thing and have each little class

00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:54,030
validate itself without having to use a

00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:57,260
silly state machine here come together

00:17:54,030 --> 00:18:04,860
is this a beatles thing we're doing here

00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:06,300
i'm gonna i'm writing this down i think

00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:12,300
that like i said i think that's a scale

00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:14,460
buggy and no and other ideas it's a

00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,290
thing don't worry about the the name of

00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,420
the class because i want to be so here's

00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:21,270
the thing i just want to have I want to

00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:23,220
be able to require something extend it

00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:24,690
right and then just use it down there

00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:27,630
and have some syntax so this could be

00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:29,070
like aggregate me or create aggregate or

00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,210
but it's not the aggregate A's the

00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:32,810
aggregate and I just couldn't figure out

00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:36,330
anything I thought you guys can help

00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:37,920
they are stub that's uh you better

00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:44,660
you're fixated on active record I think

00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:48,600
you have feature envy what's a g-class

00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:51,840
I'm writing it down I think Aggies

00:18:48,600 --> 00:19:02,610
probably the better than gets hot glue

00:18:51,840 --> 00:19:06,000
this is good yeah Texans are pretty

00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:08,700
little asst this and that I like that

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,440
little matter buddy used to call it

00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,820
and stuff

00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,990
all right I'm done with my time I'm not

00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,330
going to bore you any longer if you

00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:18,340
think of anything I'm el squid on

00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:25,150
Twitter LS KW ID so please let me know

00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:27,850
thanks guys excellent all right let me

00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:31,180
get this sweet slide deck that I drew

00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:34,210
out in the lobby you going here by talks

00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:36,940
hexagonal architecture with rails or

00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:38,290
hexagonal from the other Island anyway

00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:41,350
this is really just an invitation to

00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:44,020
discussion you can get me on Twitter pad

00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:46,210
wasabi missile or wherever else you can

00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:48,010
find me by that handle and I just want

00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:50,530
to have like a little talk let's take a

00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:52,630
survey real quick so raise your hands if

00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:54,730
your primary app is like this you got a

00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:57,000
rails app in a database and that's what

00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:59,470
you got so we got one two three four

00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,060
maybe half of the crowd how about like

00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:02,740
this like you've done a little scaling

00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,870
if you got a load balancer it's the same

00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:07,540
app you split it across some databases a

00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:09,190
couple more people okay and then maybe

00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,990
maybe some your work in a bigger shop

00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:12,610
you got multi app some of them are

00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:15,220
balanced some of them are maybe a couple

00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:17,050
of databases few more people how many of

00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:18,670
you doing like distributed stuff you got

00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:20,410
like apps at a cloud they talk to

00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:23,890
multiple services you have multiple

00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:25,390
inputs for these apps okay so this is a

00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:27,400
little shot out to some guys I used to

00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:29,740
work at where's Marcy Oh hopefully

00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,950
they're watching online anyhow the thing

00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:35,500
about rails is when the only thing you

00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:37,540
have is a hammer every app sometimes

00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,610
looks like a nail and I really

00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:42,010
appreciated the the last couple of talks

00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:43,150
the one by Steven on how to break up

00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,380
your rails app and I don't want to

00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:46,540
really get into how to break up your

00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:48,520
rails app but more how do you build your

00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,990
app outside of rails and then attach it

00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:53,290
to rails when that's what you need to do

00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:56,640
and so there's this thing called

00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:58,990
hexagonal architecture Alistair Coburn

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,210
wrote about it at this address also

00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:04,030
there's a really good talk from boot

00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:06,100
Ruby Midwest 2011 called architecture

00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:11,280
the last year's by another agile guy who

00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:15,070
shouted who's shouting yes yes a

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,780
brother-in-arms uh it's it's a really

00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:18,820
good talk unlike how to put a nap

00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:20,560
together and so basically just I just

00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,270
want to kind of like get people thinking

00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,669
about this so we can talk the idea of

00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:24,739
hexic

00:21:22,669 --> 00:21:26,690
architecture is pretty simple it's that

00:21:24,739 --> 00:21:29,720
your app really is in a box it's not a

00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:31,669
square it's a hexagon that the way your

00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,159
application ought to run should be

00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:35,720
completely independent from any other

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,789
service that it's tied to so it may

00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,950
persist to a database tovar active

00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:41,749
record sorry for trolling your lifetime

00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:43,369
of not everything should be active

00:21:41,749 --> 00:21:45,379
record right kind of what this gets out

00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:47,659
is like you've got skinny models and fat

00:21:45,379 --> 00:21:50,149
or skinny controllers and fat models and

00:21:47,659 --> 00:21:51,739
and frankly I think that still sucks and

00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:53,509
that there ought to be a better solution

00:21:51,739 --> 00:21:55,820
with like a skinny controller in a

00:21:53,509 --> 00:21:57,559
skinny model and something else or maybe

00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,840
something's else and that's kind of what

00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:01,970
this gets out is how can we design

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,609
applications in a way that they can be

00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:06,649
tested and developed and implemented and

00:22:04,609 --> 00:22:08,299
completely detached from all of its

00:22:06,649 --> 00:22:10,879
input and output streams right like you

00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:12,799
don't want your thing to always be tied

00:22:10,879 --> 00:22:14,269
to rack and actually controller maybe

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,499
you want to receive inputs from your

00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:17,149
command line or maybe you want to pick

00:22:15,499 --> 00:22:19,039
stuff off of a queue and when it comes

00:22:17,149 --> 00:22:20,450
time to change and to refactor you want

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,460
to be able to do it in a flexible way

00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:26,419
and so if you're like building your

00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:29,359
mom's you know blogging app or your

00:22:26,419 --> 00:22:30,710
grandma's you know you know to-do list

00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:32,539
or something you might not want to take

00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:35,320
your architecture this far but if you're

00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:37,700
working on a large distributed system it

00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,109
helps to have ways to kind of think

00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:41,149
about these components and build them

00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:42,320
together and there's some people I found

00:22:41,149 --> 00:22:44,289
out on github they're doing some

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,249
interesting kind of things with this but

00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:48,529
basically I just wanted to kind of bring

00:22:46,249 --> 00:22:51,109
it up and say if this interests you or

00:22:48,529 --> 00:22:53,539
maybe you have some answers for me or or

00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:55,179
you want to just like gripe about active

00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:58,879
record together we can all go get a

00:22:55,179 --> 00:23:01,279
drink later on just kidding but anyway

00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:02,840
it's let's let's talk you can find me on

00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:05,539
Twitter I'd love to hear your ideas I'd

00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:09,159
love to you know just swap thoughts and

00:23:05,539 --> 00:23:09,159
see how we can build better applications

00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:17,220
alright so today I'm going to talk about

00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:22,650
taking back your mental ram or the

00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:26,090
strategy to learn all the things so I

00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:28,140
want to say thanks to Mike for

00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:32,150
mentioning my birthday yesterday while I

00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:35,970
was out taking a bathroom break and

00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:40,230
thanks to Pat and all the organizers for

00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:43,440
putting on yet another great conference

00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:47,059
and of course bats and everyone in the

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:54,660
community who make our lives great

00:23:47,059 --> 00:24:01,700
little closer okay so I I feel great so

00:23:54,660 --> 00:24:05,669
being here and I am Tyler bird I am a

00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:11,040
husband father and engineer and I work

00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:15,270
at engineered and what I'm going to talk

00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:19,919
about today is getting things done a

00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:23,970
little bit and the concept that Dave and

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:25,830
Alan posits in there that there's

00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:27,809
usually an inverse proportion to how

00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:32,669
much something is on your mind and how

00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:34,740
much is getting done right and there's

00:24:32,669 --> 00:24:38,370
the concept in there that we have

00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:39,780
something called mental ram okay and it

00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:41,400
was a little bit what Bill was saying

00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:49,410
that you can have may be plus or minus

00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:52,860
seven things in there and so we can only

00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:54,929
have so much in there so what he says is

00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:56,460
that we need to write it all down kind

00:24:54,929 --> 00:25:00,419
of capture it in the getting things done

00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:05,100
system right and so if we capture it all

00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:11,130
into the trusted system then we are able

00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:14,250
to concentrate better and if you are

00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:16,260
able to concentrate then hopefully once

00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:17,790
you're able to concentrate like I'm

00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:21,900
hopefully concentrating down a little

00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:24,010
more getting into the flow then that's

00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:26,950
that's what you're

00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:31,190
then you get into the heightened state

00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:34,660
and if you've as anybody here ever been

00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:37,940
into that flow state or know it flow is

00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:44,660
so there's lots of information out there

00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:46,670
about flow but research that if you if

00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:48,860
you're not familiar with it but it

00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:53,510
sounds like a lot of you guys have read

00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:55,970
about it and flow is something that you

00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,590
want to get into because a it really

00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:01,700
feels good it's when time stands still

00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:04,040
or time goes by really quickly and the

00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:06,050
best advice I can give you is to try to

00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,460
know how to get back into it pay

00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:13,210
attention how you got into it and know

00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:16,520
how to get into it but so as developers

00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:24,250
we're always constantly developing right

00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:28,520
and trying to be better developers so

00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:32,590
how do we balance the backlog you know

00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:39,230
this mental Ram problem of so much stuff

00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:44,150
that we want to learn right and the this

00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:45,710
changelog ie all the work that we're

00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:49,970
working along and the work that we've

00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:51,830
done so we want to learn all these

00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:53,000
things but there's really so many things

00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:57,230
we want to learn so how do we balance

00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,730
this so what I'm proposing is this tool

00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:03,410
that I've been working on called Ruby

00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:06,980
community college and it's a self-study

00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:12,410
social network and what you do on it is

00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:20,090
you learn and you are and you teach so

00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:24,070
there are modules they're the modules

00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:29,090
that we have right now our campus

00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:34,270
library in the dictionary the campus

00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:37,500
module is take a course leave a course

00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:41,100
you are a consumer of courses

00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:42,930
and by consuming courses you take the

00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:47,700
content that other experts have created

00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:50,760
right and then you come in and you give

00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:53,820
back content that others that you're

00:27:50,760 --> 00:28:02,070
good at at into the Ruby community right

00:27:53,820 --> 00:28:07,050
so that's giving back and then disappear

00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:08,700
whoops but so because it's self self

00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:14,040
guided you're the instructor on Ruby

00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:16,560
community college and in in the campus

00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:18,980
module you also have the knowledge

00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:22,380
roadmap which allows you to organize

00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:25,740
rearrange and review your plan of

00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:27,480
learning of your learning career based

00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:34,410
on the courses that you're subscribed to

00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:37,410
right so the library module is a not

00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:42,060
just where you go to check your facebook

00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:43,800
statuses but it's the curated collection

00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:45,420
of the vast array of amazing resources

00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:48,030
we have available out on the internet

00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:51,870
today you know rails cast Pete coats all

00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:54,960
the awesome podcasts of the Ruby rogues

00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:57,240
have produced blog articles ebooks etc

00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,160
it doesn't actually contain these things

00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,350
in the library but it contains the

00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:05,370
metadata the valuable information about

00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:07,830
these things and it it has these ready

00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:14,930
to be added to curriculum and structured

00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:17,460
courses that you put in the campus so

00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:20,750
that's in the collection of the library

00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:25,650
you know we will be curating that and

00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:29,120
it's it's moderated by our faculty so

00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:31,530
the last module is the dictionary

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:42,570
sometimes the programming language is

00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:44,940
only half the battle and so you you have

00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:47,370
to learn the concepts to become a good

00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:49,860
programmer and so you've got to learn

00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:51,140
concepts and jargon and how to apply all

00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:54,050
that stuff so

00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:56,510
the dictionary is intended to be the

00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:59,240
Webster's developer dictionary and it

00:29:56,510 --> 00:30:01,640
can also be added to any course in the

00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:05,480
Ruby community college so who's working

00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:06,800
on the Ruby community college these are

00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:10,310
the developers that are currently

00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:14,660
working on it with me we meet weekly at

00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:18,340
the west jordan library Mondays and we

00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:23,780
meet Thursdays and the google hangout

00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:27,410
where can you find us you can find us

00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:31,130
online it's an open source project so

00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:32,930
our codes available to fork you can find

00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:34,490
us at Ruby community college and we also

00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:39,650
have blocked follow some of our

00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:43,580
adventures what do we need I want you to

00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:45,710
merge I want you to fork we need to some

00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:49,250
designers because we're fairly Twitter

00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:55,250
bootstrap II right now and that's a good

00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:57,440
thing as Martha Stewart says but we need

00:30:55,250 --> 00:31:01,010
powders and we need moderators to come

00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:03,350
back if we go back to our needs where

00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:07,130
did I lost my thing because I have power

00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:17,740
on my thing hello why why do I not have

00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:17,740
this is weird anyway weird in my mask oh

00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:29,060
okay coming back going back almost there

00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:33,080
got it if you want to contact me there's

00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:42,260
my in my contact information and that's

00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:43,400
it um I'm not sure this is going to be

00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:45,650
the most interesting talk for this

00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,960
audience because I actually wrote this

00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:49,730
last year I gave heard we have a group

00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:52,970
in London called a Loden girl geek

00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:55,400
dinners and they did a meetup for the

00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:56,630
London sci-fi convention and it was all

00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,130
geek girls but none of them were

00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:59,870
programmers so they wanted somebody to

00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:02,300
come in and they wanted two people to

00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:03,560
come and talk about the raspberry pi but

00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,610
actually nobody could get their hands on

00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,770
it was bleep I in May

00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:07,670
last year so there was nobody could come

00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:09,260
and say well I've done this with the

00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:11,420
world's bleep I so instead it was like

00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:13,460
well come and talk about computers for

00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:14,990
people who don't do computers and this

00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:17,080
is sort of there's an underlying

00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:20,240
diatribe to this which is I think that

00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:22,040
we've basically we've broken the

00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,870
environment that allowed me to become a

00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,150
programmer and many other people in my

00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:27,350
generation and this is going to be odd

00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:29,690
because I have to stand still because I

00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:32,630
have to click through these which is not

00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:34,790
my happiest space so wild romance is

00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:36,950
this is my this is my life in photos of

00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:41,870
computers so this is going to be doubly

00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:44,809
done but I'm lucky I was the Blessed

00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:47,030
generation there were these cheap home

00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:48,530
micros that suddenly appeared first you

00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:51,130
could build i can remember machines you

00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:52,910
had to build yourself and then you

00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:55,130
didn't have to build them but they were

00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:57,140
so weak and anemic that nobody could put

00:32:55,130 --> 00:33:00,080
a bloated operating system on them and

00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:01,700
they were just yours your parents didn't

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,830
want them they didn't want to know about

00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:05,179
them they were scary your teachers

00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:06,919
didn't teach about them at school

00:33:05,179 --> 00:33:08,660
because schools in general they could

00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:10,190
afford them they put them in physics

00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:15,620
labs or math labs they didn't put them

00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:17,960
in classes so this is the very first

00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:20,780
machine I have a programmed this is a

00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:23,540
research machines 387 it took me about

00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:26,750
three hours online to find a reasonable

00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:29,570
print of a photo of one and this thing

00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:31,880
was amazing in the day I miss this had

00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:33,620
32 cave ran the one that I got to play

00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:38,620
with at school this was more memory than

00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:40,820
I can't conceive of yeah a recurring

00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:42,740
theme of my life and this is the very

00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:44,090
first computer I throwed this some of

00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:46,280
this will be very very new to you

00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:48,830
because these are British computers our

00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:51,620
micro scene was so parallel to yours and

00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:53,990
so different and this Oh Vic one this is

00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:56,570
great this is made by you I used car

00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:58,400
dealership as you call it in Cambridge

00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:02,840
they made 1,500 of the moon went

00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:04,760
bankrupt and it was fantastic and I was

00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,230
heartbroken I had it for a year I was

00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,450
made to sell it so that I could buy my

00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:12,859
next can get my next computer and I

00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:14,540
didn't want to sell it I loved it there

00:34:12,859 --> 00:34:15,980
I'd managed to track down an emulator

00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:18,530
for it so I could actually

00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:20,270
and the original programming manual I

00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:22,190
got a PDF of it in it it's a lovely

00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:25,520
machine this is the machine that got me

00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:28,909
from the age of 12 no 13 all the way

00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:31,909
through to university it's at amstrad 48

00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:34,280
care DRAM a green screen a TV modulator

00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:38,510
a cassette deck that was incredibly

00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:41,210
temperamental and I spent about four

00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:43,609
years of my teens learning to program by

00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:46,220
deciphering somebody else's program it

00:34:43,609 --> 00:34:49,810
was a program listing in two parts in

00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:52,790
spaghetti basic for fourth interpreter a

00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:55,850
badly implemented fig fourth interpreter

00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:57,650
and everything I know about computing

00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:59,450
today i know because i sat in my bedroom

00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:04,000
doing that and then bunking off and

00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:09,320
plainly these things were great because

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:11,960
this small feature set there was nothing

00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,520
to them they're machines that as a kid

00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:16,310
you can just pick up and you can break

00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:18,320
and apart from vic-20 you could never

00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:19,850
actually really break one I mean you

00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,890
could blow vic-20 out there was a memory

00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:24,920
port you could write to him because it

00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:27,410
blew there was a capacitor over this

00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:30,460
particular port that just went bang when

00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:32,990
a signal went through it too much but I

00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:34,520
yeah she did know somebody who managed

00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:36,050
to blow their vic-20 up that way they

00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:39,430
did it to find out if it was true or

00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:44,540
nerve emit they went back that's great

00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:46,520
so I I used this quote in so many

00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:47,359
different presentations because I don't

00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,800
know if any of you are familiar with

00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:53,210
michael moorcock he's a pretty sci-fi

00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:54,890
writer who lives in texas now and he

00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:58,040
wrote a lot of the fiction that was my

00:35:54,890 --> 00:36:01,670
favorite reads when I was about 14 and I

00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:04,550
think this sums up the programmers state

00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:06,440
more than anything else I've read a lot

00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:08,560
of people things by programmers who are

00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:11,300
writers that have never gotten as close

00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:14,900
to where I feel I am when I'm writing

00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:16,960
code so i love to shove this in but i'm

00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:21,050
going to admit the unadmitted book I

00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:23,869
love basic I mean Ruby is the basic of

00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:25,700
the 21st century now that means that in

00:36:23,869 --> 00:36:27,290
any kind of offensive way and I dish

00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,030
definitely don't want to offend matts by

00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:29,570
saying that but it's got the same

00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:32,600
element

00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:35,990
to it you can just get into it you know

00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,980
its language doesn't get in your way you

00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:39,310
know and i'm going to show you what I

00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:42,650
vote would base it a commercial product

00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:44,750
the very first commercial product I vote

00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:51,290
in a high level language after I gave up

00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:52,550
university that right over here you

00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:54,440
can't see it very clearly cuz I've just

00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:57,350
blended out of a publicity poster today

00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:59,210
but that is a cockpit management system

00:36:57,350 --> 00:37:01,250
with navigation and everything fly your

00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:05,480
helicopter to your house and that's

00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:07,700
written in vb 3 and vb five basic don't

00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,770
diss it it's a absolutely awesome

00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:11,570
language I spent eight years of my life

00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:14,840
writing things in basic that should

00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:18,260
never have been written in base hit for

00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:22,040
money so the trouble is computers

00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:23,780
decided they needed to get serious this

00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:26,300
was a very first professional computer I

00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:27,620
had personal access to at home it's an

00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:31,430
apricot so I don't know if they ever

00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:36,260
made it over to the US but it's a 386 sx

00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:37,340
25 for that extra bag it's got a you

00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,750
know it's got a nifty three and a half

00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:42,470
inch floppy driving I mean this was

00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:44,120
serious tech in the day I was still

00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:46,460
pissing around with vax mates at uni

00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:49,850
when this this was my step of my step

00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:53,870
dad bought this new it's just like and

00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:55,400
then people went in gonna move yeah then

00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:57,440
people decided that instead of for the

00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:00,290
lovely lovely command line on all my old

00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:05,420
basic machines before I had to live with

00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:07,370
dose which okay dos 3.3 is my favorite

00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:13,760
dose it had some redeeming features that

00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:16,820
disappeared subsequently opinions that

00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,680
used to matter that don't anymore and

00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:23,080
over here I think this is windows to

00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:23,080
three windows three yeah its color

00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,890
I've actually got a copy of windows one

00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:29,050
lurking around some with I managed to

00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:31,420
track down on an archive and you boot it

00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:34,570
up and it's like bright primary eight

00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:36,670
colors windows because it could only do

00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:39,520
the bottom eighth color palette that's

00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:41,109
it it's pretty now at the same time that

00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,180
we were getting all professional and

00:38:41,109 --> 00:38:44,619
basically sticking machines in our

00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:48,099
houses that kids couldn't touch because

00:38:44,619 --> 00:38:49,660
they were too expensive things were

00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:55,119
going a bit differently in universities

00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:57,220
ah this this is four years of my life

00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:59,740
this is the it should have been three

00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:02,500
but I had so much fun playing with the

00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:05,770
vax 11 780 over there that I up

00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:08,500
Mike we're on camera again are we I felt

00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:10,030
up my degree the first time round and

00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:12,400
had to resit it which was great because

00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:14,109
I got us free extra year being the only

00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,060
person you knew how to program that damn

00:39:14,109 --> 00:39:18,070
machine in the corner all my hacker

00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:25,180
buddies it all got kicked out that year

00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:27,490
so um this is great 11 7 18 runs VMs for

00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:29,970
those who don't know that's the core

00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:32,589
principle stuff behind windows NT

00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:35,170
Microsoft stole a whole bunch of clever

00:39:32,589 --> 00:39:36,700
people from Dec because windows 3 was so

00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:39,310
sucky they needed a real operating

00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:40,630
system and then they picked one that is

00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:47,710
one of the most perverse operating

00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:49,720
systems known to man yeah ok so the

00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:51,640
terminal zones and stuff they get you

00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:55,470
back to a command line and anybody who's

00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:59,109
a lot you're no way I like terminals and

00:39:55,470 --> 00:40:02,319
command light this is the first computer

00:39:59,109 --> 00:40:05,170
I own that was a pc i bought this

00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:08,170
because i needed to run a fluid dynamic

00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:11,460
simulation for my degree dissertation

00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:14,589
and i couldn't afford a c compiler

00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:19,720
because c compiler for das back then you

00:40:14,589 --> 00:40:22,680
could do 30 32 bit compilation but do

00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:24,910
that i know we're running out of power

00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:27,880
see the easiest way to put a limit when

00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:29,560
your talk is to only have six percent

00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,480
battery power lit so we're going to be

00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:34,589
it's okay it should do about nine

00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,589
minutes I hope

00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:40,030
no it's run out I'm going to summarize

00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:51,130
because this is excellent SlideShare

00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:53,320
anyway oh come off it I knew I should

00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:56,680
have stuck the extra battery this second

00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:59,830
battery before doing this okay so let's

00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:03,820
go with I told you not to turn off no

00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:05,109
matter what the trouble with Max is that

00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,400
they just won't believe you when you say

00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:08,920
no I really just want to burn the

00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,660
battery I don't care just turn off when

00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,490
the batteries really run out so this

00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:14,890
poor netbook is now going I don't know

00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:18,580
what to do I'm running both both hyper

00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:22,170
threads a hundred percent capacity now

00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:28,060
we've got nice little red flashing light

00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:30,580
so it's turn off everything let's turn

00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:33,100
off all of that let's turn off all of

00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:41,680
that I just believe me we need four more

00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:43,750
minutes okay it's not going to come back

00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:46,150
I got some lovely photos of stuff that

00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:49,090
followed on from that I got photos of an

00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:52,750
apple newton a napoli mate and various

00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:54,790
other attempts that people of the people

00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:57,220
have made at doing computers to try and

00:41:54,790 --> 00:42:01,920
Riaan gauge kids and there's a picture

00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:04,570
of you know an olpc and they will suck

00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,730
they completely suck there's nothing

00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:08,650
about them that if i was 12 again I'd

00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:09,970
want to touch and then there's some

00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:11,470
pictures of a Raspberry Pi including

00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:14,859
picture of my walls bleep I called all

00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:17,170
back in homage to a character a computer

00:42:14,859 --> 00:42:20,290
that was a very irascible curmudgeonly

00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:22,090
character you know 70s BBC sci-fi see

00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:23,859
who is called Blake seven but spent most

00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:25,000
of his time patronizing other computers

00:42:23,859 --> 00:42:26,619
and telling people that they were

00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,650
completely irrelevant please go and do

00:42:26,619 --> 00:42:31,720
this thing that kills you which my buzz

00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:33,250
beep ice off it's got the right case it

00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:35,560
looks like and then I was going to skip

00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:37,240
on to the final thing which is everybody

00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:39,520
is now screaming Raspberry Pi was

00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:43,750
reclined major cultures gone mad with it

00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:45,280
if you go on ebay with 50 pounds and you

00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:49,140
can spend 50 pounds over seventy five

00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:52,300
dollars and you can buy yourself

00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:54,850
something like this with a keyboard and

00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:56,980
a screen and a built-in Wi-Fi connection

00:42:54,850 --> 00:43:00,460
that is completely disposable because it

00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:02,440
costs $75 and you can give that to a kid

00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:05,170
and you can stick a kitty hack on it and

00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:09,580
they can have the same pleasure using

00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:12,790
wubi that I had aged 12 and that's my

00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:18,840
tired of digital passion because I do it

00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:21,730
myself all right folks so this is a

00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:23,950
relatively quick talk I called developer

00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:25,630
productivity although based on what Ryan

00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:28,510
was talking about earlier I want to call

00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:31,840
it an T productivity or perhaps with

00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:34,120
more ligatures so so what I'm here to

00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:36,700
talk about is is wasted talent and

00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:38,410
wasted productivity how many people in

00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:39,580
this room I'm going to ask you to raise

00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:43,000
your hands but feel free if you don't

00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:47,020
want to but earn six figures $100,000 or

00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:49,090
more okay thank you a brave volunteers

00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:51,640
I'm going to wager that basically

00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:53,320
everybody in this room earns six figures

00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:55,300
or has the capacity to earn six figures

00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,860
within the next couple of years in their

00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,270
career and if you don't move it to

00:43:56,860 --> 00:44:00,370
Silicon Valley where they're throwing

00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:02,950
six figures I've kids coming right out

00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:04,960
of college but there's companies that

00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:07,900
that will spend all this money on salary

00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:11,470
and and won't spend money or won't focus

00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:12,910
on making developers more productive so

00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:15,760
I'm dia i'm the founder of a company

00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:17,920
called Circle C I and a lot of people

00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,960
think that we make hosted continuous

00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,310
integration and continuous deployment as

00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,020
a service and that's that's kind of what

00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:24,520
we tell people we do but behind the

00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:26,620
scenes what we tell each other we do is

00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:28,450
is that we sell productivity and so I

00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:30,880
spend a lot of time thinking about how

00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:32,290
to make developers a lot more productive

00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,380
and this is kind of what this talk is

00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:38,440
about so talk is is really in two parts

00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:41,680
and the first part I call hell is other

00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:43,690
people so the biggest productivity

00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,610
problem that you will ever have is the

00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:47,830
people who sit next to your work your

00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:49,570
colleagues are the people who you

00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:52,150
up every single day when you're trying

00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:53,650
to get done so if you really want

00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:56,140
to be more productive what you have to

00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:59,170
do is you need to affect your coworkers

00:44:56,140 --> 00:45:01,480
so does this sound familiar to anybody I

00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:01,819
get my best work done in the early

00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:07,099
morning

00:45:01,819 --> 00:45:08,449
before anyone arrives all right so these

00:45:07,099 --> 00:45:10,039
quotes are from people wear by the way

00:45:08,449 --> 00:45:12,709
which you should all should read or get

00:45:10,039 --> 00:45:14,900
your managers to read in one late

00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:16,670
evening I can do two or three days worth

00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:19,160
of work anyone at the hackathon last

00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:20,719
night might have felt that and this one

00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:24,229
is my personal favorite because I've

00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:25,699
worked in zoos and at 6pm thing was

00:45:24,229 --> 00:45:29,239
really quiet down and you might actually

00:45:25,699 --> 00:45:31,279
be able to get some done so the

00:45:29,239 --> 00:45:34,279
biggest impediment to this really is is

00:45:31,279 --> 00:45:35,539
people around you disrupting you they're

00:45:34,279 --> 00:45:36,680
they're talking they're having

00:45:35,539 --> 00:45:38,479
conversations they're having work

00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:40,130
conversations but they're having work

00:45:38,479 --> 00:45:41,869
conversations beside you while you're

00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:44,289
trying to get code done you can't get in

00:45:41,869 --> 00:45:47,180
the flow you can't get done

00:45:44,289 --> 00:45:49,690
managers sometimes we'll put salespeople

00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:52,519
in the same open-plan office as

00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:54,739
developers and developers are trying to

00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:56,869
get in the flow and sales guys are on

00:45:54,739 --> 00:45:58,729
the phone all day every day they're on

00:45:56,869 --> 00:46:02,089
skype they're talking loudly because

00:45:58,729 --> 00:46:04,849
that's their job and the people who run

00:46:02,089 --> 00:46:06,440
companies for god knows what reason put

00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:08,449
people whose job it is to talk loudly

00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:12,650
next to people whose job it is not to be

00:46:08,449 --> 00:46:14,299
disturbed by people who talk loudly and

00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:15,859
the worst part about this is you see the

00:46:14,299 --> 00:46:17,479
sign but that's that's a little

00:46:15,859 --> 00:46:20,059
passive-aggressive foot that sign up

00:46:17,479 --> 00:46:21,709
I've wanted to do that at offices where

00:46:20,059 --> 00:46:24,079
I worked at in the past just a little

00:46:21,709 --> 00:46:27,440
sign that says shut the up people

00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:29,959
are trying to work here and so so what

00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,549
what I try to do instead now is to give

00:46:29,959 --> 00:46:33,440
up on being passive-aggressive and just

00:46:31,549 --> 00:46:35,079
go straight for playing aggression

00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:38,680
that's

00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:40,719
that's that's a lovely anecdote that you

00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:42,999
have about your holiday now why don't

00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:45,609
you shut the up so I can get home

00:46:42,999 --> 00:46:48,219
get my work done get home to my wife and

00:46:45,609 --> 00:46:49,479
my dog and enjoy living my life instead

00:46:48,219 --> 00:46:52,890
of spending my life here listening to

00:46:49,479 --> 00:46:56,890
your lovely anecdotes so the second

00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:59,890
group of people who or did another

00:46:56,890 --> 00:47:02,920
version of these people who who disrupt

00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:05,049
you are the I what I think the technical

00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:06,969
term for the Miss selfish so

00:47:05,049 --> 00:47:10,239
these are the people who actually know

00:47:06,969 --> 00:47:13,059
that you want quiet and they know that

00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:16,119
you need to be in the zone in the flow

00:47:13,059 --> 00:47:18,309
at to get work done and still will talk

00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:19,839
around you and perhaps there might be

00:47:18,309 --> 00:47:21,459
other developers perhaps they might be

00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:23,099
you yourselves it certainly was me in a

00:47:21,459 --> 00:47:25,150
previous life before I understood this

00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:27,420
that you're having conversations around

00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:30,039
people who need who need concentration

00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:32,890
cydia I used to work in this building in

00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:35,529
San Francisco where it had it had a

00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:38,380
weird policy every time developers push

00:47:35,529 --> 00:47:40,479
code to production this speakers went

00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:42,309
off in the office with six seconds of

00:47:40,479 --> 00:47:44,349
their favorite song connected to

00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:47,920
subwoofer that disrupted the entire

00:47:44,349 --> 00:47:51,190
open-plan hardwood floor building so

00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:52,839
it's just it boggled my mind had this

00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:55,269
could happen and when I complained I got

00:47:52,839 --> 00:47:56,410
told no and that they weren't my company

00:47:55,269 --> 00:47:59,979
unfortunately and there was nothing I

00:47:56,410 --> 00:48:01,449
could do about it so fortunately if if

00:47:59,979 --> 00:48:02,619
you go with a policy like that you'll

00:48:01,449 --> 00:48:04,420
quickly find that you're not actually

00:48:02,619 --> 00:48:08,739
pushing codes production all that often

00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:10,479
so I problem kind of solves itself so

00:48:08,739 --> 00:48:12,369
another problem is is the interruptions

00:48:10,479 --> 00:48:14,229
you give to yourself that you turn on

00:48:12,369 --> 00:48:17,319
alerts you turn on email alerts you turn

00:48:14,229 --> 00:48:18,609
on I am alerts male dirtier your pocket

00:48:17,319 --> 00:48:20,499
vibrating whenever you get a text

00:48:18,609 --> 00:48:22,329
message turn all of this off this this

00:48:20,499 --> 00:48:25,089
damages your productivity pulls you out

00:48:22,329 --> 00:48:27,489
of the pulls you added the zone for no

00:48:25,089 --> 00:48:28,809
great no great shakes at all and another

00:48:27,489 --> 00:48:31,239
another interruption that I'm going to

00:48:28,809 --> 00:48:33,130
talk about is is roommates so I'm a

00:48:31,239 --> 00:48:35,529
founder and I have a couple of roommates

00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:38,170
and they sometimes are our interruptions

00:48:35,529 --> 00:48:40,269
this is my my first roommate this is my

00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:42,489
wife and she is my favorite person in

00:48:40,269 --> 00:48:45,130
the world but if i'm not home trying to

00:48:42,489 --> 00:48:47,650
code on a weekend that's not the best

00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:48,880
way for me to get things done this is

00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:51,640
this is my second roommate

00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:53,830
zenza he likes to play tug-of-war with

00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:57,970
its two toys and is is all in all a

00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:59,890
lovely lovely dog but but animals and

00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:01,720
kids are kind of the worst for your

00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:03,580
productivity because while you can kind

00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,350
of reason with your space and say you

00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:08,440
know I'm trying to get some stuff done

00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:09,940
it takes a very very hard man to tell

00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,800
his kids to shut the up because he

00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:15,700
got three more Pama doors to do before

00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:18,130
he can eat dinner this evening another

00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:19,900
enemy of productivity is is the

00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:22,510
open-plan office and specifically the

00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:26,200
architects who decide that they keep

00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:29,260
building open-plan offices and for

00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:31,450
knowledge workers who need silence even

00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:35,650
though a cough can carry across the

00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:38,200
entire thing so that that's kind of my

00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:39,940
first point shut the up is what you

00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:43,420
could call the first part of that talk

00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:44,980
the second part of the talk is is about

00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:47,680
how you can throw money at the problem

00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:50,410
if you're a manager or tech lead or

00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:52,780
company owner you can throw money at the

00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:54,490
problem of how much money your

00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:58,110
developers make all right sorry how much

00:49:54,490 --> 00:50:01,510
productivity your developers get so I a

00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:04,360
decent senior developer in in San

00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:08,170
Francisco will earn 150 thousand dollars

00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:09,940
and will cost his company 180 maybe 190

00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:11,320
thousand dollars when you take in taxon

00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:13,210
and what you know all that sort of thing

00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:17,470
and that comes to a bed eight or nine

00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:19,840
thousand dollars a month so the cost of

00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:21,070
office space in San Francisco is about

00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:23,500
seven hundred dollars a month per

00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:24,970
developer the cost of putting in a

00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:27,250
private office for every single

00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:30,190
developer in your company is seven

00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:31,810
hundred dollars a month more so you can

00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:33,520
pay an extra seven hundred dollars a

00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:35,470
month so that you're nine thousand

00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:38,020
dollar a month employee gets twice as

00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:43,750
much done raise your hand if you

00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:49,660
have a private office ten percent of the

00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:52,180
room so another thing that very easy

00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:53,800
productivity is is lunch lunch cost you

00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:56,350
fifteen dollars a day and it earns you

00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:57,400
30 minutes per developer 30 minutes that

00:50:56,350 --> 00:51:00,010
they're back at their desk earlier

00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:02,619
working it's it's a little bit mercenary

00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:04,930
but for every 16 developers you have

00:51:02,619 --> 00:51:07,990
you get one for free or up for 460k a

00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:09,599
year which is absolute bargain another

00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:11,920
bargain they throw money at the problem

00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:15,339
upgrading your devs to the latest thing

00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:17,349
if you have a macbook i had a macbook

00:51:15,339 --> 00:51:20,470
from a year ago this one is twice the

00:51:17,349 --> 00:51:21,849
ram it costs a few grand um wasn't my

00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:23,819
money but it led to me having

00:51:21,849 --> 00:51:26,769
significantly better productivity

00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:28,749
another one and here's the shield this

00:51:26,769 --> 00:51:31,450
is a my company stickers in the Sun on

00:51:28,749 --> 00:51:34,839
the table outside cloud productivity

00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:36,309
services for twenty dollars or two

00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:38,289
hundred dollars at two thousand dollars

00:51:36,309 --> 00:51:39,990
you can make your team significantly

00:51:38,289 --> 00:51:43,450
more productive with things like

00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:45,579
continuous integration and this this is

00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:49,359
the this is the the most sort of a

00:51:45,579 --> 00:51:52,900
sacrilegious idea which is in the old

00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:55,509
days engineers at IBM had access to the

00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:58,329
secretarial pool so they could get

00:51:55,509 --> 00:52:00,039
admins or secretaries to get their dry

00:51:58,329 --> 00:52:02,349
cleaning done or send flowers to their

00:52:00,039 --> 00:52:04,539
wives they were all male at the time and

00:52:02,349 --> 00:52:05,890
this seems narrative to people who don't

00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:07,450
even have testers and don't have QA

00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:10,299
departments this seems like like

00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:13,390
sacrilege or sort of supreme arrogance

00:52:10,299 --> 00:52:15,220
um but when I was a contractor and I

00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:17,319
could measure my hourly rate and how

00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:19,779
much time it took for me to take my bike

00:52:17,319 --> 00:52:21,369
into the shop I hired a college kid and

00:52:19,779 --> 00:52:24,329
the Padma fraction of that to go do it

00:52:21,369 --> 00:52:26,470
for me I recommend you do the same

00:52:24,329 --> 00:52:30,730
Secretary's cost twenty dollars in our

00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:33,369
engineers cost like 70 to 100 so that's

00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:37,650
it shut the up throw money at the

00:52:33,369 --> 00:52:37,650
problem and more code faster thank

00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:13,870
