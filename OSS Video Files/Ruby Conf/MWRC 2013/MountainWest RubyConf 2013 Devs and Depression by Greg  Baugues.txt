Title: MountainWest RubyConf 2013 Devs and Depression by Greg  Baugues
Publication date: 2020-01-28
Playlist: MWRC 2013
Description: 
	I am a developer, and I have Type II BiPolar and ADHD.
It's not something we talk about, but BiPolar, depression, and ADHD runs rampant in the developer community - they tend to correlate with higher intelligence. Many of the symptoms of this conditions make for great developers, but also cause incredible damage. We recently lost one of our co-workers because of untreated mental illness.
I want to share my story - and let people know that it's okay to talk about these things, that it's nothing to be ashamed of, and how to get help, and how to help those around them.

OK, yeah, so my name's Greg.

00:00:22,628 --> 00:00:26,020
I work for a company called Table XI in Chicago.

00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,271
We're a thirty person Rails shop.

00:00:29,271 --> 00:00:30,568
I've been programming most of my life.

00:00:30,568 --> 00:00:34,854
I got started programming on a TRS-80 when I was about six or seven years old.

00:00:34,854 --> 00:00:38,477
I had cassette tapes and it had BASIC on there.

00:00:38,477 --> 00:00:40,578
I remember this magazine called 3-2-1 Contact

00:00:40,578 --> 00:00:44,816
would come every month and it had BASIC programs on the back page.

00:00:44,816 --> 00:00:50,322
I'd sit there and I wouldn't copy and paste, I would literally copy the program into the thing and run it

00:00:50,322 --> 00:00:53,091
and just make the screen change colors and whatnot.

00:00:53,091 --> 00:00:58,629
I spent most of my professional career kind of straddling development and client-facing work.

00:00:58,629 --> 00:01:02,133
And I also have type-II bipolar and ADD,

00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:05,853
not to be confused with Matz's Anniversary-Driven Development from yesterday,

00:01:05,853 --> 00:01:09,980
but Attention Deficit Disorder.

00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,343
Today I want to tell you guys my story.

00:01:12,343 --> 00:01:14,378
I want to tell you why we need to be talking more about

00:01:14,378 --> 00:01:16,714
depression and mental illness

00:01:16,714 --> 00:01:22,721
in our offices, with our peers, at meetups, and at conferences like this.

00:01:22,721 --> 00:01:27,725
You might be familiar with type-I bipolar. it's also called manic depression.

00:01:27,725 --> 00:01:31,829
It means that you cycle between periods of mania — the good parts —

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:35,521
and depression at the bottom.

00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:38,270
The mania can feel kind of euphoric,

00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,306
and it can also be incredibly destructive,

00:01:41,306 --> 00:01:43,240
because it leads to great impulsiveness.

00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,076
People make a lot of bad decisions at that time.

00:01:46,076 --> 00:01:49,104
For type-I bipolar, this can also be rapid-cycling.

00:01:49,104 --> 00:01:52,521
So you can go quickly from top to bottom very fast.

00:01:52,521 --> 00:01:56,270
My bipolar, type-II bipolar, is much milder,

00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:59,436
and the cycles tend to be much more elongated.

00:01:59,436 --> 00:02:01,521
So what it would look like for me

00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:05,396
is typically anywhere from four to twelve weeks or so of

00:02:05,396 --> 00:02:10,935
just this long, slow, gradual slide down.

00:02:10,935 --> 00:02:16,309
It felt for me like I was always trying to crawl up a gravel incline

00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:19,544
that was really steep, and no matter how hard I spun my wheels,

00:02:19,544 --> 00:02:24,483
I just kept sliding back down further and further.

00:02:24,483 --> 00:02:26,751
And this was quite frustrating for me.

00:02:26,751 --> 00:02:30,820
I first noticed this during my last year, my fifth year

00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,264
— my "victory lap," although it wasn't particularly victorious for me —

00:02:34,264 --> 00:02:36,771
at the University of Illinois.

00:02:36,771 --> 00:02:41,733
And I had just broken up with a girlfriend, I had just moved into a place on my own,

00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:44,736
my first time living without any roommates.

00:02:44,736 --> 00:02:48,473
I was on my way to failing out of school

00:02:48,473 --> 00:02:50,436
and things were just getting really rough for me.

00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:52,042
I was never a particularly good student

00:02:52,042 --> 00:02:55,436
but I was always kind of smart enough that i could kind of fake my way through it.

00:02:55,436 --> 00:02:57,816
But that started catching up to me my junior, senior year.

00:02:57,816 --> 00:03:01,553
It turns out that, if you're going to go in and take a linear algebra final,

00:03:01,553 --> 00:03:04,603
it helps if you actually know what linear algebra means.

00:03:04,603 --> 00:03:06,757
I've taken that class twice now. I still couldn't tell you.

00:03:06,757 --> 00:03:12,965
And it became pretty obvious that I wasn't going to make it,

00:03:12,965 --> 00:03:13,999
that I wasn't going to graduate,

00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:16,901
and I didn't know how to tell my parents about that.

00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:20,306
And I didn't know how to deal with the fact that everybody else around me

00:03:20,306 --> 00:03:22,474
seemed to be graduating just fine,

00:03:22,474 --> 00:03:24,977
but I wasn't.

00:03:24,977 --> 00:03:25,876
I had a friend who said,

00:03:25,876 --> 00:03:27,436
"Greg is one of the smartest guys I know,

00:03:27,436 --> 00:03:29,981
but he also just happens to be one of the laziest people I know."

00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:33,551
And I believed that shit, because I didn't have any other excuse for it.

00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:36,020
You know, like, I slept all day, I didn't go to class,

00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,424
I knew that I was mentally capable, or at least smart enough,

00:03:39,424 --> 00:03:41,604
to go to class and do the homework.

00:03:41,604 --> 00:03:46,520
I just wasn't doing it, and that sounds like laziness to me.

00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:51,353
I pretty much, when I'm at the bottom of the depression, I sleep a lot.

00:03:51,353 --> 00:03:54,104
It's the most obvious symptom.

00:03:54,104 --> 00:03:59,477
The best part of my day back then was the time in which I was unconscious

00:03:59,477 --> 00:04:01,712
and the time I didn't have to deal with reality that was piling up,

00:04:01,712 --> 00:04:06,084
and just physically it was so hard to get out of bed I'd oversleep my alarm.

00:04:06,084 --> 00:04:09,603
I'd stop going to class, I'd stop going to work.

00:04:09,603 --> 00:04:14,925
I had a part time job with a very flexible schedule

00:04:14,925 --> 00:04:18,521
and it took them a while to realize that I had pretty much stopped coming in.

00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:21,853
And I had a friend, a coworker, who was just a great friend,

00:04:21,853 --> 00:04:26,304
and he really cared, he was concerned, and he sent me a couple emails just saying,

00:04:26,304 --> 00:04:29,005
"Hey, Greg, what's going on, you know?"

00:04:29,005 --> 00:04:32,342
And I ignored them because I didn't know how to talk to him about it.

00:04:32,342 --> 00:04:35,979
And then one day, it was like 2:00 on a Tuesday,

00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:37,649
I got a phone call from Bill,

00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:40,604
and I was still in bed,

00:04:40,604 --> 00:04:42,886
and I ignored it.

00:04:42,886 --> 00:04:45,937
And then he called again and I ignored it again.

00:04:45,937 --> 00:04:48,792
And then I heard a knock on my door.

00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:51,187
It was like, "Hey, Greg, it's Bill."

00:04:51,187 --> 00:04:54,298
And I was like, "Shit.

00:04:54,298 --> 00:04:56,436
It's fine. Just be quiet. He doesn't need to know I'm here.

00:04:56,436 --> 00:05:02,186
Besides, Tuesday at 2, why would he even think i'm here anyway?"

00:05:02,186 --> 00:05:05,103
And then I heard the doorknob start to turn.

00:05:05,103 --> 00:05:08,604
I wasn't very good at locking my doors back then.

00:05:08,604 --> 00:05:11,687
and at the time I was sleeping on kind of a cheap mattress.

00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:15,352
It was on one of those cheap bedframes with the casters on it

00:05:15,352 --> 00:05:20,104
and there was a gap between my bed and the wall that's about this big.

00:05:20,104 --> 00:05:24,396
And I very slowly slid into that gap

00:05:24,396 --> 00:05:27,163
and I pulled the blankets up over my head

00:05:27,163 --> 00:05:30,104
and I just held my breath while Bill walked into my living room

00:05:30,104 --> 00:05:32,837
and he poked his head in my bedroom

00:05:32,837 --> 00:05:36,520
and then he walked into the office and then left.

00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,376
That's what shame feels like.

00:05:40,376 --> 00:05:44,353
I failed out. I moved back home, went to Indianapolis, lived with my parents again.

00:05:44,353 --> 00:05:45,715
I started doing freelance work.

00:05:45,715 --> 00:05:48,252
I actually signed up for classes at a college there.

00:05:48,252 --> 00:05:53,271
After six months or so it became pretty obvious that I just wasn't going to be able to physically or mentally do that.

00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:55,894
So I lied to my parents and I told them I graduated.

00:05:55,894 --> 00:05:59,811
And i just came clean on that one about four years or so ago.

00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:02,311
And it was so frustrating,

00:06:02,311 --> 00:06:03,895
because even when I wanted to,

00:06:03,895 --> 00:06:06,601
even when I would go to class,

00:06:06,601 --> 00:06:08,500
I couldn't focus.

00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,171
Even when I wanted to do client work,

00:06:10,171 --> 00:06:12,837
and unless it was 2 in the morning the night before the work was due,

00:06:12,837 --> 00:06:13,671
i couldn't do it.

00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:15,395
When i got there, when I got focused on stuff,

00:06:15,395 --> 00:06:18,142
I could produce pretty good work.

00:06:18,142 --> 00:06:21,311
But I just felt like I had no control.

00:06:21,311 --> 00:06:22,729
And there's this verse in the Bible that says,

00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:27,643
"I do not understand what I do. What I want to do, I do not do.

00:06:27,643 --> 00:06:30,145
But instead that which I hate, I do."

00:06:30,145 --> 00:06:32,024
And that's what it felt like.

00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:34,593
It felt like anything that I tried to do, even the simplest task,

00:06:34,593 --> 00:06:36,930
it felt like I was walking through a swimming pool,

00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,395
like I just couldn't force myself, I didn't have control.

00:06:40,395 --> 00:06:42,767
I was like, "Why is this? Why can't I control myself?"

00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:49,207
So I did what you do when you have a question and need an answer to it, and I googled it.

00:06:49,207 --> 00:06:54,395
One night it was like 2 AM, and just out of desperation I googled "chronic procrastination."

00:06:54,395 --> 00:06:58,645
And it wasn't long before I was reading about attention deficit disorder.

00:06:58,645 --> 00:07:01,888
And I had always kind of joked that I had ADD,

00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,590
but I never meant it,

00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,127
because ADD is what lazy people use as an excuse

00:07:06,127 --> 00:07:07,228
because they don't want to work hard,

00:07:07,228 --> 00:07:09,977
and that's not me.

00:07:09,977 --> 00:07:13,145
But I read this book by this guy named Thom Hartmann

00:07:13,145 --> 00:07:15,502
called "The Edison Gene," and his premise was that

00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:20,939
ADD is genetic. And that inventors and creators have it.

00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:25,645
It's common. He said that tens of thousands of years ago,

00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:28,114
we had hunters and we had farmers, or gatherers,

00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:32,749
and in order to be a good hunter, you need to go out into new territory every day

00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:34,753
and you need to be constantly scanning the horizon

00:07:34,753 --> 00:07:39,693
and able to shift your focus from this thing to whatever comes into your peripheral vision

00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:41,859
and rapidly shift.

00:07:41,859 --> 00:07:45,864
In order to be a farmer, you just have to be good at doing the same thing every single day.

00:07:45,864 --> 00:07:48,199
You have to be methodical about it.

00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:51,561
And neither skill is better or worse than the other.

00:07:51,561 --> 00:07:55,978
It's just that, over time, as civilizations grew, farmers became

00:07:55,978 --> 00:07:57,811
much more useful than hunters,

00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,561
because you can support larger population bases.

00:08:00,561 --> 00:08:03,563
And when we'd go to war, it'd be the hunters who would go off and get killed

00:08:03,563 --> 00:08:06,951
and so their genes would get removed from the pool much more quickly.

00:08:06,951 --> 00:08:10,895
And over time, that portion of the population dropped,

00:08:10,895 --> 00:08:13,645
and now it's estimated that about 10-20% of the population

00:08:13,645 --> 00:08:17,763
could probably be diagnosed with ADD.

00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:21,867
He talked in that book about how people with ADD are just non-linear thinkers

00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:25,504
and people who don't have ADD are more linear thinkers.

00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:28,107
And what I found most encouraging about this is, he said

00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:31,477
that the symptoms that we attribute to people with ADD,

00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:36,115
things like lack of focus or procrastination or indecisiveness,

00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:41,228
those symptoms disappear during periods of high pressure.

00:08:41,228 --> 00:08:44,478
2 AM before the paper's due.

00:08:44,478 --> 00:08:47,927
Those same symptoms appear in linear thinkers

00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:50,394
during the same periods of high pressure.

00:08:50,394 --> 00:08:55,101
So you have to take a linear thinker and put them into a high pressure situation

00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:59,813
and they will exhibit indecisiveness. They will have a hard time focusing.

00:08:59,813 --> 00:09:01,441
And I found this really encouraging.

00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:03,562
Because it wasn't that I was broken — it was just that,

00:09:03,562 --> 00:09:08,394
in our society, we've built it so that we don't have a lot of high pressure situations.

00:09:08,394 --> 00:09:10,384
If you want to play nice with everyone else these days,

00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:14,018
you need to be good at showing up to work every single day at the same time.

00:09:14,018 --> 00:09:16,960
You need to be good at paying your bills or balancing your checkbook,

00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:21,063
whatever that means.

00:09:21,063 --> 00:09:23,133
So I kind of accepted this.

00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:26,335
It took me a year between reading this book and these other books I'd read

00:09:26,335 --> 00:09:28,517
and actually going and seeing someone about it,

00:09:28,517 --> 00:09:29,740
because again, I just wanted to fight through it,

00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,142
try harder, do it myself.

00:09:31,142 --> 00:09:35,099
But I did. I went and I saw a therapist, and I took the test.

00:09:35,099 --> 00:09:36,433
And she comes back and she says,

00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:39,017
"Yes, you absolutely have ADD, you're off the charts."

00:09:39,017 --> 00:09:41,850
And I was like "Yessss."

00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,101
She said, "But, I think you also have type-II bipolar."

00:09:45,101 --> 00:09:48,659
And I was like "Noooo....

00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:56,849
no, I will take the ADD, and you can keep the bipolar,

00:09:56,849 --> 00:09:58,683
because that's what crazy people have,

00:09:58,683 --> 00:10:01,206
and clearly that's not me."

00:10:01,206 --> 00:10:03,474
And so I pretty much lived my life like that for two years.

00:10:03,474 --> 00:10:07,476
I went to see a doctor, told him about my ADD.

00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:09,577
He said "There's two different kinds of drugs we can give you.

00:10:09,577 --> 00:10:14,420
One's going to take about two weeks or so to build up in your system for you to notice a difference.

00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,721
The other one we can give you, a stimulant,

00:10:16,721 --> 00:10:18,054
you'll notice a difference in about fifteen minutes."

00:10:18,054 --> 00:10:20,768
I was like "I'll try option B."

00:10:20,768 --> 00:10:26,797
And he was right. Fifteen minutes later my world went from out here to like right here.

00:10:26,797 --> 00:10:31,567
It was the first time in my life I could just make a list of A B and C, focus on it, do it in that order.

00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:34,432
It was amazing.

00:10:34,432 --> 00:10:36,683
But the depression remained.

00:10:36,683 --> 00:10:39,978
And it got worse because the meds helped me focus,

00:10:39,978 --> 00:10:42,268
and if the thing I was thinking about was how depressed I was,

00:10:42,268 --> 00:10:45,884
then it just helped me focus on how depressed I was.

00:10:45,884 --> 00:10:47,933
And the pattern throughout my life,

00:10:47,933 --> 00:10:54,490
because I was not willing to consider that my unhappiness was coming from inside of me,

00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:57,767
was internal, I would look to external factors,

00:10:57,767 --> 00:11:00,629
and the most obvious external factors are where you live and where you work.

00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:02,683
So when I was in college, I was like, "Screw this place.

00:11:02,683 --> 00:11:06,517
If I was just not in college, like, I'm not built for this, then things would be better."

00:11:06,517 --> 00:11:08,139
And so I moved to Indianapolis.

00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:12,683
And then after a year, I'm like, "Well, screw this living with my parents stuff, like, I'm going to move to Chicago."

00:11:12,683 --> 00:11:16,183
So I move to Chicago, I get a job with a software startup with like five people,

00:11:16,183 --> 00:11:17,981
it's a great job for me,

00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:20,433
and I'm rocking it out for the first several months.

00:11:20,433 --> 00:11:23,989
And then, eleven, twelve months later, I'm like, "Well, this place sucks."

00:11:23,989 --> 00:11:25,268
Like, I'm pretty unhappy again.

00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,323
Maybe I'm just burned out on technology.

00:11:27,323 --> 00:11:30,126
So I go get a job showing apartments.

00:11:30,126 --> 00:11:32,995
And that's great. I'm like the top performer for a few months.

00:11:32,995 --> 00:11:36,400
And things start getting bad again.

00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,016
Around this time I met a guy named Josh Golden

00:11:39,016 --> 00:11:42,735
when i was playing poker, which i was doing a ton of at the time.

00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:45,707
And Josh Golden was the CEO of Table XI.

00:11:45,707 --> 00:11:49,836
And he and I became pretty good friends over the course of the year.

00:11:49,836 --> 00:11:53,837
He told me, he found my background, the mix of sales and programming interesting.

00:11:53,837 --> 00:11:57,251
He said, "You know, whenever you get tired of doing what you're doing, let us know."

00:11:57,251 --> 00:11:59,169
So one day I just up and quit my job.

00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:02,586
I texted him and said "Hey, if you're still interested, I'm available."

00:12:02,586 --> 00:12:07,610
And about six weeks later I started working for Table XI.

00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:11,752
On that day, I had exactly one dollar in my pocket

00:12:11,752 --> 00:12:13,802
and seventy cents in my bank account

00:12:13,802 --> 00:12:17,669
because I hadn't been doing a very good job at the 100%-commission sales job.

00:12:17,669 --> 00:12:21,169
I'd been pretty much non-functional.

00:12:21,169 --> 00:12:25,477
And my roommate and i had had our hot water shut off about a month earlier.

00:12:25,477 --> 00:12:27,579
We didn't have enough money to get it turned back on, so

00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:29,717
I was taking cold showers most days.

00:12:29,717 --> 00:12:31,951
I got to work, I didn't really know what I was going to do for lunch,

00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:35,753
and that was the day I found out that Table XI buys lunch for its employees every day.

00:12:35,753 --> 00:12:39,860
We have a chef now, but that day around 11:30,

00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:44,865
Josh just IMed me and said, "Hey, give me your Jimmy John's order."

00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:47,087
Table XI started out great. I mean, it was perfect.

00:12:47,087 --> 00:12:50,837
It was exactly the company that I moved to Chicago hoping that I would find.

00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:52,875
There were only six of us at the time.

00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,210
There were many days when I felt like the dumbest guy in the room,

00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,044
which was amazing.

00:12:57,044 --> 00:12:58,276
We worked on interesting projects,

00:12:58,276 --> 00:12:59,979
we had this cool loft place,

00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,447
it just was cool and I was doing great work.

00:13:02,447 --> 00:13:06,835
And sure enough, six, seven, eight months later, a year later,

00:13:06,835 --> 00:13:09,055
things started getting pretty bad.

00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:16,419
And it got to the point where I was dropping the ball every time it was put in my hands.

00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:20,534
And I had a string of weeks when i didn't show up to work until about 2 pm.

00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:22,919
I'd oversleep my alarm every day.

00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:26,739
And things finally came to a head one day when it was a Friday,

00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:29,586
we had a big project due with a client, it was on me.

00:13:29,586 --> 00:13:31,669
I had stayed at the office all night trying to work on it,

00:13:31,669 --> 00:13:33,445
left defeated, wasn't able to focus on it,

00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:37,317
came home, said I'd get up early, overslept my alarm, and Josh was leaving that day

00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:41,668
to fly to Italy to propose to the woman who's now his wife.

00:13:41,668 --> 00:13:45,002
Josh lived about a block down the street from me.

00:13:45,002 --> 00:13:49,295
So once again, I woke up to someone walking into my apartment,

00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,751
saying, "Hey, Greg, are you in here?"

00:13:51,751 --> 00:13:53,801
And this time there's no gap between my bed and my wall

00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:56,920
and I just had to face it.

00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,502
I set up an appointment with a psychiatrist that day.

00:14:00,502 --> 00:14:04,110
I realized that it was pride that was keeping me from seeing someone.

00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,047
I didn't want to admit that something was wrong with me.

00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:12,419
And I said to myself, "I can't control this, but at least if I can localize the damage to myself,

00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:15,454
I'll be ok," and I realized that I was just harming

00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:21,539
everyone else around me by not seeking help for this thing too.

00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:27,956
Four hours after I set up an appointment, I met my wife Rachel, who's right down here.

00:14:27,956 --> 00:14:30,789
The doctor says, "Yeah, we've got drugs for that."

00:14:30,789 --> 00:14:35,123
He says, "Type-II bipolar, sounds like exactly what you have."

00:14:35,123 --> 00:14:39,494
He says, "These meds we have, lamotrigine, they're great, they work almost all the time.

00:14:39,494 --> 00:14:42,790
Every once in a while there's this one side effect,

00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,999
Every once in a while, in small cases,

00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:52,456
you'll end up getting a rash inside your anus."

00:14:52,456 --> 00:14:57,078
And I said, "Well, I'm pretty sure that if I get a rash inside of my anus,

00:14:57,078 --> 00:15:03,206
I'm still going to be depressed."

00:15:03,206 --> 00:15:10,657
Fortunately that didn't happen. So far, yeah. It's been like five years.

00:15:10,657 --> 00:15:13,261
And I've been remarkably stable ever since.

00:15:13,261 --> 00:15:15,163
It took me a while to climb out of that hole.

00:15:15,163 --> 00:15:18,206
Not to say that everything's been happy since then.

00:15:18,206 --> 00:15:21,002
Not to say that I don't still have days when I feel depressed. I do.

00:15:21,002 --> 00:15:23,791
But now they're days, not weeks or months,

00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:26,373
and I'm no longer crippled by them.

00:15:26,373 --> 00:15:29,746
I'm incredibly fortunate. My meds worked the first time,

00:15:29,746 --> 00:15:31,623
I had health insurance, I could see someone.

00:15:31,623 --> 00:15:36,252
Table XI didn't fire me even though they should have, over and over again.

00:15:36,252 --> 00:15:38,254
I'm still there six years later.

00:15:38,254 --> 00:15:42,290
I met my wife who helped me get out of this hole.

00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:45,040
A lot of people who have what I have aren't as lucky.

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,791
It's estimated that about 5% of the population suffers from bipolar.

00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:57,955
10-25% of them will die from it, and one in three will attempt suicide at some point in their life.

00:15:57,955 --> 00:16:00,243
Why does this matter to you guys?

00:16:00,243 --> 00:16:05,913
If it's 5% of the general population, my guess is that it's three to four times that for developers.

00:16:05,913 --> 00:16:10,456
These are some cherry-picked symptoms of bipolar disorder:

00:16:10,456 --> 00:16:14,321
Hyperfocusing. Sure, it's hard to focus sometimes, but once you actually get down, you get into it,

00:16:14,321 --> 00:16:16,373
the whole world just blurs away.

00:16:16,373 --> 00:16:19,540
You can sit there for 12 hours at a time and just crank on it.

00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,664
Racing Thoughts is exactly what it sounds like.

00:16:21,664 --> 00:16:24,065
Pressured Speech is when those racing thoughts try to escape

00:16:24,065 --> 00:16:26,622
through the small hole of your mouth.

00:16:26,622 --> 00:16:30,371
Social Isolation. Irregular Sleep, especially onset insomnia,

00:16:30,371 --> 00:16:31,674
which means that it's hard to fall asleep at night

00:16:31,674 --> 00:16:34,290
and almost impossible to wake up in the morning.

00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,145
And Grandiosity, thinking that the rules don't apply to you,

00:16:37,145 --> 00:16:38,613
thinking that you're better than everyone else,

00:16:38,613 --> 00:16:42,250
that you can solve problems that have eluded everybody else.

00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:46,120
If you're a young adult or an adolescent struggling with these symptoms,

00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,040
finding software development probably feels a little bit

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,429
like coming home. We accept the socially isolated.

00:16:54,429 --> 00:16:59,622
We will work with irregular sleep patterns.

00:16:59,622 --> 00:17:04,706
We will seek out people who have the grandiosity to believe

00:17:04,706 --> 00:17:07,039
that they can solve problems that others can't.

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:12,400
We'll accept irregular bursts of productivity.

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,622
And our heroes are the people who are crazy enough to believe

00:17:14,622 --> 00:17:19,487
that they can change the world.

00:17:19,487 --> 00:17:26,122
Last September, we had a developer come and interview with us. His name was Caleb Corman.

00:17:26,122 --> 00:17:30,400
And his resume was very impressive.

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,118
He had worked with three of the best Rails shops in Chicago: Hashrocket, Obtiva, and ThoughtWorks,

00:17:36,118 --> 00:17:39,007
But he only spent a year or less at each one of them,

00:17:39,007 --> 00:17:41,076
which raised some red flags.

00:17:41,076 --> 00:17:44,036
But we hired him on as a contractor, and he was just great.

00:17:44,036 --> 00:17:47,952
I got to pair with him, and he was one of the first guys I had ever paired with.

00:17:47,952 --> 00:17:49,951
And I learned so much.

00:17:49,951 --> 00:17:52,703
I mean, it's so rare that you find these people who are brilliant

00:17:52,703 --> 00:17:55,758
but patient and good teachers.

00:17:55,758 --> 00:18:01,786
He taught me about code smells. He taught me about the Pry debugger.

00:18:01,786 --> 00:18:06,285
He tried to teach me vim, but that didn't really stick.

00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:09,838
I remember, I had never paired with anyone before

00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,605
and he taught me all these verbal shortcuts that we used

00:18:11,605 --> 00:18:15,676
for punctuation, right? Because the names for punctuation are long.

00:18:15,676 --> 00:18:19,014
So we don't say "exclamation mark," we say "bang."

00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:22,017
And we don't say "question mark," it's a (inaudible).

00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:26,785
And it's not an "underscore," but it's a "skid," is what he taught me.

00:18:26,785 --> 00:18:34,829
And we don't say "pound sign." We say "octothorpe."

00:18:34,829 --> 00:18:38,314
I never got that, I never understood it.

00:18:38,314 --> 00:18:40,602
It's like we've got two commonly accepted monosyllabic names

00:18:40,602 --> 00:18:43,897
for that piece of punctuation and we call it an "octothorpe."

00:18:43,897 --> 00:18:47,564
It's just a bad-ass name, I guess.

00:18:47,564 --> 00:18:51,111
A couple weeks after he started working for us, Caleb started calling in sick.

00:18:51,111 --> 00:18:53,013
And he started showing up late.

00:18:53,013 --> 00:18:57,519
And the excuse was a little different every time, and it just felt way too familiar to me.

00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:06,526
And I told him my story, and I pulled him aside, and I was just like, "What's going on?"

00:19:06,526 --> 00:19:09,147
And he said, "Yeah, you know, I've kind of wondered for a while

00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:10,980
if I have something like that." 0:19:10.980,0:19:10.964 He was like, "But what am I going to do?

00:19:10,964 --> 00:19:14,814
It's not like I'm just going to cold-call a psychiatrist from the Yellow Pages."

00:19:14,814 --> 00:19:16,838
So I gave him a couple names, and he called around,

00:19:16,838 --> 00:19:20,841
and it took a little bit of time because it's hard to get availability sometimes

00:19:20,841 --> 00:19:24,178
but he got an appointment set up with a psychiatrist for a few weeks out.

00:19:24,178 --> 00:19:26,815
The appointment was set up for a Friday.

00:19:26,815 --> 00:19:30,685
The day before that, he sent an email to the team that we were working on,

00:19:30,685 --> 00:19:33,689
and he said he was sick, he was seeing a doctor tomorrow and he wouldn't be in.

00:19:33,689 --> 00:19:36,647
And then he sent me an email, and it just said,

00:19:36,647 --> 00:19:39,694
"Hey, I'm having a rough couple of days."

00:19:39,694 --> 00:19:44,148
And he said, "Right now I'm just struggling with a lot of things in my head,

00:19:44,148 --> 00:19:46,935
and my emotions, it's kept me up the last two nights,

00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:51,506
and that in turn has taken its toll on my mental and physical capacity this morning.

00:19:51,506 --> 00:19:55,564
I'm scared that if I come into work, I'm going to make a fool of myself with our guests today.

00:19:55,564 --> 00:19:59,814
I think it would be better if I just focus on making it to my appointment tomorrow."

00:19:59,814 --> 00:20:01,897
He didn't make it to his appointment.

00:20:01,897 --> 00:20:04,482
We found out later that he had run out of money

00:20:04,482 --> 00:20:08,022
and the day after that he died of an overdose.

00:20:08,022 --> 00:20:10,457
It was an unintentional overdose, we're quite certain.

00:20:10,457 --> 00:20:14,362
He called 911 from his phone and he died at the hospital,

00:20:14,362 --> 00:20:17,147
and his roommate, who was the first to his apartment after,

00:20:17,147 --> 00:20:20,101
said it was set up just like he was settling in for a Saturday night.

00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:23,003
He had his videogame controller on one side of his couch

00:20:23,003 --> 00:20:27,675
and an open pack of Oreos and a can of Dr. Pepper on the other.

00:20:27,675 --> 00:20:31,112
Apparently he had had a struggle with addiction for quite a while.

00:20:31,112 --> 00:20:35,011
Some of his friends knew about it; we didn't.

00:20:35,011 --> 00:20:38,920
His friends said the problem was, Caleb was just so damn smart,

00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:43,472
he was really good at covering it up and making it seem like it wasn't so bad.

00:20:43,472 --> 00:20:45,261
The thing that pisses me off most about this is that

00:20:45,261 --> 00:20:48,542
Caleb died of an overdose on speed.

00:20:48,542 --> 00:20:49,980
Speed is an amphetamine,

00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:54,716
and the meds that are prescribed to me for my ADD are dextroamphetamine.

00:20:54,716 --> 00:21:01,455
I'm quite certain that Caleb died self-medicating an untreated mental illness.

00:21:01,455 --> 00:21:06,128
The history of computer science is too littered with tragedies like this.

00:21:06,128 --> 00:21:10,344
Alan Turing, the father of computer science,

00:21:10,344 --> 00:21:16,373
committed suicide after facing intense persecution from his government.

00:21:16,373 --> 00:21:23,920
And earlier this year, we lost Aaron Swartz to similar circumstances.

00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,426
In 2007, Aaron Swartz wrote this:

00:21:26,426 --> 00:21:30,984
"I have a lot of illnesses. I don't talk about it much for a variety of reasons.

00:21:30,984 --> 00:21:33,676
I feel ashamed to have an illness. It sounds absurd,

00:21:33,676 --> 00:21:37,224
but there's still enormous stigma around being sick.

00:21:37,224 --> 00:21:39,294
I don't want to use being ill as an excuse,

00:21:39,294 --> 00:21:42,920
although sometimes I wonder how much more productive I'd be

00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,198
if i wasn't so sick.

00:21:44,198 --> 00:21:47,930
Surely there have been times when you have been sad.

00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,930
Perhaps a loved one has abandoned you,

00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,761
or a plan has gone horribly awry.

00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:53,926
Your face falls. Perhaps you cry.

00:21:53,926 --> 00:21:55,592
You feel worthless.

00:21:55,592 --> 00:21:58,760
You wonder whether it's worth going on.

00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,593
Everything you think about feels bleak:

00:22:00,593 --> 00:22:03,760
the things you've done, the things you hope to do, the people around you.

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,788
You lie in bed and want to keep the lights off.

00:22:06,788 --> 00:22:08,322
Depressed mood is like that,

00:22:08,322 --> 00:22:11,993
only it doesn't come for any reason and it doesn't go for any reason either.

00:22:11,993 --> 00:22:14,676
Go outside and get some fresh air, cuddle with a loved one,

00:22:14,676 --> 00:22:16,176
and you don't feel any better,

00:22:16,176 --> 00:22:20,470
only more upset at being unable to feel the joy that everyone else seems to feel.

00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:23,474
Everything gets colored by the sadness.

00:22:23,474 --> 00:22:26,010
Depression causes nearly half of all disability,

00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:29,842
it affects one in six, and explains more current unhappiness than poverty.

00:22:29,842 --> 00:22:34,176
Sadly, depression, like other mental illnesses, especially addiction,

00:22:34,176 --> 00:22:37,553
is not seen as real enough to deserve the investment and awareness

00:22:37,553 --> 00:22:41,010
of conditions like breast cancer, which affects one in eight,

00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:44,592
or AIDS, which affects one in 150.

00:22:44,592 --> 00:22:49,176
And there is, of course, the shame."

00:22:49,176 --> 00:22:52,636
The shame is what's killing us.

00:22:52,636 --> 00:22:54,668
And the shame and the stigma around mental illness

00:22:54,668 --> 00:22:58,926
is why our coworkers and our friends are suffering from this.

00:22:58,926 --> 00:23:02,676
If I stood up here and I told you guys that I have cancer,

00:23:02,676 --> 00:23:04,761
I wouldn't be afraid that anyone would think,

00:23:04,761 --> 00:23:07,482
"Oh, it's just all in his head."

00:23:07,482 --> 00:23:08,950
If I told you that I took insulin,

00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,761
no one would say, "Aren't you afraid that you're going to be

00:23:11,761 --> 00:23:13,955
dependent on that for the rest of your life?"

00:23:13,955 --> 00:23:17,920
No one would think that I was using it as a crutch.

00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,562
If I broke my leg, no one would say, "Just try harder."

00:23:19,562 --> 00:23:22,397
They'd say, "Go see a doctor!"

00:23:22,397 --> 00:23:25,910
But we have different rules for how we perceive

00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,702
illnesses that affect the brain

00:23:27,702 --> 00:23:30,204
than we do for anything else.

00:23:30,204 --> 00:23:32,592
Which is ironic because the brain is actually the most complicated

00:23:32,592 --> 00:23:35,420
organ in the human body.

00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,759
And yet so many of us are reluctant to use

00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:41,930
modern medical advances to help cure

00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,426
the illnesses that affect it.

00:23:43,426 --> 00:23:46,592
I think this is particularly true for developers,

00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:49,259
because we've spent so much of our life being praised

00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:51,725
for how well our brain works.

00:23:51,725 --> 00:23:55,129
But the idea that it could possibly be misfunctioning

00:23:55,129 --> 00:23:59,300
threatens our identity and our self-worth.

00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:03,872
I can understand why, if you feel like you're struggling with this stuff,

00:24:03,872 --> 00:24:05,675
you might be reluctant to go see someone

00:24:05,675 --> 00:24:07,910
or reluctant to take meds.

00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:10,260
It took me a year from diagnosing myself with ADD

00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,713
to seek someone. It took me two years from having

00:24:12,713 --> 00:24:14,550
a medical professional tell me that I had bipolar

00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:18,218
to go get treatment for it. I get that.

00:24:18,218 --> 00:24:21,676
I was afraid that it would affect the parts of my brain

00:24:21,676 --> 00:24:24,176
that made me really good at what I do.

00:24:24,176 --> 00:24:26,660
I was afraid that it would rob me of my creativity.

00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,231
And yes, it's true. My brain works differently now.

00:24:29,231 --> 00:24:30,964
I code differently now.

00:24:30,964 --> 00:24:34,426
I no longer am consumed by thoughts and stay up all night

00:24:34,426 --> 00:24:37,676
and pull these coding benders and crank stuff out.

00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:40,175
I'm now much more like the tortoise.

00:24:40,175 --> 00:24:46,983
I can be measured, I can have an objective view of the ideas as they come in,

00:24:46,983 --> 00:24:49,720
and I have control over them.

00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,843
And most importantly, I am now dependable and reliable,

00:24:53,843 --> 00:24:56,925
which is something that i've never been able to tell my friends

00:24:56,925 --> 00:25:00,610
or feel like i had before.

00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:03,676
Going to see a therapist or psychiatrist has a lot of stigma around it

00:25:03,676 --> 00:25:05,176
and I don't get that.

00:25:05,176 --> 00:25:10,930
Michael Jordan had a coach. Tiger Woods had a coach.

00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:13,206
Why would you not want an objective third party

00:25:13,206 --> 00:25:16,426
whose job is to shut up and sit there and listen to you

00:25:16,426 --> 00:25:19,136
and then occasionally make suggestions and

00:25:19,136 --> 00:25:22,182
"Maybe you should try doing this just a little bit differently"?

00:25:22,182 --> 00:25:25,253
And just as an aside, even if you have no mental health problems,

00:25:25,253 --> 00:25:28,136
if any of you guys are married out there,

00:25:28,136 --> 00:25:30,051
go get marital counseling.

00:25:30,051 --> 00:25:31,762
Rachel and I have been doing this for about a year.

00:25:31,762 --> 00:25:33,927
It's like you get to fight with a referee in the room.

00:25:33,927 --> 00:25:35,968
It's amazing.

00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:37,301
It's had a huge impact on us.

00:25:37,301 --> 00:25:39,218
Even if there's no acute problems, just go see someone.

00:25:39,218 --> 00:25:41,520
It will help.

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,668
Finding a therapist is hard.

00:25:42,668 --> 00:25:49,009
They tend to be a little bit less tech-savvy than we are.

00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:51,745
They tend to operate more by phone than email.

00:25:51,745 --> 00:25:55,680
If you go to my blog, baugues.com/depression ,

00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:59,218
there will be some resources on there that you can look up.

00:25:59,218 --> 00:26:02,290
Unfortunately I'm not from here so I can't give any personal recommendations

00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:03,221
for people in this area.

00:26:03,221 --> 00:26:08,510
But there are some resources on there that will help you find someone.

00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:12,000
If you're not there yet, just talk to people.

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,218
If you can't find anyone else, talk to me.

00:26:15,218 --> 00:26:18,136
If you feel like you're struggling with this stuff,

00:26:18,136 --> 00:26:19,510
just let your friends know.

00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,387
If you have struggled with this stuff,

00:26:21,387 --> 00:26:22,637
you can subtly let people know.

00:26:22,637 --> 00:26:25,968
And you're going to be surprised at how many people will say, "Yeah, me too."

00:26:25,968 --> 00:26:29,635
And if things seem so bleak for you right now

00:26:29,635 --> 00:26:31,968
and you feel like it's not going to get better,

00:26:31,968 --> 00:26:36,258
just know that, ten years ago, I was at college laying in bed at night,

00:26:36,258 --> 00:26:38,927
and I was praying that God wouldn't wake me up in the morning.

00:26:38,927 --> 00:26:44,600
Six years ago I had one dollar in my pocket and no hot water in my apartment.

00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,135
And today i'm standing on stage at Mountain West Ruby,

00:26:47,135 --> 00:26:49,369
my beautiful wife in the front row.

00:26:49,369 --> 00:26:52,674
Things get better. We just need to start talking about it more.

00:26:52,674 --> 00:26:55,562
Thank you very much.

00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
