Title: MountainWest RubyConf 2013 Adventures in Paranoia with Sinatra and Sequel by Eleanor McHugh
Publication date: 2020-01-28
Playlist: MWRC 2013
Description: 
	This session is a jolly romp through the realm of practical data privacy using pure Ruby. We'll start by looking at how to obfuscate data using Ruby's OpenSSL bindings, exploring the possibilities of symmetric and public key cryptography as well as the role of hashing algorithms.
Once the basic principles have been established we'll turn our attention to designing databases with a strong privacy component, using Sequel to demonstrate how encrypted keys can be used to support privacy in the relational model. There will be some meta-programming involved which should also be of interest to ActiveRecord users. This will naturally lead into a brief discussion of the seeming difficulty of searching encrypted data along with a strategy for making this practical.
We'll round out the session by turning our attention to the transport layer with a simple scheme for securing web application sessions using a custom Rack middleware.
The discussion will be backed by code examples inspired by real-world systems.
