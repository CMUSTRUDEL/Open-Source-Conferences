Title: MountainWest RubyConf 2013 Pounding Simplicity into Wiki by Ward Cunningham
Publication date: 2020-01-28
Playlist: MWRC 2013
Description: 
	I wrote the first wiki in a week. Why has it taken me a year to write another? Short answer: when something is already surprisingly simple its hard to make it simpler.
This last year I set out to do for numbers what I had done for words, give them depth and meaning that ordinary people can depend on every day. A wiki, like a glossary, defines the terms we choose to use. A data-wiki makes those choices more complex. Its no longer one click to check a definition. Its more like one more study to check a dataset, to see if the data says what we think it does. Not a simple process.
My quest has been to make knowing and using data an everyday thing. This means the study of data must be an everyday thing too. To this end I've pushed visualization, I've pushed domain specific markups, I've pushed streaming measurements. But through this I've retained wiki's greatest strength: the ability to create with those who we have just met and don't yet have reason to trust. Finding trust on the modern web may be this year's biggest accomplishment.

anyway I was trying to think about what

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,880
I could talk to this community that

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,219
would really be interesting and I think

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,430
it's a very inventive community and so I

00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:34,489
wanted to talk about inventing and

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,960
especially if you have a reputation for

00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:39,780
simple things and and you want to make a

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,729
wiki that's even simpler simpler and

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,440
more powerful so that's that's the story

00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:49,530
I want to tell and and this happened

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:52,350
almost two years ago I applied for this

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:55,680
position as a fellow working with

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:58,650
sustainability data and in my

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:03,089
application I made a promise and my

00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:05,400
promise was to give numbers data depth

00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:07,200
and meaning and by depth and meaning i

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,840
meant stuff where where people would

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,630
actually trust the numbers i went on to

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,869
say depth and meaning for ordinary

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,970
people that they can depend upon every

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:22,170
day and and of course what I was

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:25,770
alluding to there was a Wikipedia which

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:27,750
has given I think words depth and

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,600
meaning that people depend upon every

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,520
day there's there's a magic in Wick ian

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,159
and it was the encyclopedia people who

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:41,220
did it I acknowledge that not me but

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:43,470
there was a creation there that I think

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,990
works for the encyclopedia article but

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,530
doesn't work for data sets yeah so I

00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:52,229
wanted to make sustainability data as

00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:56,070
alive and real for people as wikipedia

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:58,140
has made the Encyclopedia valuable of

00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:01,170
course if you think of data you think of

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,970
numbers pages and numbers and and one

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,310
thing that's clear is if if you're an

00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:08,220
accountant and you look at a page in

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,590
numbers like that you do you do see a

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,689
company you know there's there's

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,549
something behind those numbers and and

00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:16,620
and they're trained to see that but most

00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:19,769
people just see a CN numbers or if

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:22,739
you're if you're a weatherman and you

00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:26,489
see a page in numbers like this you know

00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:28,260
you'll you'll see the wind in there but

00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:30,170
most people you know it's a struggle to

00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,390
see these maps and highs and lows and I

00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:35,780
zone out during the weather what they're

00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:38,720
even talking about but this is this is a

00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:41,810
visualization that just knocks me out

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,480
because you know you cannot help but

00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:47,959
look at that and see the wind blowing

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:51,440
all over the country and and and this

00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:53,480
hint FM is a visualization site with a

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:58,040
lot of different interesting work on it

00:02:53,480 --> 00:03:00,950
but they have this for every day and a

00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,440
sampling of some pretty neat hurricanes

00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:05,600
and stuff like that but this was two

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,489
days ago when I just happened to see it

00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,519
I see if things are pretty quiet there

00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:12,769
in the in salt lake but today it

00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:16,069
probably looks different anyway this is

00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:18,350
this is the kind of thing that the the

00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:21,650
computers we have the browser we have

00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:23,780
have the capability of doing this I was

00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:26,930
also struck by this package called the

00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:31,310
d3 and and really it's just a kind of

00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:35,000
like a jquery ish wrapper around a SVG

00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:38,299
the the vector graphics which has been

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,430
you know in browsers but not orderly but

00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:45,100
it's you know real attempt to make it

00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:47,959
orderly this is this is my first d3

00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:50,420
mashup and here you can see what I'm

00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:53,420
doing is I'm plotting the location of

00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:55,940
factories but these factories you know

00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:57,650
they happen to be a mostly in China and

00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:00,650
and they're all within blocks of each

00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:02,510
other so you can't have a map at two

00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:04,910
scales at once but you can so here I'm

00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:07,400
kind of modeling push pins and what I

00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:10,400
did is I took two different sample

00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:13,480
programs out of d3 one that did maps and

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:17,630
another one that did this you know a

00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,950
spring force a physics emulator and I

00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:21,590
just said well if I want to do a push

00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:24,320
pin I want to model the push pin with a

00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:26,210
physic simulator which normally wouldn't

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,430
work that hard but now it's all of a

00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:31,880
sudden easy and and so I think this is

00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:35,410
the palette for visualization is to do

00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:39,400
complicated complicated complicated

00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:42,130
simple by by wrapping these things in

00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,550
progressively more sophisticated

00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:48,410
libraries

00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:49,970
so now this is going on without me but I

00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:53,450
say well what does this have to do with

00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:56,300
wiki how can i make a wiki where we have

00:04:53,450 --> 00:05:00,590
data data sets and visualizations and

00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:02,570
make that come together so i call it a

00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:04,850
federated wiki because i want to pull

00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:08,980
these things from different sites I want

00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:13,550
the sharing that we associate with wiki

00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:15,530
to be sharing not within multiple people

00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:17,870
on a single site but across multiple

00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:19,880
sites and this is something that I've

00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:21,260
been dreaming of you know for a long

00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,260
time but I said let's see if we can make

00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:26,720
it work because there's more going on in

00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:30,050
the browser now than ever before here's

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,260
a traditional wiki it's a you know again

00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:35,510
it's it's a database and a web interface

00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:37,610
to that database and if let's a bunch of

00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:40,910
people use it this is a federated wiki

00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:43,850
all i did is move the sharing part out

00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:45,290
of the server and up to the client now

00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:47,510
there's still server components but the

00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:53,840
server component has a lot less to do

00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:55,610
then the client did and and so you know

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,310
kind of figuring out what the

00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:59,840
implications of that are now I also you

00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,580
know there has to be this edit

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,040
capability and this is how it looks on

00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:07,220
Wikipedia this is how it looks in mind

00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:09,170
here's here's here's a page that has a

00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:11,660
paragraph and if you click that you see

00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:13,400
an editor that the the paragraph tax

00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,860
that looks rather boring but here's

00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:22,760
here's a visualization and if you click

00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:24,710
on that you see a markup that isn't

00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:27,260
about being a paragraph it's about being

00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,370
one of these n-dimensional charts and

00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,020
here it says well these are the

00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:33,440
dimensions and these are the maximum

00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:35,120
scales and so forth and and while you're

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,160
even editing this you can bring up one

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,650
more page which is a complete

00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,450
specification of the language which fits

00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:44,750
on one of these little pages because I

00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:47,240
have lots of little markups that give me

00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:49,910
lots of little ways well some people

00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:53,750
call these a DSL lots of little dsl's

00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:56,660
that give me control over small areas of

00:06:53,750 --> 00:07:04,310
a page that's going to be

00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:05,930
shared with with other pages so I want

00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:07,460
to I wanted to you know talking about

00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:10,310
creativity a little bit i want to talk

00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,780
about the process that i used for kind

00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,190
of stumbling into this and then i'll

00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:18,850
show you a little bit more of the

00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:21,200
results I I started out by saying let's

00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,970
let's make it work with a mobile so I

00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,700
just said let's make pages narrow and

00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:27,770
once we make me pages narrow on my

00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:30,530
laptop I can get them for wide or five

00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:33,560
wide and on on a big screen I can get 10

00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:35,990
or 20 or 30 and yeah and I thought that

00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,400
was important that that you know I'm

00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,530
going to pull content from a lot of

00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,960
places on my phone it's always handy on

00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:44,900
my laptop I can work with multiple sites

00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,940
and if I have a lot of content that is

00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,280
all kind of scattered all over I can

00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:52,430
rearrange it refactor it so that was

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:55,190
important in dealing with one particular

00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:58,460
set of data which was what I promise to

00:07:55,190 --> 00:08:00,680
do I i took the effort to deeply

00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:03,050
understand what was behind the data

00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,900
there was documentation I went and took

00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,880
every single page you know there's 50

00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:11,060
pages of documentation highlighted any

00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:13,820
word that talked about data categorizes

00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:17,660
words built a model of what people were

00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:21,530
talking about and then I said well

00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:23,720
that's let's imagine a wiki with a bunch

00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:25,669
of pages that fit this model and I kind

00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,340
of laid it out on a table and here I'm

00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:31,640
kind of imagining you know the

00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:33,620
information architecture but I'm casting

00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:36,919
it all as these things with little data

00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:38,990
sets little and visualizations and all

00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:42,070
on separate pages in that somebody would

00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:44,990
would pull up some combination of these

00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:47,180
for their interest in the moment and and

00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:53,080
see both the data that they can control

00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:53,080
and edit and in the visualizations so

00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,670
with no more vision than that I said

00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:01,910
okay let's make it work it and this is

00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:03,950
this is kind of funny because you know

00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:06,560
they they hired me as the expert and I

00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:08,560
said this is what you need even though I

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,660
wasn't exactly sure what it was

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,480
and then then over the period of the

00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:15,340
year I just kept playing with the

00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,470
software and i want to show you five

00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:18,970
different things this is number zero so

00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:21,220
this is this is what i had already

00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:23,980
decided there would be with their d

00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:28,710
pages with with data sets and images and

00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:32,020
paragraphs and at the very bottom i had

00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:34,690
the complete history of the page this is

00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:37,750
this is a edit command object sort of

00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:40,540
thing so these command objects well if

00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,920
you touch any of those you can see what

00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:44,920
paragraphs were involved in here I

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,360
clicked on one and and dredged up an old

00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:50,230
version so you have this complete

00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:52,029
history and it's visualized now the

00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:54,460
other thing that it's interesting is

00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:57,240
this binding and i'll show you how these

00:09:54,460 --> 00:10:00,040
two ideas work there is one important

00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,470
discovery that i could do is that I pull

00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,480
up a page that has a visualization on

00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:06,010
here I've gotten real simple I have

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,680
simple temperature data and I have a

00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:10,900
simple graph but the graph doesn't know

00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,480
that the graph is there to graph data

00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:16,810
instead when I pull the second page up

00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:19,000
it looks around for other pages and then

00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:22,300
kind of like this magnetic attraction it

00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,720
attaches to the page to the left and and

00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:28,660
draws that data so now what's so here it

00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:31,620
is that's the Nets you know done by

00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:34,180
finding things in the Dom and so forth

00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:37,780
but here's here's where it gets really

00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:40,770
cool here this page is actually a copy

00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:45,460
of a page off a server in my basement

00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:47,800
that has has temperature data so if I

00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,600
click that page I can call up the

00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,820
original so now notice this is a

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,060
different icon it's red instead of the

00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:58,170
yellow and and it's actually more

00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:02,589
current data and when I pull up the same

00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:05,230
the same graph page so i have three

00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:07,900
pages here two versions of air

00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:11,260
temperature and two copies of the very

00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:13,420
same line drawing program but because of

00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:16,089
that binding it draws a different

00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:18,250
picture so this this I was starting to

00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:20,140
feel that that I could pulsed off a

00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,730
different sites and expect the pages to

00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:23,870
work together

00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:25,790
the other thing I did is is you're

00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:28,130
copying and copying and copying stuff

00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:31,730
around there's this sense that you'll

00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:33,320
lose track of where things are so wiki's

00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:35,240
have always had kind of an internal link

00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,250
and an external link external link is

00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,110
like every other length on the internet

00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:41,390
but the internal link i say well i can

00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:44,270
do a little more and and here is i roll

00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:47,030
over these links you know it says well

00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:48,680
it could be a couple different places so

00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:51,080
here it's saying it might be on the

00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:54,110
original site or it might come from this

00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:56,510
thing down here and and so that just

00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:58,460
because i have this evidence that that

00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:00,410
the little flag is the fork that was a

00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:02,750
page was forked off into a different

00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:04,190
wiki and and so it has these different

00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:06,170
things and when you finally click on it

00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,640
you discover well it found it in the

00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:08,860
right place so there's a lot of dynamic

00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,730
searching this is a lot like

00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,790
object-oriented programming where you

00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:18,680
you search for up a hierarchy to find

00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:21,380
out where a pages so here's another

00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,840
thing that that that really surprised me

00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:27,320
but when i put it together just it just

00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:31,730
delighted me and that was a when I I

00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:33,380
click on a page that doesn't exist you

00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,480
know I look in the places where I expect

00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:37,070
to find it i call it the context here it

00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,930
brings up this page it says we couldn't

00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:40,910
find the page in the expected context

00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:42,890
this would be called a red link but i

00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:44,180
but then i say oh but I looked all

00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:46,430
around a little more in some other

00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,970
places you're looking it just happens to

00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:51,740
have this page so that's this notion of

00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:53,390
the history of the page and how it's

00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:56,390
moved around tells you what the link

00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:57,950
should mean but if that's broken it

00:12:56,390 --> 00:13:02,120
looks a little farther it looks in what

00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:03,830
I call the neighborhood and this is this

00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,240
is one why knew I had a page called

00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:07,370
Purdue University because I went to

00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,890
Purdue so i just edited in there and it

00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:11,240
says oh you probably want this purdue so

00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:13,790
it suggests this that's this

00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,500
neighborhood it knows the neighborhood

00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:17,660
because whenever it sees mentions of a

00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,700
site this is your browser it goes and

00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:22,670
fetches a site map and here's here's

00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:25,790
what a site map looks like it has names

00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:27,350
and dates and a synopsis which is

00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:31,550
usually just the first paragraph of the

00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:33,260
page and that's enough to produce a this

00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,380
little summary here says this is the

00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:37,770
purdue

00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:40,530
you're looking for the other thing is is

00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:42,780
the the fetching of sitemaps down in the

00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:45,030
lower right-hand corner this is this is

00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,830
this all these different sites and so I

00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:50,640
have this kind of family resemblance of

00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:52,920
the icons being these gradients so here

00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,600
when I search I just search for patterns

00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,660
and so these are all the different

00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,710
places where you would find that and

00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:00,840
depending upon where you've been looking

00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:02,040
that's where you search so if you don't

00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,320
find it you look around a little more

00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:08,400
and try to search again the other thing

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,440
is this is where you get recent changes

00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,870
you want to say well what's going on on

00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,250
this federated wiki and it just goes

00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:16,290
down here there's like 12 different

00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:18,360
sites i was looking at and it's as well

00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,830
on these 12 different sites this is his

00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,650
word and you can see I was working on

00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:28,490
the on the mountain west ruby conference

00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:28,490
talk there and a few other things so

00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:33,060
again I say I want to make a bunch of

00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,070
sites feel like they're one site and

00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:39,210
this is the kind of thing that makes

00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:42,570
that happen so this is this is the this

00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:46,880
is the federated wiki sharing in the

00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:50,250
browser now then I got to thinking well

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:52,650
you know I wasn't actually being agile

00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:56,430
in this because I was trying to please

00:14:52,650 --> 00:15:00,720
myself instead of somebody else I did I

00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:04,890
did have my sponsor in mind but but I

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,510
think that that this is something as we

00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:08,160
as we get so good at agile we have to

00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,420
think of what else we can do this is a

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,730
video how many people have seen this

00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:16,410
video Brett Victor you know it's a

00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:18,930
fabulous video and i was looking at Mike

00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:20,520
Bostock who did the d3 and I was also

00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:23,250
looking at Brett victor who does a lot

00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:26,130
of visualization stuff and and then this

00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:28,970
talk came along and I said ah this this

00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:33,420
describes what's really going on in and

00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:36,660
what what what he says is he says well

00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:39,810
his idols are these people like Alan Kay

00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:41,760
and so forth who had this vision of how

00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:44,970
computer should work and I'm thinking

00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,380
gosh this were my idols to and and and

00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:48,160
then he says well this is what you have

00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:52,569
to do to really

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:54,550
you know pursue that vision and and and

00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:56,410
that is there's principle as you're

00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:59,550
trying to solve not it's not so you know

00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:02,379
just does burn down of features that

00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:04,060
somebody's telling you to do I actually

00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:06,279
put together a page where I said these

00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:08,110
these these are what I'm trying to do

00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:10,120
right up there top says the new wiki is

00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:12,279
going to innovate three ways you know

00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,620
the Federation the refactoring and the

00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:17,139
visualization I've in a quiet way

00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:20,889
showing you all of those i just started

00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:23,949
making videos as i was going on in doing

00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:27,310
this discovery first of all I called it

00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:30,189
smallest this is a this is saying I'm

00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:32,259
not trying to make the best wiki ever

00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:34,930
I'm trying to make an innovative wiki

00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:36,759
and and i'm going to leave out a lot of

00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:38,259
stuff you know it's actually kind of

00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:40,449
hard to use because i leave out a lot of

00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:43,300
stuff but what it does do right it does

00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:45,750
well first working on github makes a big

00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:49,720
difference sharing stuff on Twitter so

00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:52,990
if i compare agile on by the way I just

00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:55,149
you know I love the way that that so

00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:57,819
many concepts of a jalar just the normal

00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:59,740
way we work but but on an agile project

00:16:57,819 --> 00:17:03,069
you know which are really going for is

00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:04,750
this velocity you just want to just keep

00:17:03,069 --> 00:17:06,339
delivering you know have people trust

00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:09,459
you because you deliver regular that

00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:13,110
that velocity whereas where is what i

00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:16,120
did is i say well you know i'll know

00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:18,520
that i'm getting somewhere if I can keep

00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:21,270
it small keeping a small velocity is

00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:24,730
about getting a lot keeping it small is

00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:26,709
a small also you know and actually

00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:28,600
you're trying to you know there's two

00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:30,190
parties there's the people with the need

00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,630
and the people with the capability and

00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:36,100
the people with the need we call

00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:39,309
customers but but here I was driven by

00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:41,980
curiosity you know on any given week I

00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:43,840
could have a hot button somewhere else I

00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,980
wonder if I could do this I wonder if I

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,320
could do this what would this be like

00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:50,320
and in that curiosity being

00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:54,010
curiosity-driven is fabulous that if you

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:57,669
can get away with it you know by that I

00:17:54,010 --> 00:18:00,140
I know that all of us have to work for a

00:17:57,669 --> 00:18:02,720
living and unfortunately we

00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:05,210
have enough time left over to do some

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,610
amazing thing and and if you get old and

00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:09,380
wise then maybe even get a job like I

00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:12,170
did where you get to to do it for a

00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:14,930
whole year the other thing is in agile

00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:17,540
it's all you know you're doing things

00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:19,340
right if you have confidence in your

00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:21,530
code and i'll tell you this devops thing

00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:23,930
is is the epitome of that that you know

00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:27,290
when people say oh yeah we deploy 20

00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:28,910
times a day they just know what's going

00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:30,680
to happen and they know if they're

00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:33,820
surprised they know what they're going

00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:36,910
to do and that confidence is wonderful

00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:39,470
but in the work I was doing I would say

00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:41,510
you know Wonder and delight you know

00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:44,420
when I was surprised that the things I

00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:47,990
showed you all surprised me what it felt

00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:49,610
like to use them and i'll tell you a lot

00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:52,370
of things i tried didn't work but I that

00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:54,860
wasn't a negative thing at all either so

00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:57,020
this is this is in a lot of people say

00:18:54,860 --> 00:19:02,360
well what's after agile in a sense I'm

00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:05,060
probing what's after after agile now i

00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:08,600
do want to show you a couple of things

00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:10,580
in in just in case the the Wi-Fi didn't

00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,440
work i put a few movies in here I want

00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:15,560
to show you a couple of movies that are

00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:20,480
on that site and these are you know the

00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:22,010
last nine months I haven't even really

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,780
worked much in the core there's plenty

00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:25,940
of work to work doing the core but I've

00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:29,780
been making plugins that interact

00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:32,390
different way and and so you know when

00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,890
you when you when you add up when you

00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:36,200
add a paragraph you hit that plus sign

00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:39,020
says I want to add a new paragraph it's

00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,730
as well you know I could be any kind of

00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:43,070
paragraph and it says here's a few you

00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:46,910
might want or you can just start typing

00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:48,620
and it becomes a text paragraph but

00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:50,570
there's also in the help documentation

00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:52,730
it says well there's more than that

00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:54,800
there's more things you could make so

00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:57,680
down here and plug in documentation this

00:19:54,800 --> 00:20:01,700
is just in the wiki there's a long list

00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:05,870
of pages about different plugins and

00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:07,640
these plugins are really you know this

00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:11,120
isn't that unusual you know anybody

00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:13,430
who'd ever did a way you call it where

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,730
you have the dashboard

00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:18,680
and so forth these are like widgets

00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:21,500
except that their widgets that work in

00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:23,630
this sharing environment so so it's it's

00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:27,410
it's not widgets on your screen it's

00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:31,640
widgets on on the shared environment of

00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:34,010
wiki so here's one that I like you click

00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:37,040
this and you get a page of documentation

00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:38,570
again this is got a little markup and it

00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:42,560
says here's how the lines work and it's

00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:46,490
a little calculator and the calculator

00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:48,170
is meant to be really simple but I I and

00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:50,270
I show you how to add two plus three to

00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:51,770
get a sum of five you can double click

00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:54,260
on that and get a hint of what the

00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:58,690
mark-up for calculator is but I also do

00:20:54,260 --> 00:21:03,200
the the classic bottles of beer a

00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:04,970
calculation and and do the other thing I

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,440
wanted to mention is this is where you

00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:08,420
go if you want to see the source you

00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,100
know you get these plugins you just

00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:14,360
assume that the documentation tells you

00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:19,240
where to find the source oh I forgot to

00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:19,240
plug in my audio cable I got distracted

00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:29,530
hear that sound

00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:42,890
I'd like to show you the demo that I

00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:45,650
presented this year's open source

00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:50,000
conference these pages are available for

00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:53,540
you to experiment with at oz con ed wiki

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,090
org this is what you'll find if you go

00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:58,580
to that site here's little instructions

00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:01,610
that i wrote to to go through the demo

00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:03,950
mostly this brings up the method plug-in

00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:05,510
which is here's the documentation for it

00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:07,550
this shows you how to do simple

00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:10,100
calculations this is simple and that i

00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:13,600
can just edit this maybe modify that

00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:16,429
calculation do a command s to save and

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,350
there is i can try this again maybe make

00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:20,330
it even bigger actually just clicking

00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:24,110
outside the window will save so i get

00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:27,320
112 and 3 is 150 now what I really

00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:30,770
wanted to show off is how I can refactor

00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:33,020
content on the wiki to make it easier

00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:35,750
for people to understand and change it

00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:38,030
but let's just go to this little remove

00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:40,100
local storage pages and we'll reset

00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:42,530
everything you can try this over and

00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:45,020
over your changes will be saved in your

00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:48,320
own browser and if we go back here we're

00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:50,960
back to 2 + 3 is 5 so another page is

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,270
the bottles of beer song that shows how

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,580
i compute each versa than any nine

00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:57,650
bottles of beer song and I do it in a

00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:00,230
very simple way I just start with 99

00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:01,940
subtract one show whether is the sum at

00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:03,920
the moment subtract another show what

00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:06,110
the Sun is at the moment now because I

00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:09,650
put labels on all these numbers I don't

00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:11,540
actually have to specify them over and

00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:13,429
over so here I can just say take one

00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:15,740
down and pass it around and I'll get the

00:23:13,429 --> 00:23:18,020
minus one that I showed up there will

00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:20,630
click outside here and then we see we

00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:23,150
still get the 97th bottles of beer here

00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:25,370
I also show doing the same thing I say

00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:27,470
bottles of beer in the wall it looks up

00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:30,530
the page in fact it'll keep on looking

00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:31,790
finds the 97 and carries on I could do

00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:35,480
the same thing here I don't need that

00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:37,610
minus one save and I get 96 this keeps

00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,010
on working i have a data set here some

00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:42,860
beer Constance is going to get my song

00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:45,200
done in a hurry I say take a few down as

00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:48,770
like the minus 3 and take a bunch down

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,190
as minus 90 so here we pick up the 96

00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:52,169
take a few take

00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:54,210
more take a bunch down and we're finally

00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:56,490
done with a song zero bottles will be

00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:58,740
here on the wall now what I like to do

00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:00,299
is take these last few paragraphs and

00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:03,269
kind of spread those around here it

00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:05,519
suggests why don't I create a pic so so

00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:07,320
what I love about that is I you know

00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:09,179
this is kind of a test for a language

00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,889
and I i got the bottles of beer song

00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:14,309
done faster than anybody else on the

00:24:10,889 --> 00:24:16,019
internet there the other thing is is

00:24:14,309 --> 00:24:18,929
behind the scenes there you know there's

00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:21,330
some hash to taking those names so you

00:24:18,929 --> 00:24:24,210
know in there there's there there's I'm

00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:26,879
creating a scope of variable names and

00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:29,549
managing that and a lot of the discovery

00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:32,159
is figuring out how to how to how to

00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:34,529
define scope in a concept that's this

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,750
dynamic and now i'm going to start

00:24:34,529 --> 00:24:40,019
dragging things between pages to

00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:42,330
rearrange this song and and that was my

00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:45,899
torture test to make sure that the scope

00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:48,240
is right even as i'm rearranging the

00:24:45,899 --> 00:24:51,480
content on pages age for the beer

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:54,299
Constance if I shift click that that

00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,980
creates this new page and I'll just drag

00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:58,169
these constants over there first and

00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:01,860
explanation what it is and then the

00:24:58,169 --> 00:25:04,259
constants and it's that simple now I can

00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:06,029
do the same thing here with the with a

00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:08,610
versus let me just go back to just the

00:25:06,029 --> 00:25:13,080
beer page and then bring up the final vs

00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:15,149
oops the beer page and shift to bring up

00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:17,039
the final verses that gets me I think

00:25:15,149 --> 00:25:18,899
now notice that this isn't computing

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,179
very well here now because I lost those

00:25:18,899 --> 00:25:23,850
constants but will have that fixed in

00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:26,669
short order so let's that little

00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:29,039
paragraph of explanation and then the

00:25:26,669 --> 00:25:30,720
constants over there and now we're ready

00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,909
to go back and look at the whole thing

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,299
if I call up the beer methods

00:25:32,909 --> 00:25:39,590
shift-click to get the constants and

00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:42,480
shift-click to get the final verses and

00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:45,509
there we r 0 bottles of beer on the wall

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,429
and so this computation is looking to

00:25:45,509 --> 00:25:50,429
the left and finding these numbers and

00:25:47,429 --> 00:25:57,570
finding this 96 to finish the

00:25:50,429 --> 00:26:00,899
computation so this is this was last

00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:03,029
summer and I felt that you know hey I'm

00:26:00,899 --> 00:26:04,080
not going to crash and burn because I

00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:07,289
could do some stuff

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:11,039
that seems sort of magical the thing is

00:26:07,289 --> 00:26:12,419
I had hundreds of pages of data that

00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,880
comes from some of the most complicated

00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:17,519
spreadsheets I've ever seen transferred

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,740
it into this where you could could do

00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:22,470
this simple column of calculation i

00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:24,720
called it middle school math but for

00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:26,309
graduate level chemistry because it was

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,640
all about materials in the chemistry of

00:26:26,309 --> 00:26:31,799
materials but it was hard you know

00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:34,289
spreadsheet sometimes explode in their

00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:38,029
complexity in this environment there's

00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:42,570
not a lot of room to explode in a

00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:47,250
complexity and and part of that is the

00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:49,080
way that I that I used the just managing

00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:51,480
these hashes and names and bindings and

00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,190
so forth of course when you talk about

00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:58,350
data a lot of people think of those

00:26:53,190 --> 00:27:01,289
tables and numbers and the Allan K Brett

00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:03,539
Victor you know admirers Alan Kay I

00:27:01,289 --> 00:27:05,549
admire in lnk alan kay was asked by

00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:06,899
scientific american you know you don't

00:27:05,549 --> 00:27:09,210
submit papers of Scientific American

00:27:06,899 --> 00:27:11,399
they come to you and they went to Alan

00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:13,559
Kay and said explain computers to the

00:27:11,399 --> 00:27:15,960
Scientific American leadership and

00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:18,480
instead of going off into small talk he

00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,610
he said well let me explain spreadsheets

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,049
you know if you got spreadsheets give

00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:25,100
you this nice dynamic model and they

00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:28,250
work so well you know in a sense I'm

00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:30,539
treading on spreadsheet territory and

00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:32,190
that's one reason I didn't want to put

00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:35,250
up a page in numbers and people would

00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:38,630
ask how you do your profit and loss

00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:40,559
statement but in this he explains the

00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:45,179
spreadsheet and then he shows you how to

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:47,970
do bar graphs using spreadsheet cells as

00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:50,580
pixels and and that's I just love that

00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:52,889
way of kind of twisting twisting

00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:55,380
twisting the model so i want to show you

00:27:52,889 --> 00:27:58,740
one more video and this is is where i'm

00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:00,149
thinking one of the powers here is that

00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:04,169
if everybody kind of brings their own

00:28:00,149 --> 00:28:06,720
disk to this this sharing environment

00:28:04,169 --> 00:28:09,090
called the federated wiki if somebody

00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,159
brings a disk full of spam you know you

00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:12,360
just don't hook it into your she keep it

00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:13,350
out keep that spam out of your

00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,029
neighborhood the only way you're going

00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:16,080
to have spamming your wiki is you go hun

00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:18,210
it down

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,980
fork it in right you know so you're not

00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:22,140
going to do that but there's there's

00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:24,210
also this capability and here I'm

00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:26,490
experimenting I say well I've got a few

00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:28,769
pages that are about you know a sensor

00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:30,929
in my backyard but i wanted i wanted to

00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:34,470
be more interactive than just watching

00:28:30,929 --> 00:28:36,120
the weather and and so i spent a lot of

00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:38,669
time fiddling around with little micro

00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:41,070
computer stuff just as a recreation and

00:28:38,669 --> 00:28:43,529
i had this little mini language called

00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:45,299
Tex I'm which is for twiddling bits and

00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:47,970
I've done a lot of stuff and I so let me

00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:50,130
let me make a plug-in for texts I'm and

00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:52,980
Tex I'm would be on attached hardware

00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:56,669
hooked to a particular server through

00:28:52,980 --> 00:29:00,960
USB and and what happens is on the page

00:28:56,669 --> 00:29:04,139
the plug in the plug-in not the page or

00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:06,450
not wiki but the plug-in itself just

00:29:04,139 --> 00:29:08,789
says oh let me go back to that server

00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:12,269
open a web socket can actually get a low

00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:16,169
latency connection and this this was the

00:29:12,269 --> 00:29:18,570
this is when the documents become not

00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:21,570
documents but become user interface

00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:25,559
shared user interface all in their own

00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:28,440
right I'd like to show you some of the

00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:31,080
work on doing connecting things to

00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:33,029
federated wiki and this is the sort of

00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:35,279
thing I'm talking about this is a little

00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:38,580
computer board kind of like an Arduino

00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:41,789
this one's called a teensy popular in

00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:44,610
the hacker spaces that I hang out this

00:29:41,789 --> 00:29:47,700
one has a flash card four gigabytes of

00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:49,740
storage attached to it and a digital

00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:53,610
thermometer so this could be a data

00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:59,279
recorder it also has a USB port on it

00:29:53,610 --> 00:30:02,789
and I like to stream programs into that

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:06,960
fort and what I'd like to show you today

00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:10,980
is some plugins I've built that support

00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:13,080
that the all of these that i have i put

00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:16,110
a little interpreter right down here on

00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:19,230
the board that interprets a simple

00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:22,559
language that i call tech sign tex I'm

00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:26,180
has very simple commands like I for

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:29,370
input and over output so you just dream

00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:33,690
sentences string of characters and it

00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:36,450
will do things so this is the the one

00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:39,660
that I would like to show you today this

00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:42,750
has the cord hooked up to it and the USB

00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:46,380
is connected to the express version of

00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:49,980
the server and Express node turns out to

00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:52,700
be pretty sweet for running plugins both

00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:56,240
client-side and server-side and

00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:58,410
connecting between those with the

00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:02,460
WebSockets so it gives me a nice low

00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:06,090
latency bi-directional communication so

00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:09,570
this is the documentation that describes

00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:12,570
this plug-in and here's an example this

00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:15,510
one whenever the page opens it asks the

00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:17,400
little computer to explain what my

00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:20,310
conversion of microcontroller is there

00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:23,850
and then it uses the V command to print

00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:26,550
that version here it says an 18 mega 32

00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:29,430
you for that's that's what that little

00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:32,100
chip is so we've already done a

00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:34,290
turnaround to this computer in the

00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:37,500
documentation I do mention other things

00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:39,330
like here is a list H says tell me all

00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,970
the commands you can do so we can just

00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:43,890
see what the computer says it says what

00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:46,170
commands are available and here's the

00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:49,070
list if you don't happen to have a

00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:51,750
computer connected or a little teensy I

00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:54,660
made a copy of the list and you can see

00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:56,760
the kind of commands that I should so

00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:59,010
there's something cool their first of

00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:02,040
all this is a super small computer all

00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:03,510
the commands are single letters except

00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,250
for the quote command which is

00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:08,430
underscore and I just did a little bit

00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:11,820
of that but but what's cool is is even

00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:13,350
in the documentation page I'm not sure

00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,970
what's actually plugged in at the end of

00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:17,010
that so I say it's probably does these

00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:19,530
commands but we'll just send the H

00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:22,290
command the help command and down to

00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:24,720
down over the USB off our website at the

00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:27,840
server and pull back the documentation

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,580
out of the chip itself to see what this

00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,770
particular chip has been programmed to

00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,840
do so that there there's a connectivity

00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:36,060
there the fact that the documentation is

00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,520
in the same environment as the wiki

00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:39,380
itself makes that possible more

00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,940
importantly I

00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:43,340
created some examples first you should

00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:47,150
notice all those are lower case and in

00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:49,370
the plug-in i use upper case to talk to

00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:54,140
the plug-in so the upper case commands

00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:57,710
are executed client side and it manages

00:32:54,140 --> 00:33:00,440
the transmission of texan programs to

00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:03,320
the server and from the server onto this

00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:05,420
device so so here are some examples of

00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,610
course what anybody does with a little

00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:10,430
microcontroller there's an LED on here

00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:13,760
and you want to make it like so this is

00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:17,720
the the blink program and when that

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:19,430
starts it blinked once a second and and

00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:23,120
this is what that looks like it says

00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:26,090
here every second send down a command to

00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:28,970
select the right pin output a 1 wait 40

00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:31,820
milliseconds output is 0 and call that a

00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:34,490
blank it also says every time the thumb

00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:37,490
moves over a data set send out an even

00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:39,380
shorter blink so here it is blinking

00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:41,090
every second and it says here is

00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:43,610
receiving the word Glink so we know

00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:46,850
what's going on but as i scrub over this

00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:49,690
data we see that we get those kind of

00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:51,830
faint little very short planks

00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:54,170
continuously and so that's all being

00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:58,130
mixed in because we're sending two kinds

00:33:54,170 --> 00:34:00,110
of programs down to the device now one

00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:02,570
thing I also have on here is a speaker

00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:05,990
it's a little piezoelectric speaker and

00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:09,919
so let's try this program this program

00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:13,310
sends morse code and so it's kind of an

00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:16,490
interesting program in that i define a

00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:18,440
client-side a bunch of words like how to

00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:20,389
send Morse code and here you can see

00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,460
it's showing me the stack as it runs

00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:26,389
through that macro calling macro calling

00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:29,240
macro calling macro until it finishes so

00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:30,919
the program says here on open turn on

00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:33,679
the transmitter and set on a call and

00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:34,940
then every minute after that just shut

00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:38,540
it out of the shortened call which we

00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:40,840
call an ident or identification in a ham

00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:45,669
radio so this is this is ham radio stuff

00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:48,370
being done with with tech sign and

00:34:45,669 --> 00:34:51,790
federated wiki

00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:53,730
so to kind of pile on more things here

00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:55,990
let me let me show you a neat little

00:34:53,730 --> 00:35:00,130
application we just let that run to

00:34:55,990 --> 00:35:02,350
completion this one this one controls

00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:05,950
this too it started out it turned down

00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:08,500
the colon and it says every minute you

00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:11,260
know every second update the seconds in

00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:14,260
the display so this is writing seconds

00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:16,780
to those last two digits it also wrote

00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:18,940
the colon and this one also listens to

00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:22,090
the thumb and so when I scroll over on

00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:24,070
data and that it puts the data position

00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:26,140
in the first digit and this is just

00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:27,940
showing again this idea that I can have

00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:31,480
different programs talking to different

00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:34,360
resources here different registers in

00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:37,990
the same part and it's all getting mixed

00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:41,590
together through the web sockets going

00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:44,530
to the node server and onto the USB and

00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:47,650
so forth finally one thing I like to do

00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:51,220
is here I'm sending just short little

00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:53,050
bursts a high and then a low and it

00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:55,180
sounds like a click coming out of the

00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:58,750
speaker and this again once a second and

00:35:55,180 --> 00:36:02,410
and so in this program I say every

00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:05,110
second output a pulse and then collect

00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:07,030
the samples that's the idea and the on

00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:10,120
the minute and then collect some samples

00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:13,000
but here it says sample on a 2d

00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:16,450
converter channel 11 and P says print

00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,240
that result back up the USB all the way

00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:21,430
here to wiki so when this runs we can

00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:23,410
see we get we're also getting the blink

00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:26,680
back message there but we're getting a

00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:29,560
number let's just stop that like here if

00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:32,050
I say you know just reload the thing

00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:33,610
with in that way that that's rebooting

00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:36,550
another page kicks and we're getting

00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:39,160
just the data and if I double click this

00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:41,410
I can see what the data looks like every

00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:44,050
time every second I get a new set of

00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:47,560
data so that data is changing but what's

00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:51,070
cool is that data that's coming off of

00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:53,590
this chip I just when I get it back into

00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:55,870
the client I say well send that out in

00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:57,970
case anybody's interested like here is

00:36:55,870 --> 00:37:01,119
that d3 line for

00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:03,640
that I used to look at I still can look

00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:07,119
at the temperature in my backyard over a

00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:09,640
day here I'm looking at the vibrating of

00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,980
that speaker which is ringing like a

00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:13,990
bell it's ringing like a bell but it's

00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:16,510
ultrasonic I can't hear it but here I

00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:18,760
say take a sample every 100 microseconds

00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:22,450
and those are the samples this is the

00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:25,480
decay of the bell and the frequency

00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:28,660
there and here's here's a picture I did

00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,740
hook a regular oscilloscope up so that's

00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:31,840
what it looks like on a regular

00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:34,450
oscilloscope and it looks pretty much

00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:37,780
the same so we've built an oscilloscope

00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:41,710
out of the text I'm plug in a little

00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:43,630
device to test and d3 graphics packages

00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:47,320
we've always had so I think it's pretty

00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:49,930
powerful combination yeah I said I think

00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:51,700
this is pretty powerful yeah and of

00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:54,340
course what it is is I wrote an

00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:56,320
oscilloscope in three lines you know and

00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:58,240
half of the half of the characters in

00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,070
that line was interpreted client side

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:04,180
and the lower case letters were sent

00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:07,599
down to the server over USB to a little

00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:10,540
micro computer that was doing whatever I

00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:12,250
asked it to do in the moment right and

00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:13,420
sometimes was doing two three four

00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,800
things at once I don't know if he

00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:18,130
noticed that was blinking and sending

00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:20,440
Morse code and lighting the LEDs all at

00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:24,369
the same time and and I think that

00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:27,070
that's the the dynamic environment that

00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:30,430
is that is available to us now that is

00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:32,290
is is pretty spectacular now i'm not

00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:35,230
claiming that I've got an application

00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:38,349
here what I have is a foundation for

00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:41,770
building a lot of stuff and in an

00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:44,290
example of an architecture where we can

00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:48,780
blur the lines between clients and

00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:52,990
servers and sites and services and I

00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:55,810
think in the end what we can do is make

00:38:52,990 --> 00:39:01,300
it alive enough and interpret it enough

00:38:55,810 --> 00:39:03,660
and visual enough that that we really

00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:06,490
can make something that ordinary people

00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:10,680
love to browse love to study love to

00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:15,700
understand and love to depend upon after

00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:20,140
any questions yes do I have any

00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:22,059
additional control on how binding

00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:24,880
happens between those different things

00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:27,039
and and there's a lot of people will

00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:30,269
make kind of wiring diagram things where

00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:32,619
you draw wires and so forth and and

00:39:30,269 --> 00:39:35,410
people work really hard on those things

00:39:32,619 --> 00:39:37,539
and they you know three people figure

00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:39,640
out how to work them so so I wanted

00:39:37,539 --> 00:39:42,609
something that was simpler than that and

00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:44,589
my model is actually the unix shell

00:39:42,609 --> 00:39:46,390
where you have a little program and a

00:39:44,589 --> 00:39:48,130
pipe and a little program at a pipe and

00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:52,809
a little program and it's actually

00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:54,130
pretty constraining but man it is lasted

00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:55,930
pretty you know that's the longest

00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:58,660
lasting thing that we still use every

00:39:55,930 --> 00:40:02,200
day is that pipeline so I wanted this

00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:04,480
sort of pipeline effect now inside is

00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:07,930
really just the plugins getting along

00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:09,849
with other plugins wiki sort of oh I got

00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:12,910
the pages up there and I give control to

00:40:09,849 --> 00:40:15,910
you you know do what makes sense to you

00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:18,309
and that's not quite enough advice you

00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:21,069
know so so I think that that the

00:40:18,309 --> 00:40:24,880
direction this is heading is that you

00:40:21,069 --> 00:40:26,589
will tend to to look you know lower in

00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,650
the Dom but maybe not rummage through

00:40:26,589 --> 00:40:33,549
the Gotham so much there's a lot of kind

00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:35,859
of sequencing stuff and this isn't quite

00:40:33,549 --> 00:40:37,569
perfect yet I tend to make every plugin

00:40:35,859 --> 00:40:39,279
work a little differently but it's going

00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:40,900
to do this stuff with promises and

00:40:39,279 --> 00:40:45,220
defers and stuff like that where it will

00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:48,069
discover in architecture as the the the

00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:52,690
plugins are kind of waking up and and

00:40:48,069 --> 00:40:56,369
then build a model in memory of of what

00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:59,740
that connection is will you be able to

00:40:56,369 --> 00:41:01,299
grab those things and rebind them well I

00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:03,940
hope so I hope you'll be able to take

00:41:01,299 --> 00:41:07,329
the visualization and just roll it over

00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:09,190
a page full of data a bunch of different

00:41:07,329 --> 00:41:11,500
data sets and while that while that

00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:13,630
visualization is still in flight well

00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:16,150
it's still in the air you know that

00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:17,859
it'll just try binding different places

00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:19,990
and when it looks like what you want you

00:41:17,859 --> 00:41:21,490
just drop it in and there it is you know

00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:23,120
that you know it's like a magnifying

00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:26,420
glass of magnifying visual

00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:31,240
asian and and that's so dynamically

00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:36,460
possible is that a good answer yes we

00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:36,460
rounded bottom

00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:43,710
that if I pointed at a paragraph it

00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:45,420
highlighted every you know those are

00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:47,520
basically command objects or at it same

00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:49,590
as we do and undo it just it just

00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:52,880
highlighted everyone that applied to

00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:55,560
that paragraph or if you pointed at a

00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,360
history item an element in the journal

00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:00,030
in action it would light up the

00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:02,369
paragraph that that action applied to so

00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:05,490
I was trying to connect those I think

00:42:02,369 --> 00:42:07,680
there could be more work for example if

00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:09,210
the page gets longer in the screen you

00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,130
might want it to do a little automatic

00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:12,360
scrolling and stuff like that that was

00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:14,880
an area i thought would be very

00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:16,860
important and i got kind of that basic

00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,619
stuff in there and i've been limping

00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:23,369
along with it and and probing elsewhere

00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:25,560
but the question is is the history in

00:42:23,369 --> 00:42:29,430
the journal is that about changing data

00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:31,530
or is that about how you changed your

00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:34,410
request for data it's really how you

00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:39,210
move things around in the page and once

00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:41,820
once there's a you know the so kind of

00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:43,770
in my thought is it says if if you have

00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:46,280
a site that's changing data without

00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:48,480
adding a record of it in the journal

00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,850
then you should have a record of it in

00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:54,060
the data so in the case of the weather

00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:55,650
data every item had a date you know when

00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:59,310
the sample was taken so it was sort of

00:42:55,650 --> 00:43:01,740
managing its own history and and because

00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:04,770
I do one every every minute I didn't

00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:07,500
want to fill the journal with a bunch of

00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:08,940
stuff so there's there's also the you

00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:12,480
know and Wikipedia there's a lot of

00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:14,609
history that's kind of global but I try

00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,280
not to do anything global because this

00:43:14,609 --> 00:43:19,500
is federated and so so the history is

00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:22,200
associated with a page so if I move

00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:24,300
something around within a page it knows

00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,910
that it's a move and gets that right but

00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:28,830
if I move it to another page you know I

00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:37,770
get a delete from one page in and add to

00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:39,630
the other more questions yes I kind of

00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:43,530
glossed over Federation and the question

00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:45,450
is is what does it mean to fork a page

00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:49,410
in the context of this Federation and

00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:50,280
what it really is is I can from a page

00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:54,750
kind of

00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:57,090
follow links across to other sites to

00:43:54,750 --> 00:44:00,090
other sites and they're all there right

00:43:57,090 --> 00:44:02,550
in the right in the same window and if I

00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:05,520
start editing something that's on your

00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:07,770
site it doesn't write back to your site

00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:10,320
it writes back to my site so there's an

00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:11,880
implicit fork I might just say you know

00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,740
I like it the way you wrote it but I

00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:15,750
want it and there's another little

00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:18,030
button it just says fork and then I get

00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:22,770
it as is and the fork applies to a page

00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:26,820
at a time not to whole sites but sites

00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:29,820
tend to be small in fact I find that I

00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:32,250
create sites now like I might have

00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:35,250
created documents in the past I think of

00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:36,900
a site as being my part of a

00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:39,120
conversation that we're all going to

00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:42,480
have where a particular set of words

00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:44,190
have meaning yes let me answer that one

00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,320
because that's a very good question the

00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:49,260
question is because because there's

00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:51,270
JavaScript behind those plugins the

00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:53,850
question is where is that where is that

00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:56,760
JavaScript come from and it turns out

00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:58,290
when you start browsing a site and it

00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,900
may be your site or it may be somebody

00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:02,790
else's but it gets the initial

00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:05,190
JavaScript load from that all the stuff

00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:08,370
to manage the pages and that's where it

00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:11,700
goes back to interesting that's where it

00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:14,100
goes back to looking for a more plug-in

00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:17,100
source so in a sense you as a server

00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:20,340
operator configure your set of plugins

00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:22,200
that you intend to use and those are the

00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:23,610
where it's going to look for plugins for

00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,200
pages that grabs from somewhere else so

00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:27,210
you can pull a page from somebody else

00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,790
and discover you don't have enough

00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:31,710
plugins to render all the content on

00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:34,440
that page now if you're in that

00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:37,140
situation then what you do is say well

00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:39,510
hacked why am I trying here let's just

00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:42,600
go to his site and get a load of

00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:47,520
JavaScript from him and see how he sees

00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:49,620
his site using his plugins and and what

00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,900
I don't do is I don't automatically move

00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:56,040
code and that's because I don't want to

00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:58,350
be a medium for sharing viruses I do

00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:00,090
think that that is the direction that

00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:03,660
javascript is going where it will be

00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:06,059
easy to move code around between various

00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:10,020
nice but the CM boxing has to get a

00:46:06,059 --> 00:46:12,150
little tighter on that so so the plugins

00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:13,890
are managed the idea is that when you

00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:15,089
look for the documentation on the plugin

00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:17,220
it should always tell you where to get

00:46:15,089 --> 00:46:18,990
it you know in an open source thing and

00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:20,520
I think open source is the only way we

00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:26,010
can actually make plugins that people

00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:27,359
can trust now second question the the

00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:31,260
question is what would some other

00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:33,089
service need to add to my wiki before I

00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:35,700
could view pages from their service and

00:46:33,089 --> 00:46:37,440
if they wrote pages in terms of

00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:41,039
paragraphs and images and stuff like

00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:42,690
that nothing because how you render a

00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:45,240
paragraph and how you do an image or how

00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:47,700
you do a data set is you know I've

00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:50,400
covered that ground but if they say well

00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:53,309
the example of I think was Netflix if

00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:56,819
there's a fancy specialized plug-in that

00:46:53,309 --> 00:47:00,210
will view content or you know whatever

00:46:56,819 --> 00:47:02,309
that they want to produce then they

00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:04,500
would produce that put it on their site

00:47:02,309 --> 00:47:06,569
and you could always go to their site to

00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:08,849
view it if you pulled one of their pages

00:47:06,569 --> 00:47:10,920
you might get everything except of the

00:47:08,849 --> 00:47:14,549
viewer and we just say well I don't know

00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:16,890
that plug-in or they could say well

00:47:14,549 --> 00:47:20,490
we'll put this plug-in into the open

00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:22,559
source say here's where you go get it

00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:26,000
and then anybody who wanted to have that

00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:28,319
plug-in for their site could bring it in

00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,480
ultimately I suspect there will be a

00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:32,779
plug-in store or something with with

00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:35,430
plugins that our trust in a little more

00:47:32,779 --> 00:47:36,750
methodical way for sharing them I want

00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:42,059
to make sure that's true but I haven't

00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:46,200
built the story yet yes have I made it

00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:48,029
api for sharing information it's kind of

00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:50,460
all built on an api between the client

00:47:48,029 --> 00:47:54,289
and server it's just JSON documents and

00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:57,750
what I do is I say a JSON is a tree and

00:47:54,289 --> 00:48:00,119
the root of the tree has a story and a

00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:02,670
journal but once you get down into the

00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:04,410
story you get off into this area where

00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:06,089
it might be a data set and who knows

00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:08,700
what that data set or is it might be an

00:48:06,089 --> 00:48:11,640
image or it might be you know a special

00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:14,400
a text I'm interpreter or something so

00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:17,400
so as you get deeper in the tree you get

00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:20,550
more specialized yeah and but but you

00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:24,540
no the basic wiki protocol is just HTTP

00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:27,450
fetching and storing JSON the the thing

00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:32,700
I showed at the very end is is I can

00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:34,470
have a plug-in that has two parts it has

00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:37,290
a client side part in the server side

00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:41,070
part and in the case i showed the server

00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:43,320
side part was a relay over USB to this

00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:47,340
hardware so the client side comes up and

00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:49,740
it says you know HTTP is not good enough

00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:51,990
for me i'm going to open up a web socket

00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:54,690
and i'm going to talk my own private

00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:57,690
protocol because I control both sides of

00:48:54,690 --> 00:49:00,000
that the plug-in has a client side part

00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:02,370
in the server side part and by the way

00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,740
that's when it gets a little tricky that

00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:09,960
stuff i've been working in node because

00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:14,060
node encourages that java on the

00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:17,250
javascript on the on the server side I'm

00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:20,550
started in Ruby on the server side and

00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:22,920
it served me well but I'm looking for

00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:24,900
ways to carry that tradition for by the

00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:26,580
way other multiple implementations on

00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:31,140
the server and that's been very useful

00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:32,940
for me because it reminds me always to

00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:37,890
see if I can do something on the client

00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:40,530
first is that a good answer yeah related

00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:42,120
question is that it is that tree

00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:44,820
structure of data does it follow

00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:46,800
light-like the eight oz principles so

00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:47,710
that once you get a note and to all of

00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,820
your notes of the

00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:50,880
through it or do you have to have

00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:52,720
additional external information

00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:56,680
documentation on how to traverse the

00:49:52,720 --> 00:50:01,990
graphic I'm not sure what hate toss

00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:04,869
principle is but but but the I want

00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:07,900
everything to be discoverable but I also

00:50:04,869 --> 00:50:10,420
don't want any central repository of

00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:12,550
documentation or anything so so if you

00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:14,770
get a plug-in you get the documentation

00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:16,690
for that plug-in in the little bundle

00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:18,730
that is the plug-in so there's pages

00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:20,170
that will show up on the screen that

00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:22,980
you're really pulling out of the plug-in

00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:26,500
and that's where the documentation is

00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:29,140
the the thing is is you're going to a

00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:31,150
page is this tree as you get deeper into

00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:33,730
it you'll get into oh this is a

00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:35,800
paragraph that uses this plug-in and if

00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:38,560
you don't have that plug-in you can

00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:40,210
still see what's in the JSON but you

00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:42,640
might not be able to make sense of it

00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:46,240
you might have to go get that plug-in so

00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:49,180
you have to get you know you find the

00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:50,320
plug-in documentation and it says here's

00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:52,089
where you find the source for the

00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:54,540
plug-in up in some open sourcing and you

00:50:52,089 --> 00:50:57,280
go to that source and there and there

00:50:54,540 --> 00:51:03,820
will presumably be all the things you

00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:06,490
need to do something specialized the

00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:08,200
software does it for doing as intended

00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:14,530
but if you want to grow it and do more

00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:15,910
so so one one more question I think I

00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:19,300
think that this is an area where it gets

00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:23,260
kind of you know I've really tried very

00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:25,089
hard to make sure that I'm not in a

00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:26,980
position to make any money off of this

00:51:25,089 --> 00:51:29,980
you know that I pushed everything out

00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:32,349
that it can all be open and and I think

00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:34,030
we'll have to the question is probably

00:51:32,349 --> 00:51:35,950
answered in the videos or we can talk

00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:38,980
about it and do we have time for one

00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:41,680
more you know I have to say it's good to

00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:45,849
see Bill walking up here because you

00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:48,940
know being the being the don't think guy

00:51:45,849 --> 00:51:52,270
just do you know I looked at the I

00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:54,580
looked at bills abstract nieces hey we

00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:57,460
need to do more thinking and I guess I

00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:58,910
we had dinner the first night and talked

00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:00,789
about this and and

00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:04,220
and and and we're on the same wavelength

00:52:00,789 --> 00:52:06,950
even if we're going at at right angles

00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:08,599
but but this is you know I started out

00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:11,480
saying like this is a thinking community

00:52:08,599 --> 00:52:13,280
and here's how I'm thinking and and I

00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:15,079
want to just pass I want to skip that

00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,510
last question like they'll get up here

00:52:15,079 --> 00:52:21,760
and do his thing because I know it's

00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:21,760
going to be great awesome

00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:55,930
