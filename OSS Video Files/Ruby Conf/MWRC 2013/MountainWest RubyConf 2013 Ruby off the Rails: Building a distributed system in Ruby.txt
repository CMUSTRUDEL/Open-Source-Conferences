	Title: Ruby off the Rails: Building a distributed system in Ruby
Presented by: Matthew Kocher

Devops Borat said "is turtle all way down but at bottom is perl script, but in the case of Cloud Foundry there's Ruby at the bottom. Rails is the right choice for building a web site, but the elegance of ruby can be applied to many other things including a Platform as a Service. A full deploy of Cloud Foundry requires many different kinds of nodes, with multiple Sinatra apps, event machine based daemons, shared ruby gems, and small amounts of code in other languages like Lua, Go and C where it makes sense. I'd like to take you on a tour of an open source codebase and project that really shows where you can go with Ruby.
