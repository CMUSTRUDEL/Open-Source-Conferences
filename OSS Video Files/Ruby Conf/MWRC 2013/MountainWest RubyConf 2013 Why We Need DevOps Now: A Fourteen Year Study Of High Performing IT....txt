	Title: Why We Need DevOps Now: A Fourteen Year Study Of High Performing IT Organizations
Presented by: Gene Kim

Gene Kim will present his findings from an ongoing study of how high-performing IT organizations simultaneously deliver stellar service levels and deliver fast flow of new features into the production environment. To successfully deliver against what on the surface appear to be conflicting objectives, (i.e. preserving service levels while introducing significant amounts of change into production), requires creating a highly-coordinated collection of teams where Development, QA, IT Operations, as well as Product Management and Information Security genuinely work together to solve business objectives.
Gene will describe what successful transformations look like, and how those transformations were achieved from a software development and service operations perspective. He will draw upon fourteen years of research of high-performing IT organizations, as well as work he's done since 2008 to help some of the largest Internet companies increase feature flow and production stability through applications of DevOps principles.
