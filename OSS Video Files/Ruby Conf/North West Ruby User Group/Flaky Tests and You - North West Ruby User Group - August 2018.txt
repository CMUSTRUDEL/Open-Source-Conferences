Title: Flaky Tests and You - North West Ruby User Group - August 2018
Publication date: 2018-08-20
Playlist: North West Ruby User Group
Description: 
	Flaky tests are the bane of every developer. They kill your velocity and sow distrust in your test suite. In this talk we'll look at common causes of flaky tests, how to fix them, and how to avoid writing them in the future.


Rob Paskin is a developer at Createk, where he has been on a crusade to rid (very) large and (very) legacy apps of their flaky tests, as well as trying (very) hard to not put new ones in.
