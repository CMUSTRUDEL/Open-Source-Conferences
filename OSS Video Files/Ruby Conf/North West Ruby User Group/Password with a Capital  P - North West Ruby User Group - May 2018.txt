	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,580
so my name is Kyle waz be half-cuban on

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:09,960
twitter i'm software engineer working in

00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:12,179
nodes Ruby and JavaScript and my talk

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,759
today is about passwords well password

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:16,590
with a capital P it's a talk that kind

00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,810
of stole from someone a different

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,090
conference went to so I'm putting out

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,490
there I'll actually I did put on a

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,210
Twitter saying who I stole it from go

00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:31,019
ahead and say that passwords absolutely

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:33,000
silk they are useless for humans in many

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,460
many ways and it's just a way to keep

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,230
people and over machines out of our code

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:42,450
and accounts the problem we have is we

00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:45,239
are humans we figure things were lazy

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:48,510
and we like memes so a password isn't

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:53,010
useful in this case so I wanted to give

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:55,170
a very quick example of where we'd use a

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,199
password and in the world today we've

00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,449
got a pusher calm and say I want to

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:04,110
create myself a nice free account so I

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:06,479
work in my email address punch in air

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:10,470
passwords and create an account and I'm

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,869
in and that would be pretty pretty good

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,119
for many people but several years later

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:23,220
on I've completely forgotten my partner

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:25,200
my password for pusher and now I'm stuck

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,259
I'm logged out and stuck out and so is

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,659
everyone else but fortunately pushing

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:34,079
new that I forgot my password I just

00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:36,210
look very closely there there's have you

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,759
forgot your passwords oh cool I'm gonna

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,759
gonna hit that button hit surf forgotten

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:44,579
password link I'm going to have been

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:48,270
told to check my email accounts by the

00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:50,189
site so go and check my email checks the

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,950
email and there's a link in there to

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:55,920
click the reset so click that link and

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,740
I'm back on to this site and I need to

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,149
choose a new password in in this case so

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,259
I'm going to go for a very simple

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:05,640
special password in some cases you may

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:09,439
need to pass a certain test so I'm gonna

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,439
put one in it or in some cases a ring

00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:15,110
so the password test we have to pass a

00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,610
test each and each and every time we

00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,260
make a password for us different their

00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:22,790
providers I'm gonna give her very a

00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:25,400
real-life example for very popular

00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:28,640
manufacture around the world you can see

00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,810
very closely here there is a test and

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,910
password must contain eight or more

00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,980
characters upper and lowercase letters

00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,270
at least one number and there's a

00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:39,350
strength test as well to make sure that

00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:41,120
you are fit and healthy so we're gonna

00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:43,760
go in the head and choose the very

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,230
generic passwords which many people

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,090
around the world would use because we

00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:50,300
even been told it all over the place and

00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:52,700
it's easy to remember password cool we

00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:55,580
have managed to satisfy one or two tests

00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:57,920
but are two more tests to satisfy so

00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,020
we're going to capitalize that put that

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,480
P there we go buddy upper and lower case

00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:06,590
so doubt and so we're going to smack her

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,540
all right cool we now have a password

00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,790
which passes all the tests and this

00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:13,940
product will probably allow us to sign

00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:16,250
up with this exact password where as

00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:18,769
telling go start password is easy to be

00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:21,230
guessed so he'll try again and give it

00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:24,110
something shouldn't be too easy to

00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:27,739
guess well as a human I think change me

00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:29,390
one no I'm still weak let's try some a

00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:33,470
bit more personal to me

00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:35,600
my Duggar one cool sweet we've we've got

00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:38,450
we've now got a genuine password which

00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,880
is personal to me I can remember it and

00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:45,380
got certain uppercase letters and then a

00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:49,040
number and saying I'm not as strong as I

00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:51,680
really want to be it's also thinking is

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,390
it knows that this this passwords being

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,950
yourself elsewhere avoid using the

00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:57,380
passwords that you have use of over

00:03:54,950 --> 00:04:01,400
websites who have been snooping and none

00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:04,579
I use this password elsewhere and how

00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:07,040
can I read people's minds to be able to

00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:10,730
guess that that you can guess my

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,579
password not my reader so we're gonna go

00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:16,280
in Hadouken this and give it a password

00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:18,440
which is 64 characters long with upper

00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:20,390
case lower cases symbols and all the

00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,250
things to make a strong password because

00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,000
that's what you want to do as software

00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,750
engineer so

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,600
hence throwing the 64 character password

00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:33,560
which has been generated for us and

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,630
we've passed all the tests but it still

00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,930
says that we are weak in strength and

00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:42,800
now we have another test to pass which

00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:45,140
wasn't in the initial that's a secure

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,210
password right well now we have a new

00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:49,190
new test which wasn't obvious to us you

00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:52,070
can already see the frustration of many

00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:54,260
users at its point that one Li can

00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:56,920
choose a password which they want to use

00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:58,670
and because have to pass his test and to

00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,140
even if they do choose the right

00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:02,270
password which is meant to be strong

00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:04,280
they're limited by a set amount of

00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:07,700
characters which again has a certain

00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,350
connotation developers out there so

00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,960
we've got to satisfy this test because

00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:15,290
we are developers oh yeah good emphasize

00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,180
that again and make it a 32 character

00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:20,480
long password we have now made ourselves

00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:23,870
super-strong we can now lift this site

00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:26,960
offer ourselves and continue on and sign

00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:30,440
up for an Apple ID account I don't

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,360
recommend it some of you out there will

00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,390
probably use a password manager one

00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:38,120
password LastPass or - I use it

00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:40,550
personally because I have hundreds of

00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:43,430
accounts out there which will require a

00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:45,610
unique password and I I was a point of

00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:49,940
time in my history where to use the same

00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:52,370
8 characters for a lot of providers but

00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,169
as you know one breach here and that

00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:56,990
password is is now available to the

00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:58,729
entire world and they can try and use

00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,590
that password against you in different

00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:03,979
providers so now I generate a lot of

00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:09,830
unique passwords but I have one question

00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:12,470
is this mom proof and that's does it

00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:15,620
pass the mom test my mum doesn't use a

00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:18,229
password manager my mum has four

00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:19,940
different passwords well I say two

00:06:18,229 --> 00:06:21,320
different passwords but some of them

00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,690
have uppercase letters in lower case and

00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,860
number and the end of them but it's

00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:27,530
usually the same password which you'll

00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:30,080
use everywhere so a password manager

00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:32,000
isn't isn't for everyone and a long

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:36,050
password we can't remember again isn't

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,470
for everyone so what do we do we toss a

00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,530
cell

00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:41,540
as developers and provide a credit

00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,070
providers what is her main goal here

00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,040
when it comes to passwords

00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:48,770
oh we just want to authenticate the

00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:51,140
right person and yet remember person

00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:53,240
it's the human they're not computers

00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:55,490
there we we are fickle and we forget

00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,950
things and are lazy so we just need to

00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:00,560
have a simple way so the authenticate so

00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:03,050
as developers actually how can we fix

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,370
this well I've got a few answers here

00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:09,710
and it's probably some coming down a

00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:12,500
line in the Internet in time so there's

00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:14,750
my little guide and steps to to improve

00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,630
our products to make him user friendly

00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:19,450
and remove the password for good well we

00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:23,210
also ask ourselves do we need an account

00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:26,600
yes the users once a user service just

00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:29,120
let them use a service simple who don't

00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,190
need to we we have four examples out

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,620
there we booked a flight with very firm

00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:36,800
budget airlines don't ask us to login

00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,570
before checking a flight we can go right

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,540
way through the basket and get us

00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:43,160
ourselves onto a fly with very minimal

00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:47,240
amount of information we get a booking

00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:53,390
code and a surname and we're in look at

00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:56,180
URL to be out there and to allow the

00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:58,250
user to sign up later they want a

00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,990
service let them use a service ask for

00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:02,210
email later we have a lot of

00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,850
applications on our phone where we can

00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:06,650
start using the application

00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:08,330
and get real good phone and use out of

00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:10,729
it and then oh we want to save our

00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:13,400
progress suite entering your email here

00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:15,740
and there we go it now has my identity

00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,410
it can link all up good information

00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:20,600
which I've provided it to me and now can

00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:25,310
find a way to real authenticate which

00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:26,660
brings me on to long list sessions many

00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:29,240
of you will have applications out there

00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:31,310
where you've logged in once and you're

00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,530
not logged in for a week a month even a

00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,240
year you know you're not asked to log

00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:37,070
into your Gmail every single time you

00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,289
open up the application long list

00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:41,539
sessions many of us will do this and I

00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:46,330
highly recommend we still continue doing

00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:49,910
this delegated authentication so we have

00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:52,520
we're not experts in security we're not

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:54,800
takk refers but there are providers out

00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:58,820
there who who have big teams to do at

00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,970
Google Microsoft Yahoo AOL em they all

00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:03,950
have dedicated people who will be doing

00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:05,350
security for us well if we we don't want

00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:08,210
to go through that those we have

00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:10,370
password a password less authentication

00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:13,490
and touching face ID which we won't

00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:15,770
cover on today but I will cover password

00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:22,160
list authentication by email and I do

00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:25,580
have a video here should play a munzo of

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,140
a challenge of Bank and I'm logging into

00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:32,870
my account here it's asking me for my

00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:34,190
email account I can give it that yep you

00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:38,210
know it's asking me to check my email

00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:40,750
address so open up the email app well

00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:43,460
I'm at 0 and boxer so that's good I

00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:45,740
check my email as give me tap the button

00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:47,210
below to log into your munzo account I'm

00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,460
not having to give it a password or

00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:51,740
login anything so when I click this

00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,550
button working with a video here so

00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:57,100
there we go

00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:59,930
I am authenticated into my bank

00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:04,340
application without no password and

00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:06,110
there ago that that's that was within 40

00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:11,330
41 seconds I was able to authenticate

00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:13,730
into my bank without password but then

00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:16,370
some of you are questioning we need to

00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:19,610
secure our primary email accounts

00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:21,470
because with all of this with the reset

00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:23,210
passwords flow or even a password

00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:26,600
password let authentication which I

00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:30,410
highly recommend you take up in any

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,720
applications email is the single run

00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:36,410
ability and in all of all of our lives

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,270
right now and we start going away so as

00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:42,350
developers we can sit we can still use

00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:45,200
this premium method as a way to remove

00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:47,570
passwords from our our sites just follow

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,230
the the magic link and we'll be

00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:55,340
authenticated so ways how you can sell

00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:58,340
this to your bosses your managers or

00:10:55,340 --> 00:11:00,140
even your customers is it's less

00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,520
complicated for users you've seen your

00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,050
example there they were able to log in

00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,480
within seconds without having to put

00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:06,950
a digit memorize and count which at

00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,160
which number it was for your password

00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:12,500
three years ago it's better conversion

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,839
we're not asking them to do a lot of

00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:18,589
effort to get in and to use a product

00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:20,420
for example a sports sports website

00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:23,360
which you can buy clothes offs you would

00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:25,880
put things in your basket and at the

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,190
very end you'll be asked sue to maybe

00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,110
create an account maybe so you can

00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:32,149
convert people at a very last whenever

00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:34,190
committed it's more secure

00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:36,620
again we're not served as security

00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:39,680
experts leave it to the big guys who can

00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:43,250
do security and allow us to be secure

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,950
for our users if I use this type in

00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:48,350
passwords repetitively they are prone to

00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:51,200
phishing attacks and this is very very

00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:54,410
bad there's a a malicious site which

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,750
seems legit could could be the next bit

00:11:54,410 --> 00:12:00,170
next person who's lost their entire

00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:02,060
digital life so we can make the internet

00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:07,200
just a little bit more secure if I move

00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:11,299
from removing passwords thank you

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,299
