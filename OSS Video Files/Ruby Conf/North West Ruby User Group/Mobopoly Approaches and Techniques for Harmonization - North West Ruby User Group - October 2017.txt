Title: Mobopoly Approaches and Techniques for Harmonization - North West Ruby User Group - October 2017
Publication date: 2018-01-31
Playlist: North West Ruby User Group
Description: 
	Programming solo, or monopolising an issue is fast but limited to one programmers approach to a problem. Pair programming, or duopolising, introduced a second opinion to that approach, bringing co-learning, and improved code quality. Mob programming involves whole team co-operation (mobopolising) to solve large problems, with high code quality. But does it reduce productivity? This talk will demonstrate one approach to mob programming, highlighting some rules which aim to convert a disorderly mob into a well oiled machine.

Born and raised in Yorkshire, Robin Heathcote grew up drinking tea whilst becoming a biscuit connoisseur. He moved to Edinburgh for 4 years studying Environmental Geoscience, but soon realised he had more of a passion for the infinite creative opportunities and problem solving involved in writing code. After an intense three months studying Ruby, Rails and TDD with Makers Academy, he started work at Createk as a junior software engineer.
