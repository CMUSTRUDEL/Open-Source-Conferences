Title: Mobopoly Approaches and Techniques for Harmonization - North West Ruby User Group - October 2017
Publication date: 2018-01-31
Playlist: North West Ruby User Group
Description: 
	Programming solo, or monopolising an issue is fast but limited to one programmers approach to a problem. Pair programming, or duopolising, introduced a second opinion to that approach, bringing co-learning, and improved code quality. Mob programming involves whole team co-operation (mobopolising) to solve large problems, with high code quality. But does it reduce productivity? This talk will demonstrate one approach to mob programming, highlighting some rules which aim to convert a disorderly mob into a well oiled machine.

Born and raised in Yorkshire, Robin Heathcote grew up drinking tea whilst becoming a biscuit connoisseur. He moved to Edinburgh for 4 years studying Environmental Geoscience, but soon realised he had more of a passion for the infinite creative opportunities and problem solving involved in writing code. After an intense three months studying Ruby, Rails and TDD with Makers Academy, he started work at Createk as a junior software engineer.

hello everyone so welcome to my talk on

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:09,559
mobile e it's a talk about mob

00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:11,759
programming we've been using it fairly

00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:12,480
regularly for the last few months at

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,490
create Ecch

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,929
so it's been fairly successful we're not

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,880
playing monopoly by the way I'm just

00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:19,949
going to say I figured because usually

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,470
the start of so many argument I thought

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,580
it'd be safer to just talk about it

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,060
instead

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,410
so I'm Robin you've probably seen me

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,579
before I'm not great at introducing

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:35,520
myself so I'll explain a bit rewind a

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:36,930
couple years ago I was Edinburgh

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,629
universe a doing environmental

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:42,360
Geoscience the last talk I actually did

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:46,379
was on micro plastics and how they're

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,899
affecting Asturian food webs and since

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,309
then I sort of finished uni realized I

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,860
was more interested in the software I

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:55,850
was using for like ocean date and

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:58,800
mapping and stuff like that got into

00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:01,670
makers Academy which is a boot camp down

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,970
in London teaching Ruby Ruby on Rails

00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:08,280
TDD those sort of practices and things

00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:10,650
did that intensively for three months so

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,010
at home in my parents house in my

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:17,250
pajamas typing away then got a job at

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,320
create eck in Manchester so I moved over

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,740
here and that's where I've been since

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,689
and yeah so the only other thing about

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,580
me really is like I'm a fellow runner

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:30,000
slash trail runner so that's me looking

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:32,750
miserable in the late district in a very

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,860
wet weekend two weeks yeah

00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:40,500
so the reason why it's called MOBA Polly

00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:41,970
it's basically an idea that just popped

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,649
into my head I was trying to make the

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,390
talk sound interesting and all I could

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,820
think about was the Kaiser Chiefs album

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:51,000
that's called the angry mob so this was

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,399
the alternative I'll try and explain it

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,969
if it doesn't make sense just focus on

00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,649
the mob programming part basically I

00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:01,049
want you to imagine the apps and

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:04,409
projects that you work on as a Monopoly

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:06,509
board so the different streets and

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,819
places on the Monopoly board at

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,950
different areas of your app that you and

00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:13,390
your team sort of visit to work on add

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:18,700
features fix bugs things

00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:20,050
that so you sort of the low value Street

00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,870
you know like you're all can't Road

00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:25,510
places like that the sort of areas where

00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:27,010
you can get your quick wins sort of

00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:29,890
you're not in there very often it's not

00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:32,380
used very much by the people that are

00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:35,500
using your app so you don't need to

00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:38,020
spend much time there to fix things and

00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:41,110
to add things whereas other areas of

00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,819
your app so sort of your Mayfair places

00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:44,680
like that I'm saying those sort of

00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:48,040
high-value areas of your app that get

00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,870
used a lot and they've got high churn so

00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:53,170
they're a bit more like if you want to

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:56,220
change something in there it requires a

00:02:53,170 --> 00:03:00,970
bit more effort and a bit more time so

00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:03,060
that's sort of the basic start that the

00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,920
currency on the board is developer time

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,769
so when I'm saying like high-value areas

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,380
and things and basically say in the cost

00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:13,450
of putting property like on there so you

00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:16,420
take ownership of different areas of

00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:18,610
your app the cost of the property is the

00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:22,239
amount of developer time needed to sort

00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:25,780
of fix things or add features there so

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,280
four core areas of your app that get

00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:31,180
used a lot it's going to require more

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:35,380
developer time so those areas are the

00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:37,570
ones that we've sort of chosen as places

00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:39,519
to apply mob programming as a team a

00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:41,980
creator can it's been successful because

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,799
it's good to get more ideas in there

00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:48,040
it's places where it's really key to get

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,840
high code quality and make sure that

00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,150
everybody sort of knows what's going on

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,420
in those areas it's worth investing the

00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:58,480
time and on the other side when you put

00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:00,070
the property on those areas like you do

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,860
on a Monopoly board you put your hotels

00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:05,560
and things like that you charge rent to

00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:07,660
the other people that are playing you

00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:12,250
get value out of it as well which is

00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:15,459
also saved to develop a time so

00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:17,739
basically you'll reduce costs in other

00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:21,660
things when developers revisit that area

00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:21,660
and other things that you do as a team

00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:28,960
so monopoly brand-new solo your Perignon

00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:31,720
euro you're working on your own so this

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,039
is you at your keyboard so it's fast you

00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,930
can have multiple people obviously

00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:37,229
working on different tickets at the same

00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:40,690
time so things are moving through nicely

00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:42,490
but with that you're sort of stuck to

00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,030
one person's approach to solving a

00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,780
problem

00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:48,220
so obviously you'll probably discuss it

00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,810
with the team before hung but at the end

00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,600
of the day it's down to that person to

00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:56,020
apply their techniques their experience

00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,599
to fix bugs or add features and then it

00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:01,690
all gets code reviewed at the end so

00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:06,699
with that like when it comes to the code

00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:08,860
review like so I like I like to do yoga

00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:11,530
sometimes and when you go to a class

00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:16,720
there's one teacher teaching 30 odd

00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:18,460
people and with it with yoga you want to

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,810
get the alignment right otherwise you

00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,750
know you tie yourself up in a knot and

00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,639
you end up in hospital and it's hard for

00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:27,370
one teacher to sort of make sure that

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,050
everybody's doing things properly like

00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,909
everyone's aligned so you sort of go

00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,650
through the class and you can ends up

00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:33,970
with like aches and pains afterwards

00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,610
because you've not been in the right

00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:38,440
positions and that can kind of happen

00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,389
with lots of sort of code reviews going

00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,490
on at the same time you're having quick

00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:45,699
glances at things but you know things

00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:47,620
can sleep under the cracks and you know

00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:49,150
you might spot a big change that could

00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:52,150
need doing but you just don't have the

00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:56,169
time and you can't implement them

00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:58,780
basically so as an answer to that came

00:05:56,169 --> 00:06:01,000
duopoly which is Perrin and so you work

00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,560
with a team member you get two ideas

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,599
working on the same thing you bounce

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,110
ideas off each other you've got a driver

00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:10,050
a navigator and you work through the

00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:12,520
problems together and with that

00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:15,009
generally you see code quality going up

00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:20,169
as you sort of checking each other as

00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:22,229
you go along so mob programming if you

00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:26,979
don't know what it is basically is is

00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:30,130
sort of an extension of Perun so it came

00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:33,889
sort of came from I don't know I

00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:36,560
pronounce it Chloe Ellen Falco and who

00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:39,199
champion sort of strong style Perrin

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,409
which is a like say a driver and a

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,240
navigator but with the mobbing you get

00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:46,759
multiple navigators so you get as many

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,580
people from your team in his use deem

00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:51,590
fit and again it's all about bouncing

00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:55,280
ideas off each other and working through

00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:58,310
problems that way so you get more right

00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:04,849
more people checking the code more ideas

00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:06,379
going in so it seems a bit odd like

00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:08,000
you're putting more developers in to

00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:11,389
solve one problem you're sort of

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
limiting what your team can push out and

00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:15,379
what like at the same time so if you've

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,539
got five developers and you've got one

00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:19,189
prop button that you're working on does

00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:22,069
that mean it's one-fifth as productive

00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:24,740
and the thing is it could be one-fifth

00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:27,830
as productivity if your mob isn't really

00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:30,319
working very effectively if you don't

00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:33,770
communicate things like that it's you're

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:36,279
sort of wasting your money you develop a

00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:38,180
time basically things aren't going to be

00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:39,589
going through as quickly and as

00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,139
efficiently and you're not going to get

00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:44,330
that sort of boosting code quality and

00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:50,360
the benefits that you can get through

00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:54,129
mobbin so I mentioned daily about

00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:57,050
property value by reducing the costs so

00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:59,210
you reduce costs and things like code

00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:02,659
rewrite in later on when other people

00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:06,680
visit areas code rework and review and

00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:09,529
learning codes that you didn't write so

00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,449
I'll explain those a bit more so the key

00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:13,580
with it is is you need the effective

00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:18,349
collaboration for this to actually work

00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:21,110
so you reduce a code rewriting because

00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:23,479
you think through the problems as a team

00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:26,000
together you've got varying levels of

00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:27,560
experience and your mob some people have

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,909
may have worked on that particular area

00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:35,690
of the app before some people won't so

00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:37,550
it's all about pooling together and then

00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:40,250
through those well inform designs

00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:43,819
decisions when you come to add features

00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:45,949
later on then you don't have to like you

00:08:43,819 --> 00:08:47,220
shouldn't have to rework everything

00:08:45,949 --> 00:08:48,779
again because it does

00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,930
fit for this hopefully you've put it

00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:57,930
together in a way that's more ready for

00:08:51,930 --> 00:09:01,889
change in the future so in terms of code

00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:03,540
review and rework one benefit with the

00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:05,430
mob is that you sort of doing a code

00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,160
review whilst you're actually doing the

00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:11,370
ticket because everybody is watching

00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:13,709
what's going on so hopefully if it's a

00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:16,290
fully functioning mob if somebody like

00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:19,319
if somebody is come up with an idea and

00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:21,449
it's been written out by the driver then

00:09:19,319 --> 00:09:24,329
if someone on the team thinks hang on

00:09:21,449 --> 00:09:25,920
that seems a little bit weird that's not

00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:28,560
going to work hopefully people are

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,139
communicating and voice in what they

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,699
think and because of that you get an

00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:36,870
increased code quality as you're going

00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:39,240
along and when you do put things out

00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:41,279
hopefully getting less bugs back and you

00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,680
if there's less rework that's needed on

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,350
tickets that you're doing another

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,990
benefit of it is is the mobbing is a

00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:52,920
good way of sort of merging coding that

00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:54,420
other people have been doing so if maybe

00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,819
you might have a mob going but other

00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:59,279
people are working on other things a mob

00:09:56,819 --> 00:10:01,800
is a good way when you get in different

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,389
branches merging in to get everyone

00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,399
together you can sort the conflicts out

00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:07,350
and if you've been generating this good

00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:10,019
communication and your team it makes

00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:15,980
those merge conflicts a lot easier to

00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:19,350
deal with and reducing code learning so

00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:20,910
obviously I'm quite an experienced coder

00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:24,329
I've only been doing it for a couple

00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:26,610
years so when I go to areas of an app

00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:28,379
like when I started at krei tech it was

00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:30,269
a huge app and it was difficult for me

00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:33,449
to sort of read what other people had

00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:36,930
written before the good thing with

00:10:33,449 --> 00:10:38,730
mobbin is that you use it on these sort

00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:41,939
of high-value areas on your Monopoly

00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:44,370
board and it's useful because everybody

00:10:41,939 --> 00:10:48,870
on your team is getting experience in

00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:51,240
that area so later down the line when

00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:53,459
you come to do something else they're

00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,959
then more people have an understanding

00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:56,759
of it hopefully you're not going to get

00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,769
there and think I have no idea how this

00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:01,480
works hopefully you'll have worked on it

00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:03,249
and you'll understand it and even if you

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,470
didn't there's more people on the team

00:11:03,249 --> 00:11:07,329
for you to sort of ask and they should

00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:11,769
be quite a good understanding with it

00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:13,300
within the team the other benefit of it

00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:15,819
is I mean I didn't think of this before

00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:19,119
but it sort of has happened while we've

00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:20,649
been my programming is resilience so

00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:23,499
because you've got obviously got more

00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:25,209
people working on a ticket if you get

00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:28,809
interruptions you know you get urgent

00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:30,670
bugs coming in things like that or you

00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:32,589
have absences people are ill or they're

00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:34,779
not they're the the ticket can still

00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:36,879
progress and that's something that

00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:39,989
obviously doesn't happen if it's just

00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:42,970
one person on a ticket or a pair as well

00:11:39,989 --> 00:11:49,119
people can get diverted and you lose

00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:51,519
that sort of progress on things so the

00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:54,029
main part of the talk is about sort of

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:57,189
hurdles that we've come up against

00:11:54,029 --> 00:12:00,579
trying to make our mob as well oiled as

00:11:57,189 --> 00:12:02,470
possible because you are investing all

00:12:00,579 --> 00:12:04,629
your developers or like a large amount

00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:08,740
of them in one thing you need to make it

00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:12,069
you know productive so got a list of

00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:14,949
things to go through I'll hopefully not

00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:17,019
take too long but with each one I'll

00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:19,379
sort of say what the problem is and then

00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:22,600
the way that we've decided to tackle it

00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:26,790
to try and make our mobs as productive

00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:30,040
as possible so reduce through flow is

00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:32,170
basically because all your developers

00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:36,279
are invested trying to do one ticket

00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:39,730
then the other things can get left sort

00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:42,850
of stale on the side so what about your

00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:45,429
bugs urgent issues that come up and

00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:47,290
other features as well with those being

00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:49,869
a small team like if the entire team is

00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:55,179
mob in then obviously nothing else is

00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:57,189
going to happen so our strategy for this

00:12:55,179 --> 00:13:00,009
and what we've tried to do is be as

00:12:57,189 --> 00:13:02,439
flexible as possible and be dynamic with

00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:04,689
our mob so just because you've entered

00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:08,499
the mob and you've decided we're going

00:13:04,689 --> 00:13:10,179
to work on this it's always good to sort

00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:13,450
of have little satellite groups break

00:13:10,179 --> 00:13:16,540
off so if a bug comes in and somebody

00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:19,060
hey I know well that's gonna be let them

00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:22,470
break off let them work on it and come

00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:25,990
back in or you can stop the mob entirely

00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:27,400
work on something else as a group and by

00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:31,840
doing that it just means that other

00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:33,700
things can actually happen and later on

00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,700
as well I'll talk about mob fatigue and

00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:38,200
this is a good way of sort of getting

00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:44,970
people out of the mob and doing other

00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:49,500
things to keep them fresh as well so a

00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:54,190
mob can very quickly become ineffective

00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:57,490
so again if you start to lose engagement

00:13:54,190 --> 00:14:01,690
with people this can be further a

00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:03,430
variety of reasons sort of mob size is

00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:06,400
often a question that's asked what is

00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:08,620
the ideal mob size sometimes when we've

00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,630
been doing it as a full team it's just

00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,580
it's sent a bit like exhaustive it

00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:14,410
didn't seem like we needed everybody

00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:16,660
there and that's again where that

00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:18,340
flexibility comes in we'll just be like

00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:22,900
you know well we don't need everyone

00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:25,480
here let's break off and other times

00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,980
just like a team of three or something

00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,530
like that are perfectly capable of

00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:31,300
tackling a specific thing and you still

00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:35,590
get value out of having those extra

00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:37,990
minds on one thing and then just things

00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:39,940
like repetitive tasks and also cleaning

00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,920
up as well you don't need then like a

00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:44,950
mob just to finish off a ticket where

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,440
you just remove in duplication or fixing

00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:49,810
so a few like tests that you can't seem

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,730
to get to work that's a really good time

00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:55,980
to just leave a pair to do it and then

00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:59,500
get working on your other things as well

00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:02,050
so the main way that we've sort of

00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:04,840
addressed that sort of hurdle have been

00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:07,680
becoming ineffective is just sort of

00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:10,090
being mindful of what's happening so

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,220
with mob in you do tend to stand up a

00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:13,930
lot you can look at your team you know

00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,760
if everyone sat there on the phone or

00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:17,470
spinning a fidget spinner or something

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,230
like that then clearly something is not

00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:20,860
right like it's not working as well as

00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:23,830
you want it to

00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:25,329
so then consider breaking off or doing

00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:28,389
something else

00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:30,610
or just having a break stand up get some

00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:33,519
fresh blood in the legs and things and

00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:34,779
also retrospectives as well we've done

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,879
quite a few of these where we've just

00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:39,369
been like we've asked the entire team

00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:41,529
what's going well do we think anything

00:15:39,369 --> 00:15:43,629
can be improved and that's been really

00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:45,429
good to sort of just keep reflecting on

00:15:43,629 --> 00:15:47,290
how things are going and that's how

00:15:45,429 --> 00:15:54,879
we've come up with a lot of these sort

00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:58,360
of strategies so to begin with there's

00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,800
sort of a slow initial phase when we

00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,619
first started mobbing there was a lot of

00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:05,499
things sort of needed I now there's the

00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:09,579
age-old sort of develop a holy war of

00:16:05,499 --> 00:16:12,369
the setup that you want obviously

00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:14,860
everybody has their own preference we've

00:16:12,369 --> 00:16:18,129
spent a lot of time arguing over them

00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:21,369
plug-ins and setups like that which

00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:24,689
we're still not sorted yet like two or

00:16:21,369 --> 00:16:28,079
three months down the line of mobbin but

00:16:24,689 --> 00:16:31,420
the idea of the mob is that you rotate

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:34,149
really quickly you want to be you want

00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:36,699
fast transitions of like moving from

00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:39,069
being a navigator into a driver you

00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:40,869
don't want to be sat there you know the

00:16:39,069 --> 00:16:43,149
switching machines load in different

00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:47,649
setups and things like that you want it

00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:50,319
to be as quick as possible also just

00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:52,990
things like screen placements as well we

00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:54,699
have it so it's sort of a big screen you

00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:56,799
want to be a like everybody to see it

00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:58,360
obviously but also it's good to be able

00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:00,100
to get up and move around because it

00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:03,160
encourages good conversation between

00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:06,549
everyone and just simple things like

00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:09,189
timers that's crucial for making sure

00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:11,230
that you know you do rotate when you

00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:13,569
want to because it's very easy to just

00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:16,089
get distracted you know you get focused

00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:18,250
in on a fix or you've come up with an

00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:19,750
idea that's working and then somebody

00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:22,120
gets stuck on the keyboard for a long

00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,679
time and that's happened to me and I

00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,230
sort of become a zombie after a while

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,480
just you're trying to listen to

00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:29,919
everybody fire in different ideas that

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,380
you're saying write this write that and

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,940
shout in you know key commands and stuff

00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,840
like that to quicken it up and it just

00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:41,210
gets a bit exhausting

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:43,419
so it is really important to rotate and

00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:45,830
also communication like it is a

00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:48,409
different environment you you're there

00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:51,679
with the whole team and everybody brings

00:17:48,409 --> 00:17:53,840
their own personality into a mob so

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,899
myself like I'm quite introverted and at

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:59,239
first I was anxious about sort of being

00:17:56,899 --> 00:18:01,009
a mob and sort of you know you've got

00:17:59,239 --> 00:18:03,710
people that way more experienced than I

00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:05,119
am and I'm trying to get my ideas in

00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:07,639
there as well but it can be hard to

00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:09,889
speak up so you've got to deal with

00:18:07,639 --> 00:18:11,809
things like that as well because you

00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:14,950
really want as many ideas in there as

00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:18,729
possible that is why you're in the mob

00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:21,499
so I was strategy for dealing that

00:18:18,729 --> 00:18:24,379
dealing with that is a shared and

00:18:21,499 --> 00:18:26,229
stripped down set up this is what we've

00:18:24,379 --> 00:18:30,320
we're trying to implement at the minute

00:18:26,229 --> 00:18:31,789
we all use them so we're trying to come

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,859
up with sort of a base set that

00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:36,979
everybody has on their computer of sort

00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:39,289
of the the essentials basically that

00:18:36,979 --> 00:18:41,210
everybody uses and then you can have

00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:44,049
your own stuff on there as well and you

00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:46,489
know it's there so you can use it so

00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:49,489
that again is just a speed of the

00:18:46,489 --> 00:18:51,919
transitions one big screen as I've

00:18:49,489 --> 00:18:55,489
mentioned we also have a second screen

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:57,739
now as well sort of just on the table

00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:59,359
because it can be like the screen is

00:18:57,739 --> 00:19:04,159
quite far away so you don't be squinting

00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:06,859
all day and encouraging questions and

00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:08,599
input like no idea is a bad idea you

00:19:06,859 --> 00:19:10,399
want to be encouraging people firing

00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:14,960
things off each other

00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:18,200
and regular breaks and rotation like I I

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,839
need breaks otherwise I do just like my

00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,539
mind just turns to mush so just have I

00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:25,909
think we usually do it where after three

00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:28,159
or four rotations we have like five or

00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:30,379
ten minutes as a break and like it just

00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:35,929
refreshes everybody and then you get

00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:41,059
everyone thinking again divergence is

00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:44,929
the next one so this is sort of split

00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:47,660
into two things one is sort of you

00:19:44,929 --> 00:19:49,580
personally going off and

00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:51,950
I don't know you've seen something on

00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,870
the screen and you've got an idea and

00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:56,840
you want to jump on your computer Google

00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:59,960
some stuff and you're off on your way

00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:03,890
and the mobs go in a different way this

00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,540
is like it can be okay this but the

00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:07,430
problem is the further you go down your

00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:09,320
own path the harder it is for you to get

00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:12,140
back into the mob and to explain your

00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:14,480
ideas the whole point of a mob is if you

00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:16,190
have an idea then say it

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,750
you've got the driver there tell the

00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,970
driver to Google the thing that you want

00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:22,430
to Google and then everybody can read it

00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:25,430
and everybody then knows from the start

00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:27,050
what your idea is and you either you

00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:30,920
know it might not work or it might be

00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:33,650
the thing that you all needed the other

00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,630
thing is yak shaving is really easy like

00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:37,580
because you usually with a mob you

00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:40,220
working on big tickets you wanting to

00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:41,960
make significant changes in your app a

00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:44,000
lot of the time it's easy to just be

00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:47,450
like Oh while we're here there's that

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,970
other thing as well that is oh so nice

00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:51,410
to just get that done but at the end of

00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:53,450
the day it's not part of what you're

00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:55,460
what you're actually trying to work on

00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:57,860
and you already invest in a lot of your

00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:00,590
team's time in this ticket so you need

00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:02,450
to be deciding whether or not it's you

00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:07,760
know you just shave in too many acts or

00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:10,220
not so the way we deal with this is to

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:14,210
only have one compute or open at all

00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:15,740
times and yeah we stick to that pretty

00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:19,160
well obviously you've got to communicate

00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:21,050
with the team as well by a messaging and

00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,460
things like that and sometimes you know

00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:24,860
you have to break off and do your own

00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:26,900
thing but for the most part just keep

00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:29,750
one computer open and you for everyone

00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:32,270
else focuses on the big screen and you

00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:35,180
work as a team that way and again

00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:37,970
encourage communication is the key of

00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:40,610
mobbin and the last point has been

00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:43,730
really good for us as well which is sort

00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:47,210
of discussing and writing out a criteria

00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:49,010
right at the start as a mob so you we

00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:51,380
sort of used tickets for things and you

00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:53,870
have your criteria of what's been asked

00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:55,640
for but then this is your opportunity at

00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:57,770
the start as developers to say what do

00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,080
we need to go through to actually reach

00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:01,240
those goals so we have a list on the

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,340
board

00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,410
little checkboxes it's always nice to

00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,690
like check things off makes you feel

00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:10,360
really productive and we add to it as

00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:12,490
we're going along as well and that's

00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:15,100
been really good to just add little

00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:17,290
things would think we need to we need to

00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:19,630
solve that just over there as well

00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:21,430
before we push this ticket out and it's

00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:23,850
good at the end to have those things as

00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:26,590
like a tidy up to make sure that

00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:29,470
everything is working when you finish

00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:32,080
leaders is the next one it's something

00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:35,140
that we came up against and it's it does

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,610
happen in teams the well I think it will

00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:41,140
happen in a lot of teams where there's a

00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:43,990
mix of experience so obviously if you're

00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:45,820
in a mob and you know somebody either

00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:47,650
knows one particular part of the app

00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:49,300
really well that you're working in they

00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:52,660
can be really snappy at coming up with

00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:54,690
solutions to fix something and then they

00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:56,950
sort of just dominate what's going on so

00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:59,440
effectively you've got an entire team

00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:01,330
there that's supposed to be working on

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,950
something but somebody's just gone

00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:05,830
straight and this is my idea

00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:07,570
it's going to work and then everybody's

00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:11,200
sort of either they lose concentration

00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:13,810
or they get really confused because

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,670
you're going that fast you need your

00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:17,950
team to be following your logic as you

00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:20,650
going along and if you're just sort of

00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:24,100
firing directions that the driver who's

00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:26,350
frantically like type in a way then you

00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:30,300
sort of you lose interest and people get

00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:33,670
lost which you want to be avoiding so

00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:36,300
again this comes down to sort of mindful

00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:38,620
mobbin like watching what's happening

00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:41,440
with your team as you going along if

00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:44,220
people are sort of blank behind the eyes

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:48,190
then clearly something needs to stop and

00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:51,820
we trialed something where we rotate a

00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:53,650
chief navigators so you have your mob

00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:58,720
and usually everybody's a navigator and

00:23:53,650 --> 00:24:00,700
you all politely instruct the driver but

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,320
we had a go of once you'd be in the

00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,570
driver when you come off you're the

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:09,250
chief person that talks to the new

00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:11,140
driver so everybody else in the mob sort

00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,730
of comes up with their ideas they tell

00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:16,270
the chief navigator and then

00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:20,230
they they decide themselves what goes

00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:23,410
through the drivers hands we did it for

00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:25,890
a bit and we haven't really carried on

00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:28,750
with it which I do not sure if it's

00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:31,960
because it's not we didn't deem it very

00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:33,280
successful I always felt that like after

00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,260
you've come off the keyboard because

00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:38,559
you've been typing away and focusing on

00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:40,510
that that is kind of difficult then to

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,340
be instantly put in charge of making the

00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:44,860
decisions of the direction of where you

00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:47,140
go in so maybe that could be tweaked a

00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:49,809
little bit but it's another technique

00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:54,299
that you could try and just to stop one

00:24:49,809 --> 00:24:54,299
person just overtaken the whole thing

00:24:54,580 --> 00:25:02,230
the last bit is fatigue so like at first

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:05,230
I found mobbing exhaustion because you

00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:07,690
are lates prolonged concentration trying

00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:10,630
to sort of understand other people's

00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:13,780
logic other people's approaches and ways

00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:18,220
of thinking for an entire day which is

00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:19,990
tiring and if you doing it for like an

00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:22,960
entire week on a really big ticular or

00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:25,660
something like that it like if everybody

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,980
in your team knackered then obviously

00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:33,040
you're not going to get as much out of

00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:37,419
your mob as what you want so the point

00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:40,809
of this is take regular breaks like say

00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:44,200
we do it after every third driver and

00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:46,510
that's worked really well and also that

00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,700
flexibility and dynamic nature of your

00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:50,650
mob as well allow breaking off if

00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,510
somebody in the morning is just like I

00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:54,100
can't take it anymore I can't take you

00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:56,919
guys I want to put my headphones on and

00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:58,600
do my own thing and that's fine that

00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:00,940
means that you know other things get

00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,850
worked on the mob still go in for the

00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:05,559
people that it's working for and

00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:08,650
everyone's happy the other point is

00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:11,320
don't mob everything I'm not trying to

00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:12,970
say that mobbing is now the the new norm

00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,919
of tackling every single thing that you

00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:16,830
do it's just another tool another

00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:24,340
approach that you can use to sort of

00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:25,750
tackle things so we had some create ECMO

00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:29,440
rules

00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:32,290
so these were the main three things that

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,150
we thought were key and that's what

00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:37,060
we've stuck to just a fifteen-minute

00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:39,610
rotation one computer open and layout

00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:42,820
the steps at the beginning for what you

00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:44,380
want to do and they like everything else

00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:45,790
I've sort of helped but there are the

00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:51,580
three things that we thought were like

00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:54,790
quarter making us productive so lastly

00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:57,520
just in summary like when to apply your

00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:59,320
mob like when we've used it large

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,420
features where you're going to get a lot

00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,160
of value out of everybody knowing about

00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:05,140
that small part of the app or the large

00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:07,150
part of the app so that when they've

00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:10,420
come back in future it's great to have a

00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:12,870
team of people that know it really well

00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:15,610
structural changes and largely factors

00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:17,380
and significant changes to high use

00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:19,600
areas as well it might not be a big

00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:21,940
change but if it's used all the time and

00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,560
you find yourself always going in there

00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,180
and it's just always a pain for

00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,460
everybody you just want to avoid it like

00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:30,430
the plague then it's a good time to get

00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:33,870
your whole team in and get a good change

00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:37,810
in the earth that everybody appreciates

00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:39,120
and then when not to apply the mob I put

00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:42,190
this in but then I kind of realized

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,810
later that some of these you could

00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:47,200
actually still use a month for I was

00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:49,150
just reading a blog post that said they

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,650
found actually that using a mob through

00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:52,600
small features as well as really

00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:54,970
efficient and they've actually had a lot

00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:57,040
of success for doing it but you've just

00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:59,590
again got to be wary of like do you

00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:01,870
really need your entire team just to

00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:05,530
make simple changes then it's not going

00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:07,000
to be very effective repetitive tasks

00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:10,510
obviously you don't need an entire team

00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,730
to do that and investigations you don't

00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:15,010
need to mob really an investigation if

00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:16,990
you could get one or two people to do it

00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:18,550
and then they can inform a mob and then

00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:20,470
you can start a ticket from there thats

00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:24,550
always a good place to be and just

00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:30,900
mopping things up as well and that is it

00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:33,550
so monopoly jus up Lee and Ibaka Lee

00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:35,740
yeah the point of the talk is not to say

00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:38,140
that way like we now think mob in should

00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:39,460
just be the norm it's just we found it a

00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,559
really good way

00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:43,809
to tackle certain things and it's great

00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:46,149
to have that option and now that we've

00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:48,100
got it weld and it's working for us all

00:28:46,149 --> 00:28:50,049
then it's really good to be able to just

00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,880
say you know what we've had that thing

00:28:50,049 --> 00:28:55,120
lingering for a long time let's mob it

00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:57,909
and invest some time in it and then can

00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:01,330
obviously use pairing and just solo

00:28:57,909 --> 00:29:03,080
programming as well and that's it all

00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:07,760
right and you crash

00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,760
