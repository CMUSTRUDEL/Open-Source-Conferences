	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,449
my name is Anna and I'm working for a

00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:05,879
small company called hiring herb and

00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:07,620
it's been a topic of conversation for us

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:09,420
for a while especially being a very

00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,940
small development team and not

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,920
necessarily having much budget or

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,420
resources to try and even kind of

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,260
understand it and then deal with what we

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:21,300
needed to do with the gdpr so just

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,010
quickly hiring herb we're building a

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,670
kind of recruitment marketplace platform

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:30,150
which joins kind of rated and reviews

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:32,070
agencies to employers so there's quite a

00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,760
lot of data that kind of processes on

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:41,070
our site within our site as well so I

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:43,260
joined as CTO end of last year and I

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,030
don't know really what that means yet I

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,090
guess but I'm a bit of everything from

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,579
desktop support to product development

00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:53,820
to WordPress developers my most recent

00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:56,070
job title and facilities all sorts of

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,410
different things and then there's my

00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,920
favorite favorite responsibilities which

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,510
is information security manager as well

00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:06,810
so I don't know for those of you

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,340
remember me from on the beach I've got

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,740
really bad timing when it comes to

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,810
compliance issues in this role because I

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,930
literally got landed this job title as

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,540
well when it was PCI DSS so all the kind

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:21,000
of credit card stuff as well so I just

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,009
start here and then my boss goes oh I've

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,670
heard of this thing gdpr do you know

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:29,189
what it means I'm like oh no I'll find

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:34,020
out and so that's what we've been doing

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:36,750
for a while okay so what does it stand

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,329
for so it's the general data protection

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,909
regulation and effectively it's the same

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:45,860
as the Data Protection Act of nineteen

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:49,020
let me just check the date 98 and

00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,790
effectively there's a lot of similar

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,700
kind of principles in there all the

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,290
underlying principles are the same now

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,030
does anybody know what the principles

00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:04,310
are anybody want to take a guess how

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:07,459
many do you reckon there are oh not bad

00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:10,289
not bad now this is a key this is Q

00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:12,540
stolen slide because I'll do my slices

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,560
of text but this was a bit more wizzy so

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:18,390
stole this

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:21,239
but there's seven principles and six of

00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:23,880
them existed previously so making sure

00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:26,400
that you know the day it was fair and

00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,020
lawful that you are holding that you had

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,390
a real purpose for the data that you

00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,280
were holding you know I want a job so

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,870
you know it's you know it's reasonable

00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,900
that I'm holding you know I'm giving my

00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,610
CV to somebody in there storing it that

00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,130
you'd keep the minimum amount of data

00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,930
that you might need for that purpose do

00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,819
try and keep up to date when you're

00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,549
processing it that you'd always keep it

00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:49,680
confidential and secure and that you'd

00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:51,690
limit the forms that you'd keep it in

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,150
that would be identifiable but what's

00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:56,130
different with the seventh principle is

00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,349
they've really added some accountability

00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:02,610
and liability across the whole spectrum

00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:04,049
as well which means that people are

00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,500
really looking to kind of tighten up on

00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:07,280
everything

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:10,799
yeah there's potential fines now and

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:14,880
reputational damage as well that comes

00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:16,500
from that so that's why you know we're

00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,359
getting all these DD priori emails

00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,060
because people are kind of panicking a

00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:23,910
little about it and trying to understand

00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:29,310
what do we do what does it what does it

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:31,560
mean so what what does it apply to so

00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:35,069
applies to any personal data that can

00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,750
reasonably identify an individual so all

00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:38,819
of these are you know perfect examples

00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,470
of things that that could include but

00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:42,060
one thing that I learn is that it's not

00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,519
just personal data from a consumer

00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,940
perspective it's also personal data from

00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:51,870
a company or work perspective as well so

00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:53,940
my work email address and that's held by

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:58,230
a supplier of us for example would be in

00:03:53,940 --> 00:04:01,560
scope for this as well okay so what did

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:05,639
this mean for a hiring hub or at least

00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:08,430
for our small small team so we figured

00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:10,260
out that there's two main areas where we

00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,510
had data and that we had to look after

00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:15,329
it so we were controllers of our

00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:18,780
customer data and that was our agency

00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:21,389
and supplier user data our supplier data

00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,860
and our employee data so that was data

00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:25,680
that we actually owned and we had

00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,240
consent from people either you know

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,960
because they worked for us

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,240
and to use their NA number four for the

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,849
purposes of payroll for example or

00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,460
through terms of business that agency

00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:39,780
had given us their details so that we

00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,550
could contact them or throw them for the

00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:44,819
purposes of the business of engaging in

00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:46,410
our kind of services and mainly that was

00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:49,500
kind of around email phone number

00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:52,349
address nothing sure number bank details

00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,270
those things then we had also figured

00:04:52,349 --> 00:04:57,120
out that we were processor for some data

00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,849
so we didn't own it so an agency would

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,830
put forward a CV within our platform

00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:03,990
they might put forward some details for

00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:05,729
telephone interview on our platform but

00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:08,789
we effectively didn't own that candidate

00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:11,970
data at all but we had to ensure that

00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:14,400
the controller of that data had consent

00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:19,770
in order to process that data on our

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:22,680
system as well so that's our small team

00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:24,240
we've got four of us and sorry for my

00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,610
cheesy grin and as you could tell it was

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,800
a bit of a last it was taken today I

00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:31,620
don't wear that t-shirt this t-shirt

00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,969
every day so yeah what does it really

00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,949
mean for us like I mentioned before

00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:37,080
we're really small team a really small

00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:38,909
budget and like with any kind of startup

00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,680
business you really before you invest in

00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:42,690
kind of shoring up and mature in certain

00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,800
things you probably need to spend some

00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:48,000
money making sure that you've got a

00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,469
viable business and security and GDP but

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,020
I haven't been budgeted for in our

00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:58,229
funding at all so so what did we do so

00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:01,169
we educated ourselves pretty cheaply you

00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:02,759
know we did in although initially I kind

00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:04,400
of panicked and we were speaking to a

00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:07,770
few consultants about what did it mean

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,180
you know 1200 pound a day I thought we

00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,289
can we can find out a little bit more

00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,599
about this we don't think that we need

00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:15,120
to consult in so I have been to most

00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:17,490
gdpr events in Manchester and some other

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,860
cities especially if they've got free

00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:24,060
food and and drink well I'm definitely

00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:26,490
there you know I've read blogs we've

00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,259
kind of beg stole and borrowed lots of

00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30,000
kind of resources and things from people

00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:32,009
as well and really just going to give

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,229
ourselves a basic understanding of of

00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:35,610
what we need to do and also trying to

00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:37,860
understand where our risk points were

00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:40,260
for the business

00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,430
this maybe comes back to not stolen but

00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:44,190
kind of reacquire

00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,930
a didya GDP our policy pack and I was

00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:48,930
actually really helpful I mean it was

00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:52,320
it's pretty pretty thick but actually it

00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:54,110
helps us understand kind of a benchmark

00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,610
of where we where we needed to get to

00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:59,190
with all our daters so for example it

00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:01,110
had a secure coding policy it had a

00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:03,030
patch management policy I had an

00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:05,370
encryption policy password policy a

00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,720
retention and asset management all sorts

00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,430
of things which gave us a basic

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,470
understanding of how we should deal or

00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,760
deal with some of these things and what

00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:14,190
the standards were that we needed to

00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,140
work towards so that meant we could do a

00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:18,600
gap analysis and go right we're connor

00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:20,010
here you know and we need to be here

00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,420
what's all the stuff that we need to do

00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:23,250
and then we kind of worked with the

00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:27,450
business to kind of prioritize what was

00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:29,430
important or most important so we then

00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:31,140
decided we need to find where all that

00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:34,770
data is we knew we had this customer

00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:36,210
data account data CV phone numbers but I

00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:38,880
guess was like any small company that's

00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:40,920
kind of maturing they're worth you know

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,720
things in spreadsheets there were things

00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:48,210
on people's machines there was various

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,670
kind of servers our live service test

00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:54,990
servers staging local machines with

00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:58,440
copies of databases on potentially we

00:07:54,990 --> 00:08:00,360
had a CDN s3 storage we had our backups

00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,110
we had printouts maybe looking about the

00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,180
office and making it sound really bad

00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:07,230
it's always a data everywhere but these

00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,900
are the things that we have to start

00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:11,280
looking just to make sure where is the

00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,910
data and then how can we make it more

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,740
secure as well also logging in analytics

00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:18,900
was one as well just to look to make

00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:23,460
sure that we weren't holding any day -

00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:25,650
there - okay so we found we kind of

00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:27,210
mapped out all the data and for us

00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:29,130
because we're small company actually a

00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:30,990
lot of a lot of those kind of places

00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,950
were locations especially from a

00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:35,729
technical perspective

00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:38,630
we're from third-party suppliers so you

00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:41,190
know our car hosting our email service

00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:44,310
even our DevOps kind of operations is

00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:46,170
third party so we engage with them to

00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:47,550
help understand if they were moving to

00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:49,500
compliance and what they were doing and

00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:51,810
actually that was fantastic to help us

00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,069
alerts as well learn as well what you do

00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:58,939
it oh we know maybe we should do that as

00:08:54,069 --> 00:09:01,819
so that's really helped then once we'd

00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:03,560
found it we really kind of tried to

00:09:01,819 --> 00:09:05,689
understand did we really need it was it

00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,850
important is it just because you know we

00:09:05,689 --> 00:09:09,709
haven't had a shirred up retention

00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:13,069
policy that we've got quite a lot of

00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:16,610
customer data so we actually deleted a

00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:19,069
lot of data that we didn't need or we

00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:22,579
anonymized what we what we did need to

00:09:19,069 --> 00:09:24,230
keep so that was quite it was always an

00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:26,389
opportunity as well because I think from

00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,250
a technical perspective that's made it a

00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:29,870
lot easier to manage cost less than

00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:36,350
storage and a lot of other things as

00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:37,790
well okay so then we looked up the data

00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:41,420
that we have left and we're like who's

00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:44,569
got access to it so this back to kind of

00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:47,209
passwords was Carl you know we invoked

00:09:44,569 --> 00:09:49,910
kind of password password policies or

00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:51,560
stronger password policies again being a

00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,120
small company they'd been this kind of

00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,459
oh you know I'll just borrow that

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,379
password you know a shared password that

00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:59,269
was written down printed on the wall

00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:03,350
although that might be a safer place to

00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:04,730
keep it what we're saying here simple

00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:06,980
things like making sure that people lock

00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:09,319
in their screen creating a bit of a

00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,120
starter and lever process even though

00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:13,519
there's only you know there was any kind

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,809
of nine people when we started the

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,550
amount of access that's kind of been

00:10:14,809 --> 00:10:17,870
given on an ad-hoc basis and then

00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,879
someone would leave and there would be

00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:21,170
like few weeks later they you know they

00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:23,449
potentially still got a password to a

00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:24,949
live production system you know we need

00:10:23,449 --> 00:10:29,110
to get a process in place to make sure

00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:32,300
and that we don't do that again

00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:34,550
and so that was access to the data and

00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,930
then anything that's left any other day

00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,250
that was left looking at making sure

00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:39,439
that we're securing it as much as

00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,939
possible so that's kind of the point

00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:42,709
we're at at the minute is looking at

00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:46,040
improving the equip ssin of our

00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:47,689
application data but also making sure

00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,699
that district encryptions on the on the

00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:54,790
laptops for users if they've got

00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:54,790
anything downloaded yep

00:10:54,910 --> 00:11:04,370
and generally kind of continuing to

00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:06,920
create processes and assurances as we

00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:11,139
kind of grow the codebase as well so

00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:13,940
looking we've got it sorry you know

00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:17,389
ongoing vulnerability scanning regular

00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:19,250
pen tests using for example break man in

00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:20,779
the release pipeline to make sure that

00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:23,240
we're continually just checkpoint in

00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:24,980
where we are try to document a little

00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,600
bit more so that when people are coming

00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:29,120
in to kind of understanding how things

00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,980
are work in what we use in and looking

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,870
at implementing kind of privacy by

00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,209
design which is something that gdpr

00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,800
talks about which is really where with

00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:38,180
any kind of new development you're doing

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,620
kind of really thinking about that data

00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:42,709
do you need it where you're going to

00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:44,149
store it who's going to access it so

00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:49,250
that you can make continually make sure

00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:53,209
that you kind of keep this up so what's

00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:55,010
next so really I think we're going to

00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:57,139
try and work on how do we automate a lot

00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:59,060
of this stuff as we move forwards I

00:11:57,139 --> 00:12:01,190
think because of a small company a lot

00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,449
of it is around kind of process you know

00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,820
it's kind of process driven we can't

00:12:02,449 --> 00:12:08,000
afford a kind of all-singing all-dancing

00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:09,649
gde pr1 kind of push solution and a lot

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,870
of it is kind of workarounds and best

00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:13,910
endeavors to make sure that we can

00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:15,230
follow the processes so hopefully as we

00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:16,850
move forward we'll be able to automate a

00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:21,709
lot of that for the business and help

00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:23,149
them but just generally it's never it's

00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:24,920
never going to be done it's kind of it's

00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:27,140
not you get to there I think it's the

00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,850
25th of May where it officially comes in

00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:31,040
which is why your emails will be

00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,690
hammered I think even more so for the

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,870
next week apologies if you get one from

00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:37,579
us but it's just it's kind of one of

00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,959
those it's those ongoing processes and

00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:41,420
it's really important to kind of bed in

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,410
and educate people within your teams to

00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:47,649
make sure they understand what they need

00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:47,649
to do so thank you you all still wake

00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:51,820
