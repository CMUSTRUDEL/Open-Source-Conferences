00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,070
hi sorry I'm late so you just got stuck

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,899
in traffic I think might be the weather

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:52,140
the trend so when I'll just we'll just

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,940
go jump straight into it okay so I don't

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,239
arrive late I forgot that was the first

00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:00,079
slide clearly I should read through my

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,760
slides before I fall to sit up here and

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:06,119
really sorry about that I know your

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,100
slide deck cool yeah cool I again didn't

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:09,390
really didn't really check that out and

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,420
obviously you need to introduce your

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:17,400
talk so apologies for that false start

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:19,290
the real one and the fake one and my

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,810
name is John Clary and I'm the

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:26,700
co-founder of a company called critic

00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:28,860
and I had this idea for a talk some time

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,990
ago I gave my last talk here a year and

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,579
a half ago or something and the San the

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,439
other co-founder of a company said John

00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:37,409
I really like to talk but could you

00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:40,799
maybe do a technical talk and kind of

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:42,420
said do technical talks he said so I

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,729
said what about if I gave a talk about

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,939
giving technical talks would that do and

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:50,610
he said no but I more less aside to do

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:52,799
that anyway so thank you so this is the

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,860
talk about giving talks sort of like a

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,060
meta talk a talk talk if you will I'm

00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,520
gonna be honest today we're not going to

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,079
cover everything and we can't I had a

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,790
bit of a sort of a panic moment I need

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,250
to confess with you at the weekend last

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:09,060
Saturday I woke up the morning and I was

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:11,760
I was rehearsing my talk which is code

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,890
for starting to prepare my talk

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,849
and I had this kind of panic moment

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,200
thinking I'm gonna be on the stage in

00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:18,540
front of these people many who have

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,190
spoken before okay and I'm gonna say hey

00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,870
this is how you give a talk and the sort

00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,220
of that kind of scared me because you

00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,780
all know how to give talks and I don't

00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,940
to be the one saying this is the only

00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,849
way to do it then I remembered some of

00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,110
my own advice which is about slide 27

00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:32,790
which says it's really about your own

00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,650
personal experience so what I'm giving

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,940
you today is some of my experiences some

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,430
of the things that have worked well for

00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,390
me and some of you know the ups bills

00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,810
are some of the down some of the

00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:44,610
failures along the way um can I just get

00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,140
a quick show of hands who's given a talk

00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:48,840
at an event like this or a conference

00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,730
before that's cool that's like most of

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,799
you that's pretty cool and basically the

00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,480
next 20 slides are questions that you

00:02:52,799 --> 00:03:00,209
all answer so it's like I'm looking at

00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:01,709
and I'm kidding okay so I'm going to get

00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:04,260
a little bit technical here so try and

00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:05,640
bear with this part of the talk and you

00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,440
can break a talk down into three

00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,829
distinct phases or the whole sort of

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:15,239
lifecycle of the talk we sort of phase

00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:16,530
zero the bit before the talk and that is

00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,930
basically at the moment when you decide

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,639
you want to give a talk and you've sort

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,989
of said oh yeah I'll be good idea I'll

00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:23,370
set up in front of a load of people and

00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:27,209
I'll talk for like 40 minutes that's a

00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:28,680
great idea right up until phase one the

00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:30,419
talk which is the bit I'm doing right

00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,310
now suit anyone's not following just

00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:36,989
making that clear so phase one is the

00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:38,849
talk itself um and then a bit after the

00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:40,680
talk okay and a bit after the talk is

00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:42,389
the bit that I'm afraid gets neglected

00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,069
the most I think it's people don't

00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,630
really think about what you do

00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:47,489
afterwards

00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:49,980
I've only got one slide about it so I'm

00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:53,549
not really addressing that very well by

00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:58,169
there one sides better than none um okay

00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:59,819
so oh yeah and this is just a you know a

00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:03,510
couple of weeks before your 40 minutes

00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:05,609
and up to including infinity obviously

00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,900
if you give a talk and never give

00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:09,239
another talk ever again and that's

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,040
infinity if you decide to give one more

00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:17,060
talk then you go back to phase zero okay

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,060
I think phase zero before the talk

00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:24,780
so why would we give a talk what what

00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,570
would possess any of you to give the

00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:30,410
talk most of people should hand so can I

00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:33,090
ask tech in cuz I know your name

00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:34,650
what was your motivation you know when

00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:38,030
you decide hey look I'd like to put

00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,030
something out there in the in the space

00:04:40,610 --> 00:05:08,940
it's alright I mean I basically got 40

00:04:43,169 --> 00:05:11,210
minutes to pad so that's cool rob go on

00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,229
a picked on you again know your name

00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:25,370
anyone who does it was named I don't

00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:25,370
know you're safe tonight basically yep

00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:32,220
yeah yeah I think for me it was like

00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:35,340
it's really good to go outside your

00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,659
comfort zone and the first time I gave a

00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,159
talk you know it's like super nervous

00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:39,510
but I knew that he's kind of grow as a

00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:41,250
person so that was one of the reasons I

00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,539
want to do it do you agree that like

00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,979
it's you know it's good for your career

00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:45,360
it's like a part of your personal

00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:48,180
branding that's something you take with

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,370
you you know through life you you know

00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,780
use you can sort of gain the rat-race in

00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,759
a job and you can be fighting for a

00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,710
promotion or a rise whatever but your

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,030
your career your personal branding is

00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:59,190
something that you take with you all the

00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,659
way and that then and so you've got the

00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,690
sort of acid that's in I gave that talk

00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:04,740
and other my slides and and yeah it's

00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:07,110
like sharing the knowledge you know like

00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,970
we're a relatively small group so you

00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:13,620
know be able to share one another's I

00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:15,240
it's pretty cool what do we talk about

00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:18,840
right this is like where most people

00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:21,750
seem to get stuck and I think it's a

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,669
really tough question someone else what

00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:26,750
how did you choose what speak about Rhys

00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:26,750
what was your kind of

00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:44,500
you got an awesome boss I just the cover

00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:46,780
there yeah yeah yeah yeah I think I've

00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,630
got like what is my foolproof kind of

00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:52,210
system of working out what to talk about

00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:53,230
and it goes a bit like this so it's

00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,720
definitely good to talk about something

00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:58,750
you're passionate about this is so true

00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:02,050
I've watched TED talks about like squid

00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:03,310
and you know I don't like squid but you

00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,360
watch you talk about screen you think

00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,890
that's a really interesting talk that

00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,050
person really knows that when you you

00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:09,510
know you feed off that and you know you

00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,680
find it interesting as well so that's

00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:13,240
that is definitely a big part of you can

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,530
speak you should really focus on the

00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,510
stuff that you really like because if

00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,770
you go with the other stuff you'll you

00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:20,910
know the stuff that's cool or hip right

00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:23,590
now you may be falling off a cliff

00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:25,210
it is good however particularly in the

00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,740
Ruby community if you're giving a talk

00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,960
here or whatever it is talk about some

00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,400
people want to listen to so if you can

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,140
get that kind of balance of look I'm

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,700
really interested in this other people

00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,530
want to hear about you pretty pretty

00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,300
obvious stuff right but the last and the

00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:39,400
killer ingredient to every talk and if

00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,570
your talk does not have this right you

00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,890
were missing out this is like you should

00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:43,810
be ashamed yourself and you should like

00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:45,180
step away from the tech community need

00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:48,039
to be talking about blockchain right now

00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,720
okay so that's but now I mean seriously

00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:51,820
side out I do think if you can you know

00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,580
if you can blend those two that's that's

00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:57,970
kind of the sort of key to that okay so

00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:59,830
phase one and so made you all decide you

00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:02,110
want to give a talk all four of you who

00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:04,300
haven't already given one I hope and so

00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:09,669
we want to talk about the talk itself

00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:10,900
and the first thing to remember is the

00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:12,370
content of what you're going to speak

00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,410
about and what you have to remember is

00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:15,610
you can't tell everybody everything I

00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,289
said at the start about this talk I'm

00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:19,240
not trying to cover everything here

00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:21,789
tonight there are plenty of blogs and

00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,880
wikis and YouTube talks about it so you

00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:26,500
have to decide what it is that's that's

00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:29,860
critical what messages you want to get

00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:33,430
across I use the trick that teachers use

00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:35,140
which is having learning outcomes having

00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:38,289
a lesson plan with learning outcomes

00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,500
they write down at the start what three

00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:41,719
or four or maybe five

00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,099
five things they want the children or

00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:45,320
adults if they're teaching adults to

00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:46,700
take home at the end so that's a really

00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,310
good way to start that that kind of

00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:53,390
gives a foundation of what it is you're

00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:55,010
going to be speaking about I've written

00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,780
mine down here so you'll just to give

00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:58,190
you a flavor of what it's like so what I

00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,840
want to talk about tonight is I wanted

00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:02,600
to convey the public speaking is

00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,280
accessible there you don't have to talk

00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,960
about the next big thing the cool stuff

00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,060
that you can talk about your passion I

00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,740
want to emphasize the importance of

00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:12,530
structuring the talk which will come on

00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:16,360
to and I also want emphasize the

00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:17,950
importance of preparation and practicing

00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,290
okay

00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:23,420
so structure and this is something that

00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:25,850
I think and really think about technical

00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:28,040
talks in particular that we forget the

00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:30,890
structure of your talk is really

00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,510
important there is a tendency in the

00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:34,580
tech community to sort of brain dump

00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:36,380
onto your slides and flick through those

00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:38,210
and that be the talk you know if you're

00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:40,700
talking about a new language or

00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:43,160
something like that you can fall into

00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:46,520
that trap I think you should think about

00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:49,030
the dramatic structure the having a

00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,560
beginning a middle and an end

00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:54,650
the classic storytelling where there's a

00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:57,890
rising conflict and you know conclusion

00:09:54,650 --> 00:10:01,550
can be difficult to convey in something

00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:03,110
technical but if you look at technical

00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:06,110
topics but if you look at them from your

00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:07,940
perspective so we're talking about what

00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:10,130
we liked about this technology what

00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:13,310
worked what didn't work or problems we

00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:14,750
had would have done it differently what

00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,920
what did I learn about it that's what

00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,260
people want to know they can get the

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,610
how-to guides off the internet so they

00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:22,010
don't they don't really want that they

00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:23,870
want to hear your story and and it sort

00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:26,240
of bleeding out from you like that me

00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:28,730
for example I when I prepare my talks I

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,100
use Evernote and I put all the things

00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,510
down just in like note format one line

00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,010
by line everything I want to say in the

00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:35,930
talk and then I kind of group them

00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:38,330
together and structure them into sort of

00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:40,430
common themes and then I look and see is

00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:42,110
there a story there and if there is then

00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:44,540
I might email someone and say hey I want

00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,670
to give a talk and then you know

00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:48,770
organize that around a structure that

00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:50,690
conveys either over time or over or

00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:52,940
something something like that so there's

00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:53,660
a that beginning middle and the end you

00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,850
can fold

00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:58,370
to the position of say what you're gonna

00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:00,350
say say it and say what you've said I

00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:02,570
think it has to be a fallback position I

00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:04,280
think it's good to summarize at the end

00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:06,080
but it shouldn't be the only thing you

00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,040
do if you watch a good movie they don't

00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,870
tell you everything that's going to

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,220
happen at the beginning you watch the

00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:12,170
movie and then they tell you what you

00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:14,420
just saw that isn't how good stories

00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:18,890
work so think about the structure in

00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:21,050
terms of the story it's really important

00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:24,170
as we are now in terms of style so the

00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:27,230
way you deliver you talk to think about

00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:30,830
your audience so the delivery of it is

00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:33,560
it formal informal what is the purpose

00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:35,690
of your talk is it to educate is it to

00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,210
entertain bit of both or is there

00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:39,470
something else the way you dress and so

00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:43,820
for example tonight I'm dressed quite

00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:45,740
formally so we're going to wear oh so I

00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,930
just you know to dress with you guys I

00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:51,020
need to take your shirt off or this just

00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:54,440
segment of some work look at me give a

00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:56,990
guy a bit of privacy oh my god you guys

00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,280
much if I could be heard any more now so

00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:00,190
yeah I'm gonna dress like a techie

00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:03,970
because this is a techie job right so

00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:06,110
you can all see that I realized after I

00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:07,310
after I made the t-shirt that I probably

00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,600
should have like used the closure or

00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:13,670
something so I could do something else

00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:16,880
in the topic so dress appropriate for

00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:17,810
your audience and obviously conveyed a

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,860
message and away the audience are

00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,720
expecting to perceive it so if it's a

00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,400
work-related talk you might have to be a

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,540
bit more formal and yet loads of bullet

00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,470
points or whatever and pictures of

00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,110
people running over the finish line

00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:28,130
right in suits that's fine but if it's

00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:31,400
here you know you can have a bit more

00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:36,620
fun and this these are the slides from a

00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:38,660
talk I gave last year and talking about

00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,570
styles so these all have the same theme

00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:42,950
and these beautiful drawing to them by

00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:48,170
my daughter nobody says anything bad

00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:49,310
because his child and but also like they

00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:50,540
you know they all glued together they

00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,070
all looked like they all look the same

00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,570
and they all have the same characters in

00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:56,030
them and I went down really well

00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:58,040
actually probably got more activity on

00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:59,150
Twitter than my talk did I mean it

00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,490
certainly got more activity on Twitter

00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:02,900
and I talked it and so you know you can

00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,850
you can do something like that if you

00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,190
know if you if you want you can have a

00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:10,090
kind of a theme but

00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:11,830
be consistent with your style now the

00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:15,730
next thing the quantity that is

00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:18,640
absolutely awful sorry

00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:20,020
sorry yeah the end so what I want to

00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,330
talk about here are bullets and bullet

00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:24,550
points and this is obviously neo dodging

00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:26,830
bullets and I encourage you to do the

00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:28,000
same bullet points on your slides can

00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:29,740
kill the whole message

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,680
everyone gets bored they start reading

00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:34,030
your slides and coming back to the

00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,280
technical talks sometimes it is

00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:39,070
necessary sometimes you do need to list

00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,750
you know six or seven things on the

00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:44,020
screen or you need to put some text on

00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:45,580
there what I would say is if it's a lot

00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:47,770
of bullet points and you really can't

00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:49,330
get away from it do that thing the trick

00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:51,370
whether you know they brings one at a

00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:53,500
time so that means at least your

00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,030
audience are following along with you

00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,280
okay so you go and pull a point bullet

00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:59,350
point bullet point and if it's a lot of

00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,270
code what I would suggest you doing is

00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:03,610
fogging out the code that you're not

00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:05,200
talking about and just making the code

00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:07,150
that you're interested in in focus so

00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,620
you just move and you move the unfold

00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:10,000
bit up and down the screens while you're

00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,040
talking about it so you have that takes

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,020
a lot of more prep but it's worth doing

00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,710
and I would generally think about a

00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,720
three-second rule

00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:18,790
if you're putting text on there keep it

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,410
to like two three seconds max for people

00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:22,960
to read it if they're reading for more

00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:24,010
than three seconds you blown it right

00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,600
they're not listening to you anymore to

00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:28,210
read in your slides so use plenty of

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,470
text I would definitely do that and also

00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:31,210
what I would do is I would definitely

00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,530
not talk what's on the slide so the

00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:34,180
people are trying to read that or try to

00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:36,280
keep up with you this is gone for quite

00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,840
a long time you can sort of you really

00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,760
do like a 60 minute thing we just go on

00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,420
and on so I'm gonna stop that for a

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,450
second

00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:45,700
show of hands who is reading yeah

00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:47,590
probably everyone anyone heard me

00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:50,140
speaking yeah but actually heard what I

00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:51,220
said probably not right so you can't

00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,589
have two messages going on you don't

00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:56,620
wanna be competing with this okay this

00:14:53,589 --> 00:14:58,120
is your backdrop okay it's there to show

00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,620
you off you're the main you're the

00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,230
attracting your cup comb see then come

00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:06,400
see some slides and so just keep that in

00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:08,320
mind okay and this is the one key

00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,730
message I want to really come home with

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,589
everyone and it's the message I learned

00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:15,640
the hard way which is practice practice

00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:17,560
you talk as often as you can practice in

00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,220
any way you can even practice whatever

00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,269
works for you if you have a friend who

00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,850
since you don't practice in front to

00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:24,829
them if you just want to like mumble in

00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:27,259
front of your screen and just go through

00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:28,790
it like I do then that works too don't

00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,500
confuse practice with preparation

00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:32,360
preparation is getting your slides ready

00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,889
and getting your talk ready and getting

00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,290
your ideas together that's not the same

00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:37,459
as practicing that talk and practicing

00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:42,550
is the thing that will tell you where

00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:45,079
the cracks are and I've got a sort of

00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:47,149
kind of again a bit of a tough story and

00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:49,480
it's why one of the reasons I'm talking

00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:52,610
so much about this come back to that

00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,920
talk I gave last year and I had prepared

00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:56,420
I prepared a lot and I'd got my story

00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,000
together and I knew what I was going to

00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:01,279
talk about and I was at a conference and

00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,339
I had the closing slot which is really

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,959
pleased about and I prepared I've got my

00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:07,939
slides and I knew what I was going to

00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:10,029
say that's going to be great but I

00:16:07,939 --> 00:16:14,120
haven't practiced it the talks on Sunday

00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:15,949
like Sunday lunchtime Friday night we

00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,810
entered a hotel checked in where the

00:16:15,949 --> 00:16:19,370
conference was and then I went up to my

00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,750
room and I said oh now be really you

00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,829
know really should do this and I went

00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,649
through in a circling through it and

00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:27,290
panic I have 11 minutes of talk for 45

00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:29,329
minutes slot and it's not even a good 11

00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:31,129
minutes it's like it's pretty weak and

00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:34,129
and what I realized there was no story

00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:35,629
it was it was not a technical talk so he

00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:38,059
could have had a really nice story to

00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:40,279
had it isn't so I panicked rang my wife

00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:41,600
who's here probably and she like talked

00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:43,040
me through it and sort of said you've

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,079
got lots of time which is true I did

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,259
have a lot of time and you can you can

00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:50,720
remedy this so I I spend the rest of

00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:51,800
that evening do some deep breaths and

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,600
you know and then I start going through

00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,579
my slides and going through my talk and

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,410
going through the material and it was

00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:59,449
based on a book and read through some of

00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:00,620
that and when I went through and I went

00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:02,449
through and then the next day which was

00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:05,630
Saturday I did the same and right up

00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:08,480
until about 1:00 a.m. on Sunday night

00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:10,069
Monday morning and by then I felt okay

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,799
I've got it it's not perfect it's not

00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:15,650
what I wanted it's about 22 minutes but

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,909
I was prepared as I was going to get and

00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:18,589
it was as good it was gonna get and it

00:17:16,909 --> 00:17:20,240
was it was a good talk just a short one

00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:21,709
it was like I'm gonna say it's like a

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,959
TED Talks it was 20 minutes but it you

00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:26,780
know really I'd kind of I was I had a 45

00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:29,899
minute slot and I got away I got away it

00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:31,789
was a good talk I came across well and

00:17:29,899 --> 00:17:32,690
what I did was I came on and I I didn't

00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:35,419
say I didn't tell everything

00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:37,429
I've just told you but I did say this is

00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:38,539
gonna be a 20-minute talk you know I'm

00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:40,039
sorry it's not a little bit longer but

00:17:38,539 --> 00:17:42,019
that's that's what the material

00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:45,159
suggested which is blatant lie because I

00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:47,659
didn't practice and so I would say I

00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:49,850
would say practice because that will

00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:50,840
that will tell you how long your talk is

00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:52,129
they'll tell you if there's a structure

00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,419
I'll tell you what's missing it'll tell

00:17:52,129 --> 00:17:56,570
you if it all gels together if the order

00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:57,590
needs to change so I definitely aren't

00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,799
my lesson and I certainly wasn't

00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:04,399
practicing this just up to two hours ago

00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:10,470
okay is that too loud I can't turn it

00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:14,500
down okay can we try this

00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:18,580
[Music]

00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:21,470
okay I hope that doesn't ruin that so um

00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:24,880
I always like trying to have like funny

00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:27,290
moments in my talk okay and but I've

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,640
what I think is really really really

00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:30,080
important to learn is that you can't

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,360
like make it funny when you want it to

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,680
be funny but you can try and you can put

00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,940
the bits in in you know you hope people

00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,040
will laugh so I've got a message for

00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:38,390
anyone who's trying to sort of have have

00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,550
this like funny bits and you know to

00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:42,020
liven it up a bit don't worry people

00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:43,490
don't laugh out loud right there might

00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,410
be laughing they might be enjoying it

00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:47,300
just might not be like roaring but

00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:48,740
laughter that's the first thing second

00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,510
is the laugh at the wrong stuff and

00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:52,010
that's true right like my this fell off

00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:54,200
and you guys love that and that was

00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:55,670
great and if I had a slack notification

00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,800
go across now you'd all be like that's

00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:59,660
hilarious John and that's you know

00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,860
that's you can get you know you'll get

00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,720
those laughs and it's fine as long as

00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:04,070
the audience are enjoying it that's good

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,370
and this matter if maybe it's a little

00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:10,310
bit your expense and what I would say is

00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:12,680
don't sweat it too much and don't make

00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:14,450
it integral to the whole plot right

00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,740
because if you if you need to get a

00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:18,620
laugh somewhere in order for the next

00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:20,270
piece to work yeah you might be setting

00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,250
yourself up for fall depending on how

00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:27,950
you deliver it so that's that's my

00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:30,800
serious know about comedy okay so um so

00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:33,140
the next I have a community group of

00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,880
people online business people and so on

00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,110
and I asked them they'll some of them

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,120
public speaking and I sort of put a

00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:40,660
message out and I said would you have

00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,830
any advice and some filler slides for me

00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:44,510
for therefore the last segment of my

00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:46,310
talk and they said yeah absolutely and

00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:48,230
they gave me loads of advice and I've

00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:50,000
essentially cherry-picked the bits that

00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,200
coincide with the story that I'm trying

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,390
to tell to make it look like everyone

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,680
agrees with me and so then I connect to

00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:57,080
bits of that but these are a real quotes

00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,700
so think about the dramatic structure of

00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,590
your presentations again it comes back

00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,910
that point that you thought you're

00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:03,920
telling a story it's dramatic you can

00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:05,810
make it fun you can make it sad or

00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:10,100
whatever so just try and think about

00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:14,180
that and be as prepared as you possibly

00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:16,460
can be John so yeah definitely obviously

00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:18,320
spend that extra time getting ready make

00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:20,660
sure you're not reading your slides like

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,460
I am right now sorry about that and

00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:24,950
right now it's a really bad a point

00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:26,690
because the temptation is to put

00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:28,280
everything up here and then read it out

00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:30,020
and that's like super boring

00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,100
as you notice I've been over here and

00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,150
I've been looking at my slide that's way

00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,520
better and I'll see if you can get your

00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:36,440
screen up here better still right it's

00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,700
okay to have a flick of your slides it

00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,980
does come back to the rehearsal though

00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:45,980
the more you rehearse the less you'll

00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:47,180
need to look down there okay so this is

00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,440
great well our weapons if someone asked

00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:51,710
you a question and you don't know the

00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,330
answer and I think a lot of people like

00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:55,940
it panicked about this and someone's

00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:58,850
advice was pause breathe they said ask a

00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,620
clarifying question and then think like

00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:03,650
do you know that maybe you know the

00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:04,640
answer to this and then you know if you

00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,740
do obviously give the answer if you

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,850
don't then you have to have a bit of a

00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:11,450
game plan so that's what I would suggest

00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:13,280
have a game plan decide well first of

00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:15,290
all think of the killer questions that

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,730
you would hate to be asked like think

00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:18,920
about those write them down so what

00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:20,360
would I absolutely dread being asked

00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:23,570
right and down and work out what your

00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,860
answer is and that's you that could be a

00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:26,390
game plan your game plans I've got an

00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:28,730
answer for all of those have another

00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:30,050
slot for what if they ask me another

00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:33,410
question that I haven't thought of what

00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:35,510
am I going to say then or just don't

00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:37,730
allow questions no it's super easy right

00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:38,930
I hate being asked questions I'm not

00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,580
great thinking on the spot I'm really

00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,510
sorry my talk will not have any

00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:44,990
questions or you don't even say anything

00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:47,900
just don't ask any questions and don't

00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:49,940
say I'm so nervous and everyone's

00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:51,200
nervous someone asked me before are you

00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,610
nervous tonight like you've spoken

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,590
before yeah there was I'm still nervous

00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:56,960
you know nervous coming in it was weird

00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:58,820
being late and like on purpose and then

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,190
but still nervous because I wanted to

00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,030
get the talk started everyone gets

00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,200
nervous but it's fine

00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:06,050
everyone knows ever gets nervous you

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:10,190
need to point it out and it's fine just

00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:12,380
just like skip over that I'm up nope

00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:14,420
where are we there we go

00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,610
and I'm not a member of Toastmasters I

00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:18,920
know a few people who are and they

00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:20,570
recommended this great way of learning

00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,910
how to do public speaking so I can't

00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:25,550
give a any qualification on how good it

00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:27,020
is but my sister for example is a member

00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:28,250
and she's really good so think about

00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,870
that I think about you know if you if

00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:31,250
you want to do it a bit more frequently

00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:34,250
genital I don't know what you have to

00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:36,290
pay but look that stuff up and again

00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:38,650
rehearse rehearse rehearse talk to you

00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:41,400
book case talk you know talk to yourself

00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:44,730
no no you material inside happy really

00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:47,700
comfortable and familiar with it and now

00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:50,160
what is just whoa whoa there we go

00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:53,310
and I got obviously Oscar Wilde tweeted

00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,750
me as well and he said be yourself

00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:56,670
everyone else already taken that's Mike

00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:59,370
and again one of my other key pieces you

00:22:56,670 --> 00:23:02,310
can't be someone else up here you know

00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:04,110
you got to be yourself and it's great to

00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:05,760
emulate someone and to admire someone

00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:07,290
that you think is a great speaker and so

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,490
I'd like to be more like them and do you

00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,960
know try to be more like them but you

00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:11,490
are you and that's what people have come

00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:18,390
to see so you know be come through with

00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:19,800
that we're gonna open the floor and it's

00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:21,330
fine if you don't but does anyone here

00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:24,060
have got any kind of words of wisdom

00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:26,220
that they would give someone who is has

00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:27,690
never spoken before is thing about

00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:57,920
giving their first talk what would you

00:23:27,690 --> 00:24:03,930
say to them anyone know yeah cool

00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:06,420
anybody else I'm sitting at the back

00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:08,930
some of the time yeah yeah maybe else

00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,930
yeah

00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:45,730
yeah yeah it's really true I think

00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:47,080
they're also the you know if you if

00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:48,670
you've used a piece of technology it's

00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,230
something that not everyone has used and

00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:52,120
you struggle with it I think that story

00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:53,920
can be useful too but if you were given

00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,950
that like that detail in-depth talk

00:24:53,920 --> 00:25:17,500
about something knowing it back to front

00:24:55,950 --> 00:25:20,860
it's great yeah yeah yeah

00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:22,750
like and I went you know when I wanted

00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:24,310
to do public speaking I have the first

00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:26,440
thing I did which was the wrong thing

00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:28,090
was put like submit loads of talks to

00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:31,390
conferences and then I got knocked back

00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:32,560
and I knew the organizer so I said you

00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:33,820
know what advice would you give me said

00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:36,250

00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,580
record you know we're not going to put

00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:42,610
you up on the stage until you know we

00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:44,830
know you can speak properly and so you

00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:46,510
know get yourself down there and put

00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:47,800
yourself out and I'm practicing you

00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:49,270

00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:55,630
comfortable with it's just it's not like

00:25:52,540 --> 00:26:06,160

00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:56,200
congratulate yourself do something to

00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:58,180
mark the fact that you've done it even

00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,520
if it's just go for a meal or you know

00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:02,380
bring a friend or you know God forbid

00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:04,540

00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:10,330
like you know I'm happy with it and then

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,770
I would use some kind of you know for

00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:13,570
giggles to sort of agile and say well

00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:15,400
you know to be introspective about this

00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:17,710
and you know think about what could have

00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,120
gone better what went well right think

00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,420
about what you would do differently next

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,040
time

00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:23,260
they're really useful things don't just

00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:25,180
go yeah I did my best sir you don't even

00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:27,520
write it down like I did you know I did

00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:28,720
this this bit well I could have that

00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,310
could have been that could have been

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,660
definitely could have been stronger and

00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:33,520
if you've got a friend like a really

00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:35,740
good friend some you will be honest with

00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,850
you they're a great person you know and

00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:39,100
say look I really want you to tell me

00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:42,900
you know two things that could have

00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:47,350
improved on you know that's that's a

00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:49,510
super-duper bit and you know you can

00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:50,950
blog about it too so I say please

00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:52,480
definitely gimbop but you know put up

00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:57,190
their hair get my first talk and

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:59,740
whatever and so that's it really that's

00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:01,450
that's the end of my talk and you know

00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:02,950
I'm just going to say as I said before

00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,580
do speak about something you're really

00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:06,520
passionate about

00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:09,730
definitely structure your talk in that

00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:11,370
way in the in form of a story and

00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:14,050
practice practice practice you talk

00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:18,070
that's the a make any questions we

00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:19,690
haven't already asked I was way shorter

00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:32,560
than I thought as well as obviously

00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:34,510
brother yes I don't know I think like if

00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:36,790
people I pry into why you want to do

00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:38,080
public speaking because somebody's a

00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,880
little bit selfish you know you're

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:43,360
looking for your you promote yourself

00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:45,010
and your career and but you are giving

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,419
as well so it's like it's okay I think

00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:48,850
that's

00:28:46,419 --> 00:28:52,960
tricky area - like people really really

00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:54,309
like poking their u-turn but you know

00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,379
it's a bit self-congratulation about

00:28:54,309 --> 00:28:58,179
coming up and giving a talk but I think

00:28:56,379 --> 00:28:59,919
it's still a good thing to do on the

00:28:58,179 --> 00:29:02,080
whole people sometimes ask the question

00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,119
they know the answer to and they want to

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:10,659
see if you know the answer to it it's

00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:12,429
not charlie yeah I did definitely and I

00:29:10,659 --> 00:29:15,730
was that one at the daka conference I

00:29:12,429 --> 00:29:17,289
got asked I think he asked me about like

00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:17,799
why am I not on like native doctor or

00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:19,720
something

00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:21,429
I couldn't remember why I said but I was

00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,019
like oh is it ready yet I didn't know so

00:29:21,429 --> 00:29:25,059
I was like a bad answer like I should

00:29:23,019 --> 00:29:26,289
have I should have known that and be

00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:27,509
like I should have had my game plan

00:29:26,289 --> 00:29:29,649
together where I could have like gone

00:29:27,509 --> 00:29:31,359
yes sir I don't know I don't know just

00:29:29,649 --> 00:29:34,239
not go around to using it yet being

00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:36,999
honest I think being honest is and I did

00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:39,460
get another question and previous year

00:29:36,999 --> 00:29:40,899
and I can really remember the question

00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:42,159
but the answer I gave was can somebody

00:29:40,899 --> 00:29:43,690
else ask me a question I do know the

00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,059
answer to which I thought was reasonably

00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:49,119
good throw off you can definitely play

00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:50,919
that card once so it's worth giving that

00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:55,090
mind it's a back pocket while it's an

00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:55,970
emergency one that's it thank you very

00:29:55,090 --> 00:30:00,309
much

00:29:55,970 --> 00:30:00,309
