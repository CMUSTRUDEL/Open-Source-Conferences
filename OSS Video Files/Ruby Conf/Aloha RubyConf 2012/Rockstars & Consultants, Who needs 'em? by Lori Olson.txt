okay so i think we should probably get

00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:25,189
in your way welcome to rock stars and

00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:27,470
consultants who needs them I thought I'd

00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:31,240
start out just protect it with the odds

00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,240
you guys have seen enough cats right

00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:41,300
these are my dogs that said been given

00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:45,950
to save them again ok my name is Lori

00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:50,870
Dalton my twitter handle it is WND

00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:53,930
export and windex lord I keep a blog at

00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:55,969
Windex posters com yeah it hasn't

00:00:53,930 --> 00:01:00,309
updated for a while but i'm planning to

00:00:55,969 --> 00:01:03,649
do more I have a freelance developer

00:01:00,309 --> 00:01:07,190
mostly doing grounds 14 states but I

00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:11,740
also speak at conferences and I have

00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:14,950
done a few workshops first one was

00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:18,040
a ruby on rails for real there's a

00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:20,950
workshop focused on teaching rails to

00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:25,090
enterprise developers and then just last

00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:28,720
month we do workshop rails for iOS which

00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:30,490
is rails for iOS developers just focused

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:35,520
on the kinds of things that iOS

00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:41,130
developers might want so that's about me

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,130
the really consultants and rock stars

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:52,890
well I think actually you guys do and in

00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:57,880
fact everybody that hey there 0 nality

00:01:52,890 --> 00:02:00,970
TV series starting this fall dealing

00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:05,080
with Rockstar developers person I think

00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:08,140
that's kinda sick but the simple fact is

00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:11,380
at one time or another every shop is

00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:14,890
going to need a higher you that Rockstar

00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:20,079
developer or consultant come in hired

00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:26,010
been coaching or help quell the Rope

00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:30,269
question I think is not really why we

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:34,140
people it's why we continue to mean them

00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:38,340
and that's really the interesting part

00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:41,480
that I want to get it so before we get

00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:45,390
into that part let's talk about a bit of

00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:49,200
what actually makes a rock star rock

00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:52,709
star develop any of you guys ever been

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:57,810
called a rock star developer month that

00:02:52,709 --> 00:03:00,000
the panacea have a you know other other

00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,950
tags you've been applied to that you

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:09,780
know like being considered rock star how

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:11,549
the ninja yeah so these spots are

00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:17,700
developers these ninjas they know

00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:20,879
everything that is not just that they

00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:23,549
are self motivated learners they learn

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:27,680
new things because they enjoy learning

00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:30,389
new things they've done it all before

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:35,970
they've seen everything been there done

00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:39,019
that they are super productive once you

00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:40,950
hire them they'll get it done fast and

00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:43,200
get those

00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,980
is that you have a lot of the product

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,390
they'll be out the door before you know

00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:54,030
because now your superhero working out

00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:56,069
an adult another aspect of the rock star

00:03:54,030 --> 00:04:00,300
developer is that they have no fear

00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:03,300
don't technical fear their modern might

00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:05,819
be something like the difficult we do

00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:10,830
immediately the impossible might take a

00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:13,200
little longer okay so enough about rock

00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:16,260
star developers let's talk about

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:20,250
consultants but what is it that way

00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:24,660
higher consult or they come in a couple

00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:28,650
of different rides one of them is the

00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:32,220
expert they know one thing really really

00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:34,010
well they have deep knowledge of some

00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:39,320
critical piece of your infrastructure

00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:39,320
your technology stack and you need that

00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:46,410
sometimes they know hard things the

00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:50,669
stuff that your team doesn't have time

00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:53,060
to do how to my database how to scale in

00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:56,900
your ass up to those five million

00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,850
suddenly have these are the problems

00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,310
that your team might think is a little

00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:07,070
too hard to tackle on their own so

00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:10,220
you're bringing the expert awesome these

00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:11,990
experts are not just individuals they

00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:15,880
might be part of the group a consultancy

00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:19,810
and the consultancy has other advantages

00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:22,720
they have a really deep knowledge pool

00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:25,850
because they have all their colleagues

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,880
volunteer so individually they may not

00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:31,850
be experts in everything but

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:36,260
collectively and consultancy can be

00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:40,820
expert in absolutely ever and that's

00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:44,570
what groups like that works do

00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:49,700
patch rocket guys I've got come on help

00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:51,890
you so now let me know what Rockstar

00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:56,120
developers you like what consultancy if

00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:58,910
your life if they're so great why would

00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:02,090
you not want to hire or why would we

00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:07,040
want to you know get rid of them after a

00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:09,320
while well there are some downsides to

00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:12,740
having rockstar developers and

00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:17,440
consultants will start off with the

00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:19,490
rockstar developers one of the risks is

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,280
that I get bored

00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:24,250
these self motivated learners if there's

00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:28,430
nothing new for them to learn anymore

00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:32,919
they get bored next new exciting

00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:43,280
opportunity comes along they run away or

00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:44,810
worse they don't run so another problem

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,620
with your Rockstar developers it's

00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:52,909
Burnett they know everything they do

00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:55,880
everything and so they do everything

00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:59,840
they work insane hours and then they

00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:02,180
burn out I don't know how many of you

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:05,930
guys know desert but last year this is

00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:08,659
one of his tweets and you know the guy

00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:12,530
who died because he was at extreme

00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:14,350
levels of burnet so this isn't something

00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:21,670
that you want to do

00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:26,130
sir another one of the risks for rock

00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:32,680
stars is what I like to refer to as the

00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:36,190
illusion of the big pan if you hire a

00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:38,470
rock star promise to pay them you know

00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:40,810
gazillion dollars you get them the big

00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:45,220
stock options and then you fail to

00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:47,020
deliver that promptly building some

00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,330
other opportunity will come along that

00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:51,640
big payoff being dangled in front of

00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:56,620
them and then walk out the door chasing

00:07:51,640 --> 00:08:00,580
it or maybe we'll succeed in delivering

00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:06,670
that big pad suddenly they have great

00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:09,580
big bags of cash Bailey this is the

00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:13,180
problem with the big pal it's great for

00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:17,160
rockstar developers it really is it's a

00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:17,160
lose-lose for the campaign

00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:25,740
okay one of the other risks everybody

00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:29,279
else jokes about this right get hit by a

00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:35,310
bus what if that title key person they

00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:38,539
hired gets here by lies that's you know

00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,539
sort of a bad thing

00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:47,939
because all of a sudden their time and I

00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,939
didn't know what to do

00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:56,990
another problem with Rockstar developers

00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:58,499
is that they do tend to have a type I

00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:03,179
just say

00:08:58,499 --> 00:09:05,869
they're not all like this but the

00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:08,609
official definition of printed on up

00:09:05,869 --> 00:09:12,029
someone who behaves in a demanding

00:09:08,609 --> 00:09:14,819
awesome temperamental fashion revealing

00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:18,809
an inflated view of themselves their

00:09:14,819 --> 00:09:22,459
talent in their importance yeah ever

00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:22,459
encountered anybody like that

00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:31,420
the last click on these the Rockstar

00:09:27,939 --> 00:09:34,120
someone who answers an ad for rockstar

00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:40,050
developer position they know what their

00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:42,939
work they don't come cheap now

00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:45,930
consultants on the other hand are using

00:09:42,939 --> 00:09:45,930
wildly expensive

00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:54,749
they will lack buy-in for your company

00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:58,050
they won't have the knowledge of your

00:09:54,749 --> 00:10:00,899
business they won't know about your

00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:03,990
operational limits they won't really

00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:10,999
care about your launcher plants they're

00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:13,430
there for their contract then of course

00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:17,839
another problem

00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:20,240
is the old bait switch we're hiring for

00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:25,580
extra cheese and they have that

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:27,500
expertise but was busy somewhere else so

00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:29,700
they send in the

00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:34,310
because you don't think you call on

00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,310
those other actors that's not really

00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:45,249
another problem it can have is culture

00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:49,949
clash I also think of this it's sort of

00:10:45,249 --> 00:10:53,619
a includes mismatch between consultants

00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:56,679
and your team the way they look at

00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:59,670
problems and solutions the way your team

00:10:56,679 --> 00:11:01,899
wants or problems and solutions can be

00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:04,239
different the most kinds of

00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:06,989
communications problems can be kind of

00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:06,989
difficult to manage

00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:15,170
you may not have their consultants

00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:17,420
complete fuck-ups it's entirely possible

00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:20,450
that they're not just working for you

00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:25,270
they may have two three four other jobs

00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:25,270
on the go at the same time is that stick

00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:33,059
and of course if you have their complete

00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:36,720
focus if they're just working for you

00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:39,749
you can have other problems most

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,480
taxation agencies will start looking at

00:11:39,749 --> 00:11:46,949
your company needs Leslie if you hire

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:49,390
consultants they start calling that

00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:53,380
personal services contract

00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:56,710
and you're going to get audited and

00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:59,110
they're gonna communicate because then

00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:01,570
sell even really a consultant they're

00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:05,560
really an employee and patently King

00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:09,059
them or the cabinet properly and that is

00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:13,129
he dressed as a consultant myself I

00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:13,129
I have to dance around that

00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:24,270
so the primary risk though is one that

00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:27,550
comes with both of these is that when

00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:32,440
consultants contract is over when that

00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:35,520
rock star gets their new opportunity to

00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:39,400
take all that knowledge block out see

00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:41,950
that neurologist is really employer

00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:46,560
compli assets and how can you get I can

00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:46,560
walk out the door this problem

00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,950
so

00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,610
since I'm telling you these things are

00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,610
bad

00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:58,630
my son started

00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:07,470
have a great time that's finger I chose

00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:18,130
a little puppy I think that's all

00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:24,040
come on dance cute oh they're so i think

00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:26,830
that people companies startups don't

00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:34,660
really spend enough time thinking about

00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:38,790
growing their team growing it or yen not

00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:44,700
just adding additional warm bodies but

00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:44,700
improving leveling up your entire team

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:55,209
the first step towards leveling up your

00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:55,209
team is knowing your kings and again

00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:59,930
I can tell you that most companies don't

00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:05,529
spend enough time doing the people that

00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:09,310
work for are they single by the American

00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:15,190
are they workaholics they work on like

00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:15,190
the dad kids about pets

00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:23,910
you can have a teen parents maybe they

00:14:20,749 --> 00:14:26,790
have noses disability

00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:34,070
none of these things are to be

00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:37,160
discriminated bad or a bad thing

00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:41,690
like people get married people have kids

00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:45,200
it just is but you need to know these

00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:49,220
things so that you can slot people in to

00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:53,950
the most effective places and so that

00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:53,950
you know what some of their limitations

00:14:54,230 --> 00:15:01,340
we'll get back to that another thing

00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:05,780
they really need to know is your entire

00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:09,980
technology stack your ecosystem you've

00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:12,830
got to have the stuff down this is one

00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:15,410
of the things that most companies don't

00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:18,920
spend enough time thinking back it's how

00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:23,830
many things you need to know let's take

00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:30,190
for example your typical rails

00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:33,620
application n 10 so starting with

00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:39,830
development starting with just the

00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:41,809
basics we have to okay well it's not

00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:45,059
just leave you

00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:49,199
it's Ruby and it's JavaScript it's

00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:56,339
CoffeeScript and when you talk about

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:58,139
movie is it like MRI jruby Phineas have

00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:59,819
you got all the projects a new project

00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:02,279
maybe you've got something back at one

00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:06,959
point eight point nine you're going to

00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:11,160
know these differences are you use a

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:16,889
rail Sinatra or maybe now you moving

00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:26,299
forward backbone angular are using your

00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:29,500
beeper half sacks CSS let's start at

00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:32,930
javascript the comfy skirt

00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:36,949
so we're doing testing are we using mini

00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:40,670
test test unit r-spec are we using the

00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:43,519
mocking framework mocha flex month using

00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:48,350
factor drill are you doing integration

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:53,810
or acceptance tests do you know cucumber

00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:59,290
capybara web rag how about doing your

00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:59,290
client side test and using that

00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:13,980
more client-side testing for scalability

00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:16,380
like browsing on browser staff how about

00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:19,650
just your basic developer tool stack

00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:22,650
your operating system your editors your

00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:25,140
version control your debuggers your

00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:31,140
profilers your continuous integration

00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:34,850
tool ok that was just a dominant haven't

00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,850
even got deploy your app

00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:41,270
on the deployment side you may be on a

00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:43,460
completely different operating system

00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:47,240
developing undermount problem most

00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:49,580
likely deploying on linux and how about

00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:52,700
your database setting up and configuring

00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:54,710
a production database is a whole thing

00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:58,760
setting up and configuring it about the

00:17:54,710 --> 00:18:01,510
database for basic the toys are you

00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:05,540
doing it on Heroku which is great and

00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:07,310
use that really fast or do you have

00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:11,540
other constraints you can't go there

00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:13,760
maybe need to have a big guess what

00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:17,690
linux distro are you use what kind of

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:19,760
hardware how much memory Jenny how much

00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:23,480
hard disk or you can have raid

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:28,510
configuration how about a firewall all

00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:31,170
this it's apart of all your office

00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:35,730
managing all that acteristic

00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:37,980
you got backups monitoring analytics

00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:42,690
these are all things that you need to

00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:45,870
know all things that if you hired that

00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:49,650
Rockstar that they need to know honestly

00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:52,290
do you think even a rockstar can keep on

00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:55,640
top of every single one of those

00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:58,800
technologies that's part of your staff

00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:02,040
frankly I think that that can be done

00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:04,950
for a few pieces of the staff can't

00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:10,350
honestly say you are on top of

00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:13,190
everything that's going on across an

00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,190
entire development

00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:19,840
anything if you do have to guide the

00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:21,580
destiny you keep them at it for couple

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,859
years and he's not going to look like

00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:25,859
that anymore because you look like that

00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:38,739
okay so now that I explained that you

00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:41,980
have way too many things for people to

00:19:38,739 --> 00:19:46,389
actually stay on top of let's talk about

00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:50,230
train guts been a little bit of time

00:19:46,389 --> 00:19:52,090
training maybe you're intending yourself

00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:55,629
you need to spend some time training

00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:59,169
yourself part of the company we need to

00:19:55,629 --> 00:20:02,619
train your step this is part of the

00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:05,009
whole organic growth of thing training

00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:05,009
this cow

00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:14,119
and it's not just about money often

00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:16,099
spend a little too much time

00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:18,109
when it comes down to training thinking

00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:20,779
about how much it's going to cost on the

00:20:18,109 --> 00:20:24,589
terms and hard dollars to pay Fred

00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:28,879
Forbes go across friends that's just one

00:20:24,589 --> 00:20:32,749
part of the cops time is an equally

00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:35,929
important part of training because

00:20:32,749 --> 00:20:40,549
unless you get the people time to both

00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:44,809
learn and sword and try out what they've

00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:47,899
been trained in then half of the value

00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:50,269
of the training its waste these people

00:20:47,899 --> 00:20:53,139
don't remember if you haven't given the

00:20:50,269 --> 00:20:53,139
time to absorb

00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:01,429
there's also different types of learning

00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:01,429
and training out there

00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:09,120
RT if you don't know your team you won't

00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:14,940
know what the most effective way of

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:21,480
training their self learning types of

00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:25,050
training web-based screencasts people

00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:27,540
can read books are all types of cell

00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:30,120
phone there's more formal types of

00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:35,510
learning where you can go away of course

00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:39,590
it is like pragmatic studio extend along

00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:39,590
certifications I know everybody

00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:47,060
the one where I have to

00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:47,060
and database

00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:52,660
and worse

00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:56,630
it is a great learning experience

00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:08,970
another way to level up is you don't

00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:12,809
just stand the person to a conference or

00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:18,830
to a core pay for some sort of online

00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:18,830
learning and just gabbing person

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:25,140
you want to spread that out across your

00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:30,510
team it multiplies the effect of that

00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:30,510
making that training purchase that

00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:38,930
anyone taking training should know that

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:43,450
it is their obligation to come back pass

00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:43,450
on that on to the rest of the team

00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:47,530
now one of the ways you can do this by

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,750
hacking stuff like lunch and learns

00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:51,890
that's what we do with in place where

00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:56,070
I'm working right now

00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:59,400
there's also barking those are fun here

00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:00,600
we go back to building came again if you

00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:06,320
have a whole bunch of married people

00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:08,360
kids bark in there

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:13,639
lunch and learn on the other hand feel

00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:16,340
like that on the other hand have a whole

00:23:13,639 --> 00:23:26,059
bunch of single workaholics barcamp all

00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:29,509
the way but this is the real problem

00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:32,110
that a lot of places happen but if I

00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:32,110
spend all that

00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:42,360
simple man

00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:49,690
replacing an unhappy developer is almost

00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:53,859
always going to cost the company more

00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:56,809
than doing what it takes to keep it up

00:23:53,859 --> 00:23:59,679
happy and keep

00:23:56,809 --> 00:23:59,679
now that sounds

00:24:03,149 --> 00:24:08,350
and it's not just in terms of you know

00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:11,650
beings out to the head

00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:15,200
enters its the amount of time it costs

00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:20,090
the investment

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:22,429
to replace a people yes Apollo so do

00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:27,880
what it takes to keep the people don't

00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:31,279
cheap out stuff like training because

00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:36,950
someone feels value if they think you're

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:40,220
investing they actually

00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:42,680
i've seen them sell for you people that

00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:45,020
think that their company values them

00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:48,500
enough to send them on that training

00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:52,430
course to let me take from their job to

00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:56,030
do you know self-paced learning I filled

00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:58,310
out they don't feel like they're just

00:24:56,030 --> 00:25:00,860
can out another worn by down in the

00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:08,950
trenches another replaceable cotton

00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:08,950
machine I think that care and that value

00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:21,120
that helps increase engagement so I know

00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:21,120
I feel engaged in a project

00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:24,720
yes

00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:33,280
say hey don't know about this new

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:36,550
technology white and go on a course pay

00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:40,630
for the screencast whatever take some

00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:44,560
time learn it that it's a nice feeling

00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:46,690
to engagement and we need engaged every

00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:51,960
single member of the team needs to be

00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:51,960
engaged and needs to feel ownership

00:25:53,770 --> 00:26:00,300
and one of the ways to get people to

00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:03,480
feel ownership is to start divvying up

00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:07,620
responsibilities those rockstars

00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:11,710
shouldn't be responsible for everything

00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:14,590
you need to start slicing dicing up some

00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:17,040
of those pieces of the staff and making

00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:21,820
sure other people have those

00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:24,010
responsibilities not everyone

00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:29,200
expert in every single piece of the

00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:34,230
stack so split it up make sure that you

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:37,450
have a primary and a secondary person

00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:41,040
through each piece that is part of your

00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:41,040
critical technologies

00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:45,750
because

00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:48,530
when you have that whole hit by a bus

00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:52,200
thing or you know something more simple

00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:54,630
maybe they're just on vacation we want

00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:58,290
to actually you know get a break on

00:26:54,630 --> 00:27:09,180
vacation and not be on call every single

00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:10,940
day their way maybe they're big by hand

00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:13,460
eternity

00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:15,470
as people walk away for a while you

00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,910
don't want to be solely dependent

00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:20,240
something that's going to disappear for

00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:23,240
a while if you have a secondary they

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:29,150
could step up and start taking on

00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:31,429
sibility but just declaring your primary

00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:34,010
your secondary your primer your

00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:37,490
secondary isn't really enough you need a

00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:41,780
little bit more than that okay you need

00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:47,660
to convince developers that they need to

00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:51,400
participate okay if I participate I mean

00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:57,260
while most developers the kind of

00:27:51,400 --> 00:28:00,940
introverts probably notice that but you

00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:05,559
can't just sit back and say yeah I'm

00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:05,559
primary and

00:28:06,509 --> 00:28:14,489
if that's not getting out there are

00:28:11,449 --> 00:28:17,070
hundreds thousands of resources of there

00:28:14,489 --> 00:28:22,379
on the web for various pieces of

00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:25,649
technology use them there will be

00:28:22,379 --> 00:28:30,599
mailing list there will be blogs you

00:28:25,649 --> 00:28:34,469
will have Twitter accounts they might

00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:39,089
have an IRC chat channel maybe a Google

00:28:34,469 --> 00:28:43,529
form make sure your people get out there

00:28:39,089 --> 00:28:47,879
and start participating maybe they start

00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:50,159
off by just lurking for a while that's

00:28:47,879 --> 00:28:52,409
fine because we don't really know much

00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:55,919
and you're just starting at lurking is

00:28:52,409 --> 00:28:58,859
how you learn and after you've learned

00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:03,179
for a while maybe you start to ask

00:28:58,859 --> 00:29:04,730
questions after you've learned a little

00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:07,970
bit more you start

00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:12,049
answer first this is wearing a real

00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:16,860
give-and-take participation size this is

00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:20,350
how you stand hot under bits and pieces

00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:25,590
the whole point is to make the effort to

00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:29,140
stay on top no issues what are the bugs

00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:33,870
would it mean compatibilities are there

00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:36,090
stability is really being a primary

00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:38,780
that's responsible for some

00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:41,360
that you have to know this thing

00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:42,980
and as a primary for something do you

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:47,180
need to be the one that plans for

00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:51,080
upgrades unless your tool is completely

00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:53,480
static and that smells so be careful if

00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:57,640
it doesn't ever change that may be a

00:29:53,480 --> 00:30:02,140
problem you will need to manage updates

00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:07,900
that means going out participating

00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:11,640
yes none right make a branch start using

00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:14,620
the beta test get an idea of what impact

00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,540
if you need a second opinion hey you've

00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:18,090
got your second here we get them to

00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:20,620
where

00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:23,830
and once you've been using that beta

00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:25,900
test he'll be well situated to news

00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:28,750
release candidate when it comes out and

00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:33,790
what position to move to it as soon as

00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:36,940
it stable and once you start doing all

00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:40,510
of that maybe we should start thinking

00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:44,140
about as open source we can start

00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:46,800
contributing the contributing back if my

00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,800
public service

00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:55,809
honestly the conference center

00:30:51,309 --> 00:30:59,889
every year is using some piece of open

00:30:55,809 --> 00:31:03,159
source software I think it is damn shame

00:30:59,889 --> 00:31:07,870
helping people actually true back thank

00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:10,360
you spend a little time if you're

00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:14,649
becoming one of these primary

00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:17,499
responsibility spend the time come and

00:31:14,649 --> 00:31:19,690
expert you'll start to milk will start

00:31:17,499 --> 00:31:23,850
to see things you'll be able to fix

00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:23,850
those buttons we should do

00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:28,000
and your company should start

00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:35,260
thing I come back to that a lot don't

00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:41,590
all of this that takes time and I will

00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:44,830
not ever say that it doesn't but I will

00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:50,670
say that you need to factor that in to

00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:50,670
sustain okay we're all doing well

00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:58,969
we all aspire to be doing adult Felton

00:31:54,590 --> 00:32:04,099
right a sustainable pace is what you can

00:31:58,969 --> 00:32:07,580
do not I work tons of overtime not by

00:32:04,099 --> 00:32:10,129
working every weekend but working you

00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:13,960
know solidly every day at a sustainable

00:32:10,129 --> 00:32:18,109
case you need factor in stuff like

00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:23,049
training and developing expertise in

00:32:18,109 --> 00:32:23,049
your tool set into your sustainable

00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:34,280
it's also important to have you got all

00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:39,440
this set up to not allow the team to

00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:41,270
stay fine you know there's really cool

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:46,660
pieces of technology out there that you

00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:46,660
using there's also once they are using

00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:54,540
crafty downright unpleasant to you

00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:56,820
if you're the primary day and doing that

00:32:54,540 --> 00:33:00,390
week after week month after month year

00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:03,140
after year that that's not too Pleasant

00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:07,770
it's what you should probably try to do

00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:10,370
start rotating responsibility 15 after

00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:13,520
someone's been primary

00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:17,090
massive for a while get the chance to

00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:22,059
switch it let their secondary step up be

00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:22,059
primary for a while and let them go

00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:31,010
because then you don't want those

00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:33,950
developers to get bored and frustrated

00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:36,340
whole point of this is to make people be

00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:36,340
engaged

00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:41,559
so I think

00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:46,919
I started to answer a bit about what I

00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:51,720
think growing your team

00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:55,380
means it means training

00:33:51,720 --> 00:34:00,450
it means getting to participate

00:33:55,380 --> 00:34:04,710
and it means developing expertise and in

00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:09,870
fact I think all of those for a kind of

00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:13,470
virtuous circle and if you do enough of

00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:15,030
this for long enough it's like applying

00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:18,659
continuous improvement to your

00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:21,690
development team and that is how you

00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:24,889
grow to to something better all the rock

00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:24,889
stars and consultants

00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:33,840
fittingly the sayings

00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,840
we do it

00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,490
yes this is

00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:46,490
this is what I get every day at the end

00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:46,490
of the day ok so that's it

00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:53,870
there's my contact info I have the

00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:58,550
slides all folks pit already out

00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:58,550
but we have any questions

00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,850
we're dead

00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,890
