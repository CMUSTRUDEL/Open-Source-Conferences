thanks everybody for coming today I'm

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,720
going to talk about the great new threat

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,869
to our livelihoods which is designers

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,270
and hopefully I'll convince you that you

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:28,619
don't need to have some kind of genetic

00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:30,210
predisposition and some kind of gene

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:32,430
that makes you naturally artistic to be

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,440
able to do good design but it's actually

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,329
something that you can learn and apply

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,960
some critical thinking too and some

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:41,399
basic math and design isn't about sorry

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,680
the design will exist within a framework

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,240
of rules that you can apply and it can

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,860
be learned and that implied in a

00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,570
structured manner but first I want to

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,400
take you back to a conversation I had

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,950
earlier this year which proved to be the

00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,660
inspiration for this particular talk it

00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,460
was made me realize that if I continued

00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,690
doing things the way I always been doing

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,170
them that I probably wouldn't have a

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:03,900
career for much longer now this is the

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,360
kanji for wazza which is the japanese

00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,979
word for art and technique it's also the

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,500
name of the event that we attended

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,390
earlier this year specifically talking

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,090
about art and technique as it applied to

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,020
application development and throughout

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,939
the day I had a number of conversations

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,649
with a bunch of people who consider

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,380
themselves to be part of the application

00:01:19,649 --> 00:01:24,389
development lifecycle but there was one

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:31,229
in particular that really struck with me

00:01:24,389 --> 00:01:36,149
and that was someone called J and J was

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:38,420
there as a designer he fine up from LA

00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:40,649
to San Francisco to attend the event and

00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:42,270
our two career paths couldn't have been

00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:43,950
any more different I'd come to

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,659
application development from something

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:50,310
closer to a maths and science background

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:53,100
Jay had a history in a film and art and

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,869
design and we're talking about art and

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,659
technique and how that applied to our

00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:59,189
particular professions and we started

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,749
talking about craftsmanship and what

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:02,639
that meant and how we recognize

00:02:00,749 --> 00:02:07,380
craftsmanship in the work of our peers

00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:09,360
and despite our different backgrounds we

00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,150
had a great shared appreciation for

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,610
those that took great care and precision

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,770
in their craft and we talked about what

00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,020
that really meant and I talked about how

00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,660
I admired engineers who wrote code where

00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,400
it was read

00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:25,600
where the intention was clear where the

00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:29,080
value of what was being done there was

00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:31,090
obvious and that I know expanded on the

00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,860
virtues of computer science and 0 0

00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,090
desire and all these things that I held

00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,640
did my heart that I thought was

00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,080
important but Jay talked about other

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,700
issues when he was talking about

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,440
evaluating his peers and what

00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,680
craftsmanship meant to him and he talked

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,020
about how simple interfaces simplicity

00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,910
in design applications are catered to

00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:51,400
novice and expert users alike and

00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:54,490
applications that made novice users feel

00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:57,070
like experts and we had an appreciation

00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:58,660
for our own definitions and each other's

00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:01,090
definitions of craftsmanship but it

00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:06,700
wasn't a shared definition when we were

00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:08,830
plying into our peers and here we are at

00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,760
an event that was tailored to people's

00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,710
they both consider themselves

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,020
application developers or part of that

00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:15,190
process and we had these two very

00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:19,870
different definitions and what that

00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:22,210
actually meant and at first I was kind

00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,800
of maybe a bit conceited maybe a little

00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:26,290
bit smug and I thought it was basically

00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:29,410
Jays naivety it not experienced enough

00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:31,360
he was too green to new hadn't really

00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,100
built real applications didn't

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,620
understand the value of the stuff that I

00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,720
put in there and long term I knew I'd we

00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,580
now my stuff was more important because

00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,260
the ultimate maintainability of that

00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:43,300
code base and being able to iterate on

00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,670
that product meant that you had to care

00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,980
about the stuff that I cared about and

00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:50,080
eventually I'd probably prove him right

00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:52,330
but the more we talked about it the more

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,270
I realized that was really short sighted

00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:56,970
in my part we both ultimately wanted the

00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:59,709
exact same things and that was to build

00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:01,600
products that people loved not sort of

00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:03,040
one-hit wonders or gimmicky little tools

00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,470
that people play with and forgot about

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,940
the products are made a lasting

00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,920
impression on the users that they wanted

00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,920
to come back and use day in day out that

00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,030
they felt they depended on entirely and

00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,070
given that we wanted the same thing it

00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:16,600
just didn't make much sense that we had

00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,459
such different views on it and then I

00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,030
realized it was basically just down to

00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:23,169
the way we prioritized how we got there

00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:24,940
and when I thought about that and I

00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:27,940
thought about my motivations I realized

00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:30,010
that at its core it was a difference

00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,729
between being very intrinsically

00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:33,339
motivated

00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:34,809
all the stuff that I cared about when I

00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:37,509
was talking about what craftsmanship

00:04:34,809 --> 00:04:41,409
meant to me was stuff that would impact

00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:43,270
my life I wanted readable code and clear

00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:45,879
code so that when I came back to it it

00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:47,169
was easy for me to read I wanted loose

00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:49,059
coupling the single responsibility

00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:50,979
principle so that when the customer

00:04:49,059 --> 00:04:54,759
changed their mind it was easy for me to

00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:56,319
refactor that code J on the other hand

00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:58,300
when he was talking about the stuff he

00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:59,589
cared about he's talking about how he

00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,770
wanted to have an interface it was

00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:04,870
intuitive for the user he wanted to use

00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:06,339
her to instantly feel like an expert he

00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,830
wanted the user to be impressed by the

00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:10,330
product I was being really selfish in

00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,830
what it was that I cared about in with

00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,569
the products that I was building and I'd

00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,649
escalated my own needs above those of

00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:17,080
the users that I was meant to be

00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:19,240
building it for and the fact of the

00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,559
matter was that the number of people

00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,210
that are exposed to the stuff that I

00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:23,949
cared about I could probably count on my

00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,899
fingers it was like me and maybe some

00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:28,449
other developers whereas the stuff that

00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:29,589
J cared about was much more impactful it

00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:30,969
meant that he you know if that product

00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:33,460
was successful it would hopefully be

00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:37,749
experienced by hundreds thousands

00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:39,520
potentially millions of users and before

00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:41,080
I got too depressed thinking that line

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,009
of thinking I realized that developers

00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,569
have built some pretty amazing stuff and

00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:48,009
our priorities haven't always been wrong

00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:49,779
and which made the lives as thousands of

00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:53,649
other developers easier in the process

00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:55,569
of improving our own tools we've created

00:05:53,649 --> 00:05:57,999
tools and frameworks that continually

00:05:55,569 --> 00:06:01,930
drive the cost of taking an idea to

00:05:57,999 --> 00:06:03,729
market ever closer to 0 and 10 years ago

00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:06,039
the very idea that something like rails

00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:08,379
rumble could exist that in the space of

00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:11,259
48 hours you could conceive of something

00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:13,749
design it build it deploy it and

00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:15,669
potentially in that 48-hour window have

00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:19,389
a real business but that was completely

00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:22,029
inconceivable and along the way we've

00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:25,029
pretty much fixed deployment which was

00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:27,339
when I looked back 15 years ago a major

00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:29,680
pain it was such a pain that he could

00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:31,029
also maybe put a case forward that one

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,919
of their first attempts to solve this

00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:34,990
problem was the invention of a content

00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:36,939
management system deployment was so

00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,889
difficult that we basically tried to

00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:40,539
avoid it at all costs we built systems

00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:40,950
and frameworks that allowed the user to

00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:42,750
make

00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:44,550
changes to the application and the

00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,170
information that was presented so that

00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:49,590
we didn't have to deploy those changes

00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:51,930
and then I'm assuming most people here

00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:54,990
at some point in their career discovered

00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:59,940
rails and with rails we got introduced

00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:01,740
to Capistrano from Jonas bark and what

00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,810
Capistrano meant was that with just a

00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,910
little bit of upfront investment from

00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,980
the developer so you'd set up apache or

00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:11,760
whatever web server using create the

00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:13,170
correct directory hierarchy put some

00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,880
configuration scripts in your rails up

00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:17,340
and now you can deploy your code with

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,170
two words and that was great because in

00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,300
addition to pushing your code out into

00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,710
production you also got version control

00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,390
and release management and all these

00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:31,470
extra benefits you didn't actually have

00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:33,690
before now this is Kubat and anybody

00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:35,130
who's seen any told from anyone from

00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:37,860
github has probably been introduced to

00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:40,320
who but who buds taste basically just a

00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:43,320
chat program he sits in campfire and

00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,850
responds to commands and the thing of

00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,040
that view bot is and the way github of

00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:50,250
integrated it is that committing a

00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,780
change into version control gives it to

00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,490
like a branch that you bought then has

00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:57,390
access to and then deploying your code

00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:59,010
in github is simply saying deploy so the

00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,570
barrier to entry for deploying a

00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,220
production system if you work at github

00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:06,090
is being able to interface with a chat

00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:08,340
program and other companies have rolled

00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:10,410
similar solutions it's not completely

00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,420
unheard of to have a continuous

00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:13,830
integration server where tests are run

00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,690
automatically every time a commute is

00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:17,520
done and if those tests pass they

00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:20,460
automatically deployed to a production

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,410
or a staging server but what we see here

00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:26,040
is these trends that mean that we're all

00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:28,680
sort of converging on a very similar

00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:31,440
path here and here oq is another example

00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,000
of this version control save your

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,710
changes if you want to push them out to

00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,650
a production instance it's get push

00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:40,410
heroku master so what this convergence

00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:43,919
is is that deployment now has basically

00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:45,150
been reduced to version control everyone

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,640
has version control as part of their

00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:50,510
day-to-day work flow now and deploying

00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:52,950
the code isn't anything special anymore

00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:54,150
it's basically non-existent if you know

00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,040
how to do version control

00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:58,290
chances are in most companies these days

00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,060
that is also how you manage deployment

00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:02,970
it's not a whole separate process that

00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:05,010
you need to think about anymore which

00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:11,220
brings me back to how this is a little

00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:13,950
relevant to Jay Jay's continually been

00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,810
evolving his skills over the years once

00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,460
upon a time he'd just do a mock-up in

00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,650
Photoshop and throw it over to a

00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:22,200
developer to implement and I was that

00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:23,640
kind of developer I'd take the Photoshop

00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,340
mock-ups and I'd slice and dice them

00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,860
into images and HTML and do the CSS and

00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:31,260
then I present that work for Jay to then

00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,120
present back to the client but over time

00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,740
Jay found that wasn't terribly effective

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,320
way to be working and so he taught

00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,670
himself some HTML and CSS and that

00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,920
enabled him to sit down with the

00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:42,210
customer and iterate on the product he

00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,190
could do the mock-ups let them

00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:46,260
experience it live within their own web

00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:48,920
browser comment on what didn't didn't

00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:51,360
work see them using a real sort of

00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,130
implementation of that app and iterate

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,540
upon it much much more quickly than he

00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:57,090
could if I was involved in the process

00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,560
but then still those things would come

00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:00,300
over to me and I'd integrate them into

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,250
rails or whatever PHP or whatever

00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,450
languages using at the time and I would

00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:07,860
deploy those changes out to production

00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:09,570
for him but then Jay wanted to sort of

00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,070
show a richer experience of the customer

00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:12,750
that wasn't necessarily representative

00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:15,150
of what they'd be using at the end of

00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,740
the day so he taught himself some basic

00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:19,020
JavaScript and that so he could do some

00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:21,030
inline form validation show some real

00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,530
time feedback some animation on the page

00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:24,810
a little bit of jQuery here and there to

00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:27,540
spruce things up given the user a much

00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:29,130
more richer experience but then all

00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,390
those files would still come over to me

00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:33,090
and I would still deploy them for

00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:36,540
someone like Jay but then something

00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:38,850
happened Jay discovered nodejs and now

00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,350
his limited JavaScript ability which

00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:42,510
over the course of a few years had

00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:44,820
actually grown considerably meant that

00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:47,100
he could now do a much more rich web app

00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:49,950
experience show the transition through

00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:52,440
various pages persist data show state

00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:54,960
changes this whole little demo app thing

00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,400
this way of iterating on the app that he

00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,440
devised over the years meant that he

00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,390
actually had a working application on

00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,130
his machine in him now didn't need me to

00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:04,620
code up all the rail stuff anymore he

00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:06,339
just needed me to deploy it except that

00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,439
he doesn't really

00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:09,699
is jay learned a few years ago that get

00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:11,470
was actually really handy especially

00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:12,910
when you're sitting down dealing with

00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,920
the customer who changes their mind

00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:16,749
being able to revert backwards and

00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,279
something other than like undo and

00:11:16,749 --> 00:11:20,290
whatever your text editor is was really

00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:22,779
useful so he was already in the habit of

00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,759
regularly saving changes saving state

00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:26,920
and managing things in version control

00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:28,569
and then someone introduced him to

00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:32,410
Heroku which is Hawaii was at the wiser

00:11:28,569 --> 00:11:35,589
event and that meant Jay not only could

00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:37,329
build an app in nodejs but get push

00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:39,519
heroku master meant that he could deploy

00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:41,620
that into production and he didn't need

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,990
me at all for anything anymore he

00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:46,839
completely outsourced the whole building

00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:48,160
of a system he didn't know how it worked

00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:49,749
in the cloud he didn't particularly care

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,129
someone was keeping it up for him he

00:11:49,749 --> 00:11:53,559
knew if you needed to scale it he had

00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:55,149
the option to scale it everything that I

00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:56,980
was needed for now had basically been

00:11:55,149 --> 00:12:00,430
Trevor light trivialized to version

00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,839
control from Jay's perspective long gone

00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:04,959
were the days where I was writing HTML

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:07,149
CSS setting up a patchy ft ping fast to

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,550
a server everything had basically been

00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:11,589
reduced to this and I was no longer a

00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:16,990
required cog in this long line of

00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:18,990
machinery and that's all because we're

00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:21,009
developers and we take great pride in

00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:23,139
improving the tools and making our own

00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:25,480
lives easier but we've iterated to such

00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:28,240
a point now that our own tools are being

00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,980
used against us basically to allow other

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,809
people to come and stomp on the ground

00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:36,910
that we used to consider our own

00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:38,980
hallowed turf and the thing that is most

00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:41,199
concerning about this is if we go back

00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,819
to a discussion on values and

00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:45,579
craftsmanship and what that meant to us

00:12:42,819 --> 00:12:47,470
individually JS priorities were never

00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:49,660
focused on making his own life easier

00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:51,999
they were always focused on making the

00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:54,519
users life easier and now that he

00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:57,069
doesn't need me he's naturally better

00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:58,959
positioned to build products that users

00:12:57,069 --> 00:13:03,610
are going to love more than the ones I

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:05,939
would build without him and so it's time

00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,939
to fight back

00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,910
it's no longer safe to assume that you

00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:14,200
can ship something that just works and

00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:16,660
that will be enough for that product to

00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,430
be successful Jay can ship stuff that

00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:21,339
just works but you can ship stuff that

00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:22,990
just works and looks beautiful and that

00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:26,320
the user wants to use and that the user

00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:27,850
wants to come back and use again it's

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,430
going to be incredibly career limiting

00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:32,020
if you don't adjust your values to be

00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:33,610
able to compete with him in that phone

00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,580
space you have to be able to build

00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:38,680
something that users want to use and it

00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:40,980
turns out that as I said before it good

00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,180
design isn't necessarily a genetic gift

00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,010
that some of us are blessed with and

00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,959
some of them are missing it's something

00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:48,880
that can be learnt and even better it

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,640
exists within a framework of rules and

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,410
standards and math that makes it pretty

00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:56,950
easy for my artistically challenged

00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:58,240
engineering mind to grasp and so what

00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,680
I'm going to do is I'm going to run

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,480
through some of what I consider the

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,070
gateway drugs to design the things that

00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,839
set me on the path to actually

00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:07,120
appreciating how I could apply some of

00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:10,420
these things we're going to do that by

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,860
talking about specific people who I have

00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,839
influenced me in the way they approach

00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:20,860
this problem or at least in how they

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:22,540
explain it first is Eric Ries from

00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,520
claimers from the Lean Startup movement

00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:27,190
and probably not someone you'd typically

00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,630
associate with being a designer and I

00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:31,209
bring him up first not because he was

00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:33,160
kind of the first person to influence me

00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:35,740
in this way but because i think the way

00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,720
he's convinced engineers to think about

00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:40,120
product design like a much more holistic

00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,520
view on what it means to build and ship

00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,750
a product sets a really good foundation

00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,020
for how you should apply those same

00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:49,329
rules to the rest of the design process

00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:51,970
and the problem is the designer isn't

00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:54,880
just about graphics and drop shadows and

00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:57,209
gradients and little bits of fuzz here

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,800
and there it's a more holistic approach

00:14:57,209 --> 00:15:02,500
with how the end user will ultimately

00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,060
interact with your end product lean has

00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,490
been really great for engaging this

00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:07,899
audience I think on that with coming up

00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:10,240
with an objective and metrics driven

00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:12,370
approach to understand what your product

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,260
needs to be and that's probably the most

00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:16,750
useful first step is to make sure you

00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:18,280
have a very clear and objective

00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,900
view on what it is that you're trying to

00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,820
design and how the changes you're

00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:29,590
implementing go towards fulfilling that

00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:32,340
need now I do have some reservations

00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:35,140
with like the current Church of Lynn and

00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:37,590
sort of just the blind adherence to all

00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:40,990
these principles and I think there's the

00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:43,270
tendency for people to misinterpret or

00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:46,300
twist it to fit their own requirements

00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:48,370
and use it as an excuse to justify why a

00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:51,160
particular product didn't work because

00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:52,690
it wasn't a good market match or their

00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:56,070
what there was some other floor in the

00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:58,600
product and I think there's a risk of

00:15:56,070 --> 00:16:00,160
blurring the lines between a minimum

00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,930
product which is where you have a

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,700
hypothesis where you think a business

00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:05,710
might exist or a problem exists and you

00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:09,940
need to test whether a solution is

00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:11,530
viable and a Minimum Viable Product and

00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,900
when I think about these two analogies

00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:15,160
some when you're entering into a space

00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,750
where there's a known problem where you

00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,430
have existing competitors where there

00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:21,160
are people incumbents already in that

00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:23,290
space creating a minimum product is

00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,670
never ever going to be successful you

00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:27,040
need to create a product that is viable

00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:28,930
against that competition and I think

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,130
people were these two distinctions and

00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:32,650
things that they can achieve something

00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:34,330
that is like very engineer driving has

00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:35,650
very little in the way of design could

00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:37,360
because all you're doing is testing a

00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:41,620
hypothesis and nothing could be further

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,630
from the truth what was my first gateway

00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:48,730
drug to this though it was typography

00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:51,100
and typesetting and I'm definitely not

00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:53,890
an expert in this field at all but I

00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:55,930
find it fascinating and particularly

00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:57,610
because of all of the historical context

00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:00,700
around typesetting and typography and

00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:02,470
how a particular typeface can often be a

00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,060
reflection of what was cutting edge in

00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:07,720
terms of technical capabilities at the

00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:09,430
time that it was invented but the advent

00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,620
of word processing and desktop

00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:13,980
publishing has basically masked all of

00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:17,800
that history from most people and most

00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:20,079
disappointingly it's probably inflicted

00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,610
a infinite number of poorly laid out

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:26,000
newsletters and brochures on all of us

00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:28,130
and in space of just a decade

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,660
hundreds of years of best practices have

00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:32,030
basically been rendered useless because

00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:33,500
people didn't know any better but the

00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:35,960
thing is those best practices still

00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,620
apply today regardless of the display

00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,620
medium that you're presenting

00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:55,630
it's really easy to create visually

00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:57,600
engaging and beautiful designs just by

00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:59,980
understanding how visual hierarchy

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,800
interacts with the way that someone uses

00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:04,330
your product the way it guides in

00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,760
towards what they should be focusing on

00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:09,430
what they should be looking at how the

00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:11,770
measure of a line and the leading

00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:15,970
between them affects the readability and

00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:19,440
ultimate usability of the page now the

00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:21,640
letting of the lion should always be

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,100
greater than the space between the words

00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,630
are you presenting because we crave

00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:28,330
structure and we'll look for it even

00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:29,950
when it doesn't exist and so create

00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:32,050
increasing the space between each of

00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:34,870
these lines you'd see that instead of

00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:36,910
this looking like a blurred rectangular

00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:38,680
mess on the page you instead naturally

00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:40,780
find your eye wanting to flow left to

00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:43,210
right along each line and you'd be able

00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:46,800
to track back much easier and this would

00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:46,800
make this much more reasonable readable

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,440
you'll also find that the font sizes

00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:57,010
that you find in pretty much every word

00:18:53,440 --> 00:19:00,490
processing package the same it's like 10

00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:02,560
12 14 16 18 then it will jump to 21 24

00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:04,510
and 36 and that's not by coincidence

00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,160
it's not someone just cargo Colton

00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:08,460
because that's what they did in an

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,780
earlier version of word it's because

00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,970
hundreds of years of experience have

00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:15,160
proven that a consistent ratio between

00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:16,600
font sizes are much more readable and

00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,780
people find it naturally more pleasing

00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:21,460
and much more aesthetic and so sticking

00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:23,200
with those numbers is going to be the

00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:26,170
first step towards actually making sure

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:31,770
you have a text that people actually

00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:34,210
want to read there's also rules around

00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:36,520
the flow you have on your emphasize

00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:40,090
particular text when applying different

00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:42,760
emphasis to your writing and so the for

00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:43,780
example if you've got a hunk of text

00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,120
like this and you decide that you need

00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:47,350
to put emphasis on one of these words so

00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,870
you increase the weight of it and you're

00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:52,390
in bolding it that means if you want to

00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:54,850
put a second letter layer of emphasis

00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:57,280
somewhere within this text to like EE

00:19:54,850 --> 00:20:00,130
emphasize something the right thing to

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,560
do is definitely not to use italics it's

00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,890
either bold and all capitals or Boulder

00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,350
night

00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:07,480
but the thing is there's this whole

00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:08,890
matrix of rules and this flow decision

00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,630
chart that happens based on what that

00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:12,670
first decision was but people don't

00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:14,380
appreciate it and the thing is once you

00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:16,630
understand these rules and you apply

00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,010
them all of a sudden all this stuff sort

00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,810
of happens subconsciously and you look

00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:21,370
at this text and you go oh well that

00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:29,200
really is much more beautiful than what

00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:31,000
was there before I think what I love

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,120
most about typography is though and

00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,950
typesetting is how nerdy it is if in the

00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,180
historical artifacts that exist in that

00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:40,480
language you use when you're talking

00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:41,950
about it it all harps back to the days

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:46,170
when text like this was actually

00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:46,170
physically set by a skilled craftsperson

00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:52,900
capital and small letters will kept in

00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:55,120
the upper and lower cases lavish of a

00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:58,480
bench respectively and that's where the

00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:01,420
terms upper and lower case come from the

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:04,780
space between the lines was created by

00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:07,180
inserting extra pieces of lead between

00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:10,750
each of the lines and so hence the term

00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:12,160
letting and the length of each line is

00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,650
called a measure because on the old

00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:17,080
printers rulers that actually has set a

00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:19,210
movable slide that set the measure for

00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:21,040
that particular line so that they could

00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,570
ensure consistency throughout the entire

00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,770
page and obviously the rest of the

00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:25,770
document that they might be producing

00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:32,470
now as I said we crave structure and

00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:34,480
we'll look for it wherever we can we

00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:37,360
naturally gravitate to things that are

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,040
balanced now facial symmetry is an

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,230
example of this it determines the

00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,880
attractiveness of another person but

00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:44,680
also strangely the perception of health

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,080
in that person as well so deeply

00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,550
ingrained is that desire to find a

00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,200
balance of structure in the world that

00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:55,210
it changes our perspective on how we

00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:57,070
view things and that search for

00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:59,050
structure and beauty carries over into

00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:00,610
the apps that we design and the easiest

00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:02,920
way is to assure that it's consistently

00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:04,660
applied is to use a grid system now I'm

00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,880
assuming some of you are probably using

00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:08,440
grid systems already what a lot of

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,810
people fail to realize when using a grid

00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,760
system though is that it's often reduced

00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:14,310
down to just a bunch of columns like how

00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,020
why do I want to call them how many

00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:18,390
do I want to have but it's more than

00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:20,580
that having a proper grid system means

00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:22,830
also caring about the vertical rhythm on

00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:26,160
a page not just the width but also how

00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:29,250
things are lined up top to bottom and

00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:31,830
you'll see here the columns are done

00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:34,020
with a sort of pink ready shading and

00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:36,030
the Lions are done with like the solid

00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:38,100
red line there and that's a consistent

00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:40,740
rhythm down the page and if you look at

00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:43,260
the articles tools books templates

00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:45,150
heading here well you'll see that

00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:47,160
they're all on the exact same red

00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:49,110
baseline and that's not particularly

00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,390
remarkable that would be easy and

00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:53,460
obvious to do but if you look above them

00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:55,590
you've got the grid system as the top

00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:57,270
line heading and the bottom of each of

00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:59,820
those words also sits on the line and

00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:02,070
then if you move right the text beside

00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:04,440
it also naturally lines up with those

00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:07,860
lines and in turn the bottom of the main

00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,060
heading going over to the right it's a

00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,920
little bit difficult to see but there's

00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:12,690
a search box there now would have been

00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,370
very easy to just throw that at the top

00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:15,900
of the page up near that hide breed link

00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:17,730
but then it would have sort of felt

00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,690
alone and floating and isolated it

00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,950
wouldn't have the structure that we

00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:22,830
crave because the rest of that is all

00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:24,900
just white space but instead what's been

00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:26,790
done here is the search box lines up

00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,380
with the bottom of the word system that

00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:29,880
anchors it to the heading it shows it

00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:33,770
for the sort of above the fold it's

00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,770
still part of that the header navigation

00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:39,270
now if you look at this sort of the main

00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:41,460
article content here we've got composer

00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:44,790
vertical rhythm 960 grid system those

00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:47,490
first row of articles the headings there

00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:49,650
a different in length summer one line

00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:51,960
somewhat wrapped around 22 but they all

00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:53,970
still fall in those lines and then

00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,040
impressively you'll see that the article

00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:57,690
summary the text below it is again of

00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,550
varying lengths which means all of those

00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:01,470
articles all end somewhere slightly

00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:03,510
different on the page but in spite of

00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:06,000
all of that the second row of stories

00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:07,560
all start at the same point it provides

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,300
a structure that makes it easy for me to

00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,280
look at this and feel like I know how to

00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,780
use this site I can quickly scan it and

00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,630
find the information that I feel is

00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:17,580
relevant to me the text is being

00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:19,140
proposed so called my attention to just

00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:21,090
the headline stuff I don't have to sit

00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:22,950
here and read the entire page to work

00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:24,540
out what is relevant to me because the

00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:26,490
use of a grid system and some

00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:27,480
intelligent visual hierarchy help me God

00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:29,250
help guide me

00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,890
this process there's not some crazy

00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:39,180
workflow here unable to comprehend this

00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:42,420
easily and instantly now part of this is

00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:43,830
about considering the impact on the

00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:46,500
element you put on the page in terms of

00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:48,150
how they affect the visual height so

00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:50,580
padding and margin obviously come into

00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:52,430
play here but it also throws back to

00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:55,290
what I was saying before about the

00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:57,240
variants and sizes with fonts having a

00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:59,700
consistent ratio between these means it

00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,620
with the heading you can see there even

00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,790
when you change the size of the heading

00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:05,010
so long as you do it on a consistent

00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:07,170
ratio you can ensure that everything

00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:08,460
else will line up properly and still

00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:17,490
meet up with those bass lines all the

00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:19,350
way down so probably the author that I

00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:21,960
found easiest to broach on this subject

00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:25,260
is a UK designer called mark bolton

00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:27,000
who's written a bunch of books but the

00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:29,490
one that got me into this originally

00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,550
it's called a practical guide for

00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:34,740
designing for the web it's a great book

00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:36,180
I think it balances the history and

00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:38,520
practical application of typesetting

00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:40,200
really well and puts it into context

00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:43,740
that is easy to apply obviously talking

00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:45,350
about the web specifically and what I

00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:47,370
find from an engineer's perspective

00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:48,750
particularly great about this is because

00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:51,750
it sets it out in terms of like

00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:54,300
framework and rules and flow and math

00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:56,100
and ratio it means that I can codify

00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,780
most of this learning I can create my

00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:00,120
own sass template that automatically

00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:01,410
applies it's tough and by putting it

00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,750
into a SAS template that I've created

00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:05,580
myself I can instantly fly literally

00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:08,040
hundreds of years of best practices from

00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:12,300
typesetting across my entire website and

00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:13,770
not have to think about it ever again so

00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:17,040
the top level heading will automatically

00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:18,720
be correct ratio to the subheading below

00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,940
and the paragraph text below that would

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,080
be the same to the correct size and the

00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:25,590
vertical rhythm would all match up

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,180
perfectly now you could just use Twitter

00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:29,040
bootstrap it applies a lot of these

00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:30,600
rules but you wouldn't have any idea why

00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,250
Twitter bootstrap is making your site

00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,200
look better than you can by yourself and

00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:36,980
you'd end up with a site that looks like

00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,980
it's using Twitter bootstrap

00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:42,409
something else I found interesting was

00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:44,299
dealing with Mark was sort of a

00:26:42,409 --> 00:26:46,460
throwback to the historical origins of a

00:26:44,299 --> 00:26:49,549
lot of this stuff he talks about how

00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:52,490
underlining is kind of a bit of a recent

00:26:49,549 --> 00:26:53,750
invention it was actually post Gutenberg

00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:55,960
when people would type setting and

00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:59,149
pressing stuff it was intended as a hint

00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:01,610
to the typesetter that this word should

00:26:59,149 --> 00:27:04,010
be have added emphasis supplied it was

00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:05,899
not something that ever got printed so

00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:08,630
it's basically like a markdown note to

00:27:05,899 --> 00:27:10,519
an editor yet somehow with the advent of

00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:12,529
Microsoft Word and all these other tools

00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:13,700
people using underlined to mean all

00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:15,620
kinds of stuff when you go to the

00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:18,350
newsletter headings are underlined all

00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:19,820
kinds of things thankfully in recent

00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:21,860
years because of the advent and the web

00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:23,929
and the potential for an underline to be

00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:26,240
mistaken for a link that seems to have

00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:33,529
decreased but let me just re-emphasize

00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:37,279
don't underline words next on my list

00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:47,299
would be edward tufte anyone not heard

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:50,690
of Tufte hmm yeah excuse me for so much

00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:53,029
of my life he I've had to present large

00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:55,309
amounts of visual information on web

00:27:53,029 --> 00:27:58,549
pages we capture so much in the way of

00:27:55,309 --> 00:28:00,080
usage share performance and user

00:27:58,549 --> 00:28:01,549
behavior and all kinds of things and

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,320
ultimately some kind of manager comes

00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:05,389
along and says what the hell is going on

00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:07,370
I need to know what's happening with all

00:28:05,389 --> 00:28:10,250
our data and so you need to prevent this

00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:12,110
prevent present this somehow and tufte

00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:15,980
is the preeminent current expert on

00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:18,200
visualizing information and once again

00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:19,820
the way he talks about problems I think

00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,450
resonates really well with me because

00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:26,260
it's so cut and dried it's so sort of

00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:28,820
developer facing it seems at times and

00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:30,799
you could distill a lot of what he says

00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:32,019
basically to just apply some critical

00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,980
thinking to what it is you're doing

00:28:32,019 --> 00:28:35,960
what's the objectives that you're trying

00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:37,970
to achieve and has everything you've

00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,730
done in however you're presenting the

00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:42,380
information added to that not

00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:44,090
necessarily detracted but has it added

00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:45,889
to meeting that goal because if it

00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:48,669
hasn't you don't need it remove it

00:28:45,889 --> 00:28:48,669
simplify

00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:53,630
I run through an admittedly contrived

00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:55,730
example that I came up with to just try

00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:58,700
and give an example of how this is done

00:28:55,730 --> 00:29:00,800
wrong a lot of times so here we have

00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:03,350
this hypothetical company with two

00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:08,480
divisions one generate sprockets and one

00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:10,340
generates widgets and this brockett's

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,470
division is quite new and it's sort of

00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:14,380
growing at a pretty consistent rate and

00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:17,240
the whole company is increasing in value

00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:19,160
but we wanted to know how both of these

00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,870
perform relative to each other and

00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,610
everyone knows financial information is

00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:24,230
notoriously boring so you need to

00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:25,970
present it in 3d with textures and

00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:29,120
shadows to make sure that people pay

00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:30,850
attention to it but what it actually

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,200
does here is it doesn't just sort of

00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:35,510
jazz up the image that the people want

00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,310
to look at it it wildly distorts what

00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:39,170
we're actually presenting here so that

00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:40,850
it's no longer easy to ascertain the

00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:44,720
information or the story that I wanted

00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:47,060
to tell and so to that end taking some

00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,040
of tuff T's rules has the 3d added

00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:50,840
towards my goal of highlighting the

00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,970
difference in performance between these

00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:55,640
two business divisions and the answer is

00:29:52,970 --> 00:30:00,020
no so if we remove the 3d we come down

00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:02,090
to something like this and we sort of

00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:03,800
not necessarily focus on the data but

00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:06,230
just keep applying these has stuff being

00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:08,420
headed here is it of value is the color

00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:10,940
adding anything of value there I could

00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:13,070
probably say no and in particular those

00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:15,590
big black lines are like detracting

00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:17,120
they're taking my my I away from the

00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:18,770
information that I should be analyzing

00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:23,840
so let's get rid of everything and make

00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:25,310
it grey but that's not quite so garish

00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,360
but at the same time I can't actually

00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,770
tell the difference between these two

00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,950
companies because everything is the same

00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:34,310
color so let's apply the minimum viable

00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:36,050
change as tufte will call it and make

00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:37,820
the smallest difference possible to at

00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:38,660
least separate the two companies and

00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:42,350
that's to apply a little bit of

00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:45,020
brightness to one of them so now the

00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:46,370
data is there its front and center it's

00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:50,510
a lot more obvious what is happening

00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:52,940
well is it really the thing is if we

00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:54,890
step back and talk critically about this

00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:55,970
what I said we wanted to do is ascertain

00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:58,730
the difference in performance between

00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:59,900
these two companies and the way we'd

00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:00,870
have to do that by looking at this chart

00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,000
is to be

00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:04,590
to basically calculate the difference in

00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,490
rate of change between these two areas

00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:11,610
and I'm terrible at doing calculus in my

00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:14,400
head and I think a lot of people are the

00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:16,050
fact is humans in general are terrible

00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,240
at perceiving the difference in area

00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:19,770
between two irregular shapes and so this

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,020
is a really bad way to present this

00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:23,880
information and so instead we talked

00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:25,980
about like you know comparing these side

00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:30,300
by side so how that we actually present

00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:32,520
that information side by side and so

00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:34,350
here's the same graph but it tells a

00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:37,260
much more different story now it's like

00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:38,580
no longer to come to divisions growing

00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,500
at a very similar rate what we're

00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:42,540
actually looking at is one business that

00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,460
was nowhere to be found in January and

00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:45,990
now counts for most of the revenue come

00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:49,500
the end of the year and come June at

00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:51,720
least and so that's a much better way to

00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:54,150
be presenting this information it's far

00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:56,490
less visually distracting but it's also

00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:59,610
not still telling the story that I

00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:01,890
wanted to tell I've still forced upon

00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:03,510
the user the the requirement to tell the

00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:06,480
difference between these two graphs and

00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:08,100
by doing that because we naturally make

00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,580
assumptions about things and try and

00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:14,090
shortcut the process that big jump there

00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:17,429
and may kind of masks the fact that

00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:19,860
widgets lost money in June and so that

00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:22,140
the relative gain between may and june

00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:24,390
for sprockets was actually much much

00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:27,330
higher than you immediately realize in

00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:29,940
that graph so instead if what we want to

00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:31,950
show the user is the difference in

00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,990
performance between these two company

00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:36,000
these two divisions why don't we change

00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:37,530
this so that only presents the

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,080
difference in performance between these

00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:44,030
two and so now this tells a much much

00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:46,110
different story now it's obvious that

00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:47,520
company that is represented at the top

00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:50,100
half of the graph has been in a pretty

00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:52,309
rapid decline relatively speaking two

00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,309
sprockets

00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:59,420
this is a what Tufte has described you

00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,860
may have seen this if you've read any of

00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:04,730
his books I think he puts it in all's

00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:09,320
and that he calls this the greatest data

00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:11,600
graphic ever invented and what it is he

00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:14,630
uses it to emphasize both the richness

00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,429
of detail that can become in a very like

00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:18,020
a graphic like this but at the same time

00:33:16,429 --> 00:33:23,140
how simple a graphic like this can be

00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:27,410
this is charles joseph menards flow map

00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:30,200
depicting the disastrous russian attempt

00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:34,550
sorry the disastrous Russian campaign of

00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:37,070
Napoleon in 1912 and so what this graph

00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:39,470
actually shows is starting from left to

00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:42,860
right is the size of Napoleon's army as

00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:44,360
a trek towards Russia the thickness of

00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:47,420
the line decreasing showing the change

00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:49,190
in the size of that army over time it

00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:51,260
shows you geographically where different

00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:54,260
divisions split off and where they

00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:55,610
rejoin the campaign on the retreat it

00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:58,760
shows you geographically where they were

00:33:55,610 --> 00:34:01,030
at specific point in time down the

00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:05,030
bottom it also plots specific dates and

00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:07,220
temperatures along the retreat and

00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:09,139
what's amazing about that this is the

00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:11,480
denseness of the detail here there's so

00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:13,190
much information here so much of like

00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:16,010
ability to correlate all these different

00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:17,629
causes and effects and if you would look

00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:19,340
ingested the raw numbers there wouldn't

00:34:17,629 --> 00:34:20,659
be obvious until you see the picture

00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:23,300
here and you start to understand things

00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:24,710
that no the campaign may have been

00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,869
dreadful whether it may have been a

00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:29,720
rousing failure but that wasn't

00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:31,669
necessarily because Russia's might was

00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:34,100
just so powerful and overcame Napoleon

00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:36,109
because even after they retreated you

00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:39,649
can see how few people made it back to

00:34:36,109 --> 00:34:41,810
Paris even after the fire up in the top

00:34:39,649 --> 00:34:43,609
corner in Moscow the army continued to

00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:45,500
dwindle so it wasn't necessarily the

00:34:43,609 --> 00:34:47,570
Russians that be Napoleon it was the

00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,700
weather it was one of the worst winters

00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:54,760
in history at that point and these

00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:57,080
people died from cold and starvation and

00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,910
so the other thing that he touches on

00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,710
with this particular graphic is but

00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:02,359
there's actually nothing that you could

00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:03,670
remove from this graphic that would

00:35:02,359 --> 00:35:05,630
allow you to tell the same story

00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:08,750
everything in here is absolutely

00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:11,000
required his rear basically reduced

00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:13,070
everything or if you want to refactored

00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,480
everything down to the bare minimum that

00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:20,869
can be used to present the information

00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:22,880
in this way now big influence for anyone

00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:25,430
involved in design and therefore

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:29,210
basically anyone at Heroku is dieter

00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:31,880
Rams he is a German industrial designer

00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:35,810
most famous for his work with Braun in

00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:38,480
the 50s and 60s I think it was and he's

00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:42,010
described his approach design as being

00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:44,060
simple as being less but better and

00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:45,380
that's something we try and apply as

00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:47,869
much as possible and everything we do at

00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:49,640
a Roku but he also produced what he's

00:35:47,869 --> 00:35:52,100
called the ten principles of good design

00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:54,980
and I won't go through all of them but

00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:56,750
I'll certainly not in detail anyway but

00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:59,600
instead of go through call out a few and

00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:01,160
I think as I say these don't think about

00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,140
them in terms of design in the context

00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:05,750
that we normally think about design but

00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:10,070
instead think about how these apply to

00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:14,210
the way you write code here we go good

00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:19,220
design is a stake it makes a product

00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:24,080
understandable it is unobtrusive it is

00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:30,250
honest it is long-lasting it is thorough

00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:30,250
and it is as little design as possible

00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:35,359
what I like about this is that i find

00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,830
those principles apply to a lot of the

00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,990
stuff that i cared about the things that

00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:41,330
i was disagreeing with jay it wiser

00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:42,980
about the things that I felt I cared

00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:45,950
about are actually the things that

00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:47,420
someone as famous as dieter Rams also

00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:48,320
cared about it's just that I was caring

00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:53,540
about them in a slightly different

00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:56,810
context and what I realized is basically

00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:59,210
design can be a science there's a rules

00:36:56,810 --> 00:37:01,310
in the sense of natural order and you

00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:02,840
can codify those into things like grid

00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:04,460
systems and templates so you don't ever

00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,260
have to think about them again you can

00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:09,200
learn these lessons once and apply them

00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:11,150
to your code base and it's done and the

00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:14,000
easiest way to make a good self good at

00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:14,900
design is to first reframe of redefine

00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,579
the problem in

00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,710
to something that it feels like you can

00:37:16,579 --> 00:37:21,109
challenge instead of looking at design

00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:23,000
as a purely creative pursuit viewer is a

00:37:21,109 --> 00:37:24,950
technical challenge and one that

00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,900
operates within a confined set of rules

00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:29,210
and as an engineer we know we have a

00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:31,250
well defined and understood problem we

00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:33,140
can often automate it and so automate

00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:35,000
all of your design pull the balance of

00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:36,950
power back away from people like Jay he

00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,900
doesn't need us anymore but likewise

00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:40,700
with a little bit of understanding about

00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:42,079
what design is and the rules and wishes

00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,579
operate we have the potential to

00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:48,260
automate a lot of what he used to do as

00:37:43,579 --> 00:37:50,390
well the other thing that I realized was

00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:52,940
that our values are shared you know

00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:55,520
dieter Rams expounds on the 10 value 10

00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:57,099
principles of good design and I think

00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,450
collectively we all share those values

00:37:57,099 --> 00:38:01,640
you can apply them to code you can apply

00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:03,799
them to industrial design you can ply

00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:05,119
them to graphic design single

00:38:03,799 --> 00:38:06,859
responsibility principle is just a

00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:09,289
really technical way of saying do one

00:38:06,859 --> 00:38:11,750
thing and do it well clear and obvious

00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:14,420
intention within methods is just dieter

00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:16,880
saying make it honest make it

00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:18,230
understandable and when you realize that

00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,329
the two different groups of people

00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:22,460
essentially share the exact same value

00:38:20,329 --> 00:38:24,170
system and exist in a world where it's

00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:27,170
defined by the structure and establish

00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:30,380
best practices and do things because

00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:32,240
it's easy to reason about how did the

00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:36,109
conclusion that we are actually all

00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:37,789
designers already it's easy to forget

00:38:36,109 --> 00:38:39,740
there are multiple users of our product

00:38:37,789 --> 00:38:41,960
though and we can continue to escalate

00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:44,349
the priorities of ourselves above those

00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:47,710
of the end user that's using our product

00:38:44,349 --> 00:38:49,700
but we're in the minority use case

00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:51,829
hopefully if we build a really

00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:53,809
successful product it's going to have an

00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:55,730
order of magnitude more end users than a

00:38:53,809 --> 00:38:56,990
real developers and that's not to say

00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,730
that you should forget about all of the

00:38:56,990 --> 00:39:00,109
good principles we've had but we should

00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:07,960
also adopt some of the principles that

00:39:00,109 --> 00:39:10,430
Jay had so if you haven't considered the

00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,900
priorities of the end user when your

00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:13,279
chips your product I would argue that

00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:15,970
maybe you haven't actually shipped your

00:39:13,279 --> 00:39:15,970
product yet at all

00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:25,049
after when we talk about whether things

00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,839
are well designed we talk about them and

00:39:25,049 --> 00:39:29,130
say that they're beautiful and so I'd

00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:31,559
like to leave you with a quote from

00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:33,059
someone from a long time ago about what

00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:36,480
he thought it was for something to be

00:39:33,059 --> 00:39:39,390
beautiful and for anybody who was like

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,130
me and thinks that they're confident in

00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:43,619
HTML that they're not capable of

00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:45,750
building beautiful applications just

00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:47,970
remember to make your apps beautiful by

00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:50,339
treating them like science and a sense

00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:52,470
of order and symmetry and limiting what

00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:57,270
they do and if you don't believe me

00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:58,740
here's the words from this guy the

00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:01,230
mathematical sciences particularly

00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:03,089
exhibit order symmetry and limitation

00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:11,430
and those are the greatest forms of

00:40:03,089 --> 00:40:15,390
beautiful I've been Glenn I work at

00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:17,579
Heroku and so the obligatory we're

00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:19,349
hiring slide if you want to come work at

00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:21,809
a company that cares about design cares

00:40:19,349 --> 00:40:23,460
about products that people love come

00:40:21,809 --> 00:40:30,230
speak to me after this and maybe we can

00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:30,230
make clouds together thank you

00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:44,410
