good afternoon everyone I appreciate

00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:24,500
this vote for me over the beach that is

00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:27,410
pretty fantastic I hope that I can make

00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:31,700
your last 45 minutes of the day are so

00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:35,390
pretty enjoyable and worthy of the non

00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:36,800
Beach vote so I've come to talk a little

00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,200
bit about community building stuff and

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,570
my experiences around that and how they

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,550
really to open source some of the things

00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:46,730
that I think I kind of go to open source

00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:50,210
to find in some cases where I can't find

00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:51,829
it elsewhere and hopefully somewhere in

00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:54,949
there you guys can see some insights

00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:57,920
into ways that you can both participate

00:00:54,949 --> 00:01:00,679
contribute and manage open source

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,079
projects in ways that maybe you haven't

00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:04,489
quite thought about before so just to

00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:06,770
start off make sure that people are

00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:08,240
awake or whatever and because I'm

00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,950
curious to see if I can actually get

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,170
very much participation if you could

00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:15,409
just raise both hands if you use open

00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:17,660
source all right I think this is most

00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:20,540
everybody not touching their laptop for

00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:22,130
like a second so that's that's progress

00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,260
I'm glad that you're paying attention

00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:26,140
all right and if you contribute to open

00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:28,760
source if you could keep your hands up

00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:30,920
so it's actually like a pretty good

00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,990
number of people that do both and that

00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,600
I'm glad those of you that only had your

00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:37,640
hands up for one of them I'll see what I

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,920
can do about that if you have any

00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,420
questions or anything about how you can

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,160
do that and it's not clear by the end of

00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,780
this by all means talk to me because I

00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,850
really like helping people to do that

00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,470
one of the best parts of my weeks and

00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:51,440
days is frequently when someone comes up

00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:53,330
to me and says you know here this is my

00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,610
first pull request that I'm giving to

00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:56,960
your project like that is just a great

00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:59,030
feeling to know that I'm helping someone

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,290
to start being a part of what I feel is

00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:04,790
a really great community that is

00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:06,290
certainly given me a lot so where does

00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,149
my experience from this come from like

00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,530
what what gives me the right or

00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:12,769
knowledge to talk about this sort of

00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:15,410
stuff that would be fog so again how

00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:18,230
many people have used fog how many

00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:20,330
people have heard of fog at least so

00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:22,999
that is also a discrepancy that I would

00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:25,579
like to fix but that's neither here nor

00:02:22,999 --> 00:02:26,600
there really um so that's cool i'm glad

00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:28,780
that some of you of you

00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,790
and that more of you have heard of it

00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,740
but for those of you that haven't it's a

00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:35,930
the i guess the simplest way is to kind

00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,220
of say that's a cloud computing or m so

00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:40,760
in the same way that sort of like active

00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:43,010
record is a way to have pretty much the

00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,530
same interface to postgres or my sequel

00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:47,480
or what have you fog tries to do the

00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:50,180
same thing with different cloud things

00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:53,330
so whether it be s3 or rack space

00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:55,640
storage or Rackspace compute vs amazon

00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:57,890
GC 2 it tries to provide some common

00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,540
interfaces so you don't need to get down

00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,680
into the nitty-gritty immediately you

00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,550
can actually start getting some work

00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,140
done that that is common between them

00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,400
and it's been a very interesting project

00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,440
I've certainly learned a ton from it

00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,810
technically like I would say that in a

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,910
lot of ways I'm a cloud expert now where

00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,590
I was not at all when I started this but

00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:17,720
it's also taught me a lot about open

00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:22,940
source and and and what that can provide

00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:24,920
that if we just go to it for that so to

00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:27,230
give you some background the first year

00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,810
that I worked on fog I spent some time

00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:31,640
on it almost every day outside of work

00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,810
because I had other things going on at

00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,870
work so it wasn't really something I

00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:37,640
could dedicate time to I had a sense

00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,660
that it was important it was important

00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,970
because I didn't know anything about

00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:42,230
cloud and it seemed that I needed to

00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,270
because it was something that was

00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:45,890
becoming more and more important and it

00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:48,050
also felt like something that was

00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:50,000
lacking like I wanted this tool and it

00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,930
was not available so I decided that I

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,080
was going to try to do something about

00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:55,490
it those things are good I think that's

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,410
decent reasoning that's a good reason to

00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:59,300
start a project the problem is that over

00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:02,030
time had become this sort of like DIY

00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:04,070
Death March thing where I had good

00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,660
motivation to start but it became harder

00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:08,300
and harder to continue to be motivated

00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,680
to do that because I had learned a lot

00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,840
now and I did know about cloud computing

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,000
so that motivation was kind of gone and

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,650
like just keeping grinding on this day

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,870
after day was really difficult to keep

00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,400
myself motivated especially when it was

00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:21,859
hard to convince anyone to use it

00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,300
because they already had a WS s3 or they

00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:24,680
already had some other library that they

00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,080
were using why did they need another one

00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,670
right so there are reasons that they

00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,320
might need another one but it was hard

00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,580
to convince them right so like this was

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,100
just frustrating and I felt myself

00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,419
losing motivation losing confidence that

00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,720
this was something that was valuable and

00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:39,330
that I should continue on it and that

00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:43,560
was

00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:45,419
awful right like so moving into that a

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,860
little bit deeper there were good things

00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:49,110
right I was certainly to get more

00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,599
adoption but in some ways that was more

00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:54,360
a liability than that a benefit because

00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:55,919
now all of a sudden I had this even

00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,780
larger base of people who were running

00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,280
into even more edge cases that I'd never

00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,719
thought of that I had to support right

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,699
or that's what it continued to feel like

00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:04,560
because it was pretty much me that was

00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:06,090
doing it so I would suddenly capture

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,039
this person that finally I convinced

00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:09,419
them they would try it and they ran into

00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:11,460
this weird edge case that I spend the

00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:13,050
entire weekend fixing because you know I

00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,219
really want to capture that extra user

00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,729
because I've had so much trouble

00:05:14,219 --> 00:05:19,800
convincing in the first place to try it

00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:21,900
so along the way with that my code base

00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,580
starts expanding pretty quickly you know

00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,740
the benefit to that is that there's more

00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,599
capability there's perhaps better error

00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,490
handling but the downside is that now I

00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:31,409
have more than I need to potentially

00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:33,060
load into my head or that I need to dig

00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:35,580
back through on a day-to-day basis to

00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,259
fix these bugs as they come in and you

00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,849
know ultimately i'm having this growing

00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:40,560
growing time commitment where i used to

00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:42,330
spend half an hour or 45 minutes on it

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,800
because i enjoyed learning about cloud

00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:46,680
computing and now i'm spending an hour

00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,659
or two hours every day just responding

00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,090
to bug reports because i don't want this

00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:53,789
project to come crashing down under its

00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:56,460
own weight and you know probably crushed

00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:58,650
me in the process so overall i ended up

00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,539
in this sort of downward spiral where I

00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,580
sort of dreaded more and more working on

00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:04,680
this and I became less and less excited

00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:07,259
about the the project in general and I

00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,839
think that this is a danger that a lot

00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:12,479
of open source projects are open to or

00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:14,190
really just projects in general so

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,620
hopefully coming out of this you'll see

00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:19,620
some ways that you can avoid getting

00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,330
into this situation like I did but you

00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,860
know it's a refactoring thing right I

00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:24,539
went down a dead end for a while and

00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,889
then I realized that I needed to rework

00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:30,240
the way that I was doing this in order

00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:33,839
to better facilitate and not be dreadful

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,789
so in the second year I started really

00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,560
focusing on two things I would say one

00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:39,000
is building more community around it so

00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,440
that other people were involved so that

00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,819
other people were helping me with some

00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,080
of this burden and so that other people

00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:45,870
could share the excitement that I

00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,789
originally had and perhaps did not

00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,830
originally do the best job of conveying

00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:51,300
and also that there was a sense of

00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,360
continuity right because i knew that i

00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,550
was getting burned out

00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,199
so eventually there would come a time

00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:59,469
and I probably could not continue to do

00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:01,870
this right so how can I find a way to

00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:03,639
get other people to step up who still

00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,349
have that excitement and can

00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,199
reinvigorate my excitement and keep this

00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:11,080
project going keep it moving forward so

00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:13,110
the community did grow this is great we

00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,069
get more and more contributors this year

00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,539
or more people that are actually

00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:19,509
starting to have commit bit and adding

00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:21,759
more and more code it became clearly

00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:22,810
more sustainable and over time the

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,400
amount of time that I'm actually

00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:26,590
spending on it has gone down a lot now

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,090
instead of spending all of my time doing

00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:30,879
this low-level coding stuff I actually

00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:32,439
do a lot more something that's a lot

00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:36,279
more akin to project management i would

00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:37,960
say which is maybe a dreadful idea to

00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:39,969
some programmers but it's actually been

00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,439
really rewarding for me because instead

00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:43,300
of just you know this sort of

00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,580
traditional role of that where it might

00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,229
be like alright we have these ten tasks

00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,849
so you have to do this one and you have

00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:51,189
to do that one you have to do this one

00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:53,080
it's more situation where people come in

00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:55,509
and say i'm really excited about this

00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,310
particular thing but i don't have the

00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:59,440
background yet to do it can you help me

00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,240
and it's really rewarding to be like

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,500
actually yes i can help you and that

00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,759
would be amazing because that's one

00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,580
fewer thing that I need to worry about

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,039
and I'm struggling so yes definitely

00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:11,620
what can I do like just you know ask

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,839
away so the nice thing was you know i

00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:16,000
got from having all of this dread to now

00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,229
being excited and you know now somebody

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,339
opens an issue and I'm like this is

00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:20,289
great this is a chance for me to

00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:22,839
interact with someone who is interested

00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:25,419
in this software already and maybe just

00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:27,189
doesn't realize that they're looking for

00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:30,310
an opportunity to contribute so how can

00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:31,839
i convert this person from passing

00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,880
interest in to somebody that's that's

00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,229
actively engaged and that can solve

00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,419
their own problems how can i empower

00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:40,810
this person to be an open-source

00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:43,419
contributor so before I was kind of in

00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:44,860
this maintenance mode right and it was

00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:49,329
all about fixing issues as soon as

00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:51,339
possible right and so for me this is

00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:53,890
kind of the difference between a

00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:56,199
gardener and somebody that does topiary

00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:58,360
right I think that's the right word I

00:08:56,199 --> 00:09:00,420
would rather be doing a creative pursuit

00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:04,240
I'd rather be sculpting these crazy

00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:05,769
hedge sculpture things right making

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,929
these huge elephants or whatever

00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:09,670
then necessarily just trimming the bush

00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:12,939
so that it's still three feet high and

00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:14,739
two feet deep and that's maybe not for

00:09:12,939 --> 00:09:16,149
everyone but for me at least I did not

00:09:14,739 --> 00:09:17,589
want to just be in this situation where

00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:19,119
all I was trying to do was make sure

00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:21,160
that the house didn't fall over right

00:09:19,119 --> 00:09:22,869
it's not really interesting every day I

00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,279
didn't want to just go back out and lean

00:09:22,869 --> 00:09:27,699
against the house to make sure that it

00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:29,379
didn't collapse right so you know there

00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:30,910
was originally this sort of idea that

00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:32,350
all I was trying to do is make sure the

00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:34,029
house didn't fall down because if it did

00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:35,529
it would be obvious that I was an

00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:37,809
incompetent builder and I had hoped that

00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:39,399
that was not really the case but you

00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:40,869
know I was young enough especially that

00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:42,220
I wasn't confident that it wasn't the

00:09:40,869 --> 00:09:44,799
case right there might have actually

00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,360
been some terrible deficit in the code

00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,069
that I just didn't realize yet so I was

00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,259
always fighting to make sure that that

00:09:48,069 --> 00:09:51,730
didn't come out that you know if there

00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:55,329
was I was the one that found it instead

00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:56,949
of somebody else and I realized that the

00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:59,170
much better place to be was in this sort

00:09:56,949 --> 00:10:00,879
of mentor role right so it wasn't about

00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:02,739
fixing the issue soon as possible it was

00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:04,389
about opening a discussion about the

00:10:02,739 --> 00:10:06,399
issue as soon as possible seeing where

00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:08,019
that person was really coming from how

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,119
they got to that issue right is it that

00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:12,069
they did something that I just never

00:10:10,119 --> 00:10:13,899
thought of is it that they did something

00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:16,689
that everybody does but it's not well

00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:18,160
documented and maybe most people happen

00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:19,929
to have this background that this person

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,790
doesn't so they didn't realize that this

00:10:19,929 --> 00:10:23,319
one step is always necessary but it

00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:25,839
wasn't in the documentation right or

00:10:23,319 --> 00:10:28,480
whatever it might be sometimes the the

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,009
actual issue that appears to be

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,629
presented to you and the issue that

00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:34,329
needs to be solved are not the same

00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:37,449
thing right so it's really important to

00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:38,949
discuss it instead and try as much as

00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:41,559
possible to find out how you can help

00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:43,449
this person help themselves because that

00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:45,160
might be that oh well ultimately what we

00:10:43,449 --> 00:10:47,110
need to do is add these two extra lines

00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,610
into the readme and then no one will

00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:50,889
ever have this problem again including

00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:52,839
you and you now know how you can get

00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:54,699
help right maybe it's just asking me but

00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:56,199
maybe I can point you and say well here

00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:58,179
are the parts of the code where it

00:10:56,199 --> 00:10:59,799
actually makes it necessary that these

00:10:58,179 --> 00:11:01,509
two lines of the readme be there right

00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:02,799
and next time if you run into another

00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:04,540
problem thats related to that you can

00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:05,679
point to that or if you find out that

00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,389
somebody else has run into this problem

00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:08,589
you see a stack overflow question or

00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:12,369
whatever you now can answer that

00:11:08,589 --> 00:11:13,929
question so this sort of very

00:11:12,369 --> 00:11:15,519
counterintuitive lesson I learned over

00:11:13,929 --> 00:11:18,309
time is that one of the worst things I

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,440
ever did for my open source project was

00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:21,840
to solve the bugs

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,450
it was just a terrible idea it was just

00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,250
burning me completely out and I just I

00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,350
couldn't keep up and this may not be the

00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,700
case for every project I certainly have

00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:31,710
other open source projects where this is

00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,600
not nearly as much the case as fog and

00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:35,490
I'd be happy to go into why I think

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,170
there are some differences there but for

00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:40,770
fog fixing the bugs was actually a huge

00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:42,540
mistake right getting the bugs fixed was

00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:45,240
not a huge mistake and more often than

00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:46,650
not I've been able to convert the people

00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,050
that are having the problem into people

00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:50,550
that are solving those problems right

00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,920
and so I'll go into that a little bit

00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:55,830
more and hopefully that will be

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,000
informative to all of you as well the

00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,890
other thing that I think was a big

00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,380
change was what I was trying to get out

00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:04,530
of it right before it was a lot about

00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:06,780
learning right I hacked a lot because I

00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:08,610
didn't quite know what these interfaces

00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,930
looked like I didn't quite know how easy

00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:11,910
to worked right that was the whole

00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:13,560
reason that I came into this is like I

00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:15,840
want to understand cloud computing and I

00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,600
don't so i hacked around the problem

00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,250
until I understood cloud at least in

00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,480
some working sense even if I don't

00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:26,880
exactly know the nitty-gritty and now

00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:30,030
excuse me it's more about teaching right

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,770
so instead of hacking myself it's about

00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:33,930
advising hackers so that they can skip

00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:35,700
over some of those gotchas skip over

00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:36,870
some of those rough spots that I had to

00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,040
go through because now that I've gone

00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:39,600
through them and I've released this is

00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,700
open source why should somebody else

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,340
have to suffer through those same three

00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:47,430
steps over again right like we are

00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:48,900
sharing the fact that that is not a

00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:51,780
problem anymore we're distributing the

00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:53,490
suffering so to speak so hopefully that

00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,570
others can just skip past that and get

00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:56,100
right to the part where they're doing

00:12:54,570 --> 00:13:00,120
something amazing they've been empowered

00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:01,830
by this so it came to be something where

00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,850
I was sharing the cloud instead of just

00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:07,800
learning it for myself right which

00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:09,750
ultimately i think the lesson to that is

00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,030
just that and this one is perhaps more

00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:14,070
intuitive i hope that the group of

00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:15,810
people working together was much more

00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:18,420
powerful than me working by myself like

00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:20,130
i can't possibly keep all of the code

00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:22,110
base of fog in my head anymore it's like

00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,640
30 or 40 or 50 thousand lines of code or

00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,380
something like there's tons of stuff in

00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,360
there that I've never even touched right

00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:30,600
somebody else wrote it somebody else

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,510
accepted the contribution it is greater

00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,360
than I am

00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:36,600
which is amazing I recommend having a

00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,880
project like that if you can manage it

00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,410
so the thing is you've started these

00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:45,460
discussions but where do you go from

00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:47,380
there right and in some sense and this

00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,790
is where open source deviates again from

00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:51,550
sort of the traditional project

00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:54,190
management sort of situation is that

00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:55,330
it's easy for us to imagine in some

00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:57,340
sense although this doesn't really

00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:59,020
happen as much as it may be did in the

00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,880
80s as I gather or whatever but this

00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,440
sort of idea that getting paid a certain

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,330
number of dollars per line of code that

00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,010
you produce right we can understand that

00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:08,740
it's not exactly how we get paid

00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:11,590
generally but it kind of is right you

00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:13,930
know like you get paid for your hours or

00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:15,280
paid based on salary but you kind of

00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,960
expect it to output a certain amount of

00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,850
code when you're working in the open

00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,680
source land that is not really the case

00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,210
though right so what is it that you're

00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,830
providing these people if it isn't money

00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:27,130
if you would like to keep them motivated

00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:28,570
and keep them engaged right so you know

00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,100
in a lot of ways this sort of idea of

00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:32,380
like providing a certain number of

00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,000
inspirations to the person for each line

00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,190
of code that they produce is a lot less

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,330
intuitive it's lots less clear how we

00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:41,740
actually approach that so I think it's

00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:43,930
important to think about some of the key

00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:46,030
motivators that are intrinsic right

00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:47,260
because that is more what we're looking

00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,880
at in the open source world and

00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,410
something that I think has kept me

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:54,700
coming back to the open source world at

00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:57,670
times where like drawing up in the

00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:59,380
Midwest in Iowa there wasn't a huge

00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:01,240
development community so there were a

00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,440
lot of times where like I wanted to grow

00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,210
as a programmer but there weren't people

00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,490
that I could easily turn to to do that

00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:08,560
so I turn to open source to find those

00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:11,490
people right because they could be

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,810
anywhere then or if I'm at a job where

00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:16,060
which has happened a couple times to me

00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:18,310
I've gotten kind of bored right I'm

00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:20,440
disengaging I'm having a hard time sort

00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:21,910
of continuing to enjoy programming

00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,560
because the job isn't providing that to

00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:25,720
me I've turned to open source as a way

00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,520
to have still that enjoyment and

00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,290
remember that excitement that was

00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,170
kindled within me that you know set me

00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:33,550
down this path in the first place so the

00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:35,230
key motivators that we need to keep in

00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:38,080
mind when we're trying to do this the

00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:39,430
first of them is autonomy right so I

00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,720
think it's really important that when

00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,800
you engage in these discussions with

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,110
people and you're talking to them about

00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,010
helping you on your open source project

00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:48,490
you

00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:50,380
not be saying here on this line you

00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,940
should change this character on this

00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:54,670
other line you should make this very

00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:57,760
specific change you should say oh well I

00:15:54,670 --> 00:16:00,160
think we have a problem I think in broad

00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,810
you know high level terms this is what

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,610
we're talking about here maybe a couple

00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:04,930
files that you should look at here's

00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:07,270
some documentation that will be helpful

00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:08,500
but leave it to them to figure out

00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:10,720
exactly how they want to put those

00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,280
pieces together right there's plenty of

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,260
opportunities the pull request system is

00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,700
pretty amazing in terms of if they make

00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,620
a mistake in that process you can deal

00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,150
with it afterward you don't need to try

00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,500
to tell them every single thing they're

00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:23,050
going to do along the way or they are

00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:25,930
going to hate you and never come back

00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:28,180
probably so it's important to still

00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:30,580
given that freedom to work within the

00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,930
construct of your project the next one

00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,700
is mastery and this is one that I've

00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:35,890
turned to open source for again and

00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:38,200
again because it's very easy within a

00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:40,420
particular job to get to a point where

00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,310
you pretty much know the ropes you're

00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:44,230
kind of just repeating the same thing on

00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:45,640
a day to day basis but you can go to an

00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,990
open source project and something that

00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,450
you're a little bit less familiar with

00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:51,190
and it's very easy to ratchet up what

00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:53,080
you know about whatever that open source

00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:54,790
project might be covering and by

00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,020
actually contributing and working

00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,100
closely with the people that are

00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,830
committing on it that are actually

00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,930
experts this is definitely an area where

00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:03,370
it can be easy to rash it up that level

00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:06,220
of mastery that you have and whatever

00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:07,720
the project might be focused on and the

00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,670
last one is purpose which i think is

00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,040
also really valuable right so as I said

00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:14,380
for fog for me there were kind of two

00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:18,100
things one was learning cloud and one

00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:19,810
was empowering people to be able to do

00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,490
cool things because they didn't have to

00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:23,020
first think about infrastructure it

00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:25,690
could move past the infrastructure right

00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:26,949
to doing the cool stuff and I wanted to

00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:28,390
share that as much as possible with

00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:29,680
people and I think I still do so a lot

00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,960
of people that are coming in and

00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,430
contributing our people that have

00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,110
already taken what I've given them and

00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:36,760
are already doing something cool but

00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:38,850
then they hit an edge where they were

00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:42,100
like we did something really cool for

00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:44,140
three weeks and then we wanted to do

00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:46,990
this other cool thing and something was

00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:48,520
missing we got stuck how can we get to

00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:50,860
having that fourth week of really cool

00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,330
stuff and you say oh well I can help you

00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,860
with that right you should look at this

00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:55,780
line and this line and you should check

00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:57,789
out these two files and I think we need

00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:00,070
to do something roughly like you know

00:17:57,789 --> 00:18:01,840
this other part of the software and we

00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:03,549
can pull these things together you know

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,529
and I'd be happy to answer any questions

00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:09,580
you might have but that is where you

00:18:05,529 --> 00:18:12,850
know you draw the line so the first is

00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:14,529
autonomy again and to go into a little

00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:16,359
bit more specific it's it's all about

00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:18,100
giving help and not orders right this is

00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:20,109
the project management sort of maybe

00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,970
traditionally hopefully not at any place

00:18:20,109 --> 00:18:23,559
that we work as much as possible because

00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:25,779
I at least don't work in this situation

00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:28,149
very well but it's all about giving them

00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:29,559
the help that they need to do the things

00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:31,899
within your project not giving them

00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:34,899
orders of what they're going to do or

00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:37,210
how they're going to do it and mastery

00:18:34,899 --> 00:18:38,710
is about both teaching and learning I

00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:41,049
learned a lot at first when I was

00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:43,359
working on fog by just producing lots of

00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:44,889
code that did things but I think in a

00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:48,279
lot of ways I learned even more now by

00:18:44,889 --> 00:18:49,869
coaching someone through writing service

00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:50,950
that I've never even heard of right like

00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:53,409
I learned a lot about what those

00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:54,940
different services do and don't do what

00:18:53,409 --> 00:18:56,470
holes I may have left in the interface

00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,940
the first time through because I didn't

00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:00,639
realize that there was this class of

00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:02,889
problems that is out there that you know

00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:04,389
things like that like I learned a lot

00:19:02,889 --> 00:19:06,269
through my interactions with these

00:19:04,389 --> 00:19:10,090
people that I would not otherwise

00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:11,979
another big one for me which is comes

00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:13,269
also from this as as i mentor these

00:19:11,979 --> 00:19:14,799
people i think that it is really

00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:17,139
valuable for me to gain that extra

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,940
perspective like I'm so related to the

00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:21,039
project now that I do not have a good

00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:23,229
perspective from the outside of what it

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,879
is like to work on or use my project

00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:26,320
anymore so anytime I interact with these

00:19:24,879 --> 00:19:28,330
people that are new they're coming in

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,859
they're saying I've used this project

00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:33,580
for the first time on three weeks in I

00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:35,200
ran into this bug I'm like oh I can see

00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,639
how it would be really easy to not

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,320
realize you needed to do these two

00:19:36,639 --> 00:19:39,639
things it's not documented anywhere I'm

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,559
amazed that somebody hasn't run into

00:19:39,639 --> 00:19:43,450
this before but I would never think of

00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:45,489
it because I have you know the

00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:47,229
configuration file is on all of my

00:19:45,489 --> 00:19:48,429
laptops already I never run into the

00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:49,899
problem that the config file is missing

00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:51,669
right like it just doesn't happen to me

00:19:49,899 --> 00:19:53,649
you know like little things like that

00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:56,169
you just don't see unless you have these

00:19:53,649 --> 00:20:00,940
new people coming in and continuing to

00:19:56,169 --> 00:20:03,039
you know kindle fire so purpose a big

00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:05,080
part of this I think is to take great

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:08,379
care in the language that you use within

00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:10,059
these discussions I have been accused

00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:11,320
more than once of being overly sort of

00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:14,720
Flowery with my language

00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:16,070
especially by people within like support

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,419
or other things or like well you've

00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:19,309
solved the problem you don't need to say

00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:21,019
like please and thank you 10 extra times

00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:23,659
at the end of it but I think in a lot of

00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:25,190
cases you actually do right it doesn't

00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:29,029
really take me that much extra time and

00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:31,549
I really am thankful and emotion is hard

00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:33,889
to convey with in textual information

00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:36,139
right so like if I'm thankful I want to

00:20:33,889 --> 00:20:37,999
say could you please try this I would

00:20:36,139 --> 00:20:40,009
really appreciate it I do appreciate

00:20:37,999 --> 00:20:42,739
what you have done thank you is there

00:20:40,009 --> 00:20:44,210
anything else I can do like it's because

00:20:42,739 --> 00:20:45,799
I really feel that way and I need to say

00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,600
it four times because they can't see my

00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:49,909
face they can't see that emotion that I

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,190
have that yes thank you so much I really

00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:54,649
appreciate that you have taken your time

00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:56,539
without me paying you money or anything

00:20:54,649 --> 00:20:57,950
else to come in and help me out on

00:20:56,539 --> 00:21:02,269
something that we can both benefit from

00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:04,460
that's amazing like really thank you so

00:21:02,269 --> 00:21:06,799
you know as much as possible I try to

00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:08,419
use that as an opportunity to broadcast

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,519
the excitement that I do have and try to

00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:12,230
make sure that they can share on that

00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,309
because it is awesome and I don't want

00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,289
to just take all the credit for this

00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:17,210
project like I did work my butt off on

00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:18,889
it for a while I still work on it a lot

00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:20,269
but like it wasn't me that made this

00:21:18,889 --> 00:21:21,950
project it was all the people that have

00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:26,389
contributed to it which is an

00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:28,549
ever-growing number thankfully so for

00:21:26,389 --> 00:21:30,139
you those of you that however are not

00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:31,340
maintaining an open source project I

00:21:30,139 --> 00:21:34,429
think there's still a lot to be gained

00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:35,960
from this you know sort of what can a

00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:37,700
little old me do because I'm not running

00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:41,359
this big project how is this really

00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:43,429
helpful to me um I skipped forward too

00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:46,279
much so one of the big things I think is

00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:52,639
and something that I tried to do is not

00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:56,059
every maintainer one second dramatic

00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:57,649
pause um not every maintainer is going

00:21:56,059 --> 00:22:01,129
to have the same outlook on this that I

00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:03,169
do for a better or worse I don't know

00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:05,239
it's worked really well for me your

00:22:03,169 --> 00:22:06,590
mileage may vary of course but that

00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:08,299
doesn't mean that you can't do what I

00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:09,739
usually do now which is that if I

00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:12,080
actually run into a bug on somebody's

00:22:09,739 --> 00:22:15,619
project if I file an issue I don't say

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,570
you did this wrong I say this seems to

00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:19,190
be a problem what can I do right i I

00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:21,409
don't know enough about your project yet

00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:23,290
to fix this but if you can give me some

00:22:21,409 --> 00:22:24,850
guidance I really do want to

00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:27,280
this like I don't want you to fix this

00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:29,590
actually look I want to fix this I want

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,510
to learn more I want to understand

00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:34,060
what's going on and unfortunately I do

00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:36,700
not yet understand but if you could give

00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:42,040
me a little bit of your time I can make

00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:43,690
this happen right so consider as you

00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,970
work on open source and as you see these

00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:47,980
opportunities what kind of language you

00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:49,690
are using also towards maintainer

00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:51,280
because I think that can really

00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:53,410
influence the way that they react to you

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,390
if you just come in and say you broke

00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:57,760
this right you released a minor version

00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:59,290
and it is broken now it's unlikely that

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,120
they're gonna respond in like a happy

00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:02,680
friendly Oh what can we do about this

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,140
how can I help right they're gonna be

00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:07,600
like oh whoa whoa alright it's time for

00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:11,920
me to be on the defensive now so first

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:13,390
off you're a jerk and then I don't even

00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,250
know I'm not even going to fix this bug

00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:16,840
because it was a jerk that reported it

00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:19,030
so it must not really be an important

00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:21,160
bug right I mean it just it sets things

00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:23,590
on a really bad foot and unfortunately I

00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:25,390
can attest to as someone who works on a

00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:29,740
pretty somewhat large open source

00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:31,150
project now it is all too common to get

00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,620
discouraged as a maintainer of these

00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:36,280
projects because almost all of the

00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:38,430
feedback you get is through issues so it

00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,780
can be easy at times to feel like

00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:43,060
everybody hates you and that your

00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:47,170
project is awful because almost all you

00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:48,880
ever get is you broke this what is wrong

00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:50,860
with you this was the most important use

00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,320
case because it's my use case and it is

00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:54,880
not a use case that works anymore you

00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,290
know you should never do this again

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,560
you're a terrible human being whatever

00:23:56,290 --> 00:24:01,000
you know which I'm sure is not how most

00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:03,450
people feel about it most people just

00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,270
don't tell me anything at all and so

00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:11,470
unfortunately silence can be deafening I

00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:13,360
suppose anyway things to think about so

00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:14,650
ultimately it's really important I think

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,330
to realize that these conversations

00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:17,530
really define the contexts in which

00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,090
you'll interact with these people

00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:20,800
whether you're maintaining whether

00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:22,990
you're contributing the way that you

00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:28,630
talk to these people is going to define

00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:29,950
what the outcome is so this is something

00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:31,540
that I've talked about before where it's

00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:34,000
the sort of idea that content is this

00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:36,020
bridge between creators and consumers is

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,450
how I used to think about it

00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:40,550
which i think is somewhat flawed and

00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:41,900
that i used to also say the comments

00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:45,230
were the area under the bridge where the

00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:46,310
trolls live right but there's a number

00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:50,030
of things that i think are wrong with

00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:51,440
this right and ultimately that is

00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:54,260
because i think that it should be a

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,390
bridge between people not from one to

00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:58,190
another right i shouldn't be maintaining

00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:00,100
this project because i am a prophet from

00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:02,390
on high that has come down with the

00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,770
magic stones that tell you what the

00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:05,480
commandments are or something right i

00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:07,130
should be maintaining this because it's

00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:10,820
helping me and it's helping you and it

00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:12,890
is valuable right so as much as possible

00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:16,060
lets you know build these bridges

00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:18,320
instead of perhaps tearing them down or

00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:19,460
whatever it is that we do do them right

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,480
now sometimes I don't even know what

00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:25,700
we're doing to them so we should help

00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,980
others to help you know ourselves as

00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:30,350
much as possible whether that be as a

00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:31,910
maintainer who is trying to help

00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:33,860
bootstrap these people they're new to

00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:35,480
the project you know help them with the

00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,730
documentation problems that they don't

00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,230
understand help them to fix the issues

00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:41,030
that they're running into just really

00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:43,370
solving as many of those problems as

00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:45,380
possible by helping them to be better

00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:47,150
developers right that is how you build

00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:48,740
community is by building other people up

00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:50,270
because ultimately the community isn't

00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,740
the software right the community is the

00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,820
people that are in it so as much as

00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:55,190
possible i think that there's an

00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:56,750
important value to focusing on the

00:25:55,190 --> 00:26:01,700
people with an open source instead of

00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:04,040
just the lines of code and you know try

00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,750
to consume less and actually collaborate

00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,820
more right we use open source all the

00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:10,070
time so I you know I'm looking for

00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:14,570
opportunities when I can to give back to

00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:16,700
help out you know so I hope that we can

00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:18,700
all do that right and if any of you have

00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:22,310
questions about any of this by all means

00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:23,690
hit me up I'm happy to try to try to

00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:25,520
tell you at least what my experience has

00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,810
been like in the same way that I like to

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,540
mentor these individuals that are

00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:31,250
working on my project I'd be happy to

00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:32,360
provide any answers to questions you

00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,940
might have about other projects you're

00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:37,870
working on or other situations I think

00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:40,040
probably we will have time for questions

00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:41,990
so you know there's a lot of these

00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:44,630
little things so keep in mind this sort

00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:46,490
of idea of you know it shouldn't be you

00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:48,260
broke it it should be you know how can I

00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:49,320
help how can how can we move this

00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,000
forward not

00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,860
you know this is what happened and it's

00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,740
awful but you know what what can we do

00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:58,200
now where are we headed and you know it

00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:00,059
this sort of hopefully also deals with

00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,169
this ultimate problem which is sort of

00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:02,399
like oh I'm just going to fork your

00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:04,919
project because it's gone in this

00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:06,570
terrible way because you're already

00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:08,070
having conversations along the way right

00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:09,990
like it shouldn't turn to this point

00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:14,519
where suddenly you're at such a

00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:16,080
different point sort of philosophically

00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:17,720
about how this problem should be solved

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,919
that you need to write a whole new

00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:22,080
project that duplicates all of this

00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,460
effort that people have made in order to

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,570
make this other philosophical choice

00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,580
because you should be having those

00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:28,019
discussions earlier on and you should

00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:30,360
understand where each other coming from

00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:33,570
so that you know why that decision was

00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:35,490
made because I at least as a naive or

00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:37,620
younger person have more than once

00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:41,759
basically started to fork and rewrite

00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:44,970
something and then been like oh that's

00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:46,230
why they did that and there's no reason

00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,940
that I should have had to come to that

00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:49,830
conclusion on my own a week into a

00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,789
project right there's no reason I should

00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,200
have probably forked it in the first

00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:57,029
place but that's a whole other can of

00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:59,460
worms and ultimately you know I think it

00:27:57,029 --> 00:28:01,769
should become not you should but we

00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:04,710
could write how can we move this forward

00:28:01,769 --> 00:28:07,860
what can we do so a little bit of

00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:09,330
homework first off as you're interacting

00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:11,340
with these people as you're doing things

00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:13,230
try to seek this engagement through

00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,730
conversation right there's all these

00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:16,740
opportunities and the interactions that

00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:18,860
we have every day that I think get

00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,730
overlooked right we become we make the

00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:24,090
conversation about the problem and not

00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:26,399
about the people and do what you can to

00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:27,840
keep that motivation flowing it can be

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,669
all too easy and a big open source

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,529
project like I said getting nothing but

00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:34,169
negative feedback working your butt off

00:28:31,529 --> 00:28:35,669
to fix these issues or whatever else you

00:28:34,169 --> 00:28:37,860
know it can be easy to lose sight of the

00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:39,870
goal and to not be happy and excited

00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:41,610
about it anymore so do what you can to

00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:44,730
keep the motivation flowing both for the

00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:46,259
creators and for you know the people

00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:47,460
that are participating I highly

00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:48,809
encourage you if you have a project that

00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:51,029
you use all the time and you really love

00:28:48,809 --> 00:28:52,769
it to just let the person that works on

00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:54,690
that project that maintains it know that

00:28:52,769 --> 00:28:56,789
you really appreciate that it can really

00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:58,110
brighten their day so I've seen more

00:28:56,789 --> 00:29:00,899
than one person do it and it's awesome

00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:02,770
just go on Twitter and say hey thank you

00:29:00,899 --> 00:29:06,810
for this project I really

00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:09,460
appreciate it is amazing and ultimately

00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:10,990
you know skip the bugs and fix the

00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,580
misunderstandings right because that's

00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:14,320
what the root of almost all of these

00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:16,900
problems are going to be person doesn't

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,940
understand where you're coming from or

00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:21,730
vice versa you know that is more often

00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:24,790
the bug in the software not some line of

00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:26,590
code or some misplaced character and

00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:31,030
ultimately just be the culture you want

00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:32,650
to see right so I would be happy to

00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:34,360
answer any questions I know that's kind

00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:36,700
of a high level thing some people maybe
