welcome to Aloha Ruby come my name is

00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:24,259
Evan Mac Nick and we're going to coat on

00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,550
kind of a little journey maybe a little

00:00:24,259 --> 00:00:27,860
bit of a conversation between the two of

00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:32,660
us and it's going to be more or less

00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:34,760
about rails developmental windows no no

00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:40,070
really we're actually gonna talk about

00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:42,530
this and the thing is before we get

00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:46,219
started actually let's go ahead and do a

00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,660
little bit introductions and I hear that

00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:49,850
it's actually pretty good to get started

00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:53,420
with a cat picture right people like

00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:57,289
cats right so my name is Devin Mac Nick

00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:59,719
as I said and I've been doing Ruby /

00:00:57,289 --> 00:01:04,100
Ruby on Rails I'll run with this Mike

00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:06,710
it's cool okay yeah I've been doing Ruby

00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:09,170
/ Ruby on Rails since about two thousand

00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,940
eight I got my start in college which is

00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:15,920
amazing because most places teach

00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:18,340
terrible web development especially with

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:22,700
root you know in terms of ruby on rails

00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:25,790
I'm an application support engineer for

00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,080
engine yard which basically means I sit

00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,210
on the computer all day and help people

00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,160
you know deploy on our platform or use

00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:34,750
our platform or you know anything else

00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:37,700
in terms of you know stack related stuff

00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:40,880
and you can also find me at broad

00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:43,730
magnetin which is kind of like a you

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,500
know it's a really bad blog but I right

00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,970
there every now and then but uh you know

00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,850
the other information is there as well

00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:52,460
you know go find out information about

00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:58,310
me there so let's talk about the

00:01:52,460 --> 00:02:00,410
elephant in the room windows really gets

00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:02,090
no love whatsoever and this is kind of

00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:05,320
the traditional thing but the thing is

00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:07,340
like it's it's not really exactly true

00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,929
because there have been a lot of people

00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,369
that have you know put it put in a lot

00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:12,110
of effort to try to get windows it's

00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:14,510
kind of like a first class citizen but

00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:16,580
still like you know it's it's there's

00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:20,330
still a very unix II feel to you know

00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:23,060
Ruby itself and so anybody that's ever

00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:24,769
tried to use it on windows will notice

00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,970
that you know the you know either your

00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:28,850
gems don't work or

00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:31,760
are just weird stuff happens and it's a

00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:33,980
lot of it's not really explainable and

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,780
the thing about this that's kind of

00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:38,570
disturbing is that twenty-five percent

00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,430
of re-trial users for engine yard come

00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:44,330
from windows which if you think about it

00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:45,760
you know we do you know thousands a good

00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,590
amount of customers ain't no every month

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,820
and a quarter of that is coming from

00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,110
windows that I mean that's that's a

00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,970
pretty staggering number if you think

00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:56,090
about it and these are people that you

00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:59,060
know maybe they might not have a lot of

00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:01,430
experience with programming in general

00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,680
and they're picking up Ruby on Rails you

00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:05,150
know for their first thing which I

00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:08,980
wouldn't have done but hey you know it's

00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:12,080
we've made it pretty easy to get running

00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:15,860
so instead of having this attitude you

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,950
know where you know dude your windows

00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:20,900
kind of go away you know there's a

00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:24,020
couple people in the community that have

00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:26,930
had the attitude let's make a package

00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:28,040
that installs everything to get to make

00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,400
it easier for people to get up and

00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,870
running really quickly so we've got

00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,269
rales installer that installs all these

00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,850
packages and you're the basically the

00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:39,050
only thing you're missing right here to

00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,700
start writing full-blown applications is

00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,890
a text editor I mean if you want to

00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,320
count for huh you know notepad as a text

00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:48,769
editor good go ahead but you'll have a

00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:52,370
lot of fun with that one but because of

00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:54,590
this this is pre rails installed on Mac

00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,269
OS 10 it's actually it was actually

00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,739
easier to get up and running on Windows

00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:59,090
and it wasn't a Mac I mean yeah with a

00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:01,730
Mac you open another thing up and you

00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:03,380
gotta you know in there install xcode or

00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:05,180
say GCC you know some of those other

00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,549
things because you know apple doesn't

00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:11,750
want to give you the opportunity to

00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:13,670
build packages right so these guys you

00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:16,640
know built in a really nice package just

00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:18,260
installs everything you can in about 20

00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,930
minutes you know download and install

00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:25,340
everything you can get up and running I

00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:26,930
know right so this is a Gris is great

00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:29,780
news you know you can do all this stuff

00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:31,400
very quickly but the problem with that

00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:36,590
is you still have a lot of customers who

00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:37,880
feel like this and i mean i'll tell you

00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,560
when i first started doing this and

00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,840
started exploring this topic

00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:45,710
I felt like this a lot of times you know

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,300
and I kind of took it like you know so

00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,410
kind of for granted that you know I knew

00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,880
I knew what I was doing with ruby on

00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:52,100
rails so you know just you know throw it

00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,169
all on windows and not be good to go but

00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,090
I i did find myself a lot of times just

00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:57,290
just really getting angry with a

00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,820
computer my wife could tell you she's

00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:03,669
like dude he just does not want to be in

00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:05,480
windows at all so i felt you know i

00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:06,860
started out with like a virtualized

00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,080
environment so i felt i needed to really

00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,520
jump into it you know headfirst you know

00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,780
kind of feel exactly what everybody's

00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:16,639
experiencing because otherwise you know

00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:17,750
you really have no great context so the

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,580
first thing you need to know there

00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,419
there's basically two ways I mean you

00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,430
know you there's a couple different

00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:24,050
virtualizing things but there's two ways

00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:25,880
you can either virtualize your

00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:29,060
environment so where are you you know

00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:31,250
you run windows inside your Mac ok I'm

00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:34,520
coming from a mac so bear with me if

00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:35,600
you're actually on windows so there's

00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,340
basically two ways you can run you can

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,470
run a virtualized environment you know

00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:41,990
either in like parallels or vmware so

00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:43,700
you know you're still you're still in

00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:45,890
your Mac you know some of them actually

00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,240
uh you know abstract things out to where

00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,890
you kind of run a program but it still

00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,200
looks like it's in a Mac but that

00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:53,060
doesn't really give you you know the

00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:57,560
experience all right so the other option

00:05:53,060 --> 00:06:01,010
is boot camp and boot camp is a

00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,900
wonderful thing because it makes it very

00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:04,789
easy for you to get get up and running

00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,200
you don't really have to think about

00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:08,180
anything you just kind of click buttons

00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,440
and you have windows installed on a

00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:13,400
separate partition you can do a boot

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,710
really easily so this is great it also

00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:19,490
gives you the ability to get completely

00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:22,520
immersed in windows which I mean that's

00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:23,660
a scary topic but but I mean that's the

00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,710
only way you're going to actually get a

00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,910
feel for this stuff you know they

00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:30,020
literally I could get a feel for this

00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:32,150
stuff you know so I've done the boot

00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:35,090
camp stuff you know I've installed

00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:38,120
windows and i'm running windows 7 not

00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:40,280
even to touch windows 8 but what's next

00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,229
after you get up and running there well

00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:45,590
you basically need your Ruby on Rails

00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:47,330
environment setup and with a ruby on

00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,800
rails environment you know to really be

00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,229
able to develop an application a

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,430
full-blown application and also kind of

00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:53,180
you know collaborate with other people

00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,699
because we liked

00:06:53,180 --> 00:07:00,080
do that right what do you need so you

00:06:55,699 --> 00:07:02,120
need Ruby and rails obviously with

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,880
Windows you also need a sequel light

00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:07,250
because that's kind of you know mixed

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,199
development very easy you also need get

00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:11,300
because everybody wants to be able to

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:15,669
share code or you know use code with

00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:17,539
everybody else and svn sucks and you all

00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:21,229
you need a way to build native

00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:25,880
extensions and so what exactly is native

00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:29,030
extensions well on unix you Ruby's

00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,560
built-in see right so on unix you know

00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:34,039
it's not a prize it's not a problem just

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:37,099
so you know compile your stuff with a c

00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:40,550
compiler but on windows and just

00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:42,620
gets weird so you really just need a way

00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:45,500
to compile those extensions and use

00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:49,580
those same gems in those libraries that

00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:53,840
you're used to using but in a in a win32

00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:56,150
environment so i decided to make it easy

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,190
on myself and you know i may go on a

00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:01,520
disclaimer i work for engine yard we you

00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:04,070
know sponsored rails installer so i

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,510
figured that's the best way to go you

00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:07,370
know the users coming in doing our trial

00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,419
or using the same software so this is

00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,909
what i'm going to use i'm not gonna you

00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:12,770
know i actually went down the road to

00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:15,169
you know compile my own stuff and see

00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:16,699
how that goes but ray lacelle that makes

00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:19,970
analyze it a lot easier if you actually

00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:22,610
want to do this so you've installed

00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:24,229
rails installer let me go actually on a

00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,580
tangent talk about my workflow a bit

00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:26,870
before we get into kind of the next

00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,150
thing about you know after you've ever

00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:34,640
after you've installed everything so

00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:37,219
with a mac it's very command-line

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,900
oriented if you want it to be and I i

00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:44,360
love the command line I kind of live in

00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:46,760
it so my editor of choices fit and you

00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,589
know when i'm writing stuff you know I

00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,690
open up VIN real you know real quick you

00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:52,430
know edit a file if I want to actually

00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:54,200
open up full folder you can I can do

00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:55,970
that too but I usually tend to just edit

00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,620
file as you know switch to a new file

00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,850
open it up another file whatever but

00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,470
it's all done in the command line and I

00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:04,520
like that because it kind of makes the

00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:05,420
context schist a lot easier but the

00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:10,690
thing is

00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:12,650
vim really sucks on Windows and I mean

00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:15,500
say what you will you know I've done it

00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:17,060
I've done it both ways but it's it's

00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,210
really i mean its crop cross-platform

00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:21,050
but it's really not made for that it's

00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:23,270
really made for being running the

00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:25,610
command line yes you have GV m which is

00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:28,010
a graphical way but it really it's I

00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:31,070
mean I kind of butt heads a lot when I

00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:33,080
was trying to do that the other part of

00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:35,720
my workflow that really kind of makes

00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,560
sense what this stuff is spaces and I

00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,510
don't remember what it's called a

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:43,130
mountain lion they'd done it or lie

00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:44,630
whatever but I like to switch a lot of

00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:47,480
times back and forth between multiple

00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:48,680
desktops and I mean if you've done this

00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,110
on a Mac it's really nice and easy

00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,250
everything works really well fast same

00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:54,560
thing on Linux you know i used to use

00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,910
linux as well and just you know switch

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,350
of different desktops make things easier

00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,910
like you know i can have an editor open

00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:00,800
in one screen you know say i have

00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,000
browser open another screen you know

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,410
this kind of stuff to wear it you know I

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,060
kind of separate my stuff but i still

00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:10,010
can switch back and forth really quickly

00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:13,460
without having to do alt tab that's not

00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:18,200
on windows so it kind of makes my whole

00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:19,850
workflow go to go to crap I mean so I

00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,370
had to kind of think about things from a

00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:26,720
different perspective I really kind of

00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:27,920
take a different approach so I kind of

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,260
went back to the drawing board when i

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:34,430
started with with Ruby and rails it was

00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:37,970
in Windows but I also started because

00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:40,670
it's kind of encouraged by our professor

00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:42,470
to use what's called an IDE if you've

00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:44,050
never done it heard of that it's an

00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:46,400
integrated development environment and

00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:48,320
all it does is really gives you kind of

00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,660
the terminal you might get a browser as

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,070
well but you also get your text editor

00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:57,650
all in one kind of nice little package

00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:59,840
deprogram and after really fighting to

00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:02,080
not go this way I kind of succumbed to

00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,980
the fact that if you're on Windows

00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,770
everything's kind of focused on one

00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:09,590
window being full screen this is a lot

00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:12,400
of people's workflow so using an IDE

00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:15,620
really makes sense in this environment

00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:17,620
so that's what I did and then I tried a

00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,850
couple of different like I tried Reuben

00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:22,630
aptana I kind of settled on aptana but

00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:25,089
you know it's all kind of personal

00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:26,140
preference there and the thing is I've

00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:28,540
always had kind of a love hate

00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:29,800
relationship with IDs and this is also

00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,960
why I didn't really want to go back to

00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:35,170
that if I didn't have to because you

00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:39,100
know on one hand I des are mostly

00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:40,630
overkill for for rails development like

00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,029
a lot of times what I would i need to do

00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:44,860
is I need to open up a file edit it

00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:46,600
really quickly and check you know what's

00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:49,210
going on in my browser see how things

00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,710
are working so you know I don't need to

00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:52,060
open a whole program that's why I like

00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:57,190
using vim the command line it's just

00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:58,779
really nice and light but they also make

00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,920
things very convenient like I said you

00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:01,870
know everything is packaged into one

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,960
program so you have all these things you

00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:06,250
know and I don't do the browser in

00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,950
program because I think I think that's

00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,660
just kind of weird but you know I can

00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:12,520
still you know edit stuff in the program

00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,140
on the text editor and then just press a

00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,390
button or key combination which is

00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:17,950
probably faster you know to run my

00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:20,620
server or run my tests or whatever and

00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:22,330
you know check how things are going so

00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,270
it really makes things easy especially

00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:26,440
if you're running Windows just like

00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:32,140
that's kind of how things should be in

00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:33,790
there so you've got things set up and

00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:36,430
you can write your application now ok

00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:38,529
the next thing that really kind of

00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:43,180
throws you know threw me for a loop was

00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:44,589
testing and the first thing I did when I

00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,180
you know I i created my rails

00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:48,220
application so the first thing I wanted

00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:50,080
to do is say okay I want to write a test

00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,550
you know to see you know whatever maybe

00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:55,680
I want to check that you know check that

00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:57,430
everything's wired up correctly and I

00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,089
experience a little bit of agony because

00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:05,230
of the fact that Windows is just really

00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:06,490
really slow at least MRI ok this is this

00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,830
is what we're talking about here it's

00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:11,560
just really really slow and this you

00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,880
know is mainly due to the fact that you

00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,700
know it's it's really never been

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,160
emphasized in this environment you know

00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:21,070
so just things just are you know it

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,620
takes take probably good you know 30

00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:25,690
seconds 45 seconds to you know to run a

00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,430
test and I'm not even reloading the

00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:30,640
rails environment I'm just running you

00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:31,130
know we're running Ruby on a mini test

00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,770
or something

00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:36,170
like that you know it's really the

00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:38,960
reason that you know for it takes so

00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:42,170
long it just it was kind of baffling so

00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:45,500
we have our friend google and if you're

00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:48,380
if you're running I mean windows this is

00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,790
a kind of a huge Savior because a lot of

00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:52,400
times you know somebody's kind of run

00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:55,190
into this issue before but you know I

00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,230
have no idea so I'm hitting google and

00:13:55,190 --> 00:14:00,550
I'm saying okay how can i make my test

00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:04,910
faster on windows and it turns out that

00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:06,320
MRI is really the big culprit here and i

00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:08,000
don't know all the specifics behind it

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,560
i'm sure you can probably ask you know

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,760
one of the one of the core team members

00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:16,460
about that but that's kind of what all

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,540
you know all the you know blog posts and

00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:20,570
questions and all that kind of stuff

00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:23,210
alluded to so there's a thing called the

00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:26,180
code shop and you know they have they

00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:27,850
have like a github section where you can

00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:30,080
actually go there and what they do

00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:33,200
they're kind of mission is to make

00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:35,810
windows you know or ruby running out

00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,520
windows a lot easier and faster so if

00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,720
you're going to run you know if you're

00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,250
going to do some rails development

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,360
you're going to run Ruby on windows this

00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,790
is about what you're going to want to go

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,620
to and so I mean if you want to check it

00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:47,300
out you can always check it out it you

00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:50,090
know that's the github page but

00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:52,130
basically i took this you know they're

00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:53,720
there Ruby you know which is it has a

00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:55,400
lot of patches you can do all this stuff

00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,650
manually if you want to but they've kind

00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:00,860
of package everything up and kind of

00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:02,240
shimmed it into the rails installer Ruby

00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:05,180
right there I just you know basically

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,380
just takes making you know changing your

00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,850
path and you know kind of point and

00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,170
stuff differently so it actually where

00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:14,240
it's actually a lot easier than it

00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:16,130
sounds so this cause you know less agony

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,290
I can actually run tests it's it cut it

00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:20,510
cut the test about half you know about

00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:22,070
half the time which is still you know

00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:24,380
it's kind of slow but it's acceptable

00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:28,190
like you know I can I can run a test and

00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:30,320
I don't have to go to Twitter another

00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:32,450
thing is so you know I've got these

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,510
tests running now and I love guard you

00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:37,670
know I use it you know when i'm in when

00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:39,020
I'm in Mac to be able to you know do

00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,640
stuff so I don't have to do it every

00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,500
time i'm all about automating things and

00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,970
guard makes it easy to kind of you know

00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,399
setup stuff

00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:48,709
you know run tests automatically you

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,500
know if they fail you know does all that

00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:55,129
stuff ematic you know but the thing is

00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:58,819
like guard sucks on windows into what I

00:15:55,129 --> 00:16:00,199
kept running into the problem where if a

00:15:58,819 --> 00:16:02,000
test failed it would run it over and

00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:03,769
over I don't know it over it never

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,509
stopped running which is really really

00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:09,470
neurotic so I decided to kick it old

00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:12,529
school and run with actually uh auto

00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:13,699
test and I know I know although it has

00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:14,990
kind of gotten you know pushed to the

00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:16,399
back of the barn essence card but if

00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:19,250
you're on Windows auto test actually

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,170
works pretty well which means that i was

00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:24,709
able to you know just set it up and it

00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:26,240
wrong stuff again i didn't hit it would

00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:28,310
run my tests they failed then it would

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,089
stop running humming until i fixed it

00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:34,550
and then we run them again so it's nice

00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:38,779
so that kind of brought me to to growl

00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:40,399
and you know with with Mac you have

00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:41,689
growl and it's really nice and we got

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,550
these nice notifications now we have

00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:44,959
Notification Center or you can kind of

00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,579
see how your stuffs actually working

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:50,569
without having to go back to the command

00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:53,149
line and check it and it's always kind

00:16:50,569 --> 00:16:54,680
of its it's not really great on Windows

00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:56,509
I'll tell you that much so if you want

00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:59,389
to actually you know implement this to

00:16:56,509 --> 00:17:02,389
be able to see you know how your tests

00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:06,199
are running it takes a little bit of

00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:08,089
work but I mean that's the only way you

00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:11,480
can really do it so I mean if you want

00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:12,860
to check out growl just you know Google

00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,260
around for it there are people who have

00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:18,799
done it many to test is the way to go if

00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:19,880
you're going to roll with growl so now

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,500
you've got everything set up your right

00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,880
in your writing your applications okay

00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:28,280
you're testing your stuff which is great

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,299
now you want to collaborate and so you

00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,740
know you want you want to be able to

00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:36,049
push your stuff to github collaborate

00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:37,549
you know you got your ssh key set up you

00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:40,820
kind of have two directions you can go

00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:44,620
to in terms of collaboration you can run

00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:48,169
with regular rails installer with the

00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:50,720
you know with with the native you know

00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:52,429
just a regular one Ruby but if you want

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,260
to run multiple rubies you know for your

00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:55,890
color should say so you've got you know

00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:58,680
one of your team members who

00:17:55,890 --> 00:18:01,560
is is running 187 for their application

00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,810
and you want to kind of you know so you

00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:07,650
want to contribute to that well you can

00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:09,450
you can set up you know cygwin rvm I

00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:13,080
mean it kind of goes together in one

00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:16,830
package to be able to switch Ruby's so

00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:20,610
in Windows this is kind of good it

00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:21,750
really a 8 it's kind of a UNIX II feel

00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:23,670
but it doesn't feel like a Windows

00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,380
environment and so you're still kind of

00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:28,290
butting heads if you go this route now

00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:31,460
I've done it our vm does work on cygwin

00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:34,650
but I mean it's not the preferred method

00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:36,180
so you've got another thing let me it's

00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:38,430
awesome for experts only you've got

00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:41,160
another thing called pick and pick is a

00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:45,120
really nice thing if you to switch

00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:47,760
Ruby's on Windows you can also you can

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,320
check it out at the the github page but

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,780
really what it does is it makes it easy

00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:54,120
to you know it's really like our vm but

00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:57,000
built for windows so you you know you

00:18:54,120 --> 00:19:00,360
can actually I should say it's more like

00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,800
rbm you know so you don't have you know

00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,330
gem sets and stuff like that but you can

00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,130
really omit it makes it easy to install

00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:07,470
different gems you can actually install

00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:11,730
iron ruby if you want to try that and go

00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:13,740
the you know the dotnet route but this

00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:15,660
really makes it easy if you know so you

00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,980
can you know go with your with your

00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,230
other teammates and collaborate say I

00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:22,980
want to run you know 190 I can just pick

00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:25,350
192 I want to run 193 i can pick 193 so

00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,910
say say you have like so you know like

00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:28,980
JRuby or Rubinius and you want to

00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:31,560
install that I mean you can install it

00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,970
using pick install but you can also say

00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,930
you want to you know build it with some

00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:36,870
different options or whatever

00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:39,450
configurations you can also install that

00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:42,000
like like you normally would but then

00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:43,710
use pic and say hey pick this is where

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,860
my installation is for you know for

00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:48,840
JRuby Rubinius so you can kind of play

00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,280
around with it it's really it doesn't

00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,940
really a lot of great things in terms of

00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:57,990
windows so that's kind of all I had in

00:19:53,940 --> 00:20:01,070
terms of you know my experience it's a

00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:04,530
lot a lot of its you know still kind of

00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:08,190
new and you know there's a lot of work

00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:09,309
to be done but really it's not the big

00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:13,029
scary monster that it's

00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:14,409
like I I got into it you know well I got

00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:16,360
the talk acceptance and I was like okay

00:20:14,409 --> 00:20:18,909
I'm going to sit in Windows you know I

00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:22,120
like a weekly basis because I don't

00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:23,919
think i could sit in their daily and but

00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,990
it really got down to like if as you

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,580
really get into the whole windows thing

00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:29,440
you like coming from a mac if you get

00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:33,399
into it and commit to it you know it

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:36,580
really it's not as bad as it sounds the

00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:38,200
thing is you guys can help this and you

00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,879
guys can make it easier for other people

00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,919
to be able to you know get you know get

00:20:39,879 --> 00:20:43,899
going on windows so one of the one of

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,850
the biggest ways and one of the biggest

00:20:43,899 --> 00:20:48,610
problems that when you're trying to

00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:50,980
velop is that some gems do not run on

00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:54,249
windows and people just do not test

00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:56,860
their stuff there I mean you're right

00:20:54,249 --> 00:20:58,720
here right here your jam on a Mac you

00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,309
know it's probably going to work on

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,169
linux you might need to make a couple of

00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:04,480
changes but really it's pretty minimal

00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:05,769
but I mean if you want it to right if

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,119
you want to write to run on Windows I

00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:08,379
mean you really got to invest in okay

00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:10,419
how do I know run out of this do I need

00:21:08,379 --> 00:21:12,509
to do I need to build a binary file you

00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:15,129
know this kind of stuff so I mean

00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:16,539
there's resources out there but really

00:21:15,129 --> 00:21:17,919
if you're going to start writing gems

00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:20,320
you can start writing your own libraries

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,419
whatever please at least try to you know

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,730
check it out test it on windows because

00:21:22,419 --> 00:21:25,840
some people might you know like the idea

00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:27,070
or might want to use it you know say

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,710
it's in some application you want to

00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:31,179
install it using bundler you know if it

00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:34,769
doesn't build on Windows your kind of

00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:34,769
crap you know crap out of luck you know

00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,379
so the other way you can help is you

00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:40,509
know there's a lot of people out there

00:21:38,379 --> 00:21:42,639
that really kind of contributed to

00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:46,149
running windows and you know running

00:21:42,639 --> 00:21:48,519
ruby in a Windows environment i wany

00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:52,749
siguen you guys probably all heard of

00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:54,279
him you know Louise lavina I mean he can

00:21:52,749 --> 00:21:57,070
Collins these guys all do a lot of great

00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:59,470
great work in terms of making it easy to

00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:01,330
run stuff on a windows so you know you

00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:03,249
can always you know tweet them a beer

00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:04,869
which is a nice service or you can also

00:22:03,249 --> 00:22:06,100
use get tip which you know it kind of

00:22:04,869 --> 00:22:07,299
gives them a little bit of money or you

00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,340
know help them out with with what

00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:10,990
they're doing you know say yeah say

00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:13,539
their daily job doesn't involve

00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:15,519
contributing to open source well you

00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:17,470
know give him a little money to help him

00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:21,429
out you know in the all in when they're

00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:22,770
not in the daily grind all right I

00:22:21,429 --> 00:22:26,409
finally wrapped it up right

00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:28,150
so we've kind of talked a bit about you

00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:31,000
know how things have gone and you know

00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:33,400
how you can get started and running but

00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,600
I mean really it boils down to people

00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,340
actually you know taking the time

00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,250
stepping into the stuff and seeing you

00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:41,650
know seen for themselves how things work

00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:44,490
and it's it's very enlightening so if

00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:46,870
you get a chance definitely you know

00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:48,340
even if you even if you just fire put

00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:50,890
vme you want to see how Ruby works on

00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:52,600
there just take the time and actually go

00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:53,770
get into that stuff and see how it see

00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,000
what things are like you you kind of

00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:57,070
have a different perspective going and

00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,419
everything else all right that's about

00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:01,740
all I have in terms of presentation is

00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:01,740
everybody have any questions or anything

00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:09,159
sweet all right I nobody else has

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,230
