	00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:26,070
yes so hello my name is Noah security

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:31,619
things for company great so what we're

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:33,900
gonna do I do have an agenda slide well

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:36,479
it's not really mixing so we're talking

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,900
about what is the hippocratic license we

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,689
talked about

00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,040
how'd it happen where'd it come from

00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:42,720
where I need to consider if I'm

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,610
implementing it or if I'm just thinking

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,470
about it

00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:49,290
why is it important and then there is

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:50,729
hopefully gonna be some discussion it'll

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,450
be good I have questions prepared don't

00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:55,399
worry it's yes I also have a threat but

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,790
we'll get to that later

00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:02,549
yeah so the lessons was started by

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,799
corleone again I think this is a useful

00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:08,459
quote there's a lot of text on these I'm

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,140
not going to read all of that just so

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,550
open source licenses have long been the

00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,190
primary tool for promoting the

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:17,070
software under our own rules and

00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:19,970
conditions I think that Beth is really

00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:22,290
important our own rules in conditions

00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,910
the passed these licenses we use to

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,710
allow the free distribution modification

00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,120
use of our software but there is nothing

00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:30,510
stopping us from taking this route

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,550
nothing at all right now this one we can

00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:36,720
do software under our own rules and

00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:38,010
conditions so why not take it further so

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,260
she created what's called the

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:43,500
Hippocratic license you find it first do

00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,180
no harm that dev basically a modified

00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,560
MIT license so it'll look very familiar

00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:51,270
to you if you're familiar with that

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:53,190
license standard kind of open source

00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,900
stuff it has one edition which is that

00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,210
it prohibits the use of open source

00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:02,210
software as you can see on the screen to

00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:02,210
harm others based on the UN's definition

00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:07,530
this is kind of a major addition so like

00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,940
you know you're looking a ser an MIT

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,130
license there's some other stuff about

00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,350
what happens if the license is invalid

00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:24,209
or something but generally the idea is

00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:33,090
that so some used by anyone or systems

00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:35,400
or activities so if you have this

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,459
license and somebody tries to use it to

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:43,680
do something that threatens these things

00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:45,180
no no good right TLDR can't be used by

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,520
anyone in any way in the pursuit of

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:51,300
knowingly causing harm and we're gonna

00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,900
get to why that's important just how did

00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,200
it happen

00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,810
so the also TLDR is that basically

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,400
there's been a lot of talk about how the

00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,130
open source initiative and other big

00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,500
kind of open source bodies talk about

00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:05,580
how you can use their software now what

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,020
i think they say is that open source

00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,260
software and what's not discriminating i

00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:14,550
must defend itself can use any kind of

00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:17,400
way right so you can't say oh only the

00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:19,200
idea being but you can't say only this

00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,020
kind of person or this kind of company

00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,710
or only people from this one city can

00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,710
use my software

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,360
it's that only we know it's not the case

00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,360
for lots of reasons

00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:33,930
lots of open source is used to do bad

00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,530
thing to hurt people or make easier to

00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:38,730
do these things

00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:40,860
right and so you know partially one I

00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:45,060
think could make the argument that does

00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:46,890
go against but it's it must not you know

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,360
discriminate in terms of use right so

00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:52,620
what is making it so people can't use it

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:56,040
if you you know don't bomb somebody like

00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:58,250
can't use your software but that's why I

00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:02,850
don't write open-source licenses

00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:04,740
scoreline decides that we need stand and

00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:08,880
provide lessons we've read their work

00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:10,170
for being using this way you can see the

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,530
texting you have the actual license

00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:15,870
they're going through some iterations

00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:19,740
one question you may ask is it being

00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:22,350
used yeah so I helped convince you it's

00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:31,080
up well known file sharing app and

00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:34,880
transferred source projects I find a

00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:36,720
tactical your PR submission does wonders

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,730
you can do this too

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,950
like you can just submit a PR to a thing

00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:47,210
be like hey what may be really cool is

00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:52,680
we like you know your standard as well

00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:55,230
um will say wasn't isn't final is not in

00:05:52,680 --> 00:06:01,140
like version you know done done final

00:05:55,230 --> 00:06:03,930
gunship done done the optic leg change

00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:06,300
there are some things to consider if you

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:09,030
want to include this license you can

00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,160
have an impact in know things upstream

00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:16,890
and downstream from you people decide to

00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:26,010
stop using your stuff your stuff I would

00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:27,450
say good riddance like I said there's no

00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,010
like this is just like something boring

00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:30,180
technical stuff but like the listen

00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:32,130
who's new enough that it's not in yearly

00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,520
package people system so it's not in the

00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,520
gemspec

00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:40,710
as much ability to not been tested

00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:41,759
Yanis like for most of these kinds of

00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:44,669
things a possibility he's not

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,309
contestants that there isn't enough

00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:49,409
object yet it has like oh this is the

00:06:47,309 --> 00:06:51,839
big case where we finally took you know

00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:55,020
this company used this to do ransom once

00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:58,680
you mean right thing it's just it's

00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:03,469
treating for that one thing that I find

00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:05,729
very concerning is that this last one

00:07:03,469 --> 00:07:08,909
certainly set up to prevent itself from

00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:09,930
being used for PR so do as I say not as

00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:16,229
I do

00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:19,409
I find that there's a they don't even

00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:23,089
watch Silicon Valley so they have that

00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:26,550
episode about tipping's right technics

00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:28,770
and you know it was what it was right

00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:31,139
but I think what they made very clear is

00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:33,569
that people who support these things

00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:36,360
often will do so so they can get the PR

00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:38,550
block right and it's about what kind of

00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,069
actions you can take the follow-through

00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:45,240
does the company that selects these

00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:48,270
things then make sure that none of their

00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,039
customers or they aren't thinking about

00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:54,689
this which is just a nice way to say hey

00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:56,879
look at me you know that don't worry me

00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:59,819
there's nothing built in to make that

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:05,279
not happen like it's just this license

00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:13,830
and do what you want why is it important

00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:19,789
to have a license like that's right when

00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:25,080
open Howard Zinn is so Howard Zinn it

00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:28,469
was a very very cool historian he wrote

00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,899
a lot about how history doesn't tell the

00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:33,510
story the history were taught doesn't

00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:35,909
often tell the kinds of stories and a

00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:37,949
lot right so it focuses on the winners

00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:39,690
it focuses on the people in power it

00:08:37,949 --> 00:08:42,620
says hey you know this all of a sudden

00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:46,890
Izzy stuff happen all the people who

00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:49,110
transferred this quote you can't be

00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:52,470
neutral and moving trade tech is very

00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:57,750
much a moving train right I think we can

00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:59,430
argue with that you know the automated

00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:03,450
car people are obsessed with the whole

00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:05,100
trolley problem right and and you know a

00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,990
lot of tech is that right

00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,670
yeah and you can't be neat I I don't

00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:14,070
think that you can afford to be neutral

00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:15,450
being neutral is itself take it quite I

00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,280
mean it's such an obnoxious thing to say

00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:19,950
about like thing is itself taking a

00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,890
stance it's saying I don't care and I

00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:29,270
don't think we can afford to not care

00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:31,230
like like a really good example of this

00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:33,500
and I think there's no substitute for

00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:37,710
action

00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:39,540
you know so no the letter that got

00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:42,480
leaked it started a lot of the action or

00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:44,130
I get up as a squat as a matter of

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,350
principle we believe the appropriate way

00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:48,690
to advocate for values in a democracy is

00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,520
use our corporate voice and not to

00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,470
unplug ecology services when government

00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:57,810
customers use them to do things to which

00:09:52,470 --> 00:10:00,330
we inject like push it right like what

00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:01,860
what is the point of having a corporate

00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:03,480
voice what does that mean nobody knows

00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:07,080
what does it mean to have a corporate

00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,310
voice if you can't like how can you use

00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,770
a corporate voice if you don't do it

00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:16,260
right I can stand up here and talk all

00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:19,320
day I can come up and say like alright

00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:21,810
I'm really sick you know Ruby 2.8 right

00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:25,830
but I don't have the power to do that

00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:29,820
mmm however does have the power quite

00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:32,250
literally to unplug technology services

00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,740
with government you know customers use

00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:41,160
of the new things which they object

00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:42,510
right and I think today I think they're

00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,040
being neutral on a moving train they're

00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:47,130
trying to say well look we're we're

00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:49,080
really sad that the train is gonna run

00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:51,120
over this village where the Train is

00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:57,440
gonna definitely detain some children

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:57,440
but it's a complicated laughs isn't it

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,760
right but we're just not gonna do

00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:05,010
anything about it because we don't

00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,860
believe in fact what does that mean what

00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,170
do you

00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:10,870
there's loads of examples like this that

00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:12,100
was a slide recently of like sorry for

00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,650
the kubernetes hands in the audience

00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,630
about talking about how the DoD's

00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:19,420
Department of Defense in America

00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:21,910
kubernetes right I'm gonna I'm gonna

00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,080
view with a video game company but it

00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:26,350
was an infrastructure company they were

00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:28,150
talking and then someone on hand

00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,950
mentions yeah it's really good that we

00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,970
have security engineers because we keep

00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:37,150
doing all these contracts with the

00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:38,800
military that's interesting so I you

00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:40,270
know you can look up like public

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,430
contracts right and you know they're

00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:44,440
making upwards of tens of millions of

00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:47,920
dollars from military contracts that's

00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,670
like well no no thank you that's that's

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,140
not okay with me

00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:55,060
right I want to be upfront about it and

00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:59,310
there's no substitute for taking action

00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:01,390
there just isn't I think that the

00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:04,540
license that you know I'm here talking

00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:06,880
about tonight is a way to instigate

00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:11,980
people to take action it's a way to say

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:13,480
look I need to think about this repo

00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,100
that I'm making I need to think about

00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,270
this software maybe you don't use it

00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:20,140
maybe you go away and you're like yeah

00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:23,950
no I got what a piece of [ __ ] but you

00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:28,330
know it's it's important to consider

00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:31,780
these things and then Jack okay so

00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:33,010
actually right what can we do I really

00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:35,590
think there's four things there's no

00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:38,470
magic there's four things you can do so

00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:40,810
have conversations doesn't have to be

00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:43,660
you know hey big boss why are we doing

00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:44,830
this it can be you know the lunch table

00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,740
hey you know what you see that we have

00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,060
this client and like somewhere it's

00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,080
doing something awful with our software

00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:54,490
like what's up with that

00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:59,920
or it can just be like hey why are we on

00:12:54,490 --> 00:13:01,420
call 24/7 365 okay because this stuff

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,070
has to be internal as well right you

00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:04,540
can't just be all the way the internal

00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:06,790
external use software see how do we

00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:11,320
internally develop the software right we

00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:13,720
all work together ask questions be like

00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:16,180
hey what's up why is this like this

00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:19,120
I'm very irritating that way I'm often

00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:21,910
in select channels being like why

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,559
why dude why is this happening people

00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:26,949
are like all it's because well that's

00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:27,970
weird talk to your colleagues talk to

00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:29,620
colleagues who are not necessarily

00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:33,040
colleagues you think you were talked to

00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:36,069
I would say talk to support as much as

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,439
possible I find that if I want to get a

00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:41,170
good gauge on how my work is going and

00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:42,249
how people are using my stuff there is

00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:45,639
no better way to do that the time this

00:13:42,249 --> 00:13:46,930
works because they see it all right I

00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:49,059
mean we're talking about you know

00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:51,100
production you just can't predict

00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:53,370
anything and support will see all those

00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,370
things

00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,949
number four is probable supporting

00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:58,720
something doesn't seem right like talk

00:13:56,949 --> 00:14:00,279
about it and then see what action you

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,410
can take maybe it's not a big one right

00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:03,370
and you know I think everyone they take

00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:05,290
action in their own way

00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:07,420
I'm not mandating a particular way maybe

00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:10,420
it's you have this license one of your

00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:12,100
repos work whatever no you make your

00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,740
your company legal department ask

00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,639
questions I mean you said well you know

00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,279
it's interesting addressing these

00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:23,079
questions because we did this thing and

00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:25,660
then more questions get asked you know I

00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:28,389
can be scary so I think it's good to

00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:43,300
have groups like this right you know

00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:45,730
people nice school we should move on

00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,350
discussion points before we do I think

00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:49,720
it's important to talk about this what

00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:53,800
we do if any of this is interesting to

00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:57,749
you might I suggest that you follow tech

00:14:53,800 --> 00:15:03,339
workers on Twitter sentence and look up

00:14:57,749 --> 00:15:05,410
coalition we're trying to get start a

00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:06,160
way of getting tech workers of every

00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:20,410
stripe

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:22,620
together to discuss and to your point I

00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:25,029
make it a bigger blood

00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:30,339
there's two of us in the Rican populace

00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:33,550
that's just asking questions on Twitter

00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:38,720
if you don't want to follow it or not

00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:40,269
we're great buttons we don't have any

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,700
more buttons when we do us stickers

00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:44,959
anyway so I think there's some forward

00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,089
things that would be useful to talk

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:50,000
about I do want to mention that I can

00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:52,160
threaten anybody cents not a comment

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,420
just a question and we're gonna put you

00:15:52,160 --> 00:16:00,390
in the canal that was funny to me

00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:00,390
[Laughter]

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,750
establishing a baseline I guess that's

00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:09,860
not really part of the codified I

00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:18,800
wouldn't really put you in yet so I

00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:21,889
think one thing is right more this one

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,300
okay we take actually go beyond the

00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:29,720
license

00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:32,120
what happened that team that was and

00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,329
what are these horses the [ __ ] in the

00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:39,160
coats and how to improve or even replace

00:16:34,329 --> 00:16:39,160
time even if you don't necessarily want

00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:57,560
anybody have I don't know nothing I

00:16:53,800 --> 00:17:01,730
don't even understand it which which bit

00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:04,490
the extension or third or the career and

00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:08,240
they're an extension them they program

00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:11,240
it extension yeah it was I had to go

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:14,030
back the union rights and I don't

00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:17,600
understand how it relates to live to be

00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:20,150
demographic yeah so the idea is that the

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:26,919
software is used the violate those human

00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:29,960
rights it is a violation of the license

00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:38,270
yeah but that's a violation of things in

00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:40,130
that yes not not granting access to some

00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:43,190
software it is a violation of human

00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:46,370
rights itself no Oliveira

00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:53,480
I disagreed sorry yeah so

00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:56,450
yes so you know so nobody has a human

00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:59,260
right to access software right yes I

00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:07,340
think that's I mean many of those I

00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:08,690
don't so their rights already like if if

00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,250
there is a human but I mean I do agree

00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:11,720
with you I think absolutely that you

00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,520
know interaction should be universal and

00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,720
free it should be utility it should be

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,480
high-quality it should be given to

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:22,880
everyone without Billy

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:27,170
no but I think it's mainly about right

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:34,370
from your own appointment or only

00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:41,150
happening in the finger and Tommy are

00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:43,820
these yeah unfortunately the notion here

00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:47,120
is to give this a good baseline that's a

00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:49,610
way to start at how do we decide what

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,470
software can and can't be using our

00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:55,040
software not every piece of software but

00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:58,550
I like I personally there's lots of

00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:02,390
things I mean I can't enforce those

00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:03,740
differences I can at least say that if

00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:13,520
you use it to violate someone's human

00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:15,590
rights I think I think this is a sort of

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,780
critique that comes up frequently in

00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:21,050
these sorts of cases is that there's

00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:23,780
there's an appeal to moral relativism

00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:25,670
here like what I think is is unright are

00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:27,110
not right and may differ from what other

00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:29,930
people really think it's not right and

00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:31,550
so how do we adjudicating the legal

00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:34,430
framework that the software license web

00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:36,500
by you know what constitutes unfair use

00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:39,770
of the license and one of the reasons

00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:41,780
that the coralline move to acing it on

00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:43,520
the Universal Declaration of Human

00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,290
Rights is that this is a fairly

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,320
unambiguous document this is a very

00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:49,880
baseline document is fairly egregious

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,930
what you have to do to violate these

00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,840
rights but it's but it's very

00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:57,350
unequivocal right it's very clear as a

00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:00,820
bright line right and there are

00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:04,070
a lot of international law precedents

00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:06,350
that help us understand what constitutes

00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:08,540
the violation of human rights under this

00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,950
declaration and what does it so there's

00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:13,040
a lot of judicial wah that's already in

00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:14,660
place it helps us understand like what

00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:17,840
what's a violation what is in a

00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:20,720
violation and on top of that it's other

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:24,850
non binding under law it's been signed

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:27,049
by all but 40-something countries and

00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:29,090
certainly the United States most of

00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:30,830
Europe right the countries have really

00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:32,270
are consuming open-source software most

00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:35,240
answers for signatories to this

00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:40,700
operation right and so although

00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:42,799
something like racist acts are not going

00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,720
to constitute a violation of human

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,540
rights under this license and so are not

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,030
going to fall under the jurisdiction of

00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:52,580
this clause something like denying

00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:55,220
medical care to prisoners for example is

00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:57,080
going to constitute like like clearly

00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,760
constitute a violation of Human Rights

00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:03,260
oh and guess what's after is being used

00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:05,299
to do that right now and it would be

00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:08,299
really nice if we had systems in place

00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:10,429
because the people who built for example

00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:12,830
Ruby on Rails thh has been very critical

00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:15,380
of certain practices advice you have

00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:17,120
scope on ice that wouldn't be nice if

00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:19,280
the Hippocratic license is applied Ruby

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,380
on Rails and then we can say that for

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,330
example the hub's leadership was in

00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,669
violation of the terms because they're

00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:28,100
using that software can't fail a human

00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:30,309
rights on behalf of Isis right but

00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:32,870
that's the idea behind this mechanism

00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:37,490
anything on top of that like there's not

00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:39,290
a lot of there's not a lot of case logs

00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:44,780
that would allow us to build a strong

00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:46,760
case or for example for first violations

00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:50,780
of a code of conduct right like that's

00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:53,360
not going to happen but human rights

00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:58,720
seem like a fairly unequivocal place to

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,720
build from the law does that make sense

00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:19,820
this is unambiguous right this is like

00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:23,890
if it really came down to it like there

00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:27,620
are some sense legal bodies who could

00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:33,160
say well look they violated this thing

00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:37,270
it's in the there's been cases about it

00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:39,890
you can make these people that you can

00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:43,100
find people who will be responsible for

00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:51,380
it yet hey you know it is not always

00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:53,900
possible so I think it's very nice of

00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:59,270
you but there's definitely pros that we

00:22:53,900 --> 00:23:02,060
do sorted out because always I know of

00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:05,960
course they made it very very conscious

00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:08,450
choice not to exclude people from the

00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,400
license parameters but one that that's

00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:16,280
definitely on the bait here that flow

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:21,500
point more deeply like people who

00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:23,780
violate the rights laws they're not

00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:26,780
gonna give a flying yeah about

00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:29,530
summarizing just yep

00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:31,610
but maybe they're provided would that's

00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:47,690
that's sort of what you're aiming it

00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:55,850
right on the first one I think so it's

00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:57,890
part of the idea and there's many things

00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:59,440
that people say about this right that is

00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:02,260
notionally

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:05,300
that we we as open source people

00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:07,250
contributors and and software people are

00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,810
in control of the software that's

00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:11,510
happening right and there's many reasons

00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:16,130
it's this complicated I honestly

00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:17,930
disagree and as I do think the open

00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:21,190
source software has been said to protect

00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:24,020
the user not suffocated like explicitly

00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:25,250
that's that was the original point of

00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:30,320
ppl

00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:33,710
and so on so that's not affectionate for

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,390
it is the separation or the surprises

00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:38,390
that's not been created to affect a

00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:39,169
loser protecting human this is an

00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:42,409
important distinction

00:24:39,169 --> 00:24:44,659
right 100% and that's why this is true

00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:46,490
so in almost no circumstances in our

00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:49,520
daily lives do we have the ability to

00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:52,580
control the products that underpin the

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,260
things that control our lives right so

00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:57,530
if these licenses are designed to

00:24:54,260 --> 00:25:01,700
protect the user the system user finance

00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:03,860
software developers and users right we

00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:07,039
have the responsibility to use that

00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:11,630
power to really protect our users right

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:14,390
and in this case I would say that part

00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:17,600
of protecting our users is preventing

00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:20,270
these kinds of egregious harm right I

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:23,929
think that's really mean this gets very

00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:26,090
like we're like you know we in this case

00:25:23,929 --> 00:25:27,890
we literally for some definition of own

00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:29,570
only the means of production like we

00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:33,770
actually control the things that go to

00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:34,880
it like get up is based on so many

00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:38,809
things are based sub-grants

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:42,380
like you name it probably a rails app or

00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:44,720
was it some point right so like you know

00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:48,650
we can all send yards to the rails thing

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:50,360
and that's often used to say well that's

00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:54,230
using it in a negative connotation like

00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:55,429
that can also be used like we all can

00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,440
say we're not cool with this anymore

00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:58,909
right

00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:01,669
and we can say in order to protect our

00:25:58,909 --> 00:26:05,059
users by ourselves I don't care I mean

00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:10,059
it's whatever we need to take some kind

00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:14,000
of action that sort of makes sense

00:26:10,059 --> 00:26:16,460
it's good it's weird because the poor or

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:21,650
it's a very complicated subject so yes

00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:23,690
obviously lawyers also the people you're

00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:26,080
protecting are no longer the users but

00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:31,059
they're subjects in the system that are

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:31,059
very complex that's why it's difficult

00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:46,190
is from the same angle that you

00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:49,730
gpl-licensed activate meaning that a GPL

00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:56,390
license is a fire license which spreads

00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:59,630
down consumer and the pratik license

00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:03,559
keys so the hypocritic license means a

00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:09,020
way it's a way to say yes you can use

00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:11,929
our software okay the choice for example

00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:14,510
that the GPL takes is that if you make

00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:16,880
changes from the software and you share

00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:21,169
those changes and also you are requested

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:23,990
to change change you are required to

00:27:21,169 --> 00:27:28,400
comply and that's a choice that the GPL

00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:30,799
license makes no one day by the same by

00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:33,350
the same token the hippocratic license

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:35,480
means makes the choice knowingly that

00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:38,919
the use of the software has to be

00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:43,100
considered it's just a different choice

00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:45,020
and like like noah said it so nobody

00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:47,150
tries to enforce it yet for example did

00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:48,650
you a license uses various stages of the

00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:52,150
court and there are lawsuits which

00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:54,980
reinforce the disqualified GPL software

00:27:52,150 --> 00:28:01,340
but by the same token at some point it

00:27:54,980 --> 00:28:05,840
might so happen for example imagine that

00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:09,049
you have a quiet or a company does not

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:12,380
have best practices and wants to provide

00:28:09,049 --> 00:28:14,720
services to you entity which are known

00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:16,910
violating the rights the point of this

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,220
license is to make it inconvenient or

00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:21,740
undesirable for that company to provide

00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:26,840
your software as a service to those

00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:29,860
entities that's so that's like a so

00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:34,390
there's it that's introducing

00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:37,459
introducing extra constraints which are

00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:37,459
[Music]

00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:52,270
something which is like all the way back

00:28:52,640 --> 00:31:02,530
I think it's not gonna make trivial

00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:07,770
issues

00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:07,770
so I think

00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:42,940
and even

00:33:16,179 --> 00:33:44,619
I think the the notion here is not that

00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:46,990
this license is going to fix all of our

00:33:44,619 --> 00:34:00,450
problems right the notion here is going

00:33:46,990 --> 00:34:27,159
to inspire this I also took ten years

00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:29,799
nothing is in control this yeah so yeah

00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:32,129
so they are working with various legal

00:34:29,799 --> 00:34:36,940
people to make it happen there's also a

00:34:32,129 --> 00:34:39,190
portion that was added to the effect if

00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:41,379
it is determined that this is like so

00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:44,919
you know self-referential incoherent

00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:48,990
then it will not apply so they're

00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:53,020
hedging in business okay so I want to

00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:58,059
show it here I think it's an awesome

00:34:53,020 --> 00:35:02,470
golden [ __ ] key but it has the law of

00:34:58,059 --> 00:35:05,130
no not barring other side that's that's

00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:08,650
the idea that means take a guideline for

00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:11,680
this license that's already long there's

00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:13,349
already a UN so if you go to court right

00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:17,349
now and you say that they've armed

00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:20,200
people I am taking the isyour that's the

00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:24,730
biggest example we can just make a case

00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:28,780
with um and it will take a lot of years

00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:30,099
what action will be taken and I think

00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:36,849
that there are organization

00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:39,670
writing is right now and then there's

00:35:36,849 --> 00:35:44,289
person in the government that makes an

00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:47,049
exact horse they're willing but what

00:35:44,289 --> 00:35:48,970
what says that if we enforce this the

00:35:47,049 --> 00:35:52,749
same thing wouldn't happen yeah

00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:55,690
so if github backs out of ice they will

00:35:52,749 --> 00:35:59,109
just build it their shelves right Joseph

00:35:55,690 --> 00:36:01,479
and terrible argument though no I'm just

00:35:59,109 --> 00:36:05,049
trying to figure out like if we gonna

00:36:01,479 --> 00:36:07,869
enforce this who is going unfortunate

00:36:05,049 --> 00:36:12,309
because is or develop work have by no

00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:28,150
means the legal power to go to court

00:36:12,309 --> 00:36:32,619
with large enterprise or even drastic

00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:35,529
but well I I'm just trying to figure out

00:36:32,619 --> 00:36:39,069
here like if if I found out that someone

00:36:35,529 --> 00:36:41,319
is using my software to hurt others what

00:36:39,069 --> 00:36:45,630
steps should I take because if I go to

00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:51,150
court I'm gone I especially against the

00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:54,279
gold I am by no means a match for them

00:36:51,150 --> 00:37:04,920
and of course there will be parties that

00:36:54,279 --> 00:37:08,619
will back me up but deny them access to

00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:16,479
okay yeah sure I'm in agreement what

00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:20,859
their own copies right so i yes surely

00:37:16,479 --> 00:37:22,930
like like said said Fargo game but he

00:37:20,859 --> 00:37:25,660
also affected a very large crowd of

00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:31,390
people who were not abusing license so

00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:32,829
so it was a hard choice so I don't know

00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:39,400
how many of you work at companies that

00:37:32,829 --> 00:37:43,140
have lice and restrictions so you know I

00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,140
I have a thing my life

00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:51,650
make sure it doesn't have that's I mean

00:37:57,319 --> 00:39:00,539
they have to proactive it's worth

00:38:58,049 --> 00:39:03,630
pointing out the idea behind is that

00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:06,029
it's not about targeting people and

00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:07,920
which is it is targeting actions right

00:39:06,029 --> 00:39:10,859
so is the action of how these being used

00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,259
not necessarily like you know Jim as a

00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:17,069
developer inferred you know whatever

00:39:13,259 --> 00:39:18,749
right and it's not about what they're

00:39:17,069 --> 00:39:21,269
doing because they're developed right

00:39:18,749 --> 00:39:24,839
there we are all developing right order

00:39:21,269 --> 00:39:26,190
tip workers whatever it's about the

00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:33,589
action that is taken with the coding

00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:37,049
question photo says all questions like

00:39:33,589 --> 00:39:39,809
you can so I don't know much about like

00:39:37,049 --> 00:39:42,839
niceties well I'm thinking from like

00:39:39,809 --> 00:39:48,349
more than transform and you might think

00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:51,869
about that I think I don't know like

00:39:48,349 --> 00:39:53,999
tracking and fantasy mode and the moment

00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:56,210
I did that I don't know how it's going

00:39:53,999 --> 00:39:56,210
to do

00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:22,130
[Music]

00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:29,100
so I intend to build software to save

00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:34,350
the world and it turns out but it gets

00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:37,020
used for example let's talk about right

00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:37,980
there stated mission is order like you

00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,970
know we're gonna connect the world

00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:41,760
there's something like that right

00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:43,560
provide transports for everybody but

00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,830
what they're actually doing is creating

00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:50,010
a more sustainable and punishes the

00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:50,880
people doing the actual work right we've

00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:54,450
learned by the LIA it's a whole other

00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:57,450
thing I know but their intent is pure

00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:59,640
right you look at any over persons or at

00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:01,890
any tech person social media right like

00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:08,560
you know this little widget I named it's

00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:10,000
gonna write that's good right yeah it's

00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:14,320
right yeah the software right it's gonna

00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,040
change anything but change can also be

00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,630
bad right

00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,910
so it's important to look at the

00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:20,590
consequence of violence right and

00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:22,810
sometimes you can't know the consequence

00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:24,910
until after it's happened so that's why

00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:26,400
you could say well what you're in money

00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:29,320
to put this software was not to do that

00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:32,140
it's been used this way now I'm giving

00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:36,010
restrict as usage right because I've

00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:38,620
seen how it can be used to do hot but

00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:40,210
it's again it's it's not about the

00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:42,130
individual open source data it's not

00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:43,600
about blaming somebody it's not about

00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:45,880
looking like I have to predict every

00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:54,460
possible negative that's not possible

00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:54,880
like if it is like it's just not

00:42:54,460 --> 00:43:00,450
possible

00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,450
and so this is about giving us a lever

00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:34,230
