	00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:17,920
so how do we make money how do we do

00:00:14,379 --> 00:00:20,410
business so we do that by acting as

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,109
precede party between buyers and sellers

00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:27,550
and we take commission from both of them

00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:36,190
I want into a total of 21 percent so

00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:39,040
this is how we are trying to we want to

00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:46,480
be a business that not only grows for

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:52,000
the sake of growing but also so I

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:54,220
thought to be charging that much we have

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,910
a hundred percent created options we

00:00:54,220 --> 00:01:00,970
have around 200 in-house experts actual

00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:04,980
employees that's free every single item

00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:04,980
that we sell on to platform to weed out

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:20,010
so let's play a little game around

00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:25,210
items that we sell those are a few items

00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:28,150
and I would like to for you to guess if

00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:29,830
we set it for higher or lower than the

00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:32,260
price that's going to up here

00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:38,830
if you think it's higher please raise

00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:42,880
your hands so we thought is making 69

00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:47,740
benefit to the saloon at the end of last

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:50,909
year do you think we sold it for higher

00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,909
than 35,000 or

00:02:19,630 --> 00:03:08,920
so finally we 15 which is the first

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,920
coming boots food story of spider-man

00:03:38,840 --> 00:04:49,130
Wow and of course we support and if you

00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,130
have more questions

00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,389
Thank You Vincent

00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:07,510
Thank You Solana and cut a Vicky for

00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:10,150
hosting and sponsoring this event so

00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:16,169
let's get started with the first talk I

00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:33,280
wonder I wonder who sorry sorry sorry

00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:36,940
yeah you can take it with this for the

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:39,450
audience that's for the live stream just

00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,450
for the audience

00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,240
you

00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:08,870
it's a little bit tricky to see my

00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:12,260
industry or Isis cleaned in the screen

00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:17,180
this is actually wrong so hello everyone

00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:21,020
and welcome again my talk is going to be

00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:25,010
about crystal because I have talked to a

00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:29,030
lot of you on previous meetups and we

00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:30,890
had a lot of discussions what is it

00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:35,390
actually you know does it work is

00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:39,620
production really so a little bit about

00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:42,650
me so my name is I work at a company and

00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,690
hopefully transfer these are some some

00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:46,580
pictures from my audio part of why fans

00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:49,880
here like retention of anything like

00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:51,350
this but like this was in Syria and this

00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:55,400
one you can't actually see me with them

00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:58,960
somewhere in there and I started working

00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:02,210
to engineering which is rather like

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:07,220
programming a lot of those things are

00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:10,280
computer different these days and why do

00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:13,010
I think I'm qualified to have an actual

00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:17,480
talk about crystal to the Ruby community

00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:21,950
and understand in with transfer we built

00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:27,170
a micro service medium-size me media

00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:31,700
service that it was about 25 quest per

00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:35,660
day today there's a little bit of the

00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:37,850
weekend but on average and we have had a

00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,410
lot of experience both good and bad so I

00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:41,360
would like to talk to you about my

00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:44,150
should you do it and at the end I hope

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,790
you have a better they are so no but

00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:51,380
crystal whatever come talk about like

00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:54,830
what is it then let's talk a little bit

00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:57,050
about the pegacorn service and in the

00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:58,970
end like the key question like is sure

00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:02,270
everyone because like it has a lot of

00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:06,000
obsessed with our system so what is

00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:10,409
crystal crystal is a relatively young

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,979
that brent itself as sleek as ruby

00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:16,530
faster seat so ruby well we all love it

00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:17,729
is not necessarily the most performant

00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:21,090
language if you have really

00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:24,419
computationally happy programs that you

00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:27,150
want to run but when ruby is really good

00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:29,610
that is developer happiness it has a

00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:39,089
syntax that really meant well to what a

00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:51,510
lot of people think so that is something

00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:54,779
that more efficient that what they

00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:56,579
actually programs was correct and they

00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:59,820
wanted to find out if it was correct

00:08:56,579 --> 00:09:02,730
not when it blew up when the user was

00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,500
trying it out but as soon as possible

00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:07,980
and that's where a lot of the type

00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,870
checking comes back but as we will see

00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:13,270
later they do that in a very sensible

00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:16,380
way and finally they

00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:16,380
[Music]

00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:41,160
[Music]

00:09:37,040 --> 00:10:04,800
as you can see like Kamal is basically

00:09:41,160 --> 00:10:07,709
the same library Sinatra does put ten

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,339
times as many requests per second on a

00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:13,619
single and that is nice and it's really

00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:22,369
showcases some of what crystal gives us

00:10:13,619 --> 00:10:22,369
is that it just it has less overhead and

00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:33,809
imitations completion so type system is

00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:37,170
not a feature that both enables higher

00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:39,509
speed will also in it helps you catch

00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:41,519
errors quickly so there are this has

00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:49,079
always been a lot of debate at times

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:52,470
great and it slowed me down so here we

00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:56,339
have an example of fully typed crystal

00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:59,179
program but as you can see none of the

00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:01,499
types actually have to be written so

00:10:59,179 --> 00:11:12,540
imagine you have some variable exponent

00:11:01,499 --> 00:11:14,549
from higher up then do a and otherwise

00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:17,790
you were starting hello it's really a

00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:20,459
string to it so at the end of this what

00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:21,990
is the type of a while you might say

00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:23,730
like you can't really know because you

00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:25,410
don't know what X is but you can say

00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:28,939
it's either a number or a string and

00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:32,819
it's exactly helpers so at this point

00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:38,040
it's either a number in this case a

00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:40,709
32-bit integer or it is a string and you

00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:43,079
will see that the language will use this

00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:46,199
information to try and get air for you

00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:47,160
so if you say like I want to add one

00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:51,250
which is in

00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:54,010
to a what should you answer be well in

00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:58,000
this case the answer is you cannot do

00:11:54,010 --> 00:12:04,870
this because you cannot add numbers and

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:07,740
strings and this is an error that would

00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:11,709
have been there anyway in any program

00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:13,690
but in Ruby it blows up when you try to

00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:16,000
run it and in crystal it blows up when

00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:21,250
you try to compile it which is hopefully

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:24,220
earlier and that should allow you to

00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:31,329
ship less airs to X so let's have

00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:36,279
another example we put we create a new

00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:38,800
array that contains 32-bit integers and

00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:41,440
stuff it inside the variable a right

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:46,380
then we do some some things to it maybe

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:49,600
we add some some actual values to a

00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:53,860
maybe we mutate some values in our array

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:57,550
and then sometime later we take the 24th

00:12:53,860 --> 00:13:00,399
of a one element of a and put it in to

00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:06,550
be like does anyone want to guess what

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:12,730
is now the type of B yeah I see a CAC

00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:16,270
yes yes very good so it is possible that

00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:23,140
we haven't got to the to the 23rd index

00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:25,870
yet so it is a number or nil and like we

00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:27,910
saw earlier the types expand if the

00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:31,480
compiler cannot pin it down to one thing

00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:34,110
that they can also contract again so the

00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:38,829
compiler is smart enough to see that in

00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:44,019
this less block it is not possible for

00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:46,209
me to actually be nil so C is now much

00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:49,180
more constrained in step it has to be an

00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:53,920
int 32 because it cannot be a nil

00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:56,370
anymore so in this way the types really

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,410
propagate and you get a lot of checking

00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:00,940
without actually having to type any of

00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:04,030
these things so the compiler put

00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:05,770
more than for you this this is nice

00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:07,930
because one of the chief programmer

00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:10,600
virtues is to be a delicious possible I

00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,070
don't want to do any typing and I really

00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:16,230
like that the computer can do more of

00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:20,860
the boring stuff for me so another thing

00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:23,650
you can make classes they have the exact

00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:27,880
same syntax as in Ruby but you can have

00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:31,120
a adjacent of mapping in there and it

00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:34,210
will automatically you have to tell it

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:37,500
like how do I want to convert this class

00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:39,820
to and from Jason and they you

00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,980
automatically get to Jason here from

00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:44,730
jason methods on your class which do

00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:47,110
exactly what you think and also

00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:49,900
accessors for all the keys in the jason

00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:56,680
memory so let's have an example for this

00:14:49,900 --> 00:15:03,460
one as well so this is another Sinatra

00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:05,830
like thing and point as you can see like

00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:09,070
here we do this dispatcher current

00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:12,790
request from Jason with with request

00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:16,120
body and then immediately it has all the

00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:20,920
accesses and if one of my colleagues

00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:23,200
would ever call this end point with

00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:26,680
adjacent pilot that does not confirm to

00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:29,710
this mapping you get exactly what you

00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:33,220
expect which is a mapping error which is

00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:36,730
a fair normal exception with and that

00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:38,470
you can handle in any way you want so in

00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:42,400
this way you get a ton of error checking

00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:44,380
almost for free and you can get the

00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:48,630
program language to do a lot of the

00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:52,450
boilerplate work for you because

00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:58,420
concurrency is an interesting topic it

00:15:52,450 --> 00:16:01,120
is if anyone knows how go routines work

00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:04,390
in the go programming language they're

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,190
basically similar to that they are very

00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:10,000
lightweight sets you can spin up

00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:12,150
literally millions on a single core they

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,399
communicate preferentially through

00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:20,050
messages they sent to its

00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:22,360
and yeah this dog was already pretty

00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:24,370
long so I decided to make this slide a

00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,770
little bit shorter because what I really

00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:29,890
want to get to is have a little bit of a

00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:32,200
case study like I mentioned earlier that

00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:34,480
we transfer we have a micro surface we

00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,550
call pegacorn we call it that because

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,620
it's a unicorn but it's unicorn was

00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:41,040
already taken in Ruby so we decided to

00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:44,410
give it wings and make it a pegacorn

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:48,630
it is a service we use for illegal

00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:51,279
contact detection most of our clients

00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:54,670
use with transfer for a very legitimate

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:57,339
content sadly not all of them and we

00:16:54,670 --> 00:17:01,270
have an opinion about this and want to

00:16:57,339 --> 00:17:03,339
scan so let me get be clear we're not

00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:05,500
talking about some you know may be

00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:07,569
illegal in some repressive country we're

00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,150
talking right straight up illegal that

00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:14,890
everyone here I help what say that this

00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:21,189
is clearly so we get list of hashes of

00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:23,800
images from the police that of these

00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:27,520
illegal images and we want to detect

00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:30,370
them but not just whether they are on

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,960
the list with the direct hash but also

00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:34,240
whether they have been slightly altered

00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,570
where they may have been changed in size

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,340
grayscale or anything like that and they

00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:42,070
as you can imagine like basically

00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:49,360
anything with image processing is very

00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:52,270
computer intensive but this one is also

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,670
has all these resizing Xin comparisons

00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:58,270
to do so that there certainly does not

00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:58,890
make it easier and Ruby what we all love

00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:01,720
it very much

00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:06,610
computer intensive processing it's just

00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:10,929
not what is grated most of our other

00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:13,179
services are basically pure Ruby so we

00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:15,160
set up a separate micro service that we

00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:17,830
query over HTTP you since it's an image

00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:20,170
this tells you yes or no and it does

00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:22,929
about 25 million queries a day like I

00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:25,330
mentioned earlier and this is the dekor

00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:27,030
loop so for those of you who are very

00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:29,910
good at math and

00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:31,710
fare quick readers from a distance this

00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:35,550
is basically a hundred forty four

00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:40,890
dimensional distance computation in some

00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:44,040
high dimensional space and this method

00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:45,780
has to be computed several hundred

00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,610
thousand times for each of those twenty

00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:51,170
five minutes so you can imagine that we

00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:55,410
do a lot of computational intensive work

00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:57,420
in the service and it was actually a

00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:01,110
rewrite from an earlier service that we

00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:05,670
wrote in Haskell the initial version of

00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:07,440
the crystal from Haskell to crystal took

00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:09,810
about two days one of those days was a

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:14,790
meeting day so it clearly doesn't leave

00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:18,180
any productivity on the table it's also

00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:20,460
much more well liked because to my to my

00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:22,020
great sadness and we transfer only one

00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:27,030
and half people actually can write

00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:29,100
Haskell and read it and now everyone can

00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:35,130
read it because crystal looks so similar

00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:37,050
the the crystal bursary was slightly

00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:40,670
slow but it's a benchmark it is this

00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:43,890
morning it's still over 50 times faster

00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:45,660
than Ruby and for those of you who care

00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:47,520
about these things the docker image is

00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:53,400
very reasonable as well at about 20

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:54,770
megabytes so for this particular use

00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,420
case where we have something very

00:19:54,770 --> 00:20:01,650
computationally intensive it made a lot

00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:04,140
of sense to use the crystal programming

00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:07,560
language because as you can see it was

00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:10,770
well over 50 times faster than Ruby at

00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:12,870
the same time it also has dancers so

00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:14,250
let's talk about that do you really want

00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:16,260
it do you really want it like when I

00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,850
usually when someone talks it up to a

00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:21,840
day like end here all right it's great

00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:24,930
but like rewrite all the thing maybe

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:30,260
maybe right it also has downsides and

00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:33,450
let's have a look at this so this is the

00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:37,770
the core method of the the hottest loop

00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:40,950
that I already showed and as you can see

00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:43,080
like it has like what is

00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:45,090
earlier in the presentations like no

00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:49,860
it's great guys you don't have to write

00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:54,030
any type signatures anywhere and yet we

00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:58,610
do all right does anyone want to guess

00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:58,610
or maybe they know why we put it in here

00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:10,680
we wanted uncertainty integers is close

00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:13,890
but not not entirely correct yes this

00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:16,110
I'll repeat it for you and for the

00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:17,900
people at home in live stream the

00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:20,970
compiler can actually do a lot more

00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:26,340
optimizations if you add in as much

00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:28,500
information so what you can see here

00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:30,830
like this is just a number all the

00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:35,600
operations it does is just you know

00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:38,100
addition subtraction exponentiation

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,840
those are just operation some numbers

00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,550
but they work on any numbers with any

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,700
number of bits

00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,700
[Music]

00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:17,609
[Music]

00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:22,140
it's pretty much

00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:44,359
[Applause]

00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,359
[Music]

00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:19,390
[Music]

00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:30,370
about thinking of technology like

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:34,290
crystal community right can you get

00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:37,210
enough supports can you get all of the

00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:52,030
new text like these which trouble and

00:26:37,210 --> 00:27:05,950
not so I'm talking about the experiment

00:26:52,030 --> 00:27:14,290
release and not some of the question for

00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:18,690
everyone most of the question was it is

00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:18,690
a young language is it actually safe to

00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:38,650
from us we use it for internal micro

00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:50,710
servers and what we really liked about

00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:53,920
it even if and the biggest risk we would

00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:56,350
have is that even if oppressive

00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:58,660
development stops for government

00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:01,300
whatsoever then we still have the old

00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:03,630
version likely won't suddenly stop work

00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:08,890
I said this is a small money service

00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:13,450
basically and it doesn't have that many

00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:17,740
dependencies so for us like our thing

00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:19,720
would stop working it is no sort of real

00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:21,780
revenues relates to security first it

00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:29,470
must be fixed by someone other than us

00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:32,050
and yeah I think he even in development

00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:33,460
stuff we could presumably just leave it

00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:39,200
running

00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:41,659
contains comfortable so in our case

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,899
we're not really worried about the

00:28:41,659 --> 00:28:47,659
potential stability of the language and

00:28:44,899 --> 00:28:51,279
the benefits for us are more than large

00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:53,870
enough to take together would we arrive

00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:57,409
would we replace our next real set with

00:28:53,870 --> 00:29:02,570
it for me not for something that is

00:28:57,409 --> 00:29:04,970
really user facing we need a lot of

00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:07,909
updates lunches for features but also

00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:11,659
for security I don't think we would do

00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:16,549
that yet that's it and let me get to

00:29:11,659 --> 00:29:18,980
that and if it fits the performance

00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:20,779
profile looking for then it was

00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:24,649
definitely something I would recommend

00:29:20,779 --> 00:29:27,520
to check out it all right there was

00:29:24,649 --> 00:29:27,520
someone else with a question

00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:45,889
so once again I'll repeat the question

00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:48,379
for for everyone after Leslie the person

00:29:45,889 --> 00:29:54,950
was in sports lyrics and I'm glad to say

00:29:48,379 --> 00:29:59,419
yes yeah I wish I had matched lied about

00:29:54,950 --> 00:30:03,979
this just could show you in general all

00:29:59,419 --> 00:30:06,979
the all the things we love from from

00:30:03,979 --> 00:30:09,879
like both from relatively good type

00:30:06,979 --> 00:30:14,509
systems and from Ruby work so if you

00:30:09,879 --> 00:30:18,649
like the innumerable module works just

00:30:14,509 --> 00:30:21,739
like in Ruby so you can just map over

00:30:18,649 --> 00:30:23,779
anything with with functions and all of

00:30:21,739 --> 00:30:24,830
the type checker will check it all and

00:30:23,779 --> 00:30:32,389
make sure it works

00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:35,330
does that answer your question - point

00:30:32,389 --> 00:30:37,720
zero let's gonna take well any more

00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,720
questions

00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,840
you

00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:29,370
you

00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:38,270
and there was like bright stage light in

00:34:35,329 --> 00:34:43,629
my eyes so I couldn't see people but now

00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:43,629
I can see all the humans and it's scary

00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:57,589
welcome welcome sit down yay yeah this

00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:59,990
is version 2 of my talk using Pokemon to

00:34:57,589 --> 00:35:03,490
catch all the code smells it's super

00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:07,160
effective it has more glitter this time

00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:11,410
so my name is Melanie Gilly and I work

00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:14,569
at young glitter I work at young capital

00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:17,569
we are the fastest-growing employment

00:35:14,569 --> 00:35:20,050
agency in the Netherlands so my

00:35:17,569 --> 00:35:24,020
colleagues are here

00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:26,780
it's a lovely place to work lots of yeah

00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:31,520
young fun people we have lots of female

00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:40,010
developers lots of yeah it's like a fun

00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:41,599
place we have an idea so so I studied

00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:46,280
journalism in college

00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:49,010
and I moved to communications afterwards

00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:54,020
because there were surprisingly not a

00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:55,579
lot of jobs in journalism and but it

00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:59,180
does mean that I'm really good at

00:35:55,579 --> 00:36:00,859
googling things and copy pasting and so

00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:03,309
I guess it makes sense

00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:07,240
I switched to programming when I was 30

00:36:03,309 --> 00:36:09,710
33 because I was a little bit bored I

00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:13,430
signed up for a real girls

00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:16,190
workshop in 2013 and I thought it was so

00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:18,079
cool I opened the terminal for the first

00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:21,849
time on my computer and I could make

00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:23,930
that thing do things so that was yay

00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:25,190
yeah little bit of shameless

00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:28,609
self-promotion

00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:32,329
I have t-shirts you can find them here

00:36:28,609 --> 00:36:37,010
on teespring now if you use the code a

00:36:32,329 --> 00:36:39,380
msrb 10 you get 10% discount I like to

00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:44,440
make things that I feel should exist in

00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:46,130
the world so I'm personally very

00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:48,130
interested

00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:51,920
space that kind of lives between

00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:53,779
high-tech and low-tech so it kind of

00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,839
fascinates me that right at the time

00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:57,650
that the tech industry gives us mp3

00:36:56,839 --> 00:37:00,500
players

00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:05,539
the vinyl industry decides to come back

00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:07,970
from literal death the moment that we

00:37:05,539 --> 00:37:11,000
get iPads and tablets people start

00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:13,930
buying fancy notebooks like mole skins

00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,269
and Loyce terms and that kind of thing I

00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:20,539
like to write code but I write it on my

00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:24,259
super clicky mechanical keyboard that's

00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:28,130
so satisfying because I like to pretend

00:37:24,259 --> 00:37:31,490
I work in a 1980s newsroom on my

00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:33,380
typewriter I can buy like all the

00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:36,200
clothes I want online with the click of

00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:38,599
a button yet yarn stores are seeing a

00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:43,630
massive revival because people want to

00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:46,670
knit their own things I knit this

00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:50,089
yeah like the country of New Zealand

00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:54,259
cannot breed merino sheep fast enough to

00:37:50,089 --> 00:37:57,470
keep up with the demand selling a

00:37:54,259 --> 00:37:59,869
digital world in the analog world to

00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:02,390
have this like weird through balance

00:37:59,869 --> 00:38:06,579
thing going on and I find that super

00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:10,759
cool so I've been trying to get into the

00:38:06,579 --> 00:38:12,920
sort of like hardware wearable space you

00:38:10,759 --> 00:38:16,009
know building circuits with conductive

00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:18,230
thread and adding LEDs to your clothes

00:38:16,009 --> 00:38:20,779
and microcontrollers and all that kind

00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:23,119
of stuff so recently I learned how

00:38:20,779 --> 00:38:27,799
batteries work because I didn't really

00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:31,700
know that this is Amy Weber whoa and

00:38:27,799 --> 00:38:37,609
she's a programmer and alumni of Honda

00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:41,720
MIT air B&B and she is also known on

00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:44,720
Twitter as Sailor Mercury and she also

00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:48,910
designs and sells super cute t-shirts

00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:53,630
and sweaters on her website but she also

00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:55,430
makes and sells jeans so it's kind of

00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:57,270
like an 80s thing so I'm not sure if

00:38:55,430 --> 00:39:02,070
you're old enough but

00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:04,620
jeans are from magazine fanzine you

00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:06,420
could I think you can still buy them at

00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:08,310
if you go to like a comic book store

00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:10,650
they'll have like a little rack of

00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:13,140
things that people have made by hand and

00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:15,410
put in a photocopier and then you can

00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:18,570
buy them for a couple of bucks and

00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:23,060
they've kind of been making a revival in

00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:26,910
like the tech scene so she's got a

00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:31,050
couple it's one is called hip hip array

00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:35,400
cash cats and the literal Twitter bot

00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:40,350
zine and that's where I learned about

00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:42,540
batteries and so a battery has electrons

00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:46,140
on the positive and on the negative side

00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:48,990
and in the middle there's a barrier you

00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:51,510
make your circuit and the electrons move

00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:54,300
through the circuit and it kind of makes

00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:57,180
the LEDs bright light up or whatever

00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:59,310
you've got attached to it and so she

00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:01,590
explains like why do these electrons

00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:04,260
move why do they want to leave one space

00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:05,850
go to the other space she says well

00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:09,210
they're they're kind of like hipsters

00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:11,130
they don't want to be around in a space

00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:13,200
where there's like too many people who

00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:18,690
are like them they want to go to the

00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:21,690
other cooler space batteries does have

00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:25,050
hipsters in them okay I get it now

00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:28,140
so this zine also has it explains like

00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:31,980
api's and how to use your own Arduino so

00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:35,250
I highly recommend it so a little thing

00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:38,670
about me I could I learned coding on the

00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:42,690
job and a lot of people who are career

00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:46,320
changers do that so cool

00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:48,930
but a problem is sometimes you kind of

00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:51,030
learn enough to copy/paste something

00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:53,580
from Stack Overflow and then it kind of

00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:55,800
works enough it's fine and then you move

00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:57,420
on to another thing because your product

00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:00,930
owner is standing next to your desk and

00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:03,690
you have another ticket to do this is

00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:06,270
it's kind of on you to sometimes look

00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:08,490
back and say oh here's what I know

00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:11,490
but here's like a little gap and I need

00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:13,870
to plug that thing

00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:16,480
so I was talking to my colleague Kevin

00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:20,320
last week and I was like I'm gonna hate

00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:23,650
SQL absolutely hate it but it's because

00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:25,570
I'm really bad at it and and so Kevin

00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:27,940
was like now you know ask you I was

00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:30,160
really fun but you know what I'll do

00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:31,660
I'll organize a little workshop and then

00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:35,620
if you want to join that's that's

00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:38,560
totally cool and and so I was like oh

00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:41,230
yeah that's cool and I was immediately

00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:44,620
slightly worried that I would be like

00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:47,680
the worst performer in Kevin's SQL class

00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:49,450
and I don't want that so I thought I'll

00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:51,700
just go to code academy or something

00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:54,280
online and I'll I'll do that thing and

00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:55,660
then at least I'll know a bit more than

00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:59,200
everybody else and I'll feel good about

00:41:55,660 --> 00:42:03,090
myself but it was terrible it was like

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:08,680
type this click run here's a query tada

00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:12,820
I I don't get it and you need to explain

00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:15,160
to me in pictures what's happening and

00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:19,510
it was I was having like a little moment

00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:22,210
behind my desk like I can't do this if

00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:25,090
only there was like a fun zine that

00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:27,270
would explain this in this it's kind of

00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:29,650
in a way that makes sense for my brain

00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:32,770
but and apparently there was this is

00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:37,380
Julia Evans and she's a programmer for

00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:41,200
Montreal and she has written a bunch of

00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:44,890
genes are like oh get bite-sized

00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:47,710
Linux networking but also become a

00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:53,140
select star and that's the one I'm

00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:55,240
currently working through and so I'm not

00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:57,130
the only one news apparently found of

00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:00,610
tech scenes this is this like a whole

00:42:57,130 --> 00:43:03,040
thing there's like two fairs in the US

00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:08,830
you can go to Canadians have hopped on

00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:14,200
board and yeah like what they do is kind

00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:16,000
of let makers and designers focus what

00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:18,580
they say is they they focus on the link

00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:22,150
between sort of the intimacy and

00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:23,900
communal spirit of the the zine scene

00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:27,950
that's word

00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:29,299
and kind of democratizing tech so I

00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:32,900
think that's like a really interesting

00:43:29,299 --> 00:43:35,000
space having physical pieces of paper

00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:37,760
where someone is explaining something to

00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:43,089
you in an interesting way

00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:46,069
but it's about tech so I am a knitter

00:43:43,089 --> 00:43:48,559
and I love watching conference talks

00:43:46,069 --> 00:43:52,880
while I'm knitting because then I can

00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:56,150
feel super super productive and so a

00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:59,029
while ago I was watching sandy mats and

00:43:56,150 --> 00:44:02,720
her railsconf talk got a whiff of this

00:43:59,029 --> 00:44:05,680
and it was about code smells and in her

00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:08,029
talk she references this book

00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:11,210
refactoring by Kent Beck and Martin

00:44:08,029 --> 00:44:12,650
Fowler a lot and I don't know if you

00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:18,619
know this book but it's like really

00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:21,109
really big and so in her talk she

00:44:18,619 --> 00:44:23,270
discussed is this reference guide made

00:44:21,109 --> 00:44:26,420
by a company called industrial logic and

00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:29,359
it like on this side it it tells you a

00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:33,950
smell a code smell and then on this side

00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:38,109
it tells you where in the book you can

00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:42,559
find a way to combat that code smell and

00:44:38,109 --> 00:44:47,020
like I saw this and in my brain I was

00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:49,369
like I know looks like a strategy guide

00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:52,730
so I used to play a lot of video games

00:44:49,369 --> 00:44:55,099
as a kid and you can find these things

00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:57,470
online now but my sister and I would use

00:44:55,099 --> 00:45:01,400
we used to go to like a physical store

00:44:57,470 --> 00:45:03,260
and buy a magazine and they would have

00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,970
these strategy guides in them and it

00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:07,369
would say like oh if you have rock

00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:09,980
pokémon they're weak against water and

00:45:07,369 --> 00:45:14,390
fire pokemon are great against bug type

00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:17,210
Pokemon and so for some reason like this

00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:20,539
strap code smell strat where a reference

00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:23,329
guide and the Pokemon strategy guide

00:45:20,539 --> 00:45:27,920
they kind of fused together in my brain

00:45:23,329 --> 00:45:30,200
and became one thing and Pokemon are

00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:34,190
actually pretty similar to code smells

00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:37,280
like Pokemon are they all belong to a

00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:38,810
group and they have funny names

00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,630
and they have a certain way of being

00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:43,130
defeated and so I just thought you know

00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:46,220
why don't I just

00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:49,040
I'll just design some characters or

00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:52,160
Pokemon for each of the coat smells and

00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:54,500
then I can explain to my own brain kind

00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:59,380
of how they work and and so that's what

00:45:54,500 --> 00:46:02,840
I did and let's go through them I guess

00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:05,810
this is the dispensable group it's kind

00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:08,890
of easy to get into this is chat Kula

00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:12,530
and he represents comments code smells

00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:17,690
now this brings me to a thing about code

00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:21,410
smells having a comment in your code

00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:24,620
isn't inherently bad it's just that if

00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:28,220
you need a whole bunch of them for your

00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:30,190
code to make sense to other people then

00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:35,660
you probably want to do some refactoring

00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:38,930
so keep that in mind this is container

00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:42,110
on this is the data class code smell and

00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:45,920
this class kind of functions as a giant

00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:48,110
container and it's used by other classes

00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:52,370
but it doesn't really do very much on

00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:56,000
its own this is coffee free it's the

00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:59,840
duplicate code smell duplicate code code

00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:02,330
smell and yeah people are like oh no

00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:04,670
duplicating code is terrible and I never

00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:06,620
do that but it actually happens secretly

00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:10,760
like all the time because you have like

00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:12,740
a giant code base and at some point

00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:15,200
nobody really knows what's left and

00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:20,630
right anymore and you have a ticket to

00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:24,230
do so you just make it sleeps or is the

00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:27,860
lazy class code smell so if you have a

00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:30,290
really big code base it's it costs time

00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:33,200
and money and people are working on it

00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:35,330
and you have to pay those people and if

00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:38,540
you have classes that really are not

00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:40,790
earning their keep so to speak they are

00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:43,420
just like wasting people's time you know

00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:47,750
maybe there's a way to get rid of them

00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:50,210
this is a Dedrick this is dead code so

00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:52,279
something is not being used he needs to

00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:53,930
get rid of it

00:47:52,279 --> 00:47:56,809
this one is one of my favorites this is

00:47:53,930 --> 00:48:00,979
maybe use and it represents the

00:47:56,809 --> 00:48:02,719
speculative generality code smell so you

00:48:00,979 --> 00:48:04,339
know we all know we want to build for

00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:06,499
now and what do we need you know

00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:09,079
sometimes it's really hard to not have

00:48:06,499 --> 00:48:12,259
your brain go oh but I'll just make it

00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:14,660
like super easy to add stuff later or

00:48:12,259 --> 00:48:18,049
I'll just add this little thing here cuz

00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:20,869
we might need it so that's what this

00:48:18,049 --> 00:48:24,469
code smell is all about the next group

00:48:20,869 --> 00:48:27,619
is change preventers there are only

00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:30,229
three code smells in this group this is

00:48:27,619 --> 00:48:34,579
de minute Ron and it represents

00:48:30,229 --> 00:48:38,509
divergent change so when you're changing

00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:40,969
a class and then you're forced to make a

00:48:38,509 --> 00:48:44,390
whole bunch of method changes so say you

00:48:40,969 --> 00:48:47,119
have you're adding a product type and

00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:50,979
then you need to change all the methods

00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:54,589
for finding and displaying and ordering

00:48:50,979 --> 00:48:57,199
this is shoe tight and it represents

00:48:54,589 --> 00:48:59,869
shotgun surgery so you know you're in

00:48:57,199 --> 00:49:01,519
shotgun surgery hell if you're making a

00:48:59,869 --> 00:49:03,650
modification in your code and then you

00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:05,709
have to make like it's a bunch of tiny

00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:09,789
little changes everywhere

00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:14,029
this is ice burger and it represents

00:49:09,789 --> 00:49:17,209
parallel inheritance hierarchies so this

00:49:14,029 --> 00:49:19,489
is where you make changes to a subclass

00:49:17,209 --> 00:49:23,229
and then you need to make changes to

00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:28,160
another subclass of the parent class and

00:49:23,229 --> 00:49:31,549
you get a thing loaders are code smells

00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:33,199
that bloat your classes and methods so

00:49:31,549 --> 00:49:36,079
much that they become really really

00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:40,549
difficult to work with this is long

00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:44,239
drawn a long method large off really

00:49:40,549 --> 00:49:48,920
large class lists illah is the lung

00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:52,759
parameter list at clumping data clumps

00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:56,690
and for meats Rhian is primitive

00:49:52,759 --> 00:50:00,170
obsession it's when you use primitives

00:49:56,690 --> 00:50:01,969
instead of small objects and it's not

00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:04,130
the right tool for the right job and

00:50:01,969 --> 00:50:04,670
that kind of reminded me of trying to

00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:10,430
fit a

00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:13,160
square peg into a round hole so this

00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:18,010
group is called couplers this is fancy

00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:21,710
and it is the code smell feature env so

00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:25,579
this method accesses data from other

00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:28,640
classes more than or yeah then its own

00:50:25,579 --> 00:50:30,410
data and to me this is like a little guy

00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:32,000
that kind of looks over the fence and

00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:34,339
grass is always greener on the other

00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,970
side and that kind of reminded me of

00:50:34,339 --> 00:50:39,829
that TV show with the neighbor in the

00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:42,849
backyard home improvement and that's why

00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:45,890
I just gave him a little fishing hat

00:50:42,849 --> 00:50:50,150
this is a grab bite inappropriate

00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:53,119
intimacy this is when your class uses

00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:58,790
the internal fields and methods of other

00:50:53,119 --> 00:51:00,109
classes chain Ron or message chains so

00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:02,059
this is when your code is structured

00:51:00,109 --> 00:51:04,160
like a series of message chains and this

00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:06,589
kind of reminded me of that game you

00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,329
used to play as a kid Chinese whisper is

00:51:06,589 --> 00:51:10,160
where you kind of whisper something to

00:51:08,329 --> 00:51:12,020
one kid and then that kid whispers it to

00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,579
another kid and then you go through the

00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:15,500
whole group and at the end you have a

00:51:13,579 --> 00:51:20,200
completely different word than where he

00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:22,960
started out with this is middle manager

00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:25,819
represents the middle man code smell and

00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:27,950
this is where you have a class that only

00:51:25,819 --> 00:51:33,619
has one job and that is to tell

00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:37,160
everybody else what to do so the last

00:51:33,619 --> 00:51:40,849
group is oo abusers so these are all

00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:46,099
incomplete or in accurate applications

00:51:40,849 --> 00:51:49,069
of O programming this is a switch Zillah

00:51:46,099 --> 00:51:54,049
which is the super complicated switch

00:51:49,069 --> 00:51:59,000
statement temp T is temporary field coat

00:51:54,049 --> 00:52:01,849
smell yeah it kind of gets some value

00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,880
sometimes sometimes it's empty it's hard

00:52:01,849 --> 00:52:08,750
to see from the code what's going on

00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:10,819
it's not good this is my absolute

00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:18,380
favorite code smell this is a refused

00:52:10,819 --> 00:52:20,450
requests and so it kind of reminds me

00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:23,540
of like my eye of a son who is four

00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:26,480
years old and like if I give him food

00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:29,390
he'll like eat some of the food and then

00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:32,960
but none of the vegetables and refuse

00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:35,450
bequests is like that it's like subclass

00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:37,280
only uses some of the methods and

00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:41,590
properties of the parent class but not

00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:45,050
everything so it reminded me of that

00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:49,250
this is same klopse or alternative

00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:52,250
classes with different interfaces so two

00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:54,560
classes perform identical functions but

00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:56,690
they have different method names and it

00:52:54,560 --> 00:53:01,610
kind of reminded me of Pepsi and Cola so

00:52:56,690 --> 00:53:03,890
I made them look like hands so this is a

00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:07,340
little bit of a silly thing to do right

00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:10,820
to make drawings for your for your code

00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:12,740
smell but for me it kind out retain this

00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:17,420
information understand it a little bit

00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:20,240
better I was also just fun but I just

00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:22,430
kind of wanted to know like why why does

00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:27,080
this help why is this like a fun thing

00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:31,490
to do and so I did a little bit more

00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:36,350
research and I stumbled across this

00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:39,650
study from 2016 by the University of

00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:42,230
Waterloo in Canada and they did all

00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:44,000
these experiments on memory recall and

00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:46,640
they would have like one group of people

00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,040
write down all these words and they

00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:51,740
would have the other group of people

00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:54,230
make pictures for the words and they

00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:54,500
would like let them do that for a little

00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:56,870
bit

00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:59,420
take them away let them come back and

00:53:56,870 --> 00:54:05,530
then quiz them on how many words they

00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:08,090
could remember and so it turns out that

00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:10,430
the people who were doing all the

00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:13,280
pictures could remember way more words

00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:17,810
twice as many words as the people

00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:21,230
writing them down there is a reason why

00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:26,180
picture memory is kind of superior in

00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:31,450
that way so your brain is very much

00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:31,450
geared to visual information if you

00:54:31,759 --> 00:54:36,649
you draw a tree it kind of connects to

00:54:34,369 --> 00:54:38,179
all the thousands picked thousands of

00:54:36,649 --> 00:54:40,429
pictures of trees that you've seen in

00:54:38,179 --> 00:54:43,969
your life and have stored in your brain

00:54:40,429 --> 00:54:46,999
and it's also great news is that they if

00:54:43,969 --> 00:54:50,899
you're not a great designer like me it

00:54:46,999 --> 00:54:56,079
doesn't matter even if your drawings are

00:54:50,899 --> 00:55:00,279
crappy your memory recall is still good

00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:02,599
so it's not just about memory retention

00:55:00,279 --> 00:55:05,179
scientists believe that sort of like the

00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:09,249
rhythmic motion of making sketches is

00:55:05,179 --> 00:55:12,349
actually relaxing to humans and it

00:55:09,249 --> 00:55:15,859
conquers our fight fight or flight

00:55:12,349 --> 00:55:19,699
instincts and it reduces cortisol which

00:55:15,859 --> 00:55:20,929
is the body stress hormone and so it

00:55:19,699 --> 00:55:23,119
kind of makes sense right humans are

00:55:20,929 --> 00:55:25,039
visual creatures so these things feel

00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:27,439
good to us

00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:30,889
a study from Drexel University shows

00:55:27,439 --> 00:55:33,559
that the process of making art it

00:55:30,889 --> 00:55:37,099
stimulates your brain's reward center

00:55:33,559 --> 00:55:40,429
this was me trying to like draw brain

00:55:37,099 --> 00:55:44,539
sorry for that but it has the same

00:55:40,429 --> 00:55:49,369
effect on people as dancing laughing and

00:55:44,539 --> 00:55:52,130
eating chocolate and yeah participants

00:55:49,369 --> 00:55:55,489
for that study also reported feeling

00:55:52,130 --> 00:56:00,729
more creative and they felt like they

00:55:55,489 --> 00:56:04,189
could better solve problems afterwards

00:56:00,729 --> 00:56:08,799
so generally speaking humans are better

00:56:04,189 --> 00:56:12,679
at visualizing images than visualize or

00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:17,329
processing visual data than processing

00:56:12,679 --> 00:56:20,839
text we process images 60,000 times

00:56:17,329 --> 00:56:22,519
faster than text and 90% of the

00:56:20,839 --> 00:56:27,849
information that is being sent to your

00:56:22,519 --> 00:56:31,130
brain is visual information but when we

00:56:27,849 --> 00:56:35,599
are at work this is usually what we're

00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:38,149
looking at so I'm not saying that we

00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:41,299
should all burn our computers and start

00:56:38,149 --> 00:56:44,119
coding and pictures or something but I

00:56:41,299 --> 00:56:45,530
think sort of like visual information

00:56:44,119 --> 00:56:48,710
can help us in

00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:51,620
in other parts of our day-to-day so to

00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:54,620
speak so if you're like trying to grasp

00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:57,080
like a complex principle or trying to

00:56:54,620 --> 00:57:00,080
you know explain something to a

00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:02,060
colleague I tried to write down to law

00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:03,920
of Demeter here so you cannot pick your

00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:05,360
nose or you can't pick your nose

00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:09,770
you can pick your friends but you cannot

00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:15,680
pick your friends nose do it like that

00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:17,870
it's more fun so but also if you are

00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,910
trying to explain to your product owner

00:57:17,870 --> 00:57:21,650
why is something complex and why is it

00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:23,750
going to take longer than they think it

00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:26,120
is you know write it down on paper and

00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:29,840
sketch it out for them are you designing

00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:32,180
an app write it on paper and show your

00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:34,310
stakeholder it's like is this this thing

00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:35,870
is that what you want it's gonna work

00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:37,850
like this you don't have to code

00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:42,800
anything yet you can just show them on

00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:46,160
paper and like I feel like we can do

00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:48,590
better in sort of giving information to

00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:52,220
our colleagues and the people that we

00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:54,320
work with so let's all get like

00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:58,160
whiteboard markers it's what we do it

00:57:54,320 --> 00:58:00,950
young capital are our walls are all

00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:03,620
glass and we write on them like all day

00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:06,890
long that window cleaners were not happy

00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:08,480
with us this week and so I wanted to

00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:12,710
kind of leave you with this this is an

00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:17,030
article from last week a third of Dutch

00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:20,390
IT workers regularly considers leaving

00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:26,960
the field that's a third that's a lot

00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:29,930
and they were saying that the constant

00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:34,100
pressure of having to learn and having

00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:38,060
to keep up was getting to them and I

00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:40,700
think that if we make learning more fun

00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:44,240
and not just tell people well if you

00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:50,030
don't understand it read the effing RTF

00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:54,160
of 70 pages but maybe we can help people

00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:57,050
make this more interesting more fun and

00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:59,000
keep that pressure that they put on

00:58:57,050 --> 00:59:03,170
themselves keep it down

00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:05,330
because not only do we need new people

00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:06,920
in this industry but we need to retain

00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:11,870
the people that we have it's such a

00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:17,690
waste if we let them go so on that fun

00:59:11,870 --> 00:59:25,639
note go for it and draw thank you

00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:25,639
[Applause]

00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:44,270
questions no right now okay good

00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:46,250
oh there's a question this way not yet

00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:49,220
but I have been considering it because I

00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:58,120
think it will be fun right Alena is

00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:58,120
gonna help me move okay oh my god yes

00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:03,190
Matt as a question

01:00:42,640 --> 01:01:09,859
thank you yes I definitely struggled in

01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:12,530
the beginning yeah yeah I yeah I

01:01:09,859 --> 01:01:19,520
definitely sometimes try and relate

01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:21,349
things to like how I know like like a

01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:23,300
real-world example or not even a

01:01:21,349 --> 01:01:29,060
real-world example but just kind of make

01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:30,619
it fun in my brain so like for me I used

01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:33,280
to play a lot of video games and for me

01:01:30,619 --> 01:01:36,920
like dynamic typing is it's like Kirby

01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:42,500
because if you know Kirby he can like

01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:45,710
suck up there he he can be like like a

01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:49,790
knight or he can be a doctor or he can

01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:52,820
be I don't know anything I try to make

01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:58,190
it sort of like something in the real

01:01:52,820 --> 01:02:01,089
world to help me understand the concept

01:01:58,190 --> 01:02:01,089
