It's been a while since the last Amsterdam.rb event ðŸ‘‹ We hope everyone is still doing well during this time.

All attendees can talk and ask questions with the community and speakers on the Ruby Netherlands Slack. Join our Slack today by following this link: https://amsrbslack.herokuapp.com. We will be chatting in the #amsterdam channel during this event, so don't forget to join the #amsterdam channel.

With this being a virtual meetup, food and beverages will be of the "bring your own" kind. Grab your most comfy chair and your favorite snacks and join us online!

See you on the interwebs!

Arno, Floor, Tom & Rayta
