today we have clickers Peter who will

00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:18,420
talk about Ruby community people likes

00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,459
better

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:24,000

takes when you are there after the break

00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:52,680
[Music]

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:57,930

infrastructure reach me for last couple

00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:21,120
years I've been doing Cuban ice and a

00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:23,660
lot of work and some people here for you

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,230

00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:31,980
so that's where you can find me as well

00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:38,190
okay this talk is sort of about option

00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:42,620
ops life so I first want to know a

00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:48,870
little bit so what is your profession

00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:53,060
who identifies as it because that's

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:56,010
great well I didn't Isis operations

00:03:53,060 --> 00:04:03,709
that's very cool as well did someone put

00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:06,780
their hand up twice so qat people here I

00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:08,849
there is a whole tract or in ID of

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,599
course I know that's sort of the whole

00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:18,180
point any management people or product

00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:20,690
owners or yes very said that they're not

00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:23,660
that's just made up in great numbers

00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:26,340
yeah

00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:38,400
is there anyone here we didn't identify

00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:48,230
with any of these roles developer

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:48,230
relations I don't think they believe it

00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:55,320
we're sure it is all right so now they

00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,100
have a nice overview of who's in the

00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,990
crowd

00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,490
sorry I have to look back at the slide

00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:04,169
so I rearranged the whole bunch of it

00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:09,720
this afternoon so I keep my train or

00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:12,770
something so I was in a room who is

00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,770
responsible for production

00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:23,490
that's who can be caught and might do a

00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:32,700
301 redirection to someone else's nose

00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:35,729
to fix problem so and right now all

00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:44,479
right so it's question for you are you

00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:44,479
on call 24/7 24/7 365 exactly yes yes

00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,380
[Laughter]

00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:19,160
right so what is I had to put this into

00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:19,160
your head only if you answer tonight and

00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:31,289
ops is painful it's the it's the stuff

00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:35,210
in my opinion that is never planned it's

00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:38,210
reactive it's not part of the sprint

00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,210
right

00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:43,440
trying to get a little bit more into

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,440
detail and I'm also very interested in

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:55,910
the views of this community I do will be

00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:55,910
a lot anymore but I used to be I was

00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:11,070
[Music]

00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:14,840
what is ops very often it sucks it's not

00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:18,289
visible unless things blow up I

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:23,669
mentioned I have been doing Cuban ice

00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:26,759
super hard so hard at some point I

00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:30,889
started a kubernetes workgroup for ups

00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:35,270
engineer's just mental supports

00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:38,130
technical supports everything is new

00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:40,800
luckily Ruby on Rails is very dependable

00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:44,699
and like you sort of know what's up

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,849
because of the standards you have a

00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:49,800
whole kind of philosophy around Ruby on

00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:52,889
Rails and I think it's great if you

00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:56,940
totally embed that philosophy especially

00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:58,979
as opposition years because means I can

00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:01,820
sort of figure out what's going on as

00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,990
well even though I'm not technically a

00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:09,180
[Music]

00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:13,340
full-time program this is something I do

00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:13,340
inside as well and also the official

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:48,130
production it wasn't the same two years

00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:54,080
ago

00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:56,450
anyway um I don't know if image endless

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,130
light or anything I just sort of want to

00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:02,390
do a Kickstarter around this

00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:07,930
conversation of why this ops and these

00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:14,240
people start of my career was in

00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:17,600
basically shepherding developments the

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:22,279
results into production so I used to

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,960
work at a medium-sized ISP which had

00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:26,120
eight ancient systems because they

00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:31,040
started in the beginning of the nineties

00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:36,620
everything was smart and what a smart no

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:39,620
no but so basically I was responsible

00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:42,200
for the test systems and the developers

00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:45,700
would say yeah I'm done and they give

00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:48,830
you a war file or whatever they was that

00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:50,720
and I was responsible for getting it

00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:54,550
into the test systems everything was

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,930
manual this was over twelve years ago

00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:58,970
everything was manual I had to do

00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:03,560
deployments at night because this isn't

00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:06,190
meant to be done to comply so yeah you

00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:09,110
don't want to burden developers quick is

00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:12,820
nasty work so this is for the UPS people

00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:17,500
so we would have a dinner party at 7:00

00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,500
during one or two bottles of wine start

00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:29,089
in hindsight not best friend we always

00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,770
managed to get through and there was a

00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:35,270
very good social function for this as

00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:38,290
well but in hindsight it was very bad it

00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:44,830
was is too institution either like

00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:48,890
station realizing thing and like we got

00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:50,480
tears for working at night instead of

00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:54,620
fixing the problem of having to work at

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,780
night sometimes you can't work around it

00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:59,000
especially with these variations bespoke

00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:01,160
systems that were built in-house like

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,540
that there were no building systems

00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,630
this kind of stuff in the 90s because

00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:10,310
the internet was just getting started so

00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:13,880
that they build something in-house but

00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:18,260
that was my first job getting stuff from

00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:19,820
developers into production then start as

00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,650
a production engineer I was just

00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,570
responsible for the test systems but

00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:26,020
everything they have problems in

00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:28,820
production I was with the person who

00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:32,090
both work with the developers the QA

00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:34,910
people and the systems people because

00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:36,410
the I to get access to the systems and

00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:38,300
nobody else could because developers

00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:41,630
cannot be allowed to access the systems

00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:43,190
they don't know anything works except

00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:48,380
for the actual applications that they're

00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:52,580
making so at some point I did join the

00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:55,760
depression systems team and still chef

00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:59,150
rogues this all pipeline which was very

00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,820
manual release cycles were basically

00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:05,350
once every two months so it wasn't like

00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:09,140
I to stay up nights every week or daily

00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:15,110
which is much more normal now or at

00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:18,920
least deploying day so I want to sort of

00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:22,700
start with some observations I made over

00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:28,070
these years about who are these people

00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:30,080
in my team so sort of making this bit

00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:32,510
more exaggerated and make you have any

00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:36,880
things I've missed just feel free to

00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:40,520
return up in the workshop so developers

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:44,120
you're great you are the artists and

00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:48,020
makers of the organization you had a

00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:52,160
truly creative people you really

00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:53,800
gravitate towards new and shiny ship you

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:58,810
are very close to the business because

00:12:53,800 --> 00:13:03,910
they tell you what to do awesome or

00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:07,760
larger or exaggerating a little bit

00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:09,560
I'm much more prone to experiment and

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:16,810
they trace on the results of those

00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:16,810
experience and you are the ones who

00:13:18,200 --> 00:14:19,200
anyone who has a comment on this yes

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:22,800
music okay this is a very cool

00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,960
observation and because stereo these are

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,200
stereotypes they're obviously very wrong

00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:31,950
I'm currently the client they developed

00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:35,130
our system in the 90s ancient technology

00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:36,930
still running today developers who build

00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:38,850
it are still there today which is also

00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:40,980
not something you see very often people

00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:43,470
work for 20 30 years at the company we

00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,510
the first two months I was there we had

00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:48,300
a party because the main developer there

00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:54,240
was working there for 30 years this is a

00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:57,260
company of like 20 30 people still using

00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:00,630
a lot of the same old technology but

00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:04,950
imagine is this alarm system was using

00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:11,610
event sources in the 90s now event

00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:13,410
sourcing is all the rage right so these

00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:16,320
stereotypes are obviously wrong because

00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:19,550
these people also know that we've

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:23,310
introduced kubernetes there and modern

00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:27,420
code management practices and starting

00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:28,860
to roll okay they're actually very

00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:31,590
enthusiastic

00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:34,080
like I come in on the Monday or Tuesday

00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:35,910
and they say hey I worked on this on the

00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:45,630
weekend and I tried this MongoDB in

00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:52,970
there but it's broken so it's very hard

00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:56,400
to break the stereotypes because it's so

00:15:52,970 --> 00:16:14,100
easy to be good people in boxes for

00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:18,470
pages it's been doing their own thing

00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,470
for 20 years it's amazing

00:16:24,500 --> 00:17:09,500
but it's the we are we doing nothing and

00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:24,839
they're responsive and interpretation so

00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:28,410
they love it when you stand at their

00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:29,760
desk operations people love it if you

00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:36,120
come to them with your problem instead

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:37,740
of creating the ticket also they're

00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,770
pretty conservative they like their own

00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,720
stuff because they they know they know

00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:46,019
all the devil's

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,870
that exist in that system and they're

00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:51,299
happy so just reboot the server because

00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:57,779
of memory instead of fundamentally

00:17:51,299 --> 00:18:00,590
fixing the problem but these are the

00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:02,759
people they don't create the business a

00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:05,100
protected and make sure that everything

00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:07,169
is running you cannot change their way

00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,970
way of working because there are the

00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:12,379
people who keep the ship afloat closed

00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:18,990
if you if you change their their ways

00:18:12,379 --> 00:18:35,299
we're all gonna die right finally any

00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:39,000
comments on this I saw you sir I mean

00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:42,029
tell me I'm wrong because I am no

00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:50,450
usually usually especially nowadays and

00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:55,320
everything kind of or even requiring

00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:58,350
responsible terraform automation tools

00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:00,240
around of them deployment tools to ease

00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:02,820
the deployment for the developers

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,360
maintaining kinetics clustered units

00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,360
updates

00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:10,679
yeah great so the stereotype is and

00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:13,379
Myrlie broken as well exactly who's one

00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:38,419
stereotype which is mister yes

00:19:13,379 --> 00:19:41,639
bringing ridiculously oversized yeah

00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:43,740
it's not that case but at the same time

00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:45,720
there's also ups people who've been

00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:50,220
working there for many years ten years

00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:54,590
ten years is a long time unity do they

00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,590
do terraform and spore any of that stuff

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:03,809
now this is very easy for companies to

00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:06,529
sort of stagnate and depend on the you

00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:08,909
have a product it's working

00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:10,080
don't touch it don't touch it don't jump

00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:13,710
getting through this today

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:16,490
engage the feisty this is not a nice be

00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:19,440
at the company I'm talking about yeah

00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:23,610
and yeah well at the ISP as well they

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:32,940
were very very this wasn't ITIL kind of

00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:38,279
company who knows I do okay this is sort

00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:40,169
of good but they would have a cup which

00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:42,299
is a change advisory board they would

00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:44,309
meet every Friday and they would discuss

00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:48,450
what changed state to do on the life

00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:49,889
systems every for you next month if you

00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,690
have a very complex system that you

00:20:49,889 --> 00:20:53,370
actually don't control or a various

00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:56,370
character change because every time you

00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:58,970
change it breaks then yeah you probably

00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:01,500
need to change in spice report because

00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:04,019
can I touch the system no you guys

00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:10,169
because it's like he'll there yeah we

00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:12,899
try just this a year ago and well how

00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:16,559
did we end up your Mysterio touch that I

00:21:12,899 --> 00:21:18,809
just described our practices from 10 20

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:23,700
30 years ago is this odd stuff it's not

00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:24,330
what we're doing anymore we cannot do

00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,600
this anymore

00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:34,080
because our systems or systems I mean

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:36,570
the entire system of application is

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,039
going way more complex we find out

00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:40,649
running credit applications but we're

00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:42,740
running cough-cough clusters and god

00:21:40,649 --> 00:21:46,500
knows what

00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:49,080
so needed specialization this started

00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:53,220
already in the 90s the systems like

00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:54,870
physical systems computer network very

00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:58,799
complex stuff you don't want to burden

00:21:54,870 --> 00:22:00,899
developers with that so you had

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,460
specialized teams and they would take

00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:03,659
care of that and the application people

00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,179
would take care of the business needs

00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:10,120
that's sort of how we got into this

00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:14,610
option desolate and the first thing

00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:19,870
change fast we cannot you know have this

00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:22,600
department because then we cannot move

00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:25,539
as fast as the as the market demands

00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:31,960
basically not that we should cater to

00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:34,270
every whim of the market so and my

00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:40,840
personal observation is the things just

00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:43,600
keep moving faster and at some point but

00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:47,679
ABS ABS changed watch moves in my

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:51,730
opinion like you mentioned you're doing

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:56,679
infrared in first coat puppet chef but

00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:58,240
we hate ansible terraform docker if

00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:00,789
you're in in infrastructure management

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,559
and you haven't heard of any of these

00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:10,960
things you've been sleeping on the job

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:13,480
and probably you do continuous

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:16,690
integration and continuous delivery now

00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:22,919
let's give means automatic casters test

00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:30,580
after your gut pushes all of this stuff

00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:32,919
and there are people that basically made

00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:37,570
both statement like for people now add

00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:41,549
code not if you called declarative state

00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:41,549
which is chapter Transpo

00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:52,480
it's the carrot states and then things

00:23:46,330 --> 00:24:04,809
will actually done it them for let's say

00:23:52,480 --> 00:24:10,659
up smooth that there are not people good

00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:22,360
so right can we agree on this I know not

00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:23,570
every other person must move when I see

00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,390
her

00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:27,680
of course and yes if the application if

00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:31,330
there was an actual problem with the

00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:34,340
patient fell apart we always call but

00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:36,800
let's say 20 years ago in whisper

00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:41,870
definitely acceptable if they were not

00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:43,640
reachable all right now you need to

00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:49,910
share your knowledge of your third

00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:53,480
patient as well so today and I do

00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:56,120
remember fines that were totally fine

00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:58,700
with them to have a completely broken

00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,920
collection system closed or something

00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:08,310
that just kept adding more and more

00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:11,520
failures to use by what makes it after

00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:11,520
[Music]

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:23,620
patient people also definitely in the

00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:26,560
booth and you are all at the right place

00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:30,080
if you're doing will do most development

00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:39,950
it's such an opinionated system you're

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:41,500
doing most interesting really happy with

00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:46,010
it

00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:50,660
new twelve factor app is basically will

00:25:46,010 --> 00:26:08,230
be on Rails for me it's close enough I

00:25:50,660 --> 00:26:13,280
don't know like framework to do it their

00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:15,020
artifact your happen I can think of a

00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,430
bunch of things that it doesn't do out

00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:22,130
of the box that I would like it's people

00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:25,220
that's sorry whether it's for me as an

00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:28,100
Operations person uses the MVC model in

00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:31,070
a very predictable way if there even if

00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:33,590
I don't write any code on the databases

00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:37,630
I can figure out what's going wrong

00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:37,630
even though developer is not

00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:51,229
love developers nowadays do a lot of

00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:55,129
here on release management really happy

00:26:51,229 --> 00:26:57,259
with that as well because so my first

00:26:55,129 --> 00:26:59,450
full-time job I talked about earlier

00:26:57,259 --> 00:27:00,019
where at the shop or in this piece of

00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:01,759
code

00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:03,999
I was also basically tuning in this

00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:07,039
management thing figuring out all

00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:09,289
interacting parts because it was not one

00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:11,679
application that we get to deploy but

00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:14,720
was not and they were not micro services

00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,489
it was basically all system of like 12

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,769
people education said all the billing

00:27:16,489 --> 00:27:21,729
and I have to the podium our step

00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:25,340
something went wrong on one side and

00:27:21,729 --> 00:27:27,970
sort of had to figure out all these

00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:32,919
things comes our way

00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:36,429
so I think that people definitely

00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:36,429
changed a lot for the better

00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:46,549
what new product development and from

00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:52,899
development includes def a product

00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:52,899
owners - you guys do they know how to do

00:27:53,769 --> 00:28:08,690
things okay Donnie we should fix the

00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:15,710
problem if it's not the developer sorry

00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:17,299
other people but the DevOps team is not

00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:18,799
going to fix this thing for you it's the

00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:20,330
ops people and the deaf people doing

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:25,009
this together will fix these things

00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:36,080
right but there's a learning curve you

00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:37,700
so I feel I'm safe to say or I feel safe

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,669
to say that actually bill definitely

00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:45,080
learned how to code even though I'm

00:28:40,669 --> 00:28:47,749
already good Jane was there allows it so

00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:50,960
change the developers to do extra

00:28:47,749 --> 00:28:57,919
operations it's only starting to be

00:28:50,960 --> 00:29:02,929
thank you actually yes sir it's a

00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:05,419
learning curve DevOps movement was not

00:29:02,929 --> 00:29:08,210
or the devil's movement somehow the

00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:10,990
devil people are your old impress people

00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:13,250
that they're still in the same people

00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:14,929
there's a lot of people who go or social

00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:17,600
death ops engineer and they're basically

00:29:14,929 --> 00:29:21,340
just maintaining infrastructure that's

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,340
not that's not the point

00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:37,490
just 100 percent of nodes are we yeah

00:29:34,669 --> 00:29:45,970
how you work is 100% about people yeah

00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:45,970
you would technology yeah so that's it

00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:51,529
love hiring money you're saying I hire

00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:55,520
that person because that's very useful

00:29:51,529 --> 00:30:01,899
tool in one but that's not the case

00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:06,950
because there used to be your people so

00:30:01,899 --> 00:30:09,260
ops of course I'm exaggerating again ops

00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:12,590
people think in aggregates what is the

00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:17,029
health of my platform all the services

00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:25,279
are there is there one percent failure

00:30:17,029 --> 00:30:27,380
rate across the entire fleet like a

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:33,710
large percentage of the air is coming

00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:35,419
from this there's people technical think

00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:39,919
in specifics you need to be able to know

00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:42,559
the exact details no need and I will

00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:52,549
happen me to migrate the traffic away

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:56,809
from the proteins inside out they okay

00:30:52,549 --> 00:31:01,850
now finally why you're here what can you

00:30:56,809 --> 00:31:04,140
as a will be personally to the PC honest

00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:08,130
I have to touch your nose

00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:21,440
for the last three years okay this is

00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:21,440
what I did a company a few years ago but

00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:28,970
basically help the deaf people as well

00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:32,280
try to make sense of information things

00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:35,040
if I put in place the infrastructure to

00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:41,340
update your own apps after a gift tag

00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:43,710
and then you get some buttons to turn

00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:45,240
into actually you can do that yourself

00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:47,280
don't you find you this you know the

00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:52,440
application much much better than you

00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:58,890
said I only know about H speed load

00:31:52,440 --> 00:32:01,940
balancers a lineage right so what do you

00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:10,950
have to think about that in developer

00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:13,890
sadly doesn't exist everywhere grace for

00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:16,860
ops people are growing which means you

00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:18,270
have a fleet of instances take one again

00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:22,760
you have an update you take one down you

00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:26,429
put nuances up and continue on excuses

00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:28,320
that implies that you're running two

00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:33,419
versions concurrently so your

00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:35,970
applications to deal with that any and

00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:37,860
just what goes wrong if you run two

00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:42,210
applications concurrently and or two

00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:48,929
versions concurrently and database

00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:51,000
schema so you have to think about schema

00:32:48,929 --> 00:32:58,230
management where if you change your

00:32:51,000 --> 00:33:01,980
column you can add a new column and then

00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:04,970
only remove the off column after not

00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:09,230
very important that's basically it and

00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:13,710
these are standard practices for you

00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:17,880
know this is actually something that

00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:21,360
this company but

00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:23,790
there's blind spots here as well what we

00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,570
did is we put the Olivia heritage in

00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:29,210
Ducker

00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:34,350
the pre-generated on static assets which

00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:36,330
and they get generated actually

00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:40,500
javascript and while your images and so

00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:44,610
on what happens is you're running two

00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:46,410
versions concurrently your rails

00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:48,300
controllers will reference paths that

00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:51,720
don't exist on the other version

00:33:48,300 --> 00:34:04,140
distances and you will get mrs. if you

00:33:51,720 --> 00:34:08,570
don't use like CBN assets to the CDN you

00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:08,570
have them in place before you roll your

00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:28,910
logic we did run into this and so if you

00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:35,070
get this button to deploy to production

00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:41,220
I would do projects and smoke this after

00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:45,860
deployments do general bicycle' things

00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:45,860
log in make some changes see if it works

00:34:46,130 --> 00:35:00,900
so breakfast these are ups turns red and

00:34:52,530 --> 00:35:04,830
use anyone breath is great error

00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:07,740
duration this is what I look at as not

00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:12,510
person on my incoming traffic I look at

00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:14,160
the incoming rate of traffic changed the

00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:19,980
error rate has changed

00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:22,280
Time magazine move SPF it uses sort of

00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,280
the same

00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:34,260
utilization saturation how far am I in

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,540
my capacity this is definitely still an

00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:40,800
option responsibility provision

00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:46,560
incapacity and errors again keep an eye

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:48,660
on your why is this important

00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:53,450
you ran our tests and everything was

00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:53,450
fine 100% code coverage it was Green

00:35:55,100 --> 00:36:06,090
users are weird deduction is nothing

00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:07,470
like a test environment there's so out

00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:10,140
of all the people who are not in

00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:30,090
operations who has full access to

00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:34,500
production logs okay so this is what the

00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:36,360
industry's ability now basically means

00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:39,450
can you deduce the internal state of

00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:42,540
fury' systems by looking what is going

00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:46,290
in which means the entire raw impressed

00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:48,930
what is coming out and can you deduce

00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:50,490
the internal state of the system from

00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:52,940
the southeast yeah it's can be the

00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:59,520
actual request at all so it just walks

00:36:52,940 --> 00:37:01,230
statistics tracing for super important

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,880
if you if you want the responsibility of

00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:05,460
being able to deploy on a Friday

00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,260
afternoon to production totally family

00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:10,950
we should totally be able to do that

00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:16,710
no deploying on Friday cuts away 20% of

00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:26,510
your situation speed I realize not

00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:31,720
everyone can do it so for errors you can

00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:33,520
get the threats and use errors

00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:36,040
most important thing that you can look

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,900
at sector aces from will be are often

00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:44,290
very useful you can using the important

00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:46,119
gem for century you know what you can

00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:51,420
use house and century run it yourself

00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:54,310
it's not truly open sourcing tomorrow

00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:59,790
and you look at nice structure for

00:37:54,310 --> 00:38:02,619
secretaries of here applications these

00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:11,550
will actually know what happens these

00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:11,550
exceptions when spoiled the ending knife

00:38:13,109 --> 00:38:19,500
also loves nobody reads their locks

00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:23,710
because it's a huge mess of just

00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:25,030
constant stream of nonsense I see girls

00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:27,940
logging is especially problematic

00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:30,160
because it's not the line and this is

00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:33,609
not our most loading systems work you

00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:37,540
have to get them get the multiple lines

00:38:33,609 --> 00:38:44,140
into one event your parser or anything

00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:50,800
as anyone everyone wrote - Trey OS you

00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:53,980
can act Nico here this this is not great

00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,319
and mugs are there to help you

00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:59,650
the opinion structured logs there's a

00:38:56,319 --> 00:39:01,630
thirty years for gem for what range who

00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:05,680
wrote this thing someone who is

00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:07,869
responsible for production and its

00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,910
timing and defaults girls logging and

00:39:07,869 --> 00:39:12,069
basically gets you this and you can also

00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:16,030
decorate your existing map lines with

00:39:12,069 --> 00:39:16,690
more mater that this is the easiest way

00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:19,359
to get started

00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:25,450
it takes you a few minutes tops to

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:31,180
between easy to add more fields so you

00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:34,000
know users and whatever a better version

00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:35,950
of this is auto tracing that's going too

00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:46,500
deep and that's definitely more of an

00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:46,500
investment metrics super important

00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:52,330
that's for more automation in Eustis so

00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:54,100
as as an anthem for our first investor

00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:57,130
make sure that auto-scaling in and so

00:39:54,100 --> 00:40:02,110
onwards I need some signals throughout

00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:04,530
to scale our hangout just be CPU off to

00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:04,530
nothing life

00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:13,710
also if the office people are still

00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:16,270
responsible for reporting slides in your

00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:18,400
service availability basically and then

00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:21,280
to have signals that are more than just

00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:29,770
whatever you're a street racing get you

00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:51,580
that's all yours get handled and yeah so

00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:53,710
basically yeah these are things that you

00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:56,170
can easily do to help your octave with

00:40:53,710 --> 00:41:02,710
won't take you that much time to get

00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:05,140
started on it and they will see I see

00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:08,320
deep something you need to do together

00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:10,720
ups and that it's very often that either

00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:13,420
they are people or the deaf people or

00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:16,090
worse therefore people implement UCSD

00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:18,660
system and nobody actually understands

00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:21,190
how it works exactly this one person

00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:23,080
automates all these things very

00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:25,660
dangerous because then you not need

00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:31,420
power to default question you know

00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:33,490
what's going on yet put it together and

00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:34,900
make sure that you understand so can you

00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:52,120
speak up if you don't understand it's

00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:58,220
fine I tell very very ancient IT systems

00:41:52,120 --> 00:42:03,750
management thing comes from the UK army

00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:07,620
- very huge thing that was mostly

00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:09,660
implemented halfway by telcos these huge

00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:12,570
organizations that actually have like

00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:17,880
tons of middle management to force this

00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:20,940
thing until it's mostly shunt in the

00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:23,610
entire industry as being complete waste

00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:25,650
of time and not working anyway there

00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:30,300
were something that were pretty nice

00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:32,160
about its software delivery lifecycle or

00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:34,320
software development workshop you should

00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:36,780
take it also means like at some point

00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:41,730
we're just going to discontinue how do

00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:44,460
you manage that existing clients move to

00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:50,850
something else are they control what

00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:53,340
what application is used is other asset

00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:56,430
management is something that absolutely

00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:59,360
all companies are terrible at but this

00:42:56,430 --> 00:43:01,650
is super important and CMDB is a

00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:03,150
configuration management database it

00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:05,400
used to be something that you manually

00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:07,440
filling your configurations copy/paste

00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,480
it from your config file and at least

00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:13,050
it's sorted into a database but these

00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:21,240
things always diverged which in frescoed

00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:25,710
and so on dress code is to see for the

00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:27,120
future in supply chain management is one

00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:30,410
of the biggest problems we're gonna have

00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:35,310
as an IT industry

00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:38,880
yes but ruby gems are not perfect either

00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:40,260
yum yum for the process here today the

00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:44,150
King done something a few months ago

00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:47,100
where there was basically some gem

00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:50,490
included in another gem that everyone

00:43:47,100 --> 00:44:03,110
uses and it was just constantly sending

00:43:50,490 --> 00:44:05,760
off simply so it's like a management

00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:09,060
making sure that the software you

00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,920
include that your product doesn't try to

00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:12,990
screw you over and I know that it's very

00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:15,870
hard to catch every piece of software

00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:28,830
that's in there at least implement

00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:33,630
something as great man yes there's bad

00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:35,460
list of gems or a gem versions that are

00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:38,190
already identified but people keep using

00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:39,720
it because nobody is looking for it's

00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:42,030
very easy to add that to your CI

00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,620
pipeline absolutely watch people

00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:47,790
generally won't think about it unless

00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:49,080
they have like also a security that's

00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:51,270
very rare as well

00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:59,850
but at least use something like a

00:44:51,270 --> 00:45:02,670
dependency checker and yeah so a product

00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:04,710
this is sort of an extension of product

00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:11,010
selection is hard what components you

00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:14,940
picked about your H none no easy fix

00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:22,080
just try things and great race the

00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:25,020
presents break things and not invented

00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:27,740
here syndrome it's also still existing

00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:30,620
everywhere in ops lands and in that land

00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:33,750
even if there's a perfectly working

00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:35,790
thing for your problem we will try to

00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:38,820
implement it ourselves because here we

00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:42,300
cannot work out fifty bucks a month to

00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:44,100
just use some class products I know not

00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:46,320
everyone can use SAS products because of

00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,010
security but unless you have that

00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:49,080
problem

00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:50,520
please use SAS product because that it

00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:54,270
just means more stuff that you don't

00:45:50,520 --> 00:46:02,100
have anything and your other people are

00:45:54,270 --> 00:46:05,820
already very tired keep saying things

00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:10,520
simple things

00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:10,520
it's the nicer first or simple it stupid

00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:22,900
that's the practice

00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:25,780
of people tended to practice until I

00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:32,650
would argue that Cuban is just necessary

00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:37,619
complexity but not for every skill and

00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:41,109
how do you cross the verses are divided

00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:44,740
it's very hard so for the other people

00:46:41,109 --> 00:46:46,000
we have to start doing this if trusted

00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:48,849
in the developers they are not there to

00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,710
make your day sorry

00:46:48,849 --> 00:46:53,920
they just want to do their work as well

00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:58,990
trust them to do their work trust them

00:46:53,920 --> 00:47:04,359
to own up to the tough breaks but you

00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:07,839
move faster it will get a healthier

00:47:04,359 --> 00:47:09,849
environment and they will give trust

00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:12,270
back again when you tell them please

00:47:09,849 --> 00:47:12,270
don't do this

00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:24,670
and lastly AB signal is something that

00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,980
fixes a whole bunch of these problems

00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:29,940
because it creates I'm not working for a

00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:33,339
tech segment these types of products are

00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:35,680
absolutely essential and modern software

00:47:33,339 --> 00:47:37,990
space I think you need to be able to

00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:40,740
listen about your system to figure out

00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:40,740
what is going on

00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:46,780
sound invencible yourself please use

00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:49,089
something that people very smart already

00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:50,640
thought about there's New Relic as well

00:47:49,089 --> 00:47:55,240
but it's expensive when this stuff

00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:57,430
honestly starts there's a lot of these

00:47:55,240 --> 00:48:01,150
things on the markets I think AB signal

00:47:57,430 --> 00:48:05,920
is on a great track and there are also

00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:11,079
iterating so fast that it's worthwhile

00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:18,780
to to implement policy and that's it

00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:18,780
