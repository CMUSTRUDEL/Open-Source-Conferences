[Laughter]

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,360
[Music]

00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:41,990
this is the continuation they use for

00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:45,260
this fear so and so a little bit just

00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,070
two minutes our role in life as a

00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:51,490
company is to make categories so what

00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:54,320
most of us experience especially people

00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:59,270
recently my silver conversely in the

00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:01,460
college badges of witnesses because of

00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:03,590
and we said let's put a students because

00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:05,270
this is a basic reference time so we do

00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,430
is we work with twenty five universities

00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:09,860
around the world and counting local

00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:12,200
files are showing right now each with a

00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:14,030
theme of 30 plus people right now be

00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,849
reinvested on who solve the problem so

00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:18,920
what we try to do is we try to cure that

00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:22,160
students doesn't just women for the

00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,750
exams in the final parts or

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,880
just the final art that's when the

00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,200
studying tried to do is make sure that

00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,350
from the start of the course until the

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,730
end interesting engaging activity today

00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:33,740
so we make all kinds of tools to help

00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:37,370
teachers engage and activate their

00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:38,600
students in green so that's our always

00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,160
be learning and that's why we really

00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,780
like to host me that's like piece of

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,510
yourself has to be ourselves or I think

00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,010
users of Ruby and the Ruby reals so I'd

00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:49,340
like to say thank you all for coming

00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:51,980
I guess here Geordi Amsterdam Armenia

00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,230
and before CSer iron so if you are

00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,210
interested in education in Mission

00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:58,280
Brigham working has talked a lot of us

00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:01,190
so the first phase is Medicis around

00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:05,200
therapy bridges and experiments the last

00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:05,200
face and my face you've already seen

00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:25,080
[Music]

00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:37,720
part of the community and the workshop

00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:50,390
because he's one of the alright so I

00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,040
wasn't supposed to do this and

00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:54,920
unfortunately couldn't make it so she

00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,630
sent me something I should say if there

00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:00,470
are ever writes in JavaScript

00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:02,510
ever and you have to do it in rails even

00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:05,120
if you like it please fill in this

00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:08,000
survey be caught because it will be

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,550
using it to determine what exactly we're

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,230
going to be covering in the workshop and

00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,940
it works it will be refactored your

00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,650
doctor code to make it easier to work

00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:18,260
with as then easier to write easier to

00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:25,010
reuse and easier to maintain and that's

00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:27,800
it it will be an extension of that

00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:29,600
basically modernizing your JavaScript

00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,970
and we will be covering we will

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,380
be covering why stimulus and why not and

00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:36,080
we will be covering integration with

00:04:33,380 --> 00:05:54,090
existing memories out there

00:04:36,080 --> 00:05:57,030
yes yes you can ask us anything we will

00:05:54,090 --> 00:06:22,250
talk about some vibrations and the love

00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:33,410
story and you will have some time for

00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:33,410
working so first off I

00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,800
[Applause]

00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,239
[Music]

00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,829
[Music]

00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,910
[Music]

00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:50,210
so I really like to talk about

00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:53,550
sequel running migrations because

00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:57,080
wherever then exactly do they make these

00:07:53,550 --> 00:08:01,110
rings that you're using kisara relate so

00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:02,730
maybe our employers well maybe they're

00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:07,530
two fantastic speakers but the novelty

00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:08,880
at least one fantastic talk but if we

00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:10,260
have my sequel is your thing think

00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,550
migrations are your thing and if you

00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:15,000
want to learn something that is also

00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:19,580
important in fotress about doing

00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,580
migrations then just please stay along

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,360
because it will be interesting anyway

00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:28,770
it's not only going to cover multiple

00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:30,090
issue things so we transfer anything and

00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:32,520
engineer it used to be working for a

00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:34,050
public API anything that we have or

00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,810
discontinued shortly so if you learn

00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:39,900
account this week you don't have X's

00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:41,670
anymore and I've been working on our

00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:45,630
flagship products which I saw at home

00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:46,140
making sure you can work with multiple

00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:49,290
people

00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:52,740
on delivering some paint that is still

00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:56,190
beta tested so he might not notice thing

00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:59,510
now you will if you use retransfer later

00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:02,370
also the company makes a lot of things

00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:12,779
David Rees of creativity we once you

00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:17,839
have a say in it also remaining so most

00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:17,839
importantly I mean you show up here

00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:17,499
[Music]

00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:26,190
[Music]

00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:31,919
[Music]

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,510
[Music]

00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,649
[Music]

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,360
[Music]

00:11:54,290 --> 00:12:06,690
so this is what change occurs for a very

00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:12,000
bad solution then I thought I really

00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:17,190
want to migrate just because what is the

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:22,530
problem he was anxious for a very good

00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:24,930
reason because what he wants is having a

00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:28,560
merciless calm where all our users can

00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:31,560
manipulate data share it you can

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,420
download it all those things are

00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,630
manipulation to our data also now in

00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:40,080
database terminology as DML to think of

00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:43,520
an inflation range so all those things

00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:47,430
are happening to a predefined structure

00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:50,820
because your database at least in my

00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:53,480
sequence is using a predefined structure

00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:55,620
and we really like a queen construction

00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,750
then on the other hand if you run a

00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:00,610
migration it's called a data definition

00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:02,529
language or DDL but we

00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:04,029
is taken by the winners thing that has

00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:07,540
the same abbreviation of a data

00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:12,510
definition language and that is defining

00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:17,769
a really fine structure of your table so

00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:23,680
the amount of good details better but

00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:27,010
there is a small problem because they

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:30,610
don't mix you can't be inserting or

00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:35,680
changing or printing reading data when

00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:37,990
the structure is off and to let you

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,730
experience how something it can be when

00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:44,920
you're expecting something and then you

00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:47,589
don't get it that is what people start

00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:51,670
calling presenters I mean this is not

00:13:47,589 --> 00:14:00,579
what you're expecting on I can't take

00:13:51,670 --> 00:14:02,079
this call but it's getting annoying so

00:14:00,579 --> 00:14:03,910
you're expecting it to walk and then

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:07,329
potentially I'm going to just say to my

00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:07,990
dad look again is the worst possible mom

00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:10,750
to call me

00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:15,100
I hope the Cretans funny because you

00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:17,260
will probably come in and so your

00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:21,010
database is the same thing as you just

00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:22,870
experience or hell is happening so you

00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:24,520
can't be inserting updating or deleting

00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:26,529
things while they are changing the

00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:29,020
structure a pretty fun structure that

00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:32,829
you can trust is there it's quite

00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:34,870
important so it is the moment that you

00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:37,570
think about downtime and I want you to

00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:40,300
think about that damn what is he anyway

00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:45,940
there is during your store chain about

00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:48,010
down time all the time so their data

00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:50,199
definition language has to do with three

00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:53,170
things creating tables altering tables

00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:56,800
and broken tables so let's just cover

00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:58,149
them all in the create table there are

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,940
no that many issues

00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:03,850
we're just saying look we're not going

00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:07,420
to do transfers now a little so bees any

00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:10,990
of that true yes migration nothing moves

00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:12,699
your business is if any one means so

00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:14,310
it's just like trading a blog you don't

00:15:12,699 --> 00:15:17,460
have one do you think I'd show them

00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:27,150
thing or creating a table that you want

00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:27,650
to permit not me so pink that's popped

00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:31,230
it

00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:33,720
so creating table you don't need to do

00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:35,670
any special things creating tables just

00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:39,960
instantly or almost need something you

00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:41,220
know any magic trigger because then I'll

00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,380
insert them through that structure and

00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:47,940
the rest of your tables there are not so

00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:50,310
scary if you build a new table they just

00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,990
keep on doing what they were doing then

00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:55,200
the older table is a bit different

00:15:51,990 --> 00:16:04,680
because you try to change the system

00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:06,450
that is somewhat in use so let's make a

00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,339
small analogy you might know get

00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:13,040
commence branches merges and merge

00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:15,900
conflicts changing the structure while

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,570
inserting stuff that's what we're

00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:20,430
talking about so I have on one hand your

00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:22,800
branch we're actually building something

00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:24,450
and then you my rancher and just

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:39,930
concerning tester spaces because that's

00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:43,020
the level I appraise it change the

00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:52,980
definition of the table but potentially

00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:56,400
there of manipulation so let you see how

00:16:52,980 --> 00:17:01,200
my sequel handles this thing so look I

00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:03,209
can scroll and there are two ways of

00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,740
lineup of altering a table you can say

00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:08,520
well I want you to it I want to perform

00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:10,650
this migration oh no on a copy and I'm

00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,689
setting my default looks or I'm just

00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:14,370
going to do it in place and don't set no

00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:16,860
locks which is fantastic because it

00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:20,160
means that you can just do it Wow

00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:23,760
so you can run details well the another

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:26,699
run which is fantastic but most people

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,839
know this comedy and orcs is default

00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:29,130
basically people

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,940
so you never seen the whole thing but

00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:33,990
it's there and it means oh hello

00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:37,460
we're not doing anything because I'm

00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:43,080
getting something just wait for it and

00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:45,870
then eventually eventually it was

00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:48,480
released and all your customers and

00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:49,890
already front-row competitor yeah so

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,210
they are not using your product anymore

00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:56,159
because its value which is all fine for

00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:58,169
six hours and it wasn't Christmas so

00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:59,520
let's look at the in place and what is

00:17:58,169 --> 00:18:01,409
wrong because it's nice you can do that

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:05,309
in my sleep

00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:07,260
5.7 or sequel eight even has a new way

00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:10,110
of doing things as smoothly as possible

00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:12,059
it says no logs it runs the DL and

00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:14,159
keeping a buffer of all those

00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:16,559
manipulations that need to conform to

00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:18,750
the DVD L because well it is changing

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:21,450
things and also handling things going in

00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:25,770
or deleting or whatever and this buffer

00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:30,950
and that profit fantastic well until

00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:36,200
your honor but for memory and then and

00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:44,059
copy you gotta watch for free and then

00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:49,919
that's our anyway the pros hey for sure

00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:51,590
that's all because this is exactly the

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,510
way how my simple does it

00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:58,440
you can't insert something to something

00:18:54,510 --> 00:19:00,529
that is changing and sound but didn't

00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:03,390
really like that they creates this thing

00:19:00,529 --> 00:19:05,419
pure BS way to handle video and denounce

00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:07,860
it's fantastic

00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:10,980
it looks like this you just have a

00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:13,260
regular activate vibration you just call

00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:23,909
something from the Large Hadron my

00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:26,580
record and do the else your migrations

00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:29,450
and it's finally fantastically but

00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:32,100
there's no money in it so I came along

00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:37,710
they squirrel instead of Ruby which is

00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:40,320
better or something and focus on

00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:41,280
increased visibility you could just

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,160
austere engineers

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,020
see sweet person but you have picanha

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,300
now making sure that you have increased

00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:50,850
visited but they said it's to your

00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:53,580
bosses or bosses bosses that's also good

00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:56,700
because as I found and a fantastic

00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:59,130
business model when your databases needs

00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,500
their kind of information they're coming

00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:05,730
floor you have all the money to pay them

00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:07,740
anyway anyway so under me you can

00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,130
install it like this just if I run with

00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:12,060
it

00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:14,460
and there's two goals the kona online

00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:17,820
skimmer chains i'll probably say PTO is

00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:20,130
sea from now on is shorter PT IOC

00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:24,990
olenska change it's a wine so it's

00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:26,880
better so and it comes from those people

00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:28,260
that sell passwords they also know a

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,560
thing or two about days races don't

00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:35,220
worry and the future question is how the

00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:39,290
hell because it doesn't mix right right

00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:43,260
well nine steps or ten if you come zero

00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:45,450
first have a look you could put a

00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:47,580
structure over to your table looking you

00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,950
then users knew if there was your users

00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:52,320
table only the structure thank you very

00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:55,080
friendly then you're going to run your

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,290
migration against the in table and since

00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,970
it's empty it's quite fast

00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:02,240
then you set some triggers anything that

00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:04,680
will be inserted to the left will be

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,440
inserted to the right in the same

00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,690
transaction so it is our doesn't possess

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,310
it

00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:13,440
then you release the lock so this can be

00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:17,490
done sub second that means that we have

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:20,400
some delays take your time out resets

00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:25,230
twenty milliseconds we have no errors

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:28,980
but usually you'll be fine everything

00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:30,890
over so at the top copying things over

00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:33,330
in the middle the email is happening

00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:35,280
it's instantly going to the other table

00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:36,690
as well in the same transaction and then

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,950
we just keep them company data over it

00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:40,380
because well that's what you're about to

00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:42,750
do and then we're going to lock all the

00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,340
tables again and then we're going to

00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:46,110
drop the tip triggers and sort the

00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:49,650
tables which sounds fantastic but it's

00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:52,800
just very silly Renate and so much

00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:55,110
renamed first rename this one from users

00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,270
in two years is now then the name users

00:21:55,110 --> 00:22:00,600
freeze or this thing can remain to users

00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:02,490
and also having sub seconds and then you

00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,730
release the lock and everybody's

00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:08,630
inserting again that's fantastic

00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:11,760
and then eventually you drop the table

00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:17,780
unless you have an endless supply of

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:23,670
this space now

00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:26,790
sure so what is the fun we can have

00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:29,100
DeeDee Allen's at the same time as DMLs

00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:30,900
inserting data while changing structure

00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:34,230
and the thing will just figure out what

00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:36,720
to do my people view setting the same

00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:39,590
default values for columns so you can

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:42,809
change your mobiles things like that

00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:45,270
they're just too short looks well choose

00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:48,270
it sounds like more really really short

00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:51,720
and it's either raise it natively in

00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:55,710
Ruby or gives a nice wrapper for PLC

00:22:51,720 --> 00:23:02,340
code departure they really wants to do

00:22:55,710 --> 00:23:03,960
something so pretty far turns you just

00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:06,000
have the percussive tool kit on your

00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:08,760
server who did you say in your gem file

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:13,380
I'd like to have departure if you give

00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:15,630
me my grades and they've done so looks

00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:17,730
like this it's really really cool

00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:20,190
because the comment line of PT OC is

00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:21,660
horrendous so you want to have to record

00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:25,799
I can say you can just write in the red

00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:28,080
on migration so your migrations will

00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:30,780
take longer because it's scoping things

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:34,530
over it's fine because it's looking a

00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:37,080
little work canceling migration will

00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:38,910
give you a copy of the data and water

00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,640
trigger so the thing will be quite busy

00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:44,730
even when you're not migrating but it is

00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:47,010
that's fine then of course you need to

00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:48,770
drop the table which if you don't that

00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:52,110
the tool then we have to do it by hand

00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:56,970
always moments that I figure out where

00:23:52,110 --> 00:24:04,020
is my deodorant and of course it

00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:05,400
requires more this debate sheep but

00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:08,700
there is something with triggers it's

00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:11,029
happening in your transaction and

00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:14,970
that is happening in your transaction

00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:17,279
means your transaction will take one so

00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:21,409
it's just issue from the example before

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:23,879
that our users table is quite busy

00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:25,289
it wasn't thinking about why the user

00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:27,529
sale is basically contingent every

00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:30,149
website is trafficking humans I know

00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:33,450
now let's say that your instance is

00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:37,019
already an 80% best if you put some

00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:39,119
triggers in there and your arms even

00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:41,659
copying roads you're already going to go

00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:45,419
over whatever that instance

00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:47,460
10news instance being a very vague word

00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:49,139
because it can be your table is too busy

00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:51,749
maybe they are giving you know four

00:24:49,139 --> 00:24:53,220
write operations your CPU is double

00:24:51,749 --> 00:24:55,559
today I don't know but if you're already

00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,159
upon any percent something it will get

00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:58,470
worse

00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,450
and in the press control-c and the

00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:02,070
trails are still there and then you

00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:16,129
reach your deodorant

00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:21,869
I know well first thing is wait or

00:25:16,129 --> 00:25:23,399
Christmas because everybody wants the

00:25:21,869 --> 00:25:25,230
word Christmas when your site is not

00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:26,730
very easy so you can run your migrations

00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:30,830
and you just have to postpone changing

00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:30,830
your business till the end of the year

00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:45,960
we actually discussed I am the guy that

00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:48,059
we should have button remember need to

00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,350
change this but I couldn't because the

00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:51,659
cycles hoping well there wasn't when

00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:53,700
immigration started but on Tuesday

00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:55,889
morning around 10:00 which I forget some

00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:58,019
traffic and I wasn't changing the user

00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:59,340
single bound on disable and for some

00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:01,289
reason people start violating our

00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:07,049
chakras and is exactly when the whole

00:26:01,289 --> 00:26:08,460
thing branches and I thought well there

00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:17,340
must be something wrong so we just we

00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:20,549
started it later and so that was all

00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:22,619
very annoying so you use a trailer

00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:24,999
solution

00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:26,379
because as well we can't have that we're

00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:31,299
shooting myself only fruit with our own

00:26:26,379 --> 00:26:34,389
tools right it sucks but you have to get

00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:37,509
your insert the data into that other

00:26:34,389 --> 00:26:39,159
table it needs to be replicated on the

00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:43,899
other thing and that's exactly what

00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:45,399
triggers do for you kind of smart so you

00:26:43,899 --> 00:26:47,340
know there's another way how you can

00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:50,230
replicate the accessible replication

00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:53,799
it's a replica log it has all your

00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:55,600
statements that you need to replicate so

00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:59,799
I'm just going to carry around school it

00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:01,990
while I do but row based looking to

00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:05,980
rescue because that kind of warning

00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:09,279
tells you on a roam level and is an

00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:12,730
entity if you're that kind of person a

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:14,350
model instance on a model instance level

00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:22,119
what should be done about it so it's

00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:29,200
very handy to run it on a very predator

00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:35,799
base so it's a really nice tool it's

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:39,129
very awesome so I'm just I'm just

00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:42,249
pointing in screen here this is your

00:27:39,129 --> 00:27:43,619
users table this is your replica users

00:27:42,249 --> 00:27:48,940
table there's one of those entities

00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:51,190
neither those but this thing I get the

00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:53,139
past 30 reach replicas all the time so

00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:54,909
if you create a pull request that

00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:57,429
everybody reading your date I can see

00:27:54,909 --> 00:28:05,499
the border crossed as well so what they

00:27:57,429 --> 00:28:08,289
have and then ghost comes along saying

00:28:05,499 --> 00:28:10,419
whoo you want to change this table I

00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:13,169
know the structure I'm going to create

00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:16,960
this table on your main page events

00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:18,789
migrate the thing and just by looking in

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,889
one of the replicas that is preferred

00:28:18,789 --> 00:28:23,080
another corporation it will just apply

00:28:20,889 --> 00:28:25,299
everything to the table

00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:27,129
poopee data over from this table into

00:28:25,299 --> 00:28:28,809
they're applying everything over there

00:28:27,129 --> 00:28:34,619
as well and then eventually it figures

00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:34,619
out and just sits there

00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:41,089
you really are dumb and it's nice

00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:43,249
because it means that you can just say

00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:46,489
you are going to switch over those

00:28:43,249 --> 00:28:51,259
stables it's Christmas because it will

00:28:46,489 --> 00:28:52,489
be done so I have a lot of images but

00:28:51,259 --> 00:28:52,909
you just don't explain how the thing

00:28:52,489 --> 00:28:54,979
works

00:28:52,909 --> 00:28:58,789
trying to get more in depth read their

00:28:54,979 --> 00:29:02,629
documentation because it's awesome so

00:28:58,789 --> 00:29:04,489
there no triggers so if this thing needs

00:29:02,629 --> 00:29:06,409
to be throttled it has some very same

00:29:04,489 --> 00:29:09,289
defaults what you can configure I have

00:29:06,409 --> 00:29:12,069
outfit it will just do nothing but

00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:13,940
absolutely nothing on your main database

00:29:12,069 --> 00:29:17,449
like take it where you want the thing to

00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:20,629
be I'm a grazing my data running videos

00:29:17,449 --> 00:29:24,949
emails oh it's very busy traction and

00:29:20,629 --> 00:29:27,079
it's really shutting up well is running

00:29:24,949 --> 00:29:31,669
you can even send some triggers so you

00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:33,440
know using doors you can send some

00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:35,989
information do things to change

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,449
configuration while it's going saying

00:29:35,989 --> 00:29:42,109
well you should be running message of

00:29:38,449 --> 00:29:45,949
1000 rows instead of 10 things like it

00:29:42,109 --> 00:29:49,039
you can compare it all the way and you

00:29:45,949 --> 00:29:52,009
can even run multiple migrations against

00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:59,509
different tables at the same time fun

00:29:52,009 --> 00:30:01,579
facts well experimenting with no I I was

00:29:59,509 --> 00:30:03,409
so sure it was going to work out they

00:30:01,579 --> 00:30:05,299
didn't even care about reading manual in

00:30:03,409 --> 00:30:11,559
just running it and I find out it is

00:30:05,299 --> 00:30:14,089
something wrong but it worked anyway so

00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:15,499
the core needs you need a replica you

00:30:14,089 --> 00:30:18,169
may not have a replica you think of

00:30:15,499 --> 00:30:22,069
having new trades but it's steamy advice

00:30:18,169 --> 00:30:24,679
to have one it takes even longer because

00:30:22,069 --> 00:30:27,349
all your data is going to well go into

00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:28,969
many many many many many many places if

00:30:27,349 --> 00:30:31,329
you have many replicas and will go in

00:30:28,969 --> 00:30:33,949
even more many many many many places and

00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:37,789
and then it takes up a lot of space on

00:30:33,949 --> 00:30:39,829
all those and there's no exit right

00:30:37,789 --> 00:30:41,899
rough active record forever

00:30:39,829 --> 00:30:44,749
is it bad yeah because she comes round

00:30:41,899 --> 00:30:48,579
rooms to be migrated but based on

00:30:44,749 --> 00:30:48,579
departure which builds arrival

00:30:51,309 --> 00:30:56,500
it is in such a bad shape and I told

00:30:54,049 --> 00:30:56,500
Emma wait

00:30:57,649 --> 00:31:02,149
because we want this thing to work and

00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:06,200
you are four tools sorry it will arrive

00:31:02,149 --> 00:31:07,639
shortly exactly but it's like public

00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,970
transport in the Netherlands departure

00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:16,669
is somewhat late so what it looks like

00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:20,000
first is can you read that thing so this

00:31:16,669 --> 00:31:21,380
is why you want to rapper right yeah you

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,419
don't want to convert only our

00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:32,570
migrations into this thing because the

00:31:23,419 --> 00:31:35,000
only sane one here the table for us and

00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:36,350
it rebuilds your whole table which is a

00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,059
good thing because you can absolutely

00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:40,190
not to combine the amounts of videos

00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:44,980
while refilling your table but it

00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:47,570
doesn't float as a result by the way and

00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:50,090
after heavy experimentation with your

00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:53,470
stool all the tables of return silicone

00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:56,269
can now store that character set meaning

00:31:53,470 --> 00:32:06,019
Japanese people can put in their names

00:31:56,269 --> 00:32:07,070
and we can choose emojis so what it

00:32:06,019 --> 00:32:15,440
looks like in practice

00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:21,409
um actually I say this was the first try

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:28,580
I feel this was the second time and it

00:32:21,409 --> 00:32:31,970
filled unless human are more anyway on

00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:34,070
the y-axis sorry sorry what you see up

00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:37,970
here is starting what do you see over

00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:42,919
here is 1 billion records it's a big

00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:46,700
table yeah so and what you see over here

00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:48,710
all those horizontal lines is my

00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,330
colleague one where he rose and I script

00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,929
everything all the things that we don't

00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:54,860
want

00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:58,460
so he's deleting downloads every night

00:32:54,860 --> 00:33:01,129
well I'll be doing that but I mean is

00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:03,460
that the database is so busy that go she

00:33:01,129 --> 00:33:03,460
sings

00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:19,310
very very very very very busy and then

00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:22,520
ghost kicks in again that's my time here

00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:27,890
so this by the way is Fett fingering

00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:31,490
oomphel see that sucks I mean then I

00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:33,950
figure couple seeds of all that bad but

00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:42,080
I think I had to explain to about 60

00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:44,420
colleagues but I really immediately drop

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:47,140
the table so you know sitting there for

00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:51,680
a long time I was like what

00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:53,030
probies anyway so there one point you

00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,520
don't see anything here before I had

00:33:53,030 --> 00:34:02,510
this PG so it's very good at dropping

00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:04,070
tables so here we thought well we

00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:06,530
shouldn't do it on Friday afternoon

00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:16,629
that's when it probably finishes should

00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:23,950
be doing during weekend thing built so

00:34:16,629 --> 00:34:26,600
Monday Monday at 6:00 a.m. Tuesday and

00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:30,860
then over select we communicated with

00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:34,340
each other yes quite no they began on

00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:47,870
coffee sure all sense giving a command

00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:57,429
to do nothing and it's retrying and

00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:57,429
retry and retry this example 1200 times

00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:08,060
10 seconds so he's going to try to

00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:10,360
acquire a walk for 10 seconds so quite

00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:13,400
often we're trying to get a walk on

00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,930
those three tables the two original

00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,859
tables and the one that had to be the

00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:17,599
least stable

00:35:15,859 --> 00:35:20,869
and said look and you getting a quarter

00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:23,950
one trying trying trying and winning all

00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:27,019
traffic at 6 a.m. and nobody cared and

00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:31,549
then it just said look I've done this

00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:32,749
120 times I'm just getting off and then

00:35:31,549 --> 00:35:37,400
the tables were kind of sings and

00:35:32,749 --> 00:35:38,480
control them again there and then we

00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,819
thought why is that

00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:44,150
well it is Melones it's stalling here

00:35:40,819 --> 00:35:45,799
because we're at eating data but what he

00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:47,660
didn't notice at that time is that it

00:35:45,799 --> 00:35:49,940
was so busy deleting things everywhere

00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:51,859
the database which is coming busy so it

00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:54,230
couldn't order the local time and it was

00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:56,720
still cooking over or actually handling

00:35:54,230 --> 00:36:00,380
deletions of rows that we didn't notice

00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:08,079
so this is human error yes he not as bad

00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:08,079
a spectrum encompassing very much so

00:36:09,849 --> 00:36:22,009
93rd days so on Friday we said well it's

00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:24,829
almost lunchtime

00:36:22,009 --> 00:36:26,749
I think we'll do delicious our handles

00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:30,140
so we shove off the tables now because

00:36:26,749 --> 00:36:32,420
it's Friday actually afternoon let's do

00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:34,160
it any we get the command and then

00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:38,950
immediately determine will spent

00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,950
something like what when drying

00:36:40,569 --> 00:36:53,420
what how so it works fantastically if

00:36:50,329 --> 00:36:55,999
you pay attention to the context so

00:36:53,420 --> 00:37:01,670
what's downtime anyway you may or may

00:36:55,999 --> 00:37:08,900
not have been thinking about this for me

00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:09,650
downtime is this oh that's not that's

00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:12,710
not doing it again

00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:15,410
or at least no more than once again

00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:17,450
okay sure and then you start figuring

00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:19,009
out what there are two leads how did you

00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:21,349
write something that works better than

00:37:19,009 --> 00:37:24,019
thing that you had a bunch of them so

00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:27,349
every time you go down get your

00:37:24,019 --> 00:37:29,269
deodorants and then a note write down

00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:29,839
what went wrong because otherwise you

00:37:29,269 --> 00:37:32,049
will you ski

00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:37,519
you saying failure over and over again

00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:39,160
it took me two years to arrive anyway so

00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:44,719
that was altering a table

00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:46,189
no because you still have tables you saw

00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:49,729
there's that we also have drop the table

00:37:46,189 --> 00:37:55,939
but there is something important because

00:37:49,729 --> 00:37:59,539
if you have larger tables then still the

00:37:55,939 --> 00:38:02,420
database takes quite some time to prove

00:37:59,539 --> 00:38:06,380
it just because again because there are

00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:08,539
files and buffers and I don't know but

00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:10,219
thank all of our time Audi's all that

00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:13,699
point so we just delayed some use

00:38:10,219 --> 00:38:16,729
although the users but there were no 500

00:38:13,699 --> 00:38:19,489
stringent there 9 times oh nothing to

00:38:16,729 --> 00:38:21,949
learn here and well actually there is

00:38:19,489 --> 00:38:23,420
something very here because well the

00:38:21,949 --> 00:38:26,089
problem is that if you're going to

00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:28,489
delete a love story broken table with a

00:38:26,089 --> 00:38:31,189
lot of rows in there and potentially

00:38:28,489 --> 00:38:33,469
also with a lot of things in your buffer

00:38:31,189 --> 00:38:36,079
pages so the thing has just been written

00:38:33,469 --> 00:38:39,170
to quite often migration for instance

00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:44,599
but then probably the database someone's

00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:45,979
busy so just very very very very

00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:47,150
controlled delete all your rows you

00:38:45,979 --> 00:38:50,989
don't want the other defense you know

00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:56,029
was low and then when all those things

00:38:50,989 --> 00:38:58,549
are done just wait sugar no open buffer

00:38:56,029 --> 00:39:04,039
pages anymore it's like watching paint

00:38:58,549 --> 00:39:06,019
dry and then you vote and then mum

00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:09,650
walking it spends six seconds for

00:39:06,019 --> 00:39:11,749
anything so nobody's delayed but still

00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:13,400
takes six seconds so we're stationary or

00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:14,769
going to the layer users by six seconds

00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:18,619
twenty five

00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:19,479
anyway I'm are over sourcing this being

00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:22,099
the

00:39:19,479 --> 00:39:23,539
shortly it's also because ghost is

00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:26,539
written and go we thought well let's

00:39:23,539 --> 00:39:28,969
don't go there you go because then you

00:39:26,539 --> 00:39:32,569
really people can use but it needs to be

00:39:28,969 --> 00:39:35,839
incorporated into a wife as well don't

00:39:32,569 --> 00:39:38,119
make me do compiler so tables

00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:43,150
coverage it means I am an answer for

00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:43,150
your question any questions hello

00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:55,010
well the question is sorry yeah sorry

00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:58,160
so the question is why do we need a

00:39:55,010 --> 00:40:00,650
replica table and well it's the

00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:04,610
preferred mode of operation from ghost

00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:06,560
and because it is the only way to

00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:09,530
guarantee that you're not polluting your

00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:12,140
master which isn't things because it's

00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:14,300
not only migrating your data to a new

00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:17,150
table is also making status updates

00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:22,280
somewhere and it likes to not do that

00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:22,790
anymore as far as I know that is the

00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,310
problem

00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:28,550
but it has multiple nodes corporation

00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:31,190
you can run it on your replica to just

00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:32,990
figure out if your migration is sound or

00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:36,320
you can even run it without a replica as

00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:37,940
long as you have robust logging so as

00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:40,790
long as you have a replication Ward

00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:42,620
because ghost or next to your replica

00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:45,980
long to figure out what should be done

00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:49,370
because it's not set trigger and you get

00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:50,000
a replica log then usually a replica

00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:53,810
anyway

00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,780
and unless you're using six to

00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:59,420
potentially even using to do your rise

00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:07,430
to one place you can store those nice

00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:21,430
refreshing messy this is where you get

00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:30,080
to ask questions et ose for common

00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:33,080
online schema change to get yeah so then

00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:50,960
you think why ghost because online

00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:53,000
scheme employee there's multiple people

00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,860
attempted to explain this to me over the

00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,700
years like gratulations I finally

00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:57,700
understand the same

00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,999
[Music]

00:42:35,569 --> 00:42:41,549
well I have some today already start

00:42:39,049 --> 00:42:45,569
running to the toilet when whether we

00:42:41,549 --> 00:42:47,640
delay are used by a second any we have

00:42:45,569 --> 00:42:49,680
some colleagues they say well we have an

00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:51,479
era budget twenty minutes a month and we

00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:59,759
spend none of it so we should try for

00:42:51,479 --> 00:43:03,449
more yes I am somewhere there but yeah

00:42:59,759 --> 00:43:11,930
we had we had downtime its considered

00:43:03,449 --> 00:43:35,699
serious by some and its really alluring

00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:37,890
hello sorry Billy Rose I did well if you

00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:39,359
let's I don't know the numbers for

00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:41,910
change so I'm just guessing here but

00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:46,079
let's say that we make a hundred euros a

00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:48,839
year anywhere down for 20 minutes each

00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:51,269
month you can do that every night I've

00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:52,979
got money and if you're going to do it

00:43:51,269 --> 00:43:56,119
more often while I love learning for me

00:43:52,979 --> 00:43:56,119
it's going to cost you more

00:44:00,190 --> 00:45:10,410
I was yes we had some help

00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:34,219
[Music]

00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:40,079
[Music]

00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:50,210
[Music]

00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:33,470
so amin i thought the second match which

00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:36,340
should be merged it's available so this

00:46:33,470 --> 00:47:31,400
was the first bench

00:46:36,340 --> 00:47:33,530
no second no schedule do questions this

00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:50,150
is going to be the exact same time as

00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:54,850
your ago is his phone is for no yes sure

00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:54,850
yes yes

00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:26,349
I think the sponsors so and it's not

00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:28,579
that expensive

00:48:26,349 --> 00:49:16,400
all those people actually solving the

00:48:28,579 --> 00:49:18,799
problem I hate it is it's the

00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:26,650
international way of expressing the

00:49:18,799 --> 00:49:33,170
sound if you happen to like it so and

00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:36,589
I'm singing at least maybe someone told

00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:51,140
me that there's more so we're fine

00:49:36,589 --> 00:49:54,319
people you're nice people so we are here

00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:56,779
today to talk about Ruby so this is a

00:49:54,319 --> 00:50:04,940
really conference and it's not a

00:49:56,779 --> 00:50:07,339
conference how we can help and so the

00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:11,890
language that is also used by my

00:50:07,339 --> 00:50:11,890
employer so and

00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:15,159
[Music]

00:50:28,030 --> 00:51:49,480
so this is so I was looking and I

00:51:49,990 --> 00:52:10,780
started to looking and scrolling around

00:51:52,640 --> 00:52:14,600
the matching slice movements that's nice

00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:18,200
perfection you see I think I've heard

00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:25,890
something about this okay um separation

00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:30,849
of positioning keyword arguments okay

00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:34,930
nevermind so are there not about new

00:52:30,849 --> 00:52:39,250
features oh this is interesting points

00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:40,869
there and also yeah um so I usually

00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:43,480
don't care about any of the other new

00:52:40,869 --> 00:52:47,319
fields except for this because this is

00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:56,500
easily for free so your applications

00:52:47,319 --> 00:53:00,640
magically becomes faster also other

00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:02,650
nothing changes and a bunch of cans were

00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:07,480
extracted a bunch of things were deleted

00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:11,760
move to something else yes

00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:19,869
so after digesting a little bit let's

00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:22,030
try to look at some highlights the first

00:53:19,869 --> 00:53:24,160
thing is that I think it's it's the most

00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:29,160
important thing because it's number one

00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:37,390
bullet point blog post and it's about

00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:40,329
matching by the way my matching is still

00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:44,589
experimental feature but the idea is

00:53:40,329 --> 00:53:47,440
that you have on one side some kind of

00:53:44,589 --> 00:53:51,240
data and on the other side some kind of

00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:55,690
pattern and it tries to match those

00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:57,700
today something like this so we have

00:53:55,690 --> 00:54:01,779
like one two three and you have a

00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:04,450
pattern of away that expects something

00:54:01,779 --> 00:54:08,140
in three positions and if it matches it

00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:08,410
assigns the values from one end to the

00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:10,960
other

00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:13,720
as I said it's experimental and it

00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:17,890
usually looks like this so this is the

00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:20,770
most simple example your hey your

00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:23,500
pattern on the other side and as you can

00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:29,109
see with this you can do the assignment

00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:32,980
to see where you get a three there any

00:54:29,109 --> 00:54:34,930
more elaborated syntax will use case in

00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:36,819
and then you can have a bunch of putnams

00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:39,490
and you do a bunch of stuff with those

00:54:36,819 --> 00:54:41,440
patterns when they match

00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:44,770
but I've committed something really

00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:46,810
important here with this race so

00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:50,410
whatever you're trying to use it you get

00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:52,480
a warning and every time using a warning

00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:54,310
every time you get a warning and as you

00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:59,080
can see they are trying to tell us

00:54:54,310 --> 00:55:02,350
something that perhaps it's that

00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:06,970
action is screamin and the behavior may

00:55:02,350 --> 00:55:12,690
changing it version of food so should

00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:15,610
you use it maybe if you happen to

00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:18,220
develop some libraries or some framework

00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:20,680
or something else or you want to do that

00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:23,730
and you want to use matching this is the

00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:27,720
perfect time to try this is your time to

00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:32,380
explore the ideas and hopefully if

00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:34,590
nothing changes much too much then you

00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:39,220
have something ready for movie though

00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:41,050
and if you also want to learn a little

00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:44,560
bit more about mansion there was

00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:49,270
really good talk by the guy who wrote it

00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:51,340
in Ruby good call last year so it

00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:54,760
explains a lot better than I can do it

00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:57,090
and perhaps you have some insights off

00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,090
Howie

00:55:58,410 --> 00:56:05,020
another important thing that I saw there

00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:10,060
with the second bullet point is that

00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:13,900
poem provements so that hole is

00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:16,770
basically when like when you are be

00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:19,830
you're really console have like this

00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:23,650
comment line where you can find code and

00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:26,440
it's the code for you and it gives you

00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:32,040
like the result of doing that processing

00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:35,050
and those improvements means that

00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:37,390
grapple is now written entirely in Ruby

00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:41,380
so it doesn't use the red line library

00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:44,800
from C reline library from goodie which

00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:48,850
means that it can work with sentence

00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:51,880
cavity both line support and it's also

00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:59,880
considerably slower

00:56:51,880 --> 00:57:05,079
very brutal yeah you've probably heard

00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:07,210
about this guy called tender love so he

00:57:05,079 --> 00:57:10,269
has been doing a lot of work with

00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:13,329
garbage collection and garbage

00:57:10,269 --> 00:57:17,819
compaction so this is entirely his work

00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:21,819
I think he was doing this for at least

00:57:17,819 --> 00:57:26,460
it was possible but then this is here so

00:57:21,819 --> 00:57:26,460
it's really cool really important and

00:57:26,729 --> 00:57:33,839
you may also remember the talk about

00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:36,789
hungry last year at this very same meter

00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:39,519
where he was explaining how the memory

00:57:36,789 --> 00:57:42,160
could be float could be bloated in your

00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:47,200
Ruby application without you even doing

00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:51,359
anything wrong with it so I my my

00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:54,519
perception is that if you follow only

00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:58,150
suggestion to either use its Ruby

00:57:54,519 --> 00:58:01,059
distribution or use J block and you

00:57:58,150 --> 00:58:04,839
combine this with compaction DC we may

00:58:01,059 --> 00:58:10,799
have almost become to be able to control

00:58:04,839 --> 00:58:12,670
memory in Ruby so that's exciting so

00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:17,279
this is how you use it

00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:26,200
you call compact into the GC library and

00:58:17,279 --> 00:58:30,839
if nothing explodes but this is probably

00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:34,779
most useful for again if you are either

00:58:30,839 --> 00:58:37,390
the outer of psychic or uma or fusion

00:58:34,779 --> 00:58:39,069
passenger or something that can actually

00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:43,390
control the flow of your application

00:58:39,069 --> 00:58:46,869
then you may be already trying to put

00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:49,269
some kind of out of the out of the bench

00:58:46,869 --> 00:58:51,729
garbage collection through here that

00:58:49,269 --> 00:58:53,799
will hopefully trigger this when your

00:58:51,729 --> 00:58:57,309
application is done so pretty easy and

00:58:53,799 --> 00:58:59,410
then try to recover schematic but keep

00:58:57,309 --> 00:59:05,009
an eye on it maybe it's a little trick

00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:05,009
for a weight faster stuff like that

00:59:05,439 --> 00:59:14,819
there's only one sorry for the drawings

00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:19,599
I tried stop learning

00:59:14,819 --> 00:59:24,939
so it's the separation of positional

00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:27,789
arguments and and what the hell is this

00:59:24,939 --> 00:59:32,170
what is what it's it what why is it

00:59:27,789 --> 00:59:51,699
important so let's take a look so this

00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:54,789
is old room syntax so you have like you

00:59:51,699 --> 00:59:59,799
can use it the sector's it allows you to

00:59:54,789 --> 01:00:02,439
use any number of key value things

00:59:59,799 --> 01:00:07,809
inside your method so this works I think

01:00:02,439 --> 01:00:12,309
even in 1.9 you'll find a lot of tasing

01:00:07,809 --> 01:00:19,539
Williams in other languages a different

01:00:12,309 --> 01:00:24,069
version of this is this so here we are

01:00:19,539 --> 01:00:26,619
using ruby 2.0 syntax and the keyword

01:00:24,069 --> 01:00:35,009
arguments so you find that your method

01:00:26,619 --> 01:00:38,739
expects a same hash and match to work

01:00:35,009 --> 01:00:45,609
but not in 3.0 so there is like this

01:00:38,739 --> 01:00:53,949
migration plan and this is how it will

01:00:45,609 --> 01:01:09,569
work we've put it 2.74 and not only you

01:00:53,949 --> 01:01:12,549
got a one warning you you should get

01:01:09,569 --> 01:01:18,160
some kind of factory syndication or

01:01:12,549 --> 01:01:27,369
where it was help you go into the search

01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:30,940
King sir so this is usually how you do

01:01:27,369 --> 01:01:33,819
so instead of using that automatic

01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:37,720
conversion use the doubles flight sim

01:01:33,819 --> 01:01:40,479
packs and bearing that's all you need to

01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:45,509
do here but what is the double splat

01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:48,910
syntax and how is it different from the

01:01:45,509 --> 01:01:52,869
single sponsor let's take a look a few

01:01:48,910 --> 01:02:00,479
more examples so the most common use

01:01:52,869 --> 01:02:03,190
case that you know this one use splicing

01:02:00,479 --> 01:02:06,220
symbols when you already find your

01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:09,989
method and what that means is that you

01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:12,999
can pass any or a limited amount of

01:02:09,989 --> 01:02:15,670
keyword arguments and then you can just

01:02:12,999 --> 01:02:22,109
ask for the Hat for arts again hash

01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:26,489
inside you can also do this thing in

01:02:22,109 --> 01:02:28,839
inverted way so you can have your

01:02:26,489 --> 01:02:32,440
keywords declared there and when

01:02:28,839 --> 01:02:34,779
explained them when you're calling the

01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:37,210
same thing can be said for the single

01:02:34,779 --> 01:02:42,069
supply of arguments where you declare a

01:02:37,210 --> 01:02:43,779
single one get an array that's any

01:02:42,069 --> 01:02:49,150
enough amount of positional arguments

01:02:43,779 --> 01:02:51,930
gets converted cetera or vice versa

01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:55,779
that's an array use this single split

01:02:51,930 --> 01:03:01,479
gets converted and you can even mix the

01:02:55,779 --> 01:03:09,579
two so in pass array and hash and vice

01:03:01,479 --> 01:03:10,269
versa so if you like it or not it

01:03:09,579 --> 01:03:12,069
doesn't matter

01:03:10,269 --> 01:03:15,729
let me quickly though we would want you

01:03:12,069 --> 01:03:17,590
to use it every time so starting to get

01:03:15,729 --> 01:03:19,170
used to it

01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:23,710
[Music]

01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:26,410
but anyways and if you start to migrate

01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:29,529
your recent your current code use the

01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:32,489
new syntax then things will go super for

01:03:29,529 --> 01:03:32,489
you when you

01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:44,450
but so we've seen a few examples well

01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:47,210
how hard it will be to actually well I

01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:52,850
like you can't on Twitter to figure it

01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:59,200
out and it looks like it's not gonna be

01:03:52,850 --> 01:03:59,200
super suit at least not if you like

01:04:00,430 --> 01:04:10,430
library and provide high quality so we

01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:15,140
have an again okay you just had to like

01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:19,460
fix code one one part of your co-pays

01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:27,410
maybe we cannot make that so I asked it

01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:34,550
again and we can't so that seems to be

01:04:27,410 --> 01:04:43,900
some very weird situations that doesn't

01:04:34,550 --> 01:04:47,270
work as sorry for that but anyways um

01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:50,840
your existing code you should probably

01:04:47,270 --> 01:04:54,770
start to patching it and trying to fix

01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:58,640
the most obvious place that need to

01:04:54,770 --> 01:05:02,870
change from a conversion to manually

01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:08,960
convert and that should help your future

01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:13,430
self let's go to a few lights on the

01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:19,270
lease I think this is actually really

01:05:13,430 --> 01:05:26,990
cool so we have this parameters for what

01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:28,460
and I think it would be easier to

01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:34,580
understand on the examples of how

01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:39,290
powerful this can be so this is me 2.6

01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:44,830
syntax you have some kind of block you

01:05:39,290 --> 01:05:44,830
usually use red or purple or even

01:05:46,270 --> 01:07:12,760
so we usually speak English and

01:07:07,819 --> 01:07:12,760
apparently it can be used for generating

01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:59,859
like this this is the new method it's

01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:59,859
faster

01:07:59,890 --> 01:08:12,970
it's short another one intersection so

01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:16,279
we can reduce against a collection again

01:08:12,970 --> 01:08:22,540
by doing that you get what is common

01:08:16,279 --> 01:08:36,489
between picture just looks like this I

01:08:22,540 --> 01:08:40,970
have imagined it's faster than this is

01:08:36,489 --> 01:08:50,540
actually really cool I think something

01:08:40,970 --> 01:09:33,440
that we find that a lot so you're mixing

01:08:50,540 --> 01:09:37,160
together the ability of well there are a

01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:43,400
few things to talk about this so I've

01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:48,799
been waiting for sheet J actually

01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:50,569
blending functional feature and I was

01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:52,489
expecting that the point seven will

01:09:50,569 --> 01:09:57,590
actually bring this some performance

01:09:52,489 --> 01:10:00,770
increments I forgot to to get this fish

01:09:57,590 --> 01:10:05,780
up but basically the answer is no it's

01:10:00,770 --> 01:10:13,110
too slow but there is one thing that I

01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:15,940
found here that is so you guys think

01:10:13,110 --> 01:10:19,890
you probably have been using scape you

01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:24,250
choose escape hmm it used to be faster

01:10:19,890 --> 01:10:26,250
so CGI escape used to be like 25 or 30

01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:40,180
percent slower than skeletons

01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:43,690
now it's why it's important you see

01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:49,020
those two lines there's a good chance

01:10:43,690 --> 01:10:49,020
that most of us are here either party or

01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:57,190
which you use CGI scape so it has the

01:10:55,120 --> 01:11:03,270
same performance as your escape so by

01:10:57,190 --> 01:11:03,270
training Rudy you get faster templates

01:11:03,410 --> 01:11:07,750
[Music]

01:11:04,890 --> 01:11:11,830
probably if you're using some random 10

01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:14,520
or that you may have found the second

01:11:11,830 --> 01:11:33,300
the third example that is basically

01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:54,580
running a global placement that's swhich

01:11:33,300 --> 01:12:07,780
but it can be worse is actually 37 times

01:11:54,580 --> 01:12:15,190
low I have no idea why but I think it's

01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:19,210
something related to braking but anyway

01:12:15,190 --> 01:12:25,120
it's a guy ski pretty good and I have

01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:26,230
one less interesting start you may hear

01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:30,250
a note that

01:12:26,230 --> 01:12:34,060
is mainly developed in Japan by Japanese

01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:37,090
people and because it is developed in

01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:39,580
Japan or Japanese people it usually

01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:52,050
incorporates features that are important

01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:55,060
for you may not know yet but Japan has a

01:12:52,050 --> 01:12:57,510
calendar system that is different from

01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:57,510
ours

01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:02,500
[Music]

01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:07,300
this calendar system works with the

01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:13,770
concept of Paris and the earth follows

01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:18,850
the reign of the Emperor of Japan this

01:13:13,770 --> 01:13:26,830
so I'm very happy to announce that we

01:13:18,850 --> 01:13:32,260
are at the new Japanese era that means

01:13:26,830 --> 01:13:36,970
that we last once an era and we went to

01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:43,990
the heiwa so you asked me why this is

01:13:36,970 --> 01:13:54,730
important for you quite you've seen that

01:13:43,990 --> 01:13:56,830
there is some any ng ng right it happens

01:13:54,730 --> 01:14:00,220
to be the case that when there is

01:13:56,830 --> 01:14:06,250
anybody there they choose anything and

01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:08,470
that name use you Kenji and so it

01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:13,230
actually two countries but then they mix

01:14:08,470 --> 01:14:15,390
the two together in great and you so

01:14:13,230 --> 01:14:18,400
there we go

01:14:15,390 --> 01:14:22,750
that new kanji needs to be incorporated

01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:24,940
into the income and unicode follows a

01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:28,330
russian system so whenever there is

01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:29,200
something new to amico they have to

01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:32,470
release a new version

01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:34,840
everybody has to update so operation

01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:37,320
system has to think the language has to

01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:37,320
update

01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:41,670
but in storage in my database

01:14:42,170 --> 01:14:49,360
[Laughter]

01:14:46,050 --> 01:14:53,409
and by combining the two together we get

01:14:49,360 --> 01:15:02,800
this new engineer is this cats are

01:14:53,409 --> 01:15:14,320
terribly well it'll be 2.7 support then

01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:17,260
you can and this is also backward

01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:19,090
compatible with Ruby 2 point 6 so there

01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:25,449
is a new release and you should upgrade

01:15:19,090 --> 01:15:31,209
today but again well maybe you're not

01:15:25,449 --> 01:15:41,409
doing business in Japan so well with

01:15:31,209 --> 01:15:44,320
Unicode we also get new emojis but

01:15:41,409 --> 01:15:46,719
actually this is not - sorry

01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:51,489
well actually it is but it's not for the

01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:54,909
same reason I try to figure out why I

01:15:51,489 --> 01:15:58,019
could already use that those using two

01:15:54,909 --> 01:16:01,629
point six and then it happens to be that

01:15:58,019 --> 01:16:03,479
something in how we use it code doesn't

01:16:01,629 --> 01:16:05,199
actually used in higher library so they

01:16:03,479 --> 01:16:07,869
never it works

01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:13,119
no need to upgrade and use the new

01:16:07,869 --> 01:16:20,860
emojis and the remaining question is is

01:16:13,119 --> 01:16:23,349
Ruby 227 worth upgrade so I think I was

01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:27,309
able to explain to you a few reasons to

01:16:23,349 --> 01:16:35,499
do so but 2.7 we will not be super

01:16:27,309 --> 01:16:37,769
sleuth but I believe that if 2.7 is the

01:16:35,499 --> 01:16:37,769
price that

01:16:57,830 --> 01:17:00,979
[Music]

01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:09,180
only do this twice and the second time

01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:12,180
machine for the hey Sierra lives in the

01:17:09,180 --> 01:17:12,180
1960s

01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:19,060
oh I'm thinking of the Showa era sorry

01:17:16,750 --> 01:17:20,800
yeah whatever it was so there's a

01:17:19,060 --> 01:17:23,320
transition to show era which is sort of

01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:25,450
the transition to a say we've happened

01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:27,670
the 80s not be people very well

01:17:25,450 --> 01:17:29,650
everybody think that when users and they

01:17:27,670 --> 01:17:32,590
may be consistently debates in this

01:17:29,650 --> 01:17:34,360
format so let's suppose then I'm not

01:17:32,590 --> 01:17:36,370
quite ready that's great three point

01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:38,950
seven but I'm also not quite ready to

01:17:36,370 --> 01:17:57,550
deal with y2k scale problem my servers

01:17:38,950 --> 01:18:18,930
like how do I do that earlier you just

01:17:57,550 --> 01:18:25,500
don't there is also the I hope they user

01:18:18,930 --> 01:18:25,500
you can go to the tracker and search for

01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:41,940
is a really good there you should read

01:18:52,090 --> 01:19:01,180
so I started point warnings rate broke

01:19:01,449 --> 01:19:04,449
grdc's

01:19:40,600 --> 01:21:19,040
and it will be sunny frontier introduce

01:20:10,160 --> 01:21:22,690
new in Rotterdam and yes so we fill in

01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:22,690
the survey fill in the survey please

01:21:29,990 --> 01:21:35,100
