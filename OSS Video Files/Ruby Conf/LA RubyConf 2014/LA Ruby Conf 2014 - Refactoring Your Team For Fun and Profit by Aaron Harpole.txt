Title: LA Ruby Conf 2014 - Refactoring Your Team For Fun and Profit by Aaron Harpole
Publication date: 2020-01-24
Playlist: LA RubyConf 2014
Description: 
	As Rubyists, we see the value in refactoring. When Fullscreen started experiencing serious growth and our team started to grow with it, the excitement and glamour of being a successful startup quickly wore off as a far-reaching engineering initiative began looking insurmountable. In this talk, I will discuss how applying software development best practices to how we ran our team turned it into one that runs at scale, shipping new things more frequently than ever before with less stress than ever.

hey guys so my name is aaron i work for

00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:35,769
full screen which is based in Southern

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:38,350
California I have a really cool job I am

00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:40,120
a director of happiness and that sounds

00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:42,399
like a really cushy job and kind of is

00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,379
but it's also really challenging to my

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,909
job is to optimize the engineering team

00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:47,319
at full screen to make sure that

00:00:45,909 --> 00:00:49,629
everyone is as happy as possible and

00:00:47,319 --> 00:00:52,120
make sure the full screen is an awesome

00:00:49,629 --> 00:00:53,229
this place to work as possible if you've

00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,719
never heard full screen before you're

00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:57,129
not alone we're kind of a quiet company

00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:58,719
but we actually have a pretty big

00:00:57,129 --> 00:01:01,719
presence um if you don't know what we do

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,979
were a media company we are primarily on

00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:06,310
YouTube and we're actually a very large

00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:07,360
YouTube network so we have tens of

00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:10,479
thousands of channels that we represent

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,610
I think the count is over 30,000 last

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,960
time I checked and if you don't know any

00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:15,640
of these channels and that makes me feel

00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,390
really old here not alone I feel really

00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,920
old to try going to VidCon sometime

00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:25,899
everyone there is like 14 I'm like where

00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:28,329
are your parents our network is huge we

00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:30,490
have over 300 million subscribers across

00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:33,520
all our channels it just blows my mind

00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:36,850
to think about that and we accrue every

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,500
month over 3 billion monthly views but

00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,670
we're startup like we started from

00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,759
humble beginnings just like any other

00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,810
startup this is our CEO George I think

00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:46,929
this photo was taken about three years

00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:49,210
ago we just celebrated our third

00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:51,460
birthday a couple weeks ago actually so

00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:54,249
how do you get from this to what we have

00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:56,079
now which is almost 200 people we had to

00:01:54,249 --> 00:01:58,420
grow using technology and George saw

00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,520
that immediately so he hired drew my

00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:04,210
roommate and our founding engineer look

00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:06,789
at that baby face so we started to grow

00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:09,220
and the engineering team started to grow

00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:12,220
pretty quickly and this is full screens

00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,020
headcount this is pretty rapid growth

00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,370
especially

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,760
that we're all sharing a single bathroom

00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,870
in an office so we started to kind of

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,310
feel the pain of grinding and I know

00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,840
those are like really premium problems

00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,120
have like this is a first world problem

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,700
like in the first degree but growing

00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,730
it's really hard especially in an

00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,940
engineering team our product dashboard

00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:34,440
looks like this or it looked like this

00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,510
and it was kind of command central for

00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,610
full screen it's responsible for last

00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,380
stuff it makes sure all the money coming

00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,330
in and going out is correct make sure

00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,010
everyone gets paid correctly make sure

00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,510
everyone knows exactly what the splits

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,890
are wood when they're doing that when

00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,180
you're doing up with ten cells in the

00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,100
channels that's a lot of work a lot of

00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,450
contracts to manage I was kind of

00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,240
looking around at like all the different

00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:57,690
roles that this app had to play and it's

00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,910
a lot like I called a Yamaha app because

00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,530
it just does like so many different like

00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,910
things that are sometimes completely

00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,020
unrelated I'm trying to get that term

00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,700
going around so if you guys want to look

00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,610
use that me see it happens doing a lot

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,440
of things like really help me out here

00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:11,970
so from early on we were really scrappy

00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,430
so when the business demanded something

00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:16,680
we would do it we added a lot of

00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:19,110
features to dashboard really quickly and

00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,220
that really caught up with us as you as

00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:23,750
you might know if you've ever done

00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:27,000
something like that we started seeing

00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:29,700
just errors in general because we were

00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,280
struggling to scale it was trying to

00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:35,430
make us panic a little bit we knew that

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,650
we had to change something so our team

00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:39,660
got together this is in 2012 it's

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,550
amazing I think it's so long ago and we

00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:44,310
just started to talk about our issues

00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:45,780
with dashboard and we kind of aired our

00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,000
grievances we talked about all the

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,590
mistakes that we made using mongodb as

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,080
your main data store for stuff that it

00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,730
was appropriate for no I guess not going

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,520
to be or anything but you know it wasn't

00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:59,220
a good choice enough at that time we

00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,630
talked about what we did wrong things

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,580
that we wanted to do with dashboard

00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:05,760
later and we came to conclusion we

00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,530
needed to do the big rewrite so you know

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,540
we knew this kind of doesn't really work

00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:12,000
but maybe it's going to refer us because

00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,680
you know I think we you know we hope we

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,300
knew all the right things so we kind of

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,100
got together we talked about it we knew

00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,989
what we want to do we didn't really know

00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,100
how we're going to do it but we left

00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:22,470
that meeting feeling pretty good and

00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,630
then nothing happened for several months

00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,100
because we were still dealing with

00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,920
putting out fires all the time

00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,390
so that was happening we didn't

00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,230
necessarily have a game plan for how

00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,210
we're going to architect this new

00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,350
product and so the team is kind of

00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:37,500
working kind of just functional way

00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:39,150
still the leaders of the m train can got

00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,400
together again and we actually started

00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:43,230
talking about the approach so we land on

00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,630
a service-oriented architecture which is

00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:49,310
a great idea so Amazon does you know I

00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:51,210
figure they've they know this stuff so

00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,530
we kind of had an idea of how this is

00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,030
going to work we were going to break

00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:55,500
Dashboard up into a series of small

00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:59,490
services each of which was responsible

00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:01,350
for a little tiny thing and we have that

00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,670
kind of game approach but we didn't

00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,990
necessarily know how we're going to

00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,430
transition away from it how we were

00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,440
going to get the existing app to be

00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,460
moved over to all that stuff we still

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,410
knew we were going to do so we knew we

00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:13,020
were going to build so people started

00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:15,150
building things we were still supporting

00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,250
our existing apps but new stuff was

00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:20,610
skating built as well but a few months

00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:22,080
passed by and still it was not looking

00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,370
like we were going to ever really hit

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,160
the time when we were going to be using

00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:27,660
dashboard to fado bets for being made

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,070
with accounting on whether we'd hit

00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,570
those dates whether we keep those

00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:33,020
promises and that's not really good and

00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:36,240
we weren't winning those betsy there i

00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:37,680
was becoming really alarmed because our

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,920
team was bigger than ever before but we

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:44,120
were still shipping stuff pretty slowly

00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:46,740
and we had to do something to change and

00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,480
the change came in the form of a

00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,800
blessing and a curse so we were giving

00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,750
increasing demands from the business and

00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,190
instead of just giving account thumbs up

00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,350
like yeah yeah we can do this we were

00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,300
kind of actually really starting a

00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:59,820
little bit panicked because adding all

00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,370
the stuff was getting really hard we had

00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,230
to make a change and the thing that kind

00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,670
of called for it was something that you

00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:09,450
should never agree to but we agreed to

00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:11,670
do a deadline our CEO kind of status all

00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:14,130
down and we talked about it and we

00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:15,750
decided jun 15 2013 that's going to be

00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,980
when we should this new thing and we're

00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,750
like yeah that's cool that's far too

00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:21,180
often in the future that I feel like we

00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,440
can do a bunch of stuff in that time and

00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,260
I'll bet things can just kind of come

00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,970
together and that's not really the best

00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,380
idea in the world but it worked it's

00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,700
what we had and to give you an idea of

00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:32,010
like how well we thought out that date

00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:33,879
jun 15th is a sunday so like that

00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:36,889
definitely isn't going to happen

00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:40,009
but something really miraculous happened

00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:42,680
after this we at this time also reorg

00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:43,909
dar team and at that point I became a

00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,560
director of engineering and a couple of

00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:47,300
other people on RT became directors and

00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,199
the three of us at the time were

00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,060
basically kind of running the

00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:52,310
engineering team we didn't have a head

00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:55,879
of the time our CEO is basically serious

00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:57,830
that he was non-technical but we started

00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:58,970
making some changes and the specific

00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,810
changes I'm I can really go into much

00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:02,930
detail because it makes her a really

00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:05,090
shitty story but our thinking changed

00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,440
the way we approached how we work with

00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:09,289
our team started to really change and

00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:12,289
that created a lot of really great

00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:13,759
changes and we did ship we shipped

00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:16,250
something called the Creator platform in

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:19,370
June of 2013 it was our biggest launch

00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:21,310
to date it was so cool to see that like

00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:23,120
it launched in such a sane way and

00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:25,729
compared to other things we did

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,080
before like I would be like deploying

00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:28,580
stuff to Heroku late at night and then

00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,139
I'd be there really late fixing all the

00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,370
stuff I realized I just broke and then

00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:32,870
I'd spend the next week like not doing

00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,039
anything because I'm busy fixing all the

00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:37,430
other things that I broke that I just

00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:39,830
discovered that we're broken but we work

00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:43,460
a lot differently now there's not so

00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:45,830
much stress with the way we work we ship

00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:49,759
before the days we commit to which is

00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:53,810
just insane deploys are very stress free

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,669
we deploy in its fine we have a real QA

00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:57,080
team now which i think is fantastic i

00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:59,270
really recommend it even if you feel

00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,710
like you're too small for one you get a

00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,639
lot of bang for your buck by adding

00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,860
people that are just tracking these

00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:07,490
things out we can actually do our

00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:09,830
launches in a more in a more proper way

00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,569
we can stagger them we can schedule them

00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,069
correctly we can actually roll them out

00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:16,159
gradually to users and these are things

00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:18,620
we weren't thinking about before and as

00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:19,789
we started doing this our executive team

00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,830
started actually having faith in us

00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:23,240
again because we were able to work at

00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:25,370
the beat of her own drum that gives you

00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,620
autonomy and that's really important to

00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:29,210
have we were factored our team this is

00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,089
what happened and we're not done in fact

00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:33,110
I our team we are constantly doing that

00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:35,930
so how do you do how do you reflect our

00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:37,700
team when you were a factor code you

00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:39,409
have to have a test suite right because

00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,180
if you don't then you're not actually

00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:42,469
are factoring yours changing a bunch of

00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:45,320
 and you don't know if you actually

00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:46,670
broken anything or not so how do you how

00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,570
do you have unit tests for p

00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:52,460
well can't use like kazar spec kenya

00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,780
that wouldn't really work I wish it

00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:57,490
would because that'd make my job a lot

00:08:53,780 --> 00:09:00,230
easier um you could do surveys maybe I

00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:01,250
don't know like I thought surveys and I

00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,470
don't really thought service because

00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:05,170
they're really tedious and they just end

00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,100
up looking like something like that

00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,630
there's a lot of discrete stuff you can

00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,250
look at like you can measure you like

00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:11,840
your ship times you can measure like a

00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,220
twirl you ship you can watch your

00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,770
velocity and make sure that it stays

00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,570
pretty consistent can look and see if

00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:19,010
people are working late the see-through

00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,530
midnight oil like those are all easy

00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:22,400
things to watch and those are good

00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:24,200
metrics to watch if you wanna make sure

00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,440
you're successful but you ultimately

00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,030
really need humans to be telling you

00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,590
what you need to know your team is your

00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,700
are your eyes and ears you can't

00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:34,210
necessarily see everything so you need

00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,440
to be getting candid feedback from them

00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:37,520
if you're a really small team you

00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,790
probably already get really candid

00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:43,100
feedback but if your team grew really

00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:44,750
rapidly like ours did you might find

00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,870
yourself at a point where that growth

00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,740
resulted in a situation where maybe

00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:51,350
you're not having those conversations

00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:53,570
with everyone anymore maybe some people

00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:56,150
kind of got slipped under they started

00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:57,320
falling between the cracks a lot of

00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,700
people just don't leave feedback at all

00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,230
they just don't tell you anything or

00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,360
like when you go ask them they'll say oh

00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,710
yeah everything's fine some people will

00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,180
give it to you but they're just kind of

00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:06,260
really timid about it maybe they'll walk

00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,090
into your office the hub like hadn't

00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,320
bunch of notes prepare they're like yeah

00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,610
everything's really great you know I

00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,170
really love the team by the way it's a

00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:15,140
really criminally efficient and I'll

00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:16,430
talk to you later bye but like what you

00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,750
really want to get is to a point where

00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:19,280
you can just have conversations people

00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,930
you just want to have conversations all

00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,950
your team members and you want to just

00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,930
be straight up home and they'll be

00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,910
straight up with you and you've got a

00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:27,680
great conversation going on that is

00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:31,130
fantastic like if you can get to that

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,780
point you are in a very good place if

00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,610
you're not at that point yet watch some

00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:36,290
of your behaviors when you get feedback

00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:38,360
from people are you engaging in some

00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:41,660
anti-patterns like I bet this happen to

00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:43,130
you like maybe you've you've gone to

00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,320
your boss and you had a really good idea

00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:46,340
and like oh my god thank you so much

00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,170
this is so great that we're getting

00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:50,570
feedback you can just tell they're not

00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:52,760
gonna do about that like nothing's

00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:54,140
gonna change and if you ever work for a

00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:58,700
big corporation like you probably know

00:10:54,140 --> 00:11:00,600
that deals don't do that like give

00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,399
honest feedback about the feedback

00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,829
um another one like a more passive

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,110
aggressive approach is like you have an

00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:09,000
idea and you have a really great way to

00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:11,310
do something better and you share it

00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,259
with your boss like yeah well you know

00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:16,259
this is how we currently do things and

00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:18,540
that is so incredibly arrogant to think

00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:20,730
that you're doing something so right

00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,529
that if someone thinks they have a

00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,310
better idea it's not they really do it's

00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:25,170
just they don't understand it well

00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:27,060
enough like you guys are all great but

00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:30,089
like I don't think any of you are doing

00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:31,380
anything so well that you can't look and

00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:33,540
maybe get an idea of how to do something

00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,430
better like I mean I don't know all you

00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,930
guys personally bit like I'm sure

00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:40,190
there's something everything can be

00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:41,819
improved someone another big one

00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,860
especially when teams get big and

00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:48,690
everyone gets busy is the I can't

00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:49,860
response try to avoid this one don't say

00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:51,959
I can't do something when what you

00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,990
really mean is I won't do something it's

00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:58,230
just as honest if you won't do something

00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:59,819
because unfeasible just say that I think

00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:02,579
if I give someone feedback and they tell

00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:05,459
me they can't do it I'd rather just hear

00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:08,279
why and you'll get better feedback that

00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:10,199
way you have to really demonstrate to

00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:13,470
people that their feedback is useful to

00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:15,329
you you can't just simply say it is like

00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:18,569
you don't get put on hold with an

00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:19,649
airline and get told that your calls

00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:22,199
really valuable to them and you're like

00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:25,290
oh man that feels good it's really

00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:27,180
relieved where you guys didn't value my

00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:30,750
call after being put on hold for 30

00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:31,920
minutes so one really easy way to show

00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,480
people that their feedback is really

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,880
useful is by actually doing something

00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,079
like there is so much stuff that you can

00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,660
try that you probably just been putting

00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:41,880
off just just let them try it like you

00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,529
will probably not destroy your team like

00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,939
there's probably no change that I can

00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,560
think of that you're going to make that

00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:48,420
someone suggests you that's going to

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,920
cause your team to fall apart your

00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:52,620
business to lose money your spouse to

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,880
leave you like this disastrous like if I

00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,759
can measure on a team and not have that

00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,199
happen I think that like there's no

00:12:56,759 --> 00:13:00,060
suggestion you might like take that

00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:01,560
that's going to cause that to happen so

00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,720
just try things looks like that's really

00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,980
easy to do it's not gonna work on a

00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,889
percent of the time sometimes you're

00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:10,170
just going to get really bad suggestions

00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:12,420
and you got to address those if it's a

00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:14,960
bad suggestion just say it just like say

00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:19,380
no I know this is a bad idea

00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:20,580
explain if you can demonstrate that you

00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,720
actually really thought through it they

00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:25,440
said you're not just giving a knee-jerk

00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:27,720
response that feels better like I deal I

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,980
mean it's not as good as like having

00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,390
your feedback listen to and having a

00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,890
change being made because of it but if

00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,300
you could actually have a real

00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:36,180
conversation about it and not just like

00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:39,120
have it go off into ether I think people

00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:40,710
feel better that way another way to show

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,710
that you are actually really interested

00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:45,090
by asking a lot of questions if you're

00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,740
maybe hearing some suggestion your

00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,420
calico know about this this kind of

00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:51,090
sounds weird but you don't really know

00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:52,140
enough to to really say why well you're

00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:54,930
not really in a position to have a

00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:57,720
stance on the issue are you so start

00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,680
asking questions if you don't know if

00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,280
you can't make a decision about

00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:04,620
something go and research it just go

00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,820
find out like ask other people questions

00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,610
there's plenty of resources out there

00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,480
and if you try these things maybe you're

00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,770
going to be surprising you're going to

00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,360
find that someone had a really great

00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:13,860
suggestion and you didn't even know that

00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,570
it was a great going to be great idea

00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:18,780
but you went and found out and it's

00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:20,880
great so that's really good framework

00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:22,920
for making sure that the feedback you're

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,270
getting is valuable and it's a lot of

00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,130
work to get to that point like it takes

00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:29,250
a lot of time to build that trust with

00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:30,600
your team if full screen we use the tool

00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:33,030
called know your company it's made by

00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,280
what used to be 37signals they're

00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:37,140
actually their own company now know your

00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,050
company is really great every week it

00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:41,100
basically sends out emails asking

00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:42,990
questions the entire team about random

00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:46,050
things it'll ask things like what are

00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:47,190
you working on it last things like just

00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:50,280
gauging your opinion about the company

00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:51,690
in general and it also asks people just

00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,160
social questions and questions to get to

00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:55,800
know each other better and then these

00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,290
answers are shared the entire team it's

00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,310
really great way to get to know people

00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:01,470
it's important that you ask the right

00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:04,020
questions though here's an example

00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:06,750
question that we asked using know your

00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:08,940
company last week I want to make sure

00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:10,950
that everyone understood that our goals

00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,960
for 2014 were clear and I got some

00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:16,680
really great answers for it and these

00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:19,530
answers lead to very easy action items

00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:21,000
they can start a conversation and I know

00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:24,510
exactly what I need to do to make a

00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,920
change we also asked recently the thing

00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:27,600
what any good recipes to share and I got

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,170
a really fantastic recipe for rat poison

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,769
so you guys want a non-toxic rapaz

00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:35,759
recipe just hit me up at all you know

00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:37,290
there are lots of general questions you

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,410
can ask like what can we improve on and

00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:43,290
those are really not that grade I'm not

00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:44,819
a fan of these they're too generic you

00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:47,360
probably won't get responses at all

00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:51,060
sometimes let's be like oh no we're fine

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,649
try going more specific try something

00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,880
like what's the change the full screen

00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:56,190
could make it now costs that you it

00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,660
would make you happier that's still

00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:59,130
pretty general like you can get a lot of

00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,420
answers that way but it's directed

00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:02,550
enough that like really make someone

00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,779
think about their answer people weren't

00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:05,100
necessarily expecting to hear that

00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:07,319
question either so it really makes him

00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,519
think another one that I asked that I

00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:10,649
really liked I asked these at all my

00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:13,470
performance reviews last week I asked

00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:15,240
people if they were offered any job and

00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:17,519
they were going to leave full support

00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,139
with that job be I got some really

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,310
fantastic answers and it taught me some

00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:22,470
really great things about my team I

00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:24,630
learned that a lot of my team members

00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:25,740
really entrepreneurial and they would

00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:28,050
like to start their own company someday

00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,850
that's really great to know I learned

00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:31,949
that some of my team members really like

00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:33,540
certain technologies so if I can offer

00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:35,540
them more opportunity to work with those

00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:37,769
new technologies I'm going to be happier

00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,930
if you can learn things like that about

00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:41,040
your team like that can help put you in

00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:44,100
a position where you can make them

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,120
really happy if you're at a point now

00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,120
where you can get really good feedback

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,740
about things you can really move fast

00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,209
and break and you do this with your

00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,699
software probably if you're working in a

00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:56,459
really agile way you just move you try

00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:57,779
things that are new you have to be

00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:58,980
prepared to fail though you have to be

00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:02,160
prepared that not everything you're

00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:03,420
going to do is a it's a slam dunk so

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:09,630
you're going to fail but you got to be

00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:10,890
sure to fail really cheaply if you have

00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,750
an idea for something you want to try

00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:14,880
don't just try to salute the entire

00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:17,760
company try it with maybe a subset first

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,890
just to see if it's going to work if it

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:23,520
looks like it's catching on cool keep

00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:25,260
working on that if it doesn't stop doing

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,669
that and figure out what you need to

00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:30,659
adjust so you can learn lessons along

00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:32,970
the way at full screen our vp of design

00:17:30,659 --> 00:17:34,470
and research came back from a conference

00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:36,360
a couple months ago and he had this

00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,799
really great idea called his first one

00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,030
called design Sprint's i was really an

00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:40,360
idea he heard about it google ventures

00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:42,040
does this

00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,220
basically a one-week exercise with a new

00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,630
project where you do user research and

00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,070
you have really good conversations about

00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,240
what you want your proxy dude and what

00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:51,880
problems you want your product is solve

00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,440
you put together wireframes figure out

00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,400
what you like about them and figure out

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,620
ones that you want to build a prototype

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,850
of you build a really cheap prototype of

00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,559
it using keynote you don't even write

00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:01,840
any code and then you bring in people

00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:03,370
real people to actually get feedback on

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,230
those prototypes and watch them struggle

00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:08,590
with it and do the casual user testing

00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:10,720
with it this all happens within one week

00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:13,090
so it's a very rapid way to kind of do a

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,250
lot of product discovery at once and he

00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:17,290
wanted to try it with our team so we did

00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,429
we tried at that very next week we

00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:20,500
didn't try out with everything because

00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:22,960
that would be a lot of work and it's

00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,880
more risky that way so we tried with a

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,580
single project and it was an incredible

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,650
success I felt really inspired that week

00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:31,600
because the conversations were having

00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,820
were fantastic we got really great user

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,250
data and the best part was it was really

00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:39,940
cheap to do this if this was a total

00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:42,010
failure we lost maybe a week's worth of

00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,780
work with just a few people and that's

00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:45,309
not totally cheap but that's not the end

00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,929
of the world that's not like bringing

00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:49,210
down the company it's just something we

00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:51,340
tried and we could have moved on but the

00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:52,570
upside is it didn't fail it was really

00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,970
successful and now we actually did with

00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:57,280
our with all of our new projects so it's

00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:59,380
really great success not everything we

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,230
do is that successful though I had a

00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:03,580
great idea once to do our retrospectives

00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:05,910
and have demos of everything that was

00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:09,370
developed be demoed during the retro

00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:11,320
people hated it I could've predicted

00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:13,809
that probably but I just want to try it

00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:16,049
anyway people did hate it so I

00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:17,799
acquiesced and we don't do that anymore

00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:22,210
so I had to kind of deal with that

00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:24,280
reality but we I real like the idea of

00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:26,169
duboce so we actually tries to be a

00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,750
little bit different with it every month

00:19:26,169 --> 00:19:31,030
our team gets together and now we do

00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:33,400
demos of the pillar features that we

00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:34,270
developed that week or that month that's

00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,860
really cool because we're really big

00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:37,299
team we ship a lot of stuff every month

00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,980
so it's really cool to have see what

00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:40,299
others are up to and just kind of make

00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,320
sure you have a good idea of all things

00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:44,350
that we showed that month because we're

00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:46,900
pretty awesome when you start working

00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:48,490
like this you're going to notice like a

00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:51,730
cultural shift in the way your company

00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:53,309
works people aren't going to be people

00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:56,370
are going to be sitting

00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:58,200
at the watercooler being like men the

00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:01,590
way we do our planning really sucks and

00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:05,220
they're just like yeah it does suck

00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:07,259
doesn't it instead people are going to

00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:09,899
say man this really sucks little bit

00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:12,659
yeah what Queen do about this let's try

00:20:09,899 --> 00:20:15,059
something immediately that's a great

00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:17,309
cultural shift that makes people happy

00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:18,299
makes me happy to know that if there's

00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:20,129
something I don't like I can just go

00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:21,179
change it immediately and I want

00:20:20,129 --> 00:20:23,669
everyone on my team to feel that

00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:24,749
empowered we have a motto at full screen

00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:26,009
it's easier to ask forgiveness in

00:20:24,749 --> 00:20:27,779
permission I think we stole from grace

00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:29,519
hopper but it's been working well for us

00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:32,070
and like we take that really seriously

00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:33,840
like I ripped a bunch of desks out of my

00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:35,879
office because we need the space and I

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,799
didn't get permission but it was like a

00:20:35,879 --> 00:20:40,080
10-second awkward conversation with an

00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:41,340
operations guy basically saying I you

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,230
should have done that but like whatever

00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,539
it was really easy ask for forgiveness I

00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:49,470
tried it and it worked so I got the job

00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:51,029
done but creating something that's like

00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:52,440
centered around happiness is like that's

00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:54,690
what I'm about like that's the kind of

00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:57,539
team I want to be building world rubios

00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:59,549
here I'm also sorry Ruby is optimized to

00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:01,169
make engineers happy at the expense of

00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:03,119
almost everything else like it wants us

00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:04,619
to be happy as engineers everything is

00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:08,639
really intuitive there's no boilerplate

00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:12,629
and as a result of that like rubios have

00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:13,980
really high standards for everything we

00:21:12,629 --> 00:21:17,220
do best practices all the time because

00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:18,389
best practices make us happy if I talk

00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,499
to rubios I can just take for granted

00:21:18,389 --> 00:21:21,090
that they're using source control

00:21:19,499 --> 00:21:23,700
they're probably using really good

00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:24,749
source control like get i can assume

00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,999
that they have a test suite on their

00:21:24,749 --> 00:21:28,679
application if they have a web

00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:31,590
application i can assume it's 12 factor

00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:33,809
or close to it they probably use github

00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:36,389
they're probably using a CI tool like

00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:37,470
Travis we just we levitate towards these

00:21:36,389 --> 00:21:40,679
things because they're the right thing

00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:43,019
to do and we like to do the right thing

00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:45,320
because it makes us happy what if we

00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:49,110
felt that way about our workplace to

00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:53,279
what if our workplace was not above this

00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:55,919
sort of approach we do that a full

00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:58,889
screen we use lots of stuff we love

00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:02,100
having fun we have lots of perks we

00:21:58,889 --> 00:22:04,080
really value learning but we also make

00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:06,410
ourselves a place where people can

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,410
actually make change than they need to

00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:15,650
we're very fluid I think that makes

00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:17,120
people really happy I believe that being

00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:19,670
happy with your job is something that

00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,830
you should feel almost entitled to and I

00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:23,270
believe that not just because I'm bias

00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:25,760
and I want to have a job that I like but

00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:26,900
I believe that because I do my best work

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,420
when I feel like there's meaning to the

00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:33,050
work I do and I think that's better for

00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:34,340
business our employers have an

00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:37,400
incredible amount of control over our

00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:39,620
lives if you ever think about it they

00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:42,470
determine basically most of our income

00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:46,520
if not all of it they determine where we

00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:47,870
live unless we're remote they account

00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,960
for almost all of our waking hours

00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:53,000
during the week either by commuting or

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,390
being at work and they control the

00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,620
environment that you working to and when

00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:01,610
you have control over all those things

00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:06,230
that gives your employer Tessa control

00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:09,500
over whether you're happy and I believe

00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:11,060
that we need to make sure that employers

00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,500
are invested in people's happiness I

00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:14,660
think everyone should have a director of

00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,220
happiness at their employer because when

00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:20,030
you look at things like this you're

00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:21,730
going to run better as a team if you're

00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:23,990
interested in learning more I think that

00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:25,640
you're part of probably lots of growing

00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:29,510
startups maybe some of you may become

00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:32,600
manage ourselves I'm not an expert I as

00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:34,250
you can kind of probably tell and it's

00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,600
actually really good like I'm not

00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:37,850
burdened with having to be an expert

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,070
things I'm not burned with having to

00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:42,440
know things and having to make the right

00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:44,030
decision all the time I have a lot of

00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,350
humility in the way I work and I just

00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:47,690
change things when things are going

00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:49,010
wrong if you want to kind of a crash

00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:50,810
course in the world of management i

00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,940
recommend managing humans by my coop

00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:55,100
it's a really good engineering driven

00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,390
approach to how to do management it just

00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,190
helps you get to know the world of

00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:00,680
business and understanding why things

00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:01,930
are the way they are in many ways if

00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,430
you're interested in learning more about

00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:08,360
our user design testing labs that we've

00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:10,400
built our vp of product design has put

00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,020
together a series of blog post about it

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,040
i'm going to post these links on my

00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:15,350
twitter account as well so they're

00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,900
applicable if you guys have any

00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:20,770
questions you can hit me up on twitter

00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:20,770
but other than that thank you guys

00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:42,520
do you have any questions yep so our org

00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:44,200
chart is very flat there are engineers

00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:48,040
there are directors and there's the VP

00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:51,010
of engineering that from day to day our

00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:53,920
teams are differently structured we have

00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:55,510
a series of pipelines which are all kind

00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,880
of just like independent units that kind

00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:59,860
of have their own spirit planning

00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,270
meetings they were kind of just

00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:03,580
independently of one other those aren't

00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:04,600
necessarily tied to the directors we're

00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:07,420
probably going to connect them a little

00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:09,400
more later but for right now we organize

00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:11,110
our org chart based on who's a good

00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,450
supervisor based on like your career

00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:16,950
path and who would be a good mentor for

00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:19,950
each person and so we think about that

00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:19,950
yep

00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:30,080
it is bursting at the seams because is

00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:33,170
we're growing a lot and it's very hard

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,940
to find space we we've been kind of just

00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:37,340
cramming people in we're generally

00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:38,630
organized by the role people have so

00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,520
designers tend to be with other

00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:43,160
designers product managers are usually

00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:44,600
with other product managers but we

00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,240
aren't necessarily we have a lot of

00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,890
nooks and crannies in our current office

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,299
so we've got like one really big open

00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:51,590
space has a lot of engineers in it we've

00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:53,840
got a couple other areas that have some

00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:57,140
engineers and we try to have some open

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,850
space as well we keep growing and we're

00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,919
going to eventually get bigger space and

00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:03,169
it's a goldmine to optimize that to make

00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:04,669
sure that there's a space that people

00:26:03,169 --> 00:26:06,380
can go to like they want to have a quiet

00:26:04,669 --> 00:26:07,790
area to work sometimes people work in an

00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:09,440
open area sometimes you want to go pair

00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:10,429
together so I want to make sure all

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,890
those things are accommodating but

00:26:10,429 --> 00:26:32,230
there's enough extra space that that can

00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:34,549
work yep we don't use any particular

00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:36,049
agile methodology it's kind of one that

00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:38,710
we baked ourselves based on our own

00:26:36,049 --> 00:26:41,030
needs we work in single week iterations

00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:42,169
at the beginning of each week we'll plan

00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,820
the iteration out we'll plan what

00:26:42,169 --> 00:26:44,960
stories we're going to do we'll have the

00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:47,570
retro at the end of the week to

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,040
basically just kind of go over what

00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:50,690
stories we're done to make sure that

00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,880
there's any if there's any changes need

00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:54,740
to be made we can react to that you can

00:26:52,880 --> 00:27:01,960
talk to stakeholders and just kind of

00:26:54,740 --> 00:27:04,490
like talk to each other about things yep

00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,870
we basically just like we put topics up

00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:07,070
on the board at the beginning and then

00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:08,330
we'll kind of just discuss them and

00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:15,040
we'll figure out changes to make based

00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:15,040
on that any other questions

00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:18,240
alright thanks guys

00:28:05,389 --> 00:28:08,389
