Title: LA Ruby Conf 2014 - Addressing sexism to build a better Ruby community
Publication date: 2020-01-24
Playlist: LA RubyConf 2014
Description: 
	By Hannah Howard and Evan Dorn

Despite programs like RailsBridge and RailsGirls, gender disparities remain a persistent problem in technology. In the last year the coding community has been rocked by several incidents of shockingly overt sexism. The topic is uncomfortable for everyone, and attempts to address it often create new unpleasant conflicts. We will discuss the experiences of women in our community, and address the understandable (but often unhelpful) reactions men have to the issues. We will offer practical strategies and tools to address these issues and create a healthier community. Co-presentation by Evan Dorn and Hannah Howard of Logical Reality Design, Inc.

everyone my name is Hannah um and this

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,210
talks gonna be a little bit different I

00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:35,980
was thinking as I was getting up here

00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:38,620
that it's kind of awkward that I'm

00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:40,780
probably the only female speaker today

00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,819
and although I'm super super passionate

00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,940
about things like writing small code

00:00:42,819 --> 00:00:49,889
we're going to be talking about sexism

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:52,929
which is a little bit different um so uh

00:00:49,889 --> 00:00:55,379
so I'm Hannah Howard this is Evan Dorn

00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:59,559
there's our little twitter handle things

00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:02,379
and we are both from a company called

00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:05,950
logical reality design logical reality

00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:08,619
design is one of la's premier homegrown

00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:12,310
agile development shops at least that's

00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:14,560
what I like to say and we're going to be

00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:16,899
giving a talk about addressing sexism

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,630
I'm going to kind of do the first part

00:01:16,899 --> 00:01:20,859
and then Evans going to take over and

00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:24,789
give a little bit of a different

00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:27,189
perspective so um so the first part is

00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:30,609
basically about the issue about gender &

00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:32,229
Technology and kind of talking I'm going

00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:36,789
to be telling you a little bit about my

00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:39,189
journey as a female programmer um and as

00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:40,659
you can oh ok went to the next slide

00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:42,100
there was a transition there we'll just

00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:47,380
all have to imagine that there was a

00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:51,249
funny joke and so did there um so yeah a

00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:54,100
bit about this gender thing ok so gender

00:01:51,249 --> 00:01:56,409
is kind of like a big deal gender has

00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:59,380
plays a lot of a pretty big role in our

00:01:56,409 --> 00:02:01,479
lives it actually has an effect on both

00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:04,869
how we talk what we wear what our

00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:06,929
interests are who were interested in and

00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:10,570
even in some ways how we carry ourselves

00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:12,130
as time goes on we're coming to really

00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:14,620
understand that a lot of those traits

00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:18,549
which we at one point assumed to

00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:20,470
sort of biologically inherent um by the

00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:22,870
way should I step back so I'm in the

00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:27,129
video okay sorry sorry for the technical

00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:29,019
interruption anyway so a lot of the

00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:32,769
qualities that we at one point thought

00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:35,290
were sort of basic biology we're now

00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:38,379
coming to learn our learned behaviors

00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:41,680
that we develop as we grow up in our

00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:43,959
modern society um but because of all

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,870
this we all kind of have a lot invested

00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:51,040
in this idea of being real men and real

00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:53,140
women and you know we're tall are a lot

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,150
of our lives to be to be these things in

00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:57,280
fact even the Internet agrees with me on

00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:59,500
this one if you just do a quick Google

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,109
search for the terms real men in real

00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,329
women you get all kinds of interesting

00:03:02,109 --> 00:03:06,609
ideas about what vo men and real women

00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:09,010
do for example most real men shave with

00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:13,420
chainsaw so if you don't do that then

00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:15,640
you are not a real man um real women

00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:19,780
avoid drama so clearly i am not a real

00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:21,549
woman um and this one I don't I really

00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,410
don't like a real woman can do it all by

00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:25,180
herself but a real man won't let her

00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,889
that's kind of sketchy I'm not really a

00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,099
fan of that one and there's actually a

00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:31,690
number of them that I'm not a fan of um

00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:34,989
but basically when we take these all

00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:37,629
together we call these traditional

00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:40,569
gender roles and you can see they're

00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:42,099
also a pastry but I don't know if anyone

00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:45,160
can actually read the comic from like

00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:48,310
way back there but traditional gender

00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:51,400
roles are really really awful both as a

00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:53,500
pastry and as a concept they're

00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,440
basically a traditional gender roles are

00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,989
a set of rules for how men and women

00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,549
behave in our society and they can be

00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:02,910
kind of strict and in fact the

00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:06,639
traditional version is the sort of like

00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:08,769
1950s you know housewife breadwinner

00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,780
thing that we all probably learned

00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:14,709
happened in the past no longer happens

00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:18,039
um so then what is this thing we call

00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:20,560
sexism right so basically if you go back

00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:22,750
to the full-on old-school traditional

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,000
gender role of like you know the

00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,139
housewife in the breadwinner there were

00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,879
some basic extra

00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:31,759
fits that men got and some extra

00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:34,669
hardships that women got right and so we

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:39,439
call that disparity we call that sexism

00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:43,490
right um oh there we do in fact do what

00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:45,740
it doesn't slide um and the good thing

00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,870
though is that in the 20th century we

00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:52,340
were able to solve this problem so what

00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:54,050
sexism was actually solved um I'm hoping

00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:56,090
some of you in the audience or kind of

00:04:54,050 --> 00:05:00,050
incredulous at that statement because it

00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:02,000
didn't really get solved we did actually

00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,650
make some really great progress and in

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,449
fact we created a number of

00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:07,939
opportunities for both men and women

00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:10,550
that didn't exist before but if you look

00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:12,710
at just a basic measure like where power

00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:15,590
and influence is concentrated in our

00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:18,500
society it's unfortunately still more in

00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:20,779
the hands of men than women um but

00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,490
that's a bigger discussion I'm sure we

00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:25,189
can all have a heated argument about it

00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,960
at some point in the near you know over

00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:31,219
dinner maybe it won't need to be a

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,779
heated argument but we're here to talk

00:05:31,219 --> 00:05:37,870
about us today right we're here to talk

00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:41,599
about programmers and sexism within the

00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:45,349
within the programmer tech community so

00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:48,529
so what about us so the first thing to

00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:50,599
know is that pretty much there's a

00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:52,430
variety of variations in the in the

00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:56,810
numbers based on the studies but they

00:05:52,430 --> 00:06:00,319
all tend to put the number of women who

00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:02,839
are software engineers it around about

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,569
twenty percent of overall all software

00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:07,189
engineers and and the sad thing is that

00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:08,779
an open source is actually a lot worse

00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:12,289
so if you look at open source

00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:14,539
contributions by gender about 1.5

00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:18,110
percent of contributions to open source

00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:19,729
code are from women um and the thing is

00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:21,979
the thing about this is is this is

00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:24,860
really sort of the crux of what drives

00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:29,120
the phenomena or the potentially the

00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:30,889
problem of sexism in the in the in

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,139
within the programmer in tech community

00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:36,229
everything about our conversation is

00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:38,120
influenced by the fact that there's such

00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:40,519
a disparity in not in numbers and it

00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,940
changes the whole sort of equation for

00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:45,440
how

00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:46,910
this how sexism affects people so but

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,310
i'm sure you're saying at this moment um

00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:51,140
wait a second Hannah I know that

00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,960
programming is just a guy thing guys

00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:56,030
like the program girls like to I don't

00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,180
know like what do we like to do play

00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:02,150
with my little pony at least small

00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:05,000
children do and but the fact is this

00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:07,550
isn't actually how it was always um the

00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,890
at one point uh most programmers were

00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:12,200
women this is a way back thing basically

00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:15,350
if you look at World War two even

00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:17,330
through the 50s and up to the 60s most

00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:19,130
programmers were women in large part

00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:22,400
because programming was seen as clerical

00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:24,200
or secretarial work um and you guys have

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,990
probably all heard of this lady this is

00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:29,870
um Grace Hopper she's the person who

00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:33,230
essentially invented the compiler or she

00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:34,910
wrote one of the first ones um and so

00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:37,100
they're women have played a role in

00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:38,600
computer science in the past but

00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,850
regardless of that it's nice to look

00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,470
back to that you know romantic idea of

00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:47,450
there was a time when it was equally

00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:48,890
distributed among genders but we were in

00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,870
the present and we're in a

00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:53,210
male-dominated profession at this moment

00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:57,380
so that's that's going to shape our

00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:59,630
current conversation okay and so now for

00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:03,740
a narrative digression what I'm going to

00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:07,600
step away from the slides oh wait we

00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:11,630
went back one there oh no work yep okay

00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:13,640
so so I'm going to sort of talk for a

00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:15,169
little bit away from the present from

00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,720
the slides and tell you a little bit

00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:20,860
about my own personal story as a female

00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:23,900
programmer so I started off programming

00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:26,230
really really young I started I

00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:29,000
programmed in high school and in college

00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:30,770
even a little bit in junior high which

00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,500
is not always the typical story for

00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:37,729
women programmers but i did get started

00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:41,089
earlier so but i did get started early

00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:43,219
and when i was first programming i

00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:46,730
actually got a lot of really really

00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:49,910
positive feedback I actually had family

00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:51,830
members friends teachers generally

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:53,460
people came at who I came in contact

00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:56,190
with told me

00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:58,170
me that I was you know a computer was a

00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:01,140
program are really going to be great at

00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:02,850
this um and so I really actually did

00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:06,180
really well on my first time through um

00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:08,280
but then i but then um when I was

00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:11,730
graduating college I decided to make a

00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:13,860
change and I decided to leave

00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:16,080
programming on in part because I was

00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:19,020
like in my early 20s and feeling a lot

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,490
of idealism about the word about what I

00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,620
wanted to do with my life so I wasn't

00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:26,160
worked in nonprofits and I worked in

00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:28,260
nonprofits for about 10 years doing all

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,210
kinds of things including like totally

00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,040
non technical things I was at one point

00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:34,950
working and social services i was

00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,720
working as an office manager so I got

00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,730
completely away from it and then when i

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,190
was turning 30 particularly when the

00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:42,810
nonprofit income kind of didn't look

00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:45,120
like a something i was going to live on

00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:47,940
my whole life i came back to technology

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:51,240
and i started off actually as a computer

00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:54,720
repair technician at at the apple store

00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,610
fixing mac computers so um when I came

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,730
back I had a totally different

00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:01,920
experience basically what I when I was

00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:04,230
coming when I was approaching people as

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,530
a 30-something woman who they had no

00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:10,170
knowledge of the history of my own

00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:13,410
history I had got completely different

00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:17,700
reactions and the reactions that I got

00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:20,850
were that basically I didn't know that

00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,530
much and in fact i had when i was

00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:25,710
working at one of the nonprofit's when I

00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:28,500
was sort of the in-house IT person I had

00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:31,920
an outside consultant come in and tell

00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:35,420
me that I wasn't qualified to install a

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:39,000
Mac computer but that I could watch him

00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:40,710
and I when I was working at the apple

00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,870
store and this didn't happen a lot but

00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:44,790
it did happen i would have periodically

00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:47,930
someone would either directly or

00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:50,220
implicitly ask to see a male technician

00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:52,860
and that's something that's happened a

00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,410
lot to me and the other thing is that

00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,880
even today I mean today I'm in the

00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:59,820
programming community which certainly

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:03,750
affords a basic level of status in terms

00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:06,320
of your abilities but even today when

00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:08,570
I'm at a like a meetup or anything

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,430
and I'm working with another woman doing

00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:12,710
like pair programming I've noticed that

00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:14,150
whenever a guy comes over they tend to

00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:15,890
if they don't know us they tend to

00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:19,430
immediately assume we're both beginners

00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:23,030
um and that's I it's a really weird

00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:25,940
experience so most of our one more thing

00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:28,400
in here and this is kind of so it wasn't

00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,960
just that I left and came back and had a

00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,070
totally different experience and I'm

00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,900
going to share a little bit about myself

00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:35,090
that's probably more than I shared with

00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:37,310
the room of 200 people in a single

00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:40,910
moment before i'm actually a transgender

00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:44,300
woman so during that time when I was

00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:47,420
away from programming I transitioned

00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:50,570
from male to female so when you look

00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:52,630
back at that different experience the

00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:56,180
difference between how I was treated

00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:57,650
before and how I was treated after was

00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:00,400
the difference between someone

00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:05,180
perceiving a man and perceiving a woman

00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:07,310
so for me it was sufficiently different

00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:12,860
that it was quite shocking to me I was

00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:15,010
not expecting that um and and it so it's

00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:17,270
been it's been a real process coming

00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:21,890
realizing what a phenomena this is now

00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:23,480
the other thing is um I I've also

00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:25,370
noticed another thing that seems to

00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,570
happen to me a lot when I go to any

00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:32,090
larger gathering of computer programmers

00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:34,370
I've noticed that I get looked at it's

00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:36,170
sort of like it's not really a sexual

00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:38,210
thing necessarily it's more just

00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:41,720
people's eyes kind of linger on me and

00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:44,300
the way I read it is I read it as the

00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,520
people sort of saying sort of wondering

00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,110
what are you doing here like how did you

00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,540
get here why are you here this is you

00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:52,580
don't necessarily belong here um and

00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:55,700
this could potentially all be in my head

00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:57,290
but that's what I'm perceiving and I

00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,630
think that it's something when you look

00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:01,970
at the women in the room I think it's

00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:04,430
something that I think that they'll

00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:08,180
probably be familiar with this feeling

00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:10,310
of being an outsider um so that is kind

00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:15,490
of the that's the narrative storytelling

00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:15,490
portion of the other presentation and

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:24,009
okay we're back good no more personal

00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:25,809
sharing okay so I want to take a moment

00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:28,299
to kind of connect my own personal

00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:34,029
experience with the problem in general

00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:36,040
of sexism so one of the so obviously i

00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:38,829
mentioned assumptions about ability how

00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:41,199
good are you know how how good women are

00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:42,699
at programming assumptions about

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,309
experience and this can mean

00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:46,749
specifically assuming that you have to

00:13:45,309 --> 00:13:49,929
have started really early to be a

00:13:46,749 --> 00:13:53,499
programmer also can be you have to have

00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:56,259
um you know you have to or all women

00:13:53,499 --> 00:14:00,069
didn't start that way all men did start

00:13:56,259 --> 00:14:02,110
that way um definitely negative comments

00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:03,309
about women in general I mean these are

00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:05,139
these are more these sort of like

00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:07,480
generalizations where people have

00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:10,179
beliefs about women in the role they

00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:12,519
play in you know technology they're all

00:14:10,179 --> 00:14:14,739
parts of the marketing department that

00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:18,220
are getting in our way that type of

00:14:14,739 --> 00:14:20,649
thing and then there's like you know

00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:22,509
overly sexual language that doesn't

00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:24,100
belong in a professional setting I mean

00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:26,529
not that's something I hear a lot it's

00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,879
just you know I mean I think that this

00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:29,709
is something where because there aren't

00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:32,110
a lot it's something that becomes more

00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:34,809
okay whereas in other career career

00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:36,549
fields it wouldn't be okay and then the

00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:39,069
last thing and this is it something I

00:14:36,549 --> 00:14:41,049
personally had to deal with as much but

00:14:39,069 --> 00:14:42,549
I know a lot of women who have literally

00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:44,739
over lunch people were mentioning

00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:47,589
experiences like this of harassment and

00:14:44,739 --> 00:14:49,720
unwanted sexual attention and these are

00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:52,569
real phenomena they do sometimes get

00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:56,799
very real and very serious include up to

00:14:52,569 --> 00:14:59,709
and including sexual assault so um I

00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:02,199
want to step back and say first of all I

00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:04,209
don't think all guys are sexist in fact

00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:07,239
i'm willing to bet the most of the guys

00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:09,819
in this room are not sexist in fact i

00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:12,790
think very few are sexist but the

00:15:09,819 --> 00:15:15,339
numbers the numbers that that you know

00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:17,169
the disparity in numbers between men and

00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:19,949
women in the programming community

00:15:17,169 --> 00:15:25,299
really affect how this dynamic plays out

00:15:19,949 --> 00:15:26,740
and i want to just do a real quick run

00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:29,430
through the through this sort of little

00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:33,180
animation that displays it so if you are

00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:35,430
zoom that all men and all women most of

00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:38,160
them aren't sexist and a small few of

00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:41,370
them among both genders are do sexist

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,950
things towards the other gender when you

00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:45,510
have a disparity in numbers I'm going to

00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,529
watch this little animation play out

00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:49,560
what you're seeing with these little

00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:53,459
arrows are basically people being sexist

00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:56,820
right on and when it completes all these

00:15:53,459 --> 00:16:00,270
little blues that are actually the the

00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:02,459
women have all these arrows directed at

00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:04,470
them and that's because they're so few

00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:07,080
there's so many more men and so fewer

00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:09,360
targets of women and to the extent that

00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:13,170
women are sexist they're diffusing over

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:17,580
so many others so many men so how do we

00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:19,290
fix this yeah how do we fix this well we

00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:21,420
first of all there's one tactic we could

00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:23,100
try which is denial and actually dad

00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:25,260
denial has been proven to be a pretty

00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,330
healthy tactic so I highly encourage us

00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:29,459
to think about this but then not

00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:31,290
actually do it because the problem is

00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:33,900
because of the current situation the

00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:35,760
momentum is in the opposite direction so

00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:38,880
we have to actively do things to change

00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,920
it um so one thing we can do is we can

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,720
challenge sexism wherever we see it this

00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,390
is just like my 3-point plan and I'll

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,650
get into a little bit more some more

00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:49,680
specific things in a second challenge

00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:51,390
sexism wherever we see it actively and

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,700
intentionally bring women programmers

00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:56,100
into the community and once they're here

00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:58,320
make it a safe space for them one of the

00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,730
biggest challenges for women is for

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,000
bringing women into the community is

00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:04,980
retention women tend to at any level you

00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,850
know show up but then leave sooner

00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:10,410
because of their experience um ok that's

00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:13,380
real nice but how would we actually do

00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:15,660
that um this is just like some really

00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,100
really simple things you can do first of

00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,069
all if you see someone doing something

00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:22,319
that you know is not okay say something

00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:23,970
and if possible if it's not harming

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,079
someone in that moment say it to them in

00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,689
private so they don't have to be

00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:29,730
embarrassed if it's happening in the

00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:31,110
moment don't be afraid to say something

00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:34,710
especially if it's something really bad

00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:36,450
um pay attention to the experiences of

00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:38,580
the women around you and this can be

00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:40,590
just taking a moment to try to be in

00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,450
someone else's shoes try to think about

00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,990
what someone might as someone else might

00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:46,440
be going

00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:48,540
and then the last thing is that action

00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,309
give me a negative so just and and I

00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:52,260
hate to get into all these specifics

00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:54,210
here don't say sexist things don't

00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:57,330
harass women that's the sort of short

00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:59,190
version of that I think Oh at this point

00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:02,460
in our society we have a general idea of

00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:04,320
what those things are also you can

00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:07,650
support this is my interruption for a

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,210
little plug so please support rails

00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:11,370
girls which is happening March fifteenth

00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:14,550
and sixteenth helping women learn to

00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:18,390
code the address is rails girls calm /

00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:19,740
LA and we will have this up at the end

00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:24,300
because I realized we've brought this

00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:26,220
pretty quickly um and then lastly what

00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,420
about the guys right I know at this

00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,950
point everyone's like well you're just

00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:32,580
talking about women and how they're

00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:35,040
negatively affected what about guys and

00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:37,500
the fact is that sexism effects guys too

00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,510
and I might be breaking ranks with the

00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,480
feminist movement in this but I think

00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:45,450
it's something that really does affect

00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:47,040
affect guys specifically around meeting

00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:51,240
these standards of what real men are

00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:55,830
right being tough athletic strong and

00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:57,960
really I think that that that when you

00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:00,720
look at the geek stereotype and the guys

00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:04,110
who feel like they've been kind of a you

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,000
know harassed their dirt when when they

00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:08,670
were young a lot of that has to do with

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,920
standards of masculinity and not being

00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:12,360
those sort of real men so I think we're

00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,240
all in this together but I'm going to

00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:19,820
turn it over to Evan who's going to do a

00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:22,559
bit about some of the guys perspective

00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,940
ok so I think sometimes I talk too much

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,350
in fact people tell me that so I'm going

00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,890
to start off by not talking let's just

00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,890
read some slides

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,180
so this is where i'm going with that i

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,210
want to talk about six reactions that

00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:58,340
men including me have to discussions of

00:19:54,210 --> 00:20:02,400
the issue of sexism and i want to a

00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:04,770
little out there i want to head off a

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,750
criticism of a known problem with the

00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:10,020
presentation i'm getting is that you

00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:12,360
might already be thinking this but

00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:14,880
really we're talking about sexism and I

00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:17,880
a guy I'm going to get up here and talk

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,320
to men about mens feelings and that's

00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,450
really kind of screwed up if you think

00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,770
about it but there's a reason I'm going

00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:24,360
to do it there's a reason I'm taking

00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:26,100
this approach and that's because we are

00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,540
all in this together and we are at

00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,430
present at least a male-dominated

00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:31,170
community in the programming world and

00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:34,500
things aren't going to get better unless

00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:36,720
the guys get better and I include myself

00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:41,100
in this by the way so how are we going

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:43,710
to get better if we understand why we

00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:45,630
react the way we react and what that

00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:48,080
leads to on our behavior that's the key

00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:50,340
to improving it the more you know right

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,810
so I've spent a fair amount of time

00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,070
thinking about this over the last couple

00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,960
of years and I've spent a fair amount of

00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:56,490
time learning and here are the things

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,190
that have helped me understand the major

00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:04,020
reactions that I have reaction number

00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:06,840
one objection not all men are like that

00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:09,150
I guarantee that as soon as we started

00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,700
talking about this most of the guys in

00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:15,030
the room started thinking that way

00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:17,250
excuse me certainly I feel this way

00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:19,140
every time I've said this I've posted

00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:21,240
this online and it is a really common

00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:23,520
reaction it's really common because it's

00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,860
sort of a human universal where else

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:28,050
have we heard variants of this we heard

00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:31,740
that not all white people are like that

00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:34,110
or all straight people are like that or

00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:36,120
there's even a struggle inside the

00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:38,340
feminist activist community right now

00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:41,310
where you see this statement posted

00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:42,750
online fairly frequently I'll spare you

00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:44,790
the details of the struggle but the

00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:47,670
truth is when a generalization is made

00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:49,080
about people's bad behavior everybody

00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:51,990
reacts this way to that generalization

00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:54,270
and why is it that we react that way why

00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:56,310
do we have this feeling the reason is we

00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:58,010
want the world to be sort of good guys

00:21:56,310 --> 00:22:00,070
and bad guys there's a clear distinction

00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:04,180
in this case that

00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:05,980
means oh no there we go sexist and not

00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:07,930
sexist and we all want to be in this

00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:10,240
category right nobody thinks of

00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:12,910
themselves as a bad guy or bad girl or

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,590
whatever we're of course in reality of

00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:16,420
the world is more like this we all grew

00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:19,600
up in this culture we all have patterned

00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:21,730
behaviors and we all have some shades of

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,890
sexism I absolutely include myself in

00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:25,900
this so it's normal to have this

00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:27,790
reaction when you feel threatened by a

00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:30,910
generalization you don't want to be

00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:32,800
lumped into the bad category but there

00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:34,720
are reasons why you don't need to say it

00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:37,120
and normally this plays out online like

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,620
we all have this reaction in person but

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,720
then we get online we're on twitter

00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:42,760
we're on a bulletin board and that's

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,080
when we feel safe actually saying it but

00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,930
here's why you don't need to the first

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:50,590
thing everybody knows this already right

00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:53,680
if everybody were a harasser our world

00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:56,500
would be a lot worse off than it is and

00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:59,290
secondarily really everybody knows

00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:01,480
because everybody's saying it so you

00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:03,400
know whenever a woman discusses an issue

00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:06,790
of sexism that has made her life

00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:08,770
difficult I can guarantee you that 30 of

00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:10,120
us guys have already said this and you

00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:13,510
don't need to add your voice to that

00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:15,130
chorus why are you doing it ultimately

00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:18,040
what you're doing is you're changing the

00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:20,890
subject to this fear that you have of

00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:24,370
being lumped in with the bad guys but

00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:26,800
it's a little impolite to take somebody

00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:28,210
else's concern and make it about you

00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:32,070
because that's ultimately what you're

00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:34,840
doing is you're expressing your own fear

00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:39,190
okay so let's go on to a reaction number

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:41,230
two I can get my there we go so when

00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:42,670
people complain about unwanted sexual

00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:44,290
attention which Hannah mentioned is

00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:45,310
something nearly every woman in the in

00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:47,020
the programming community has

00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:49,150
experienced you get a series of

00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:51,280
reactions from guys that are along these

00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:53,020
lines it's a compliment you should be

00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,240
flattered by people telling you you're

00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:57,190
attractive or or you know hitting on you

00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,230
or whatever or isn't that why you wear

00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:01,840
makeup and nice clothes or you're

00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:04,240
overreacting or perhaps most commonly

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,190
I'd love it if that happened to me I

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,020
think this all the time right like I

00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:09,730
mean guys don't get as much sexual

00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:12,580
attention and that might really be nice

00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:13,299
to be on the receiving end of that kind

00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:17,049
of attention

00:24:13,299 --> 00:24:19,989
but it's natural to think that way but I

00:24:17,049 --> 00:24:24,179
want to give you some general life

00:24:19,989 --> 00:24:27,369
advice about this reaction it's

00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:32,080
basically very important to never tell

00:24:27,369 --> 00:24:33,999
someone else how they should feel it's

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,009
natural to think about things from your

00:24:33,999 --> 00:24:38,739
point of view if this happened to me

00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:41,110
here's how I would feel if I had done

00:24:38,739 --> 00:24:42,850
that here's what I would mean by that

00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:44,019
it's your point of view of course it's

00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:45,639
natural to think about your point of

00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:47,679
view but your point of view is

00:24:45,639 --> 00:24:49,749
completely irrelevant to someone else's

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,419
feelings so this is universal life

00:24:49,749 --> 00:24:54,340
advice because it doesn't just apply to

00:24:52,419 --> 00:24:55,720
the issue of sexism in the programming

00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:57,909
world it applies to all of your

00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,220
relationships telling someone else their

00:24:57,909 --> 00:25:01,840
feelings are wrong or their feelings are

00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:04,059
inappropriate is the fastest way to

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,649
destroy any relationship right imagine

00:25:04,059 --> 00:25:07,720
your spouse comes home and they said man

00:25:05,649 --> 00:25:09,279
I just I really had a stressful day at

00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,659
work and I'm exhausted and tired and

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:13,269
frustrated and your answer as well you

00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:17,289
shouldn't be frustrated that's not a

00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:18,879
useful thing to say so work on listen to

00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:20,350
other people's perspectives and

00:25:18,879 --> 00:25:21,730
understanding that their feelings are

00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:24,600
what they are and talk about things

00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:28,239
other than judging people's feelings

00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,590
okay so reaction number three so we're

00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:31,509
having one of these discussions online

00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:34,179
and I've told you you can't judge

00:25:31,509 --> 00:25:36,489
people's feelings and you can't object

00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:38,619
to the generalization and so you might

00:25:36,489 --> 00:25:40,809
have this reaction of well if I can't

00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:42,340
say this and I can't say that then how

00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:45,580
am I supposed to respond to this

00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:49,809
discussion well I think this all the

00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:52,330
time so we suggest that often you don't

00:25:49,809 --> 00:25:54,789
need to say anything right when someone

00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:57,220
else is talking about their experiences

00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:59,889
the most important thing you can do is

00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:01,090
listen to get their point of view that's

00:25:59,889 --> 00:26:03,100
why they're talking about their

00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:04,720
experiences don't need to turn it around

00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,970
and make it about you and you know

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,980
Twitter isn't going anywhere and this

00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:10,149
discussion thread is not going to end of

00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,679
the world's not going to end if you

00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:13,509
don't get your word in the discussion

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,460
the most important thing for you to is

00:26:13,509 --> 00:26:17,440
to listen to what they're saying for

00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:19,749
their point of view and to listen to how

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,759
you're reacting think about what it

00:26:19,749 --> 00:26:23,830
means to have the feelings that you're

00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:26,259
feeling that make you want to react and

00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:26,980
in those thoughts you're going to

00:26:26,259 --> 00:26:29,020
understand

00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:31,630
and more about yourself and hopefully

00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,919
more about how to build a healthier

00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:36,520
community where everybody is going to

00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:37,900
feel comfortable issue number four so

00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,549
this is a common one I've thought this

00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:42,640
it also ties into something that Hannah

00:26:39,549 --> 00:26:44,679
said I'm a nerd people picked on me my

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,140
whole life and believe me I get this I

00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:49,780
was the stereotypical nerd in junior

00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:52,000
high school I got pantsed I got my

00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:55,150
briefcase stolen because yes I carried a

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,730
briefcase in junior high school I got

00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:59,679
beat up and so you know I can't impress

00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:02,290
other people I'm the one that society

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,240
looks down on well first of all this

00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:05,950
isn't really true anymore think how many

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,540
nerds are the richest people in our

00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:09,940
world is kind of cool to be a nerd now

00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:11,500
but a lot of us did go through that and

00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:13,990
it will really was traumatic and so it's

00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:15,940
natural think about and the reason we do

00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:17,590
is again it ties back to this binary

00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:19,120
thinking we want there to be good guys

00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:21,970
and bad guys and so there's these

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,260
oppressors maybe either the one percent

00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:25,299
or the were though the wall street

00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,770
finance ears and their oppressing

00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:28,960
everybody else and of course we can't

00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:30,850
put ourselves in that category but of

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,070
course life doesn't work that way it's

00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:34,840
not two categories it's more like lots

00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:37,330
and lots of categories you know you've

00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:39,760
got you've got color and you've got

00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:42,250
wealth and you've got you know body

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,679
normativity and neuro normativity and

00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:47,200
and physical ability and all sorts of

00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:48,580
other things and it's quite possible for

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,559
you to have advantages in one of these

00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:52,720
categories and disadvantages in the

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:56,470
other category in fact almost nobody is

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:58,690
advantaged in every category and so

00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:00,669
absolutely you can be a geek who was

00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:03,070
oppressed and still be a misogynist

00:28:00,669 --> 00:28:05,049
that's completely possible so try to

00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:07,960
think about how these different axes of

00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:10,240
advantages intersect in your life so

00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,309
that you're not trying to use one to

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,990
justify bad behavior in the other one

00:28:12,309 --> 00:28:16,350
this is something that I've had to learn

00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:19,210
a lot about in the last few years

00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:20,770
category number five so you'll often

00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:22,900
hear people making these arguments about

00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:25,330
web programming is a guy thing and why

00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:27,309
is programming a guy thing you'll hear a

00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:29,290
lot of evolutionary arguments well women

00:28:27,309 --> 00:28:30,610
had to do childcare and cooking and

00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:32,919
keeping the home so they evolved from

00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:35,260
multitasking compassion and detail

00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:37,000
whereas men were single-mindedly

00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:39,510
aggressive and had to you know chase

00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,990
after game and that sort of thing

00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:44,820
and that somehow this focus that men

00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:46,200
have are the spatial abilities that men

00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:49,770
get from that make them better

00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,570
programmers on average I don't usually

00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:53,040
like to pull rank because i think it's

00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:57,000
not really the nicest way to do a

00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:59,190
discussion but my PhD work was in the

00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,320
mathematics and information science of

00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:02,700
evolutionary biology and when i hear

00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:06,440
this kind of argument made from

00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:11,340
evolution this is my first reaction and

00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:18,960
then this is my second reaction and then

00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:20,880
this is my third reaction that kind of

00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,800
argument is called an evolutionary just

00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,260
so story we're really what you're doing

00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:27,390
is using the language of evolution to

00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:30,090
justify what you already believe and

00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:32,520
appoint to other people like myself who

00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:34,320
are interested in evolution a lot of

00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,030
people of that mindset accuse religious

00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,010
people of doing this all the time saying

00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:39,840
you use your holy books to justify what

00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:41,580
you already believe if you're making

00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,240
that kind of argument that's exactly

00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:46,650
what you're doing with evolution so

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,150
think about that before you say it and

00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:50,160
make sure you have evidence to actually

00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:52,020
back it up we can easily make up any

00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,960
kind of story I could say that detail

00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:56,880
oriented work that women had to do of

00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:59,340
gathering berries while main you know

00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,020
handling a child while doing all sorts

00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,550
of other things is like the multitasking

00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:05,820
that we have to do to handle our code

00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:07,740
and our specs and our browser and our

00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:09,510
documentation and bouncing back and

00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,130
forth and the detail oriented work of

00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:12,660
finding berries and the leaves and the

00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:14,520
pattern recognition you have to do that

00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:16,260
is a lot like but you know the truth is

00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,450
that's just as much BS as saying that

00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:21,600
big game hunting prepared us for

00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:23,820
programming the evidence really doesn't

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,260
support any of this we've all met

00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:27,120
programmers Hannah is the best

00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:30,240
programmer i have ever hired Thank You

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:33,030
Hannah women can be just as good

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,160
programmers as men can please don't

00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:37,350
resort to this kind of thinking to

00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:40,170
justify why we have gender disparities

00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:42,900
in programming alright and the last

00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:46,080
issue this is probably the scariest one

00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:47,820
so we always talk about when issues of

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,490
victimization come up they could be

00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:52,960
harassment or assault or just general

00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:55,299
sexist conversation and behavior

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,820
one of the things that's often said is

00:30:55,299 --> 00:30:59,860
we should trust the victim first and we

00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:01,929
should support the victim and this

00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:03,850
provokes a really really common

00:31:01,929 --> 00:31:05,380
emotional reaction where we say if we're

00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:07,870
always assuming the victims are telling

00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:09,880
the truth then we could be destroying

00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:12,850
careers and lives over false accusations

00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:15,070
and misunderstandings we've all heard

00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:17,620
this I've thought it myself many times

00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:19,330
I've SAT up at night terrified about it

00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:21,580
when I've read about some of the painful

00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:22,960
issues of sexism and assault that have

00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:25,750
happened in our community in the last

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:28,539
few years relatedly is another reaction

00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:30,970
well I'm Gordon nervous around women I

00:31:28,539 --> 00:31:33,760
am kind of a geek and I'm speaking in

00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:35,980
the first person here so what if someone

00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,360
misunderstood my intentions when I

00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:38,919
approached somebody in a way that i

00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,320
thought was polite but I didn't quite

00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:43,059
get it they accused me of harassment

00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:45,549
that could be my career that's on the

00:31:43,059 --> 00:31:48,070
line this is a really natural fear I

00:31:45,549 --> 00:31:49,539
want to recognize that right i mean the

00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:54,399
thought of having your reputation ruined

00:31:49,539 --> 00:31:57,850
is absolutely terrifying but i want to

00:31:54,399 --> 00:32:00,460
say relax about it the truth is this is

00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:03,309
a thing that really doesn't happen why

00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:06,340
doesn't it happen first of all women are

00:32:03,309 --> 00:32:07,809
reasonable people to do you guys have

00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:09,610
any interest in making a false

00:32:07,809 --> 00:32:12,370
accusation of harassment to destroy

00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:13,870
somebody's reputation didn't think you

00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:16,450
did if you're a reasonable person you

00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:18,520
don't nobody is really interested in

00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:21,130
doing that so you don't need to fear it

00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:23,020
the second one is that the consequences

00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:25,480
of making an accusation like that are

00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:28,179
often higher for the accuser than for

00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,890
the accused right the truth is most

00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:31,659
women who complain about harassment at

00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:33,490
work end up losing their jobs the

00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:37,570
barrier is really high to making that

00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:39,220
kind of an accusation before it happens

00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:42,460
it usually has to be a really traumatic

00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:44,260
situation in the first place and so when

00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,309
you have that reaction you're doing the

00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:47,649
same thing I mentioned in the first

00:32:45,309 --> 00:32:50,110
slide you're making it about your fear

00:32:47,649 --> 00:32:53,950
and that's really not a polite thing to

00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:56,350
do in that circumstance and ultimately

00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:58,630
you're taking someone whose life has

00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:02,020
already been traumatized and valuing

00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:04,389
someone else's hypothetical trauma over

00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:06,060
that trauma that has already occurred so

00:33:04,389 --> 00:33:07,860
I understand that it's an

00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:09,630
reaction but it's one that we want to

00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,280
learn to modulate and it's one that we

00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:14,400
want to learn to not express because it

00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:16,320
really can be problematic I'd like to

00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,500
share a little parable here that really

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,420
helped me get it over the last few years

00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:22,890
it's a parable written this is i will

00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:24,330
post these slides later so you can get

00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:26,550
that URL if you can't copy it down

00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:28,200
really quickly but it's a parable that

00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:30,060
was helped to explain that was designed

00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,410
to help explain the term male privilege

00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:33,990
because a lot of people react to that

00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:36,150
and feel like you know we no longer have

00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:38,420
laws that say only men can vote right so

00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:41,160
what is this male privilege thing really

00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:43,680
because it's more subtle than we usually

00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:47,280
give it credit for so imagine that we

00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:48,570
have an Alaskan Husky or a Malamute and

00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,700
this cute lizard and they're living in a

00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:52,020
house together in northern Ohio all

00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,790
right just bear with me for a second

00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:55,800
these two cute animals are living

00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:57,720
together and it gets cold in northern

00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,010
Ohio and the dog is the only one who's

00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,800
tall enough when he stands up on his

00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:03,510
hind legs to work the thermostat so he's

00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,980
got this nice fur coat and so he sets

00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:07,410
the thermostat at the temperature that's

00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:09,300
comfortable for him you know 55 degrees

00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:11,460
or something like that and of course the

00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,050
lizard is an ecto therm and 55 degrees

00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:14,820
is kind of miserable but he's never

00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:16,740
known anything different they've lived

00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:19,530
together their whole lives he's always

00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:21,360
been mildly uncomfortable and he just

00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:25,500
doesn't really know that there are any

00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:26,610
other options so one day the dog gets up

00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,930
and you know just not just the

00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:29,250
thermostat down a little bit because

00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:31,020
that's the mood he's in and the lizard

00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:32,460
says hey that kind of makes me

00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:35,160
uncomfortable when you do that could you

00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:37,440
could you not do that and the dog says

00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:39,870
what don't do what I don't I don't get

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,570
it what's what's making you

00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:43,950
uncomfortable and the lizard says well

00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:45,420
how would you feel if I stood up and

00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:48,990
turn to the temperature down on you and

00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:51,050
the dog says sounds great I'd love it if

00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:53,640
that happened to me remember that

00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:56,070
comment earlier in the talk I'd love it

00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:58,620
if that happened to me and this is not

00:34:56,070 --> 00:35:01,560
saying that the dog is a bad person the

00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:03,510
dog has a fur coat and is isolated from

00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:06,000
the feeling of the colds and simply

00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:09,960
can't understand what it's like to have

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,310
lived your life cold your entire life it

00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,170
just can't understand not a bad person

00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:15,060
for not understanding it but just

00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:18,390
doesn't have the context to understand

00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:19,110
that life experience so I want to repeat

00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:21,090
from this

00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:23,340
when somebody else is telling you about

00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:25,470
their experiences listen to their

00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:28,740
experiences and trust them to be the

00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:30,390
judge of what their life is like so male

00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:32,430
privilege is kind of like just having

00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:33,810
this fur coat you haven't had to deal

00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,910
with the things that other people have

00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:37,890
had to deal with because you haven't

00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:39,690
been assaulted with it quite as much

00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:41,400
sorry that's really not the term that I

00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:43,440
meant there you haven't been made

00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:48,300
uncomfortable as often about these

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:50,850
issues so finally I want to open up with

00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:53,850
something because I don't want to stand

00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:55,620
up here and pretend that I am this white

00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:57,330
knight who's got it all figured out and

00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:59,850
I'm not a sexist and I want to tell all

00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:02,220
of you how to be better guys because

00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:03,810
that's not the way it is I am like

00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:06,120
everybody else I grew up in this culture

00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:08,550
I have sexist behavior I've been working

00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:11,370
on some of it and there's some that I

00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:13,320
have not yet been able to fix and one in

00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:16,140
particular that I'm going to publicly

00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:19,350
call myself out on is the way I look at

00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:21,030
women I'm a straight guy I'm attracted

00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:23,310
to women I've been attracted to women

00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:25,620
all my life and I like looking at women

00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:28,140
that I find attractive and I do it too

00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:29,880
much you know it's okay to notice people

00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:31,590
you kind of can't help but notice people

00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,510
you find attractive but I tend to look

00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:35,730
too eagerly and I tend to look too long

00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:37,140
and how do I know that I know that

00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:39,570
because people have called me out on it

00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:42,000
I've had a couple of women tell me that

00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:43,800
that made them uncomfortable and the

00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,720
truth is there's a lot of barriers there

00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,640
to people making that complaint right

00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:50,130
women are sort of socialized not to

00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:52,110
criticize men so I know that if a couple

00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:53,190
of people have complained there are a

00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:56,250
lot more people that have been made

00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:58,590
uncomfortable and so this is a sexist

00:36:56,250 --> 00:37:01,380
behavior I know I have I'm working on it

00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:05,190
I hope that we can all identify and work

00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:06,960
on our own problems our own issues and i

00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:09,510
want to invite anyone who ever observes

00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,950
any uncomfortable behavior on my part to

00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:12,960
please call me out on it i will do my

00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:15,690
best not to be defensive and i will do

00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,330
my best to hear you out and with that

00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:20,040
that's the end of my talk I want to say

00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:22,050
Hannah and I are both happy to talk to

00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:24,840
anybody about this whether it's over the

00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:26,940
break or over dinner or whatever but we

00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:29,100
want to make this a conversation not you

00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:31,400
know a dictatorial lecture so thank you

00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,400
very much

00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,560
you

00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:22,050
