Title: LA Ruby Conf 2014 - I Have Pair Programmed for 27,000 Hours: Ask Me Anything!
Publication date: 2020-01-24
Playlist: LA RubyConf 2014
Description: 
	By Joe Moore

Let's do this thing. What is pair programming? Won't software projects take twice as long or cost twice as much with pair programming? Do I pair with the same person every day? Who owns the code? How do performance reviews work? Do we pair on *everything?* What do I do if my pair goes home sick? What do I do if I can't stand my pair? What if my pair smells bad? What if my pair smells GOOD?! I've given presentations at many conferences, Meetups, and companies on topics ranging from Agile team management to Android messaging frameworks. My presentations inevitably grind to a halt once I mention that I pair program: I'm peppered with questions! I'll answer any and all questions about pair programming and remote pair programming, from the profound to the silly. I have no doubt that we will fill the allotted time with sage advice, educational anecdotes, and your own stories about pair programming.

I know that it was talks where there's a

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,320
lot of audience participation it's kind

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,970
of awkward you know it's like somebody

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,079
asked if anybody has a question or to

00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,850
raise their hand if something and

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:43,130
everybody kind of Mills around well

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:46,320
guess what this entire talk is only that

00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:48,840
so if nobody asks any questions it's

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,520
going to be really awkward for everybody

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,329
so let's do this I'm gonna give you a

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,250
second so I've pare programmed for

00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:58,829
27,000 hours which is about every

00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:02,160
working day more or less for 13 years

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:03,439
and I really want you to ask me anything

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,789
because people find this topic

00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:08,189
fascinating so I'm gonna give you a

00:01:05,789 --> 00:01:12,270
moment a couple seconds to just in

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:20,819
silence think of one question that you

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:21,899
might want to ask go okay that question

00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:23,700
you thought of is probably one to the

00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:26,759
top three or five questions so throw

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:32,880
that one out and think of another

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:35,069
question that you might want to ask how

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,029
do you get good well you're going for it

00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:37,950
awesome

00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:39,569
how do you get over being nervous let's

00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,819
do this thing sure how do you get over

00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:45,299
being nervous when you're a pair program

00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:48,419
with somebody having a lot of time doing

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,669
it a lot that makes a big difference

00:01:48,419 --> 00:01:51,929
that first time is always the first time

00:01:50,669 --> 00:01:54,119
you've ever paired with somebody and

00:01:51,929 --> 00:01:57,659
even now after 13 years the first time i

00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:00,059
pair with somebody I'm nervous and I'll

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:02,429
even admit that you know we organize our

00:02:00,059 --> 00:02:04,259
our projects into these we call stories

00:02:02,429 --> 00:02:06,239
you can call them cards whatever little

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,610
features and whenever I'm about to start

00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,890
a feature with somebody that may last a

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,599
day or two even if I've worked with this

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,300
person for a long time I'm nervous

00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,160
when we

00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,680
that start button because I'm always

00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,120
thinking like this could be the time

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,280
when I completely fall apart and it

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,200
turns out that I don't know what I'm

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,410
doing and the person I'm working with is

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,570
gonna think I'm an idiot it happens like

00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:30,370
just for a few moments it always happens

00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:33,820
so I think for me the answer is I never

00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:35,590
stop getting nervous but you it's it it

00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,880
becomes just kind of part of it and you

00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,960
get over it really quickly especially

00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:42,850
when you have a good rapport with people

00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:53,440
ah there's a question in the back no

00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:56,620
stupid questions yes what is pair

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,870
programming in general so maybe I'll

00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,690
force you to answer another question I'm

00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:04,270
sorry raise your hands if you've ever

00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:08,200
pair programmed wow that's almost

00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:11,260
everybody I would say that was 80 to 90

00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,420
percent maybe so for the 10% who are

00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:16,720
left pair programming is a software

00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:18,610
development technique by which two

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,260
programmers although it can be a

00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:23,590
programmer and designer it could be two

00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:25,840
people let's say that are working on the

00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:28,600
same computer quote-unquote computer

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,930
solving the same software problem at the

00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:34,450
same time so sometimes that's literally

00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,959
two people sitting side by side at the

00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:40,660
same computer with two keyboards usually

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,400
trying to decide you know how to write

00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,020
this line of code right here whether or

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,900
not we should go take a different

00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:48,760
direction whether or not uh should we

00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,530
follow these solid principles that we

00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,870
just learned about or how to better

00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,840
follow them and kind of constantly

00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,340
working together to come up with the

00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,130
best solution to whatever whatever

00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,209
problem you're solving at the moment

00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,350
sometimes you can do this remotely too

00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:04,150
so doesn't have to be at the same

00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:06,010
computer you can do it across screen

00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:08,440
sharing and such as well so that's kind

00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:10,720
of the canonical description of what

00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,340
pair programming is and there's a lot of

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:17,980
benefits as well but there's a question

00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:20,470
so I'm not going to pass it up what is

00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:25,010
pair programming good for and what is

00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:26,750
pair programming bad for so we

00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,730
tend to believe I should say I'm gonna

00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,530
put myself this on me I believe that

00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:36,140
there's almost no problems that are bad

00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:37,850
for pair programming we even pair right

00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,750
this is gonna sound weird but it makes

00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:42,100
sense I promise

00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:45,830
we sometimes pair write emails

00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:47,960
especially a for example you are sending

00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:51,020
an email to maybe a politically

00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,190
sensitive manager or something like that

00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,550
when you're maybe you're working in a

00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:57,590
complex organization where you know

00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:01,100
everything is email all the time and

00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:02,630
you're trying to capture well some kind

00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,490
of situation we'll write that together

00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:06,320
so that we come up with like something

00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,120
really good maybe that it sounds kind of

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,210
weird but we'll even take it that far

00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,400
now a question I have heard is can you

00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,470
pair program on those sort of ooh sorry

00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:20,630
if I was flickering

00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:22,040
I just unplugged this thing let me plug

00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:24,290
this power in but I'll answer while I'm

00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,760
doing that I've haven't had I've had

00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:28,820
people ask me what about the kind of

00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:32,210
quote unquote artsy things or algorithms

00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:34,370
and that's kind of super things that

00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:35,330
traditionally are thought of as too well

00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,370
you know where you go to a mountaintop

00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,930
and you think about for a long time and

00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,000
you come up with like Google's search

00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:44,740
algorithm or something like that I think

00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,740
you can pair program on those as well

00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:51,460
I really don't think that there's hardly

00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:51,460
anything you can't peer out there

00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:56,000
can you pair program without talking to

00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:59,420
each other so I actually know somebody

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,340
who on Twitter or tweeted the other day

00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,410
well remote pair program Oh two pair

00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,730
programming is so hard and I wrote back

00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,560
and said oh what kind of problems are

00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:08,480
you having excite passionate about that

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,830
particular topic and I like to help he

00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,690
says well you know when you can't talk

00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:16,340
to each other it's hard to know what's

00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:17,990
going on it's like well it's really

00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:20,600
really hard to pair programming without

00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:23,330
talking I can honestly say I've never

00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,190
pair programmed in silent well like I've

00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:27,260
had like that person who won't talk

00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:29,500
that's a different problem and we can

00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:31,820
talk about that but as far as say

00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,990
literally having no means of verbal

00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:38,210
communication I've never done that I

00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:39,420
don't think it would work very well have

00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:45,090
you done this

00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:47,400
oh that's interesting

00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:50,190
having your code speak for itself I like

00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,080
the philosophy of that as an experiment

00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:54,210
I might have a hard time justifying

00:06:52,080 --> 00:07:03,750
billing my clients for that experiment

00:06:54,210 --> 00:07:05,040
I saw something right here yeah so what

00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,080
are the tools for remote pair

00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,910
programming um I have a whole talk I can

00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,360
do just about that so I won't go too

00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:15,510
deep into it but in general you need

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,010
some kind of voice communication Skype

00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:18,510
Google hangout something like that

00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:20,490
there's screen shot and you need some

00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:22,160
kind of screen sharing technology by

00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:24,660
which you can collaborate on the same

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,220
computer to solve the same problem now I

00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,140
am opinionated about what I'm about to

00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,730
say a lot of people might not agree with

00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:32,010
me about this but I will say it anyway

00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:34,530
and that is people will often say like I

00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:37,200
remote pair program and we use Skype or

00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:39,360
we use Google Hangouts and I say you're

00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:43,320
not pair programming I'm sorry

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,330
you are certainly collaborating very you

00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,010
know intently on the same problem or

00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:50,600
you're not pair programming because you

00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:57,990
can't both program that's my opinion

00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:58,640
right there what happens when you don't

00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,520
agree

00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,950
what on how to proceed with your pair

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,390
presumably maybe in a technical you know

00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:08,460
anything anything from programming to

00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:12,300
any kind of approach that happens all

00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:14,930
the time so I think that's all call pair

00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:19,200
programming kind of a continuous

00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:21,120
compromise and negotiation but I also

00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:24,480
like to say that what you often arrive

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,580
at is the highest common denominator not

00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,370
the lowest but the highest so you take

00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:31,380
so when you don't agree

00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:34,080
you'll spend some time talking about it

00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:36,180
of course now sometimes you won't you

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,500
laughter we'll say five ten minutes

00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:40,110
maybe you're both extremely passionate

00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,300
about these two directions what we'll

00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:45,150
often do and we can almost always do

00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:49,110
this is bring in a third person who is

00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:51,720
respected by both to say listen listen

00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:53,760
to this and if that's not possible maybe

00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,440
you're two people you

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,280
an open-source project or a two-person

00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,360
project and there's nobody to bring in

00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,870
sometimes you just have to go with one

00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,100
of them and somebody else has to just

00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:08,010
take and just kind of grin and bear it

00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,380
for a while and see if it bears fruit

00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:12,690
see if it works out but the other person

00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,970
the person who quote-unquote one should

00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:18,240
ideally be gracious enough to say if

00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:20,310
their idea doesn't end up working out to

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,630
say let's try the other one maybe you

00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,630
could try both as well

00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:32,520
nonverbal communication methods that use

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,140
with pair programming those are

00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,840
especially important with remote pair

00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:39,480
programming where you often can't see

00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,850
each other's hands and such but actually

00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,970
I find that a lot of people talk about

00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:47,250
will ask me how do people how do you

00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:50,310
decide when who's going to what we call

00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:52,470
say drive versus navigator kind of sit

00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,850
back and not have hands on the keyboards

00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,710
because what I'm not talking about is

00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:57,570
like one person running like the left

00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:00,270
hand side of the keyboard

00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:02,310
the other one the right I did actually

00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:03,990
as a tangent of my tangent asked my I

00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,730
was got a haircut the other day before I

00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:08,910
came and asked the lady working on my

00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:11,160
hair if if she could imagine two barbers

00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:13,350
working on the same head of hair at the

00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,060
same time and she said no because

00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:17,670
they're scissors would keep hitting each

00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:19,890
other so I thought that was interesting

00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:22,320
so I'm not talking about that but so

00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:24,510
there is like a ideally in a good

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,670
pairing situation a trade-off that

00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:27,870
happens you know as you're working on

00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,980
one person typing for a little while and

00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,570
then the other one takes over the other

00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,610
one takes over and you kind of go bounce

00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:35,150
back and forth and a lot of that I find

00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:36,900
is that non it's the nonverbal

00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:39,450
communication that happens and it's

00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:42,630
little things that you get used to

00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:44,220
picking up on somebody's like I'll do it

00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,570
on this computer here in front of me you

00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,070
know one person who's driving they're

00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:49,770
leaning forward they're intently

00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:51,390
typing they're like clearly in their

00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:53,160
their eyes or focus they're clearly like

00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:55,440
very much in a zone and in that

00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,000
situation it can be very disruptive for

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,260
the other person to just jump in and

00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,210
grab the mouse and keyboard and start

00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:03,000
doing something because we've all had

00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:05,340
somebody rip us out of that zone and

00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,199
it's very disruptive now that person is

00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:12,329
doing that and then they pause

00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:16,679
and then they do this thing like huh how

00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:19,679
did you is it is it the method on

00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:21,629
colonel and that's when the other person

00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,669
can say like I know what that is and

00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:25,049
they can jump they can jump in because

00:11:23,669 --> 00:11:29,009
they've the person has taken themselves

00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:30,629
out of that zone and the other person

00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:32,519
can almost always jump in without

00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:34,649
disrupting that without disrupting them

00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:36,449
now you there are little techniques we

00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:39,149
can talk about where somebody refuses to

00:11:36,449 --> 00:11:40,290
give up the keyboard TDD is great for

00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:42,059
this because you can do something called

00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,559
ping pong pairing where one person

00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:46,199
writes a test and then the person

00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:49,139
implements and then you trade back and

00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:52,499
forth that's like a a good technique to

00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:53,790
enforce that but those little nonverbal

00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:56,459
things you'll people taking a pause

00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:58,069
sitting back rubbing their face there's

00:11:56,459 --> 00:12:02,989
always this one this is my favorite one

00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:04,889
this is a I'm not typing right now

00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:06,269
people do that one a lot that's an

00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:08,129
invitation for somebody else to take

00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:10,249
over as well it's not something over

00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:10,249
here

00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:27,560
so the question was are there situations

00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,120
or people said that remote pairing can

00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,560
be even better than in-person pairing

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,830
and some that's an excellent question

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,840
because I've actually heard people say

00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:38,750
that they sometimes enjoy remote pairing

00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:41,000
more than in-person pairing and I am

00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:43,850
biased because I remote pair program

00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,910
full-time so I'm biased to like want

00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:48,440
people to say that nothing but uninvited

00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:51,800
people have said this and the reason

00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:54,590
they've said that or an example of why

00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:56,630
they've said that is that when you're

00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:58,580
saying a busy office like the pivotal

00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:00,230
office we have a lot of stuff going on

00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:03,080
and everybody is pairing but because

00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:04,430
pairing is a lot of talking it's there's

00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,720
a lot of stuff going on and then that

00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:07,400
person like through that Nerf ball

00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,140
across the room and then you know

00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,990
somebody's having a birthday over here

00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:15,050
and there's just a lot of stuff going on

00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:17,060
and remote pairing tends to focus you

00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:19,190
even more focus than you already are

00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:21,560
when you're pairing because pairing can

00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:23,210
be extremely focusing so when you you

00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,000
know if you kind of put on a headset on

00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:27,110
going over your ears and your we were

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,310
looking at a camera with this other

00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:30,200
person's face on it and you're working

00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:32,960
on this code together it can really

00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,760
laser focus you in on the problems that

00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,410
you're trying to solve and so for that

00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,940
reason some people have said some

00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:41,060
situations they prefer remote pairing

00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:42,500
because it really focuses them versus

00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:46,220
the kind of the distractions that can be

00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:57,230
in a quote unquote normal office in in

00:13:46,220 --> 00:14:00,590
the back ah good question so if you are

00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:05,090
pairing with somebody who is very senior

00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:07,700
to yourself perhaps do you both do the

00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:11,180
disappear in general get benefit out of

00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:14,350
that so I say absolutely I think one of

00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:16,430
the core benefits of pair programming is

00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:18,890
the cross-training and knowledge

00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:21,140
transfer effect of it now that might

00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:25,640
seem like it's all of this junior person

00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:26,720
getting all of that benefit and I find

00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,460
that that's not the case at all the

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,930
senior person you know somebody's been

00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,130
doing this for 20 years and they're

00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,480
pairing with somebody pairing with

00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:34,410
somebody who's a college grad or

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,790
something that's made me an extreme

00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:38,940
but I can say as somebody who's been

00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:41,339
doing this for 15 years and recently was

00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:44,940
pairing with a college grad every single

00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:46,259
day I learned something from that

00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,540
college grad that I didn't already know

00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:50,009
and I actually this is this is no lie I

00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,689
have a little notebook a little day

00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:53,069
planner I sit next to me on my desk and

00:14:51,689 --> 00:14:56,279
every day I write down something that I

00:14:53,069 --> 00:14:57,689
learned for my pair and it doesn't

00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:00,509
matter if they're senior more senior

00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:02,430
than me same level recent college grad I

00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:04,470
always learned something from them so I

00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:08,519
really do think that that's one aspect

00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:11,759
by which a very diverse pair will call

00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:14,430
it or disparate pair can still benefit

00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:15,990
each other and I also find well let me

00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:17,550
ask you guys this question you can think

00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,860
about it yourself but I should say I

00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:21,959
find that when I really think I know

00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,730
something really well and that newbie

00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:25,560
says what's going on here can you

00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:27,060
explain it and I explained it and

00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,029
they're like I really I still don't get

00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:31,860
it and then I have to force myself to

00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:34,439
actually understand it better and not

00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,480
make all these assumptions and I've

00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:38,910
actually managed to talk myself out of

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,069
beliefs that I've had like actually

00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:43,459
saying them out loud I realize well

00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:45,420
that's actually kind of sounds terrible

00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:47,459
why are we doing it that way

00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,620
River had those moments I have those

00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:53,850
moments so that's another way in which

00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:56,279
just the the forcing the the the senior

00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:59,970
person to get into a teaching mindset

00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:03,980
can benefit them as the teacher as much

00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:03,980
as it benefits the person who's learning

00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:19,680
myk's

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,260
so the question was when people who've

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,600
only paired side by side in person with

00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:27,029
somebody then does remote pairing what

00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,620
has been their general takeaway and I

00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:31,740
would say almost every single time

00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:33,360
they've said that it was almost exactly

00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,459
like in-person pairing

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,779
not necessarily better I mean I say I

00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:38,370
bet if you were to like put it on a

00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:40,920
hundred point scale they'd probably rank

00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:42,839
it lower than in person pairing and I

00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,850
would never go so far as to say like

00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:46,740
alright everybody go home and buy a

00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:48,810
headset and some high-speed Internet and

00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,940
you should just stay home because I if I

00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:52,740
had a choice I would be side-by-side

00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,720
pairing with the people that I work with

00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,100
you get so much higher fidelity of

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,260
everything but back to your question

00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,839
people almost universally say that it

00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:02,490
was way better than they expected as it

00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:04,079
is intimidating there's like less

00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:07,110
technology going on and like some kind

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,459
of blurry video and it's like what's

00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:11,250
gonna happen I've never done this before

00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:17,160
and like the screen is typing on its own

00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:19,380
and the novelty of the remote situation

00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,839
I'd say it falls away very quickly

00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,339
like probably within an hour or less and

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,169
because once you get into that zone of

00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:28,110
like okay well should we extract an

00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:29,400
object here or not and then you just

00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,720
revert right back into the normal

00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,880
conversations you have all the time

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,440
while pairing and whether or not that

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,179
person is the conversation you're having

00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,130
is with the remote person or not it's

00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:42,600
the same conversation and it's the same

00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:44,580
urban flow of the pairing experience as

00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,020
long as you you know have a good high

00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:49,080
speed internet internet and things like

00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:55,770
that so people usually say that it's

00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:58,950
really good right there do I ever want

00:17:55,770 --> 00:18:00,270
to just work by myself and the answer is

00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:03,840
yes yes I do

00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:06,990
hi my name is Joe pair program - pretty

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:11,549
much my entire career and I still really

00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:13,320
sometimes miss working by myself it is a

00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:15,630
different experience you know I'm gonna

00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,980
unplug this everybody got this light

00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,280
does anybody have any questions about

00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:24,070
the words

00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:26,140
around here alright so yes I do miss

00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:28,690
working by myself sometimes and there

00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:30,150
are times like the way our company is

00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,170
structured sometimes you're in between

00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:34,840
client engagements and you might have a

00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:36,970
few days where it just makes more sense

00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:41,500
for you to work from work by yourself

00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:43,360
I've had people ask me so if you're if

00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,190
you exclusively pair program and your

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,740
pair is sick do you just take the day

00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,790
off to like well no we're not in we're

00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:51,700
not like that

00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:53,740
dogmatic yeah I could we'll send people

00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,240
home because somebody has you know

00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:57,400
because they're Perico or something like

00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:00,790
that and those days are I'm not gonna

00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:03,880
lie it's really fun and I can also

00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:07,030
honestly say that I check in some of my

00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:09,370
worst code during those days and make

00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:11,830
dumb mistakes and thrash on these easy

00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:14,740
things that my impaired would have just

00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:16,510
been like what are you doing like you're

00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:19,300
you're making a mistake right here so

00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:20,890
it's fun but it's sort of a like when my

00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,980
wife is get lays out of town for a few

00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:26,950
days it's kind of like bachelor time

00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:28,780
stay up late and you know drink that one

00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:31,750
extra beer and things like that but you

00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:34,240
know in the end it's better to go back

00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:52,480
to a more disciplined state all right

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:53,980
here blue shirt so the question was what

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,370
if you have a pairing situation where

00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:58,840
people are almost of the same mind you

00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:00,730
know they agree on everything that's the

00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:03,550
same experience level there's very

00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:05,020
little interchange of ideas or knowledge

00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:08,800
because they're basically on the same

00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:11,530
page I found that that's an extremely

00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:14,640
rare situation because we're all

00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:17,680
extremely opinionated people and we have

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,960
probably even more like maybe now maybe

00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:23,440
wasn't as fair as it is to say people

00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:25,120
didn't have different experiences from

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,070
their past different projects different

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,750
companies it may be different if two

00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:30,250
people are say hired on the same day

00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:32,050
straight out of college or something

00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,340
like that and kind of come up together

00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:35,679
only working together on the same

00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:37,750
projects you know that may be a

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,110
situation where it might be more likely

00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:43,270
for them to have kind of this groupthink

00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:45,730
you know total lock-in of ideas because

00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:48,220
they've had such a narrow band of

00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:49,870
experience but in my experience that's

00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,429
even people who are the same age I

00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:53,170
graduated college at the same time and

00:20:51,429 --> 00:20:55,179
worked as a similar companies before

00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:58,090
working together all that other

00:20:55,179 --> 00:20:59,620
experiences have come built them into

00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:03,010
different people with different ideas

00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:05,410
and and have a lot to contribute to each

00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:07,510
other so I can imagine that situation

00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:10,450
happening but I would imagine it also

00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:13,200
being extremely rare and they're almost

00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:16,570
always being an interchange of ideas

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:20,970
between almost any pairing combination

00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:20,970
and my experience pretty sure

00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:31,620
however oh boy the editor what editor do

00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:35,220
you use what key mappings do you use

00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,220
goddamn Dvorak

00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:43,340
so the answer is yes all the time

00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:44,870
even amongst you know pivotal is kind of

00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:46,370
famous for being dogmatic about things

00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:48,170
like key mapping and everybody using the

00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:51,410
same editor but guess what different

00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:56,390
offices use different editors and key

00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:57,470
mappings and such so it that could

00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:59,000
definitely be hard I can imagine that

00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:01,309
being a bigger issue and say an open

00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,440
source situation hey do you want to work

00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:06,530
on some open source ok that's great ok

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:10,940
now we're kind of we everybody has their

00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:12,559
custom tuned laptop just for them if

00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,240
somebody really wants to learn that

00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,770
other editor that's that's a great

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,300
opportunity to do so

00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:19,070
oh you're an Emacs person I'm a VIN

00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:21,140
person you know this is a great

00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:25,059
opportunity for me to learn a Emacs or

00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:27,290
office or auto set at the very least

00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:29,840
finding the default settings on those

00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:31,880
editors like so you don't overwrite all

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,350
of the defaults go like reverting back

00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,030
to the defaults on a lot of these

00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:36,770
editors can help because the other

00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:38,540
person they may not know your custom

00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:40,490
thing but they know the defaults of

00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:42,890
whatever that editor are whatever that

00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:45,620
editor is so like finding some

00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:47,300
compromise can be great it's also a good

00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:48,830
opportunity for you both to use

00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:51,890
something you're not familiar with and

00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:58,900
you can both learn that together let's

00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:58,900
do this side over here yes

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,740
so I think the question is like how do

00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:15,360
you decide kind of how much driving one

00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,430
person does versus somebody else you

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,130
know like do you do you switch off the

00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:22,380
the typing every few minutes or every

00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:24,060
few hours or maybe somebody old types

00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:30,600
all day long and so other person's turn

00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:32,730
the next today I would say this is gonna

00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,230
sound a little squishy but kind of

00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:37,260
whatever works out great for the pair

00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:39,570
within within limits so for example I

00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:41,280
would probably never say except in weird

00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:42,300
situations like somebody has a guy used

00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,970
to work with somebody who had RS I

00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:46,410
literally could not type yes pair

00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:49,010
programming with somebody who it's

00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:51,150
physically uncapable incapable of typing

00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,890
so except in those situations I would

00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:55,730
say like going all day without having

00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:58,080
somebody pair it's pretty unbalanced

00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:03,360
down to the other extreme of like you

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:07,350
trade letters too far I find that you

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:10,680
know basically every kind of few minutes

00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:13,320
I find like there can be you can use

00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:15,870
things like pong pairing to enforce F

00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:18,000
hello in a situation that would go

00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:19,320
unbalanced without it like that person

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,580
is just a keyboard hog and they're just

00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,200
not going to give up the keyboard

00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:25,440
because they oh my god the typing so

00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,660
much fun and then the other pair can say

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:31,410
like hey what are you so it's also kind

00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:33,480
of a little non confrontational cue it's

00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:35,670
like hey maybe we should ping-pong this

00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:38,850
one oh that uh okay I get it

00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:40,470
I'm gonna sit on my hands now so that

00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:42,750
can be a good way of bringing the flow

00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:44,250
back but like like there was a there was

00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:46,620
a question earlier about nonverbal

00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:48,780
communication and and I kind of turned

00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:51,840
it into how the flow works out and just

00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:53,070
those little people people go through

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,390
little peaks and valleys big ones

00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,950
throughout the day like maybe you had

00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:57,870
breakfast and you're like and your

00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:59,490
coffee and you're up here and then it's

00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,900
like you know 15 minutes before lunch

00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,700
and you're kind of like you know

00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,260
struggling and then of course there's

00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,450
that - those I like three o'clock

00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:08,790
we're like burrito you aid it's like

00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:10,470
really really working on you pretty hard

00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:12,870
and you're like feeling like you're

00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:16,740
gonna fall asleep but you're inevitably

00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:18,330
people's rhythms

00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,940
off they're not going to be locked

00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:23,100
directly and as as far as like their

00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:25,380
energy level so I call it like writing

00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,429
the peaks so somebody's like really into

00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,530
it and then they kind of take a little

00:25:26,429 --> 00:25:30,090
pause and they're thinking and that's a

00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:32,100
great opportunity and a good healthy

00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:33,929
pairing scenario where the other person

00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:35,850
can kind of jump in and my in my

00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:37,290
experience that's every tends to be

00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:40,170
every few minutes sometimes five

00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:42,120
sometimes ten sometimes to hope that

00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:59,990
answers your question the other guy who

00:25:42,120 --> 00:26:04,320
didn't get to talk about here okay

00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:06,179
couple couple questions there one in an

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,990
effort to sort of balance the pair so

00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:11,640
you don't have too many kind of either

00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:15,300
experience levels that are exactly the

00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:17,700
same or totally wide-ranging ones do you

00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:19,260
ever do we ever say try to mix up the

00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:23,880
pairs specifically to pair people

00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:25,410
together purposefully you like so they

00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,300
short answer is yes we sometimes will do

00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:30,570
that especially when it's something like

00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:34,320
hey John is really good at CSS we have

00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:36,900
this CSS chore coming up and hey you

00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,820
know Sally you really don't know any CSS

00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:41,610
this is you but you've said you want to

00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:44,460
learn how about if you guys pair up so

00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:46,050
somebody can learn or when somebody

00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,000
who's been working on say this one area

00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:52,800
of the code a lot it's kind of become

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:55,160
theirs which is a kind of a danger thing

00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:59,370
getting rotating people through that

00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:01,170
expert rapidly so that they can transfer

00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:02,280
get that and get that knowledge shared

00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:04,440
amongst the rest of the team we'll do

00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,340
that on purpose as well the second part

00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:09,440
of your question was well how do you

00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:13,710
decide when people are going to pair and

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:15,720
a couple answers to that one we as part

00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:19,740
of our morning kind of stand up meeting

00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:21,720
morning meeting check in we say who

00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:24,690
wants to switch pairs we try to switch

00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:28,470
every day if we can tend to structure

00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:30,419
our projects such that the thing you're

00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:32,879
working on are these little bits

00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:34,049
you can often get done in a day so

00:27:32,879 --> 00:27:35,519
that's a great opportunity to change

00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:37,830
like hey we just finished that thing on

00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:39,210
the profile page I'm done or we're done

00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:41,480
with that let's mix it up who finished

00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:43,889
something yesterday okay let's trade

00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:47,149
sometimes you'll have people who need to

00:27:43,889 --> 00:27:51,749
stick together for a few days and that

00:27:47,149 --> 00:27:53,340
there's just time now and but the

00:27:51,749 --> 00:27:55,830
opposite can happen where maybe there's

00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:57,899
this really long-running feature super

00:27:55,830 --> 00:28:00,419
complex these two people they've been

00:27:57,899 --> 00:28:02,009
working together for three days on it

00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:03,570
maybe they've like managed to convince

00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:05,519
people to let them go four days on it

00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:08,429
and they're still together and still not

00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:10,529
done we usually will encourage them to

00:28:08,429 --> 00:28:11,669
break up and get another mind in there

00:28:10,529 --> 00:28:13,529
cuz that usually means they're stuck on

00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:15,119
something or that the stuff they're

00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:19,230
working on is so complex that we need to

00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:21,509
get some other ideas and mind okay so

00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:24,859
those are all ways in which we decide

00:28:21,509 --> 00:28:24,859
how to combine pairs

00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:38,220
right cross-training different

00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:41,970
disciplines like sis ops and programming

00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:44,580
I might turn that into bringing this

00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:50,280
pairing with designers pairing with your

00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:53,370
product manager I I love that for many

00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:56,760
reasons one there is the the easy win of

00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:58,020
like cross cross training if somebody

00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:01,200
who's not very good at sis ops are

00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:03,210
pairing with SS ops person they're both

00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,070
gonna learn a lot from each other

00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:07,170
but there's also I feel like the

00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:11,100
secondary benefit of there can also be

00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:14,940
these camps yeah those ops guys you know

00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:18,590
they're like oh ya know those designers

00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:23,280
why Photoshop what's that

00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:26,340
so pairing can also bring together these

00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:27,720
different people and hey turns out we're

00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,370
all pretty much the same we're all kind

00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,100
of geeky people and we like to learn

00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:33,720
from each other and so pairing can break

00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,550
down those kind of social barriers as

00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,620
well so there's literally yes

00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:40,320
cross-training now something I haven't

00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:42,180
necessarily seen as full-time pairing

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,550
between these different organizations

00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:47,910
like you always have a programmer always

00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:49,530
paired with a sis office person those

00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:51,120
tend to be more targeted things like

00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:54,540
you're both you got a deploy to that

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:56,010
server and IT kind of owns that but hey

00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,420
let's work together on getting this

00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:59,820
working because I t's never deployed

00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:04,080
that thing you're trying to deploy those

00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:05,610
those are great targeted situations to

00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:12,090
to pair I think we have time for maybe

00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:18,210
one more way in the back when should you

00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:20,700
not pair oh my gosh 45 seconds that's

00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:21,720
that's a that's that's a tough that's a

00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:25,170
tough question I don't think there's any

00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:27,930
one situation like you know definitely

00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:30,480
in the pair programming handbook online

00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:35,880
you know 50 it says don't pair in this

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:40,140
situation maybe I'll change your

00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:42,270
question until like make sure that you

00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:43,520
take breaks if you are getting burned

00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:45,020
out on pairing I don't

00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,320
it's necessarily a bad thing to say like

00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:50,470
can I just solo today now are there

00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:53,540
tasks that shouldn't be paired on I

00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:56,570
don't necessarily think so I think you

00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:57,770
know you may find something but I would

00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:59,510
say make sure that you you take breaks

00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:01,760
throughout the day so you can kind of

00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:03,830
take a break from this intense situation

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,020
and then once in a once in a while you

00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:08,030
may not want to you might want to take a

00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:10,910
break from pairing all together just to

00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:13,370
sort of take a break from that ultra

00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:14,690
intense interaction you may need a break

00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:17,810
and I think that that's okay

00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:24,100
and I think that that's time does

00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:24,100
