Title: LA Ruby Conf 2014 - Writing Games with Ruby by Mike Moore
Publication date: 2020-01-24
Playlist: LA RubyConf 2014
Description: 
	Creating games is crazy fun and dirt simple with Ruby. You will leave this session with a working game; no previous game development experience necessary. We will introduce basic concepts of game programming and show how to implement them using the Gosu library. This includes the game loop, sprites, animation, camera movement and hit detection. We will build a complete game, so you might want to bring your notebook and follow along.
