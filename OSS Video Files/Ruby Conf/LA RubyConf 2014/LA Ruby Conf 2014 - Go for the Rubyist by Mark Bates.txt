Title: LA Ruby Conf 2014 - Go for the Rubyist by Mark Bates
Publication date: 2020-01-24
Playlist: LA RubyConf 2014
Description: 
	Why are so many Rubyists buzzing about Go? This hot new language that grew out of Google just a few years ago is taking the world by storm and is generating a lot of buzz in the Ruby community. In this talk we'll look at the highlights of Go and try and figure out what the hype is all about, and we'll do with a keen Rubyist eye. We'll also look at where it would make sense in our Ruby/Rails projects to extend them with this highly concurrent, and performant language. What do you say my fellow Rubyists; are you up for the challenge of learning something a bit different?
