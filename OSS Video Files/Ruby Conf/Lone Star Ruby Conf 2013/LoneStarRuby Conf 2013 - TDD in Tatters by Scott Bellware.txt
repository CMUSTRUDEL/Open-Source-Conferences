Description: 
	TDD has been tattered, torn, twisted, stood on its head, and pounded into an pulp of techno-fetishism. TDD was a game-changer, but the focus in the interceding years has shifted from technique to tools, and TDD has been devolving into a lost art. By tearing TDD down to its bones, this presentation presents TDD in its essence, free of tools, and reinforcing the primary focus on design principles. It attempts to convince you to return to a simpler time when TDD was still about design, and software developers were dutifully steeped in the critical importance of design principles. To avoid being held to any particularly offensive positions, this talk liberally attacking the status quo of testing and contemporary tool-focused TDD in Ruby, while introducing yet-another testing library in Ruby. :)
