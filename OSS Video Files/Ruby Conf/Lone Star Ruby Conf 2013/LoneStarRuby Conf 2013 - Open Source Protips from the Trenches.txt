Description: 
	By Matt Rogers

Open Source projects can be hard to navigate for both new and old contributors alike. In this talk, we'll walk through some tips and tricks for dealing with the various pieces of open source projects. From dealing with trolls to nurturing one shot patch submitters into long time contributors we'll walk through various tips to get the most out of your open source experience

open source developers we spend a lot of

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:25,290
time pushing code up to github we merge

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,700
pull requests also on github and we

00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:31,050
spend some time trying to figure out why

00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:32,910
our builds have failed again or we're

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,340
looking for places to fix our bad code

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,250
and we're using some awesome tools to do

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:45,809
this with and when things are going well

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:49,890
we are awesome to each other but when

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:52,620
things go wrong and they go wrong a lot

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:56,610
more than we think we can be pretty

00:00:52,620 --> 00:01:00,619
horrible to each other and this is just

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:03,650
for one guy in one email and/or

00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:06,780
fortunately not from the Ruby community

00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:09,030
but in other places in our community and

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:12,930
elsewhere this sort of vitriol flows

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:15,299
like water from a fire hose but you see

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:18,270
open-source ultimately isn't about code

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,640
it's about people and how we treat them

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,160
on a day-to-day basis we're more than

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,340
just the user names that we see on

00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:28,680
places like credit or hacker news as s

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:32,100
Dryden said it Ruby Midwest its people

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,080
all the way down as a community we

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,450
generally do a good job of treating

00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,550
people well using minnis Juan Matz is

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,340
nice so we are nice as our guiding

00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:43,700
principle we all stand to gain by being

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:47,790
more awesome to each other all the time

00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:51,630
that way we see more of these and less

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:53,040
of this after all we don't want people

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:57,450
to think they're stuck in a minefield

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,700
with no way out do we so for the next

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,290
little bit I want to explain some of the

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,970
things that I've discovered that will

00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,450
allow us to improve ourselves as a

00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:07,560
community and continue our tradition of

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,590
community awesomeness without

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,629
unknowingly caused by trauma I have a

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,090
specific example that I want to talk

00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:16,680
about from 10 years ago and this is

00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,590
something that I did on another open

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,340
source project called KDE and kitty if

00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:26,400
you're not familiar is an open-source

00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:28,050
desktop community for linux and it's

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,850
2003 and then

00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:33,540
just 10 days prior to making this commit

00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:38,280
I am had just gotten access to katie's

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:41,970
CBS repositories no subversion no get so

00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,500
yes I said CBS I was bored one day and I

00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,790
decided to try to find something to work

00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,980
on that was outside my normal realm

00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,590
which was at the time it's the messaging

00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,800
protocols and instant messaging clients

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,120
and so I hop into IRC and I start poking

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,950
around for something to do and I get

00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,770
told i can help on this thing that you

00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:01,680
see here and basically what I'm doing is

00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,120
I'm adding null check or nil checks for

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,730
nill to make sure that the code doesn't

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,250
crash and this takes about an hour which

00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,810
is 10 minutes of actual change time and

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:15,330
then 40 minutes of compiling because

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:18,540
it's c++ and I end up with this and a

00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:20,670
little while later I got this particular

00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,350
reply and I'm not going to ask you to do

00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:25,620
all this but we'll just dive into the

00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:29,270
first sentence I see this i'm just like

00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:32,970
whoa wait what happen what did i do and

00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:36,080
i remember thinking brilliant thanks man

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:39,900
I appreciate your support so much I'm

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,250
God and I swear side and I'm like what

00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,830
is the rest of this email going to be

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,630
like I was just doing what I was told I

00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:49,560
asked for some you know some guidance

00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:51,000
what am I doing here and you can make a

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,950
lot of cases about what I should have

00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,190
done sent something to for review or

00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:59,310
whatever but the point is is it I'm like

00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,690
I'm ready for a fight at this point it

00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:05,220
doesn't matter that the code is wrong

00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:08,070
but I get this at the end and really no

00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,959
you're not actually sorry about being

00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:12,840
harsh you're just saying that to make

00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:15,270
yourself feel better because you hate

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,430
that it sucks that I did this thing but

00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:19,980
you don't really want to say it but this

00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,630
has a profound impact on me and my

00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,240
contribution to this particular section

00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:27,600
of code I started committing to KDE in

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,500
2003 and this particular module I

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,460
committed roughly 10 more times in the

00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,890
eight or nine years that I was

00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,890
contributing to KDE my first commit was

00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:40,680
in 03 on May 28 my next commit was not

00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:41,790
for almost two years later and all it

00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,700
was was a simple

00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:47,700
so that the build would work and then

00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,350
after that it was a third commit to fix

00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:52,980
a bug so that I could actually have

00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:55,080
working email and what this person's

00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:57,510
angry reply did to me was let me know

00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,790
that new people are generally not

00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:01,620
allowed in that particular section of

00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:05,340
the community and it effectively drove

00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:08,280
me away and sadly this happens all the

00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:11,760
time either in the Ruby community or

00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:16,950
elsewhere so my first tip for you guys

00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:18,570
is to not respond while you're angry

00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,910
there's a ton of things that you can do

00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:23,250
to make those situations better if

00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:26,400
you're angry go find something else to

00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:28,530
do go come back read that thing that

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,530
makes you angry again are you still

00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:34,290
angry well then walk away again go do

00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:36,600
something else go do some push-ups get

00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:39,510
some exercise whatever something so you

00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,360
can come back and sit down and not be

00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:43,530
angry when you write that response I

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,630
guarantee you your response will be a

00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:48,660
hundred percent better than the one that

00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:50,490
I got so now that we've dealt with our

00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,750
anger management issues I want to talk

00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:56,010
about what happens when we unnecessarily

00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:57,660
jump to conclusions now I do this all

00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:00,030
the time and I'm ashamed to admit that I

00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:02,580
do a lot more than I am then i would

00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:04,740
like to admit at one of the projects

00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,660
that i recently that i work on recently

00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,340
upgraded to rails for and the guy who

00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,500
did the work was nice enough to send an

00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,880
email that let us know that he'd merged

00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,710
this work in which was totally awesome

00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,330
those are the kinds of communications

00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:18,530
that you want to do when you're working

00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:20,790
with lots people on other projects and

00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:22,020
you know I was caught up in some things

00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,910
I was caught up in this talk I was

00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,130
caught up in other contributions and so

00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:31,860
when I saw this I sent this awesome

00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:35,100
reply and I got this very well reasons

00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:37,410
response and I remember reading that and

00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:41,490
just hanging my head in shame because I

00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:44,280
was just I had forgotten and not gone

00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:48,330
back to go look to see if he'd actually

00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:50,310
announced it until I saw this so at this

00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:52,830
point because I've jumped to conclusions

00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:54,960
I've make myself look like a complete

00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:58,270
jerk

00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,400
so this is the next tip if you can put

00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:02,500
yourself in somebody else's shoes and

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,480
see it from their point of view before

00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,220
you barge in with your point of view you

00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:10,270
can avoid the situations like the one I

00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:13,420
just showed you alright so now I have a

00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:17,320
question what do you guys think is the

00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:23,410
answer to this question it does anybody

00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:27,310
anybody want to take a guess it's close

00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:29,800
it's actually this which is not enough

00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:31,840
people and there are several reasons for

00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,250
this actually one of them is that lots

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,650
of people go start their own projects

00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,960
instead of joining others it's easier to

00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:40,090
do a lot of people do it for as a

00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:43,420
learning experience and then other

00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:44,860
people just can't be bothered and some

00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:48,490
of the people just need a little bit of

00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:51,490
push so that means we end up with

00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:53,050
projects or this is the case most of the

00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:55,480
time eighty percent of the effort is

00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:57,790
done by twenty percent of the people so

00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:01,330
that begs the question how do we

00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:05,500
encourage more people to contribute this

00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:09,400
is not the answer i know that i have

00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:12,040
done this before and it's not not the

00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,680
way to do it unfortunately that was in a

00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:18,130
previous life once i actually wisened up

00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:20,740
a little bit and sort of grew up you

00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:22,540
could you tell anybody in any other more

00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,340
condescending way that you're just

00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,510
really not all that interested in that

00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,650
thing that they just said hey I have

00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:30,130
this great idea they're enthusiastic

00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:34,419
about it everything you just like yeah

00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:38,039
I'm not interested so we can firmly

00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:39,820
place this in the do not use category

00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:43,810
but we can make it a little bit better

00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:45,640
and this is one way to do that patches

00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:47,200
accepted is nice because it signals that

00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,140
at least you're interested in taking

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,210
their contributions this is a little bit

00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:54,640
better because you're still you're

00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:59,110
letting them know that you're actually

00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:02,020
happy to do it but these are just kind

00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:03,670
of old and tired and they're not as

00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:06,040
effective as they could be at getting

00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:07,480
people to contribute to your project so

00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,899
this is what I have started

00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:13,149
with my projects and the simple act of

00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:15,459
asking this question is enough to get

00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:17,769
many people to go off and solve their

00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:20,440
own problems which is a beautiful thing

00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:22,750
in fact I actually merged about a week

00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:25,690
ago pull request from somebody who had

00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:27,699
never contributed to open source before

00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,709
and I got them to actually go off and

00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:31,510
update some documentation so we're

00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:35,230
working on that lack of documentation

00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:37,600
problem and it was fantastic and I did

00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:40,389
nothing more than ask her ask the person

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,529
the question and let her know where she

00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:46,240
could go find go find the code to change

00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:49,570
so this leads me to sort of tip number

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,149
three which is to ask questions don't

00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:53,980
give orders even if you're a benevolent

00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:56,829
dictator for life in your project you're

00:09:53,980 --> 00:10:03,370
not an actual dictator so don't act like

00:09:56,829 --> 00:10:05,980
one pairing is a great way to get and/or

00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:08,079
keep other people involved in your

00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,660
project and like what Mark went through

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:15,220
with the lightning talk today was great

00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:18,190
because when you sit down to offer help

00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:21,699
to people that gives them the sense that

00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:24,010
you are you as a leader of a project are

00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:25,449
interested in interested in having their

00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:27,760
contributions and interested in having

00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:29,440
them work with you on your project and

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,760
that it's not just all about you and

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,620
what you're doing but that you're

00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:36,190
actually willing to form a community

00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:39,100
around your project so this leads into

00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:42,790
tip number four if you're giving them

00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:44,529
help then you're awesome so I want

00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:49,720
people to offer help to other people in

00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:51,850
other projects so having pulled my pull

00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,010
request merge is one of my favorite

00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:57,459
things in the world and I especially

00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:59,050
like it even more when I see these sorts

00:10:57,459 --> 00:11:01,899
of responses to the pull request that I

00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:04,630
submit and in fact this particular

00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:06,430
response got me to submit to additional

00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:09,940
pull requests to the project that I had

00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:12,699
originally submitted to my first comment

00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:16,779
might my first one got the previous

00:11:12,699 --> 00:11:19,569
slide this perfect my next pull request

00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:21,350
got this and I actually did a third one

00:11:19,569 --> 00:11:22,640
which was about

00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:26,900
limit that I could go with that project

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,940
and so I just stopped one of my other

00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:31,430
favorite things is merging pull requests

00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:34,010
and I'd love to do it with a little bit

00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:37,580
of flair just because it offers that

00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:40,310
sort of excitement and it signals that

00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:43,730
excitement for people when you merge

00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:45,710
their stuff this is why I love emoji and

00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,720
I love to sprinkle these things I

00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:49,070
probably or we use them but that I love

00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,350
to sprinkle these things when merging

00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:53,060
pull requests or just to express the

00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:55,640
fact that I like something that somebody

00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:57,440
has done this helps provide a lot of a

00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,810
little bit of whimsy and praise and

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:03,380
encouragement for these people when they

00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:06,530
come to your project I also like to do

00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:08,960
things like this like this idea this is

00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:10,550
great just to so show people that the I

00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,350
am paying attention to what you're

00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:14,870
submitting I am interested in what's

00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:18,200
going on and that it doesn't matter that

00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:22,310
you're a beginner or an expert I will

00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:25,700
take your stuff no matter what so this

00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:28,040
leads into my last tip actually which is

00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:30,770
to offer praise and encouragement all

00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,630
the time any time that you can do it

00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:34,730
even if you have to find something

00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:37,220
positive to say about a particular thing

00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:39,080
that's something that you can give to

00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:44,570
that person is feedback that will help

00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:48,890
them out later so to wrap this up and

00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:50,930
put a little bit of a bow on this we do

00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:56,900
excellent with this in a lot of the

00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:58,940
cases and we can do better much like

00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:01,100
companies optimized for happiness

00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:03,110
developer happiness customer happiness

00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:06,710
whatever you have you we should strive

00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:08,870
to optimize for kindness in that case if

00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:10,910
you want to learn more I highly suggest

00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:12,500
you to read this book it's where a lot

00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,910
of the content from this talk comes from

00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,840
and it's where I learned a lot of how to

00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:21,230
do these things in general it's an old

00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:22,610
book and if you actually do pick it up I

00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:24,680
would get the version from nineteen

00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:29,870
eighty one which is how old it is it's

00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:32,150
been in print since 36 1936 but the

00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:34,340
updates that they put in have been sort

00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,970
of modernizing it the version from 81 is

00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,790
the one that you

00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:40,430
it's the it's the best one in my opinion

00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:44,360
so that's I know this is really really

00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:50,000
short but that's actually all I got and

00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:52,370
I am Matt Rogers I go by Matt are with

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,110
an underscore on Twitter and this is an

00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:55,579
open source pro tips from the trenches

00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:59,180
and I would love to take any questions

00:13:55,579 --> 00:14:02,420
or have a large discussion about some of

00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:07,569
the things anything else before i turn

00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:07,569
