Title: LoneStarRuby 2013 - Big Data and the Coming Golden Age of Humanity
Publication date: 2020-01-28

Description: 
	By Byron Reese

This talk explores how the widespread proliferation of cheap sensors of all kinds will create a vast collective memory for the planet which will serve as a record of every cause and effect. This data will be scoured for associations that will be turned into algorithms which optimize every decision we have to make in life. And while we may not always choose to do those things, it will effectively make every person on the planet vastly wiser than the wisest person who has ever lived. In the future, no one will ever need to make a mistake again.

Thank You senator Arthur stated within

00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:25,070
2007 when I was asked to become an

00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:27,289
advisor for rapid development company

00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:29,329
that was using ruby in the bay area and

00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:31,340
is really impressed with the technology

00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:33,500
and but but I was actually impressed

00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:36,590
with the people i discovered using it as

00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,750
I kind of got into that role maybe with

00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:41,870
its emphasis on convention over

00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:44,089
configuration strictly the time comes a

00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:45,589
seismic shift in development languages I

00:00:44,089 --> 00:00:48,590
actually came from the world of

00:00:45,589 --> 00:00:50,719
programming to us the only ones among

00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,789
you might I was with the company called

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,680
wave wave which we made things like to

00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:56,480
is dot H we made C++ application

00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,550
frameworks and things like 20 * h plus

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:02,000
plus and so forth if I can come out of

00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:04,580
that world and and happened upon the

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,770
Royal of rubi english days before about

00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:09,590
in the late nineties I was concerned

00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,930
about two trends that seemed to be quite

00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,850
at odds with each other when is ops

00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:16,369
needing to become very robust in more

00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:18,500
feature-rich websites trying to do more

00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:21,650
and more and in a solution that's fine

00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:24,170
but superimposed on that were massively

00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,430
shortened development cycles and I

00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,799
wondered which of those two imperatives

00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:29,869
would break first and it turns out

00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:32,740
neither did because the languages and

00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:35,720
the environments so for both of them

00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:37,970
it's see reviews is a language for the

00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,549
web over the cloud and since it

00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:42,439
basically predates the cloud we can view

00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:45,950
its arrival as Perseus if not downright

00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:47,450
prophetic these things that are ahead of

00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,720
their time would live to see the time

00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:53,899
allowed you think about da Vinci and his

00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:56,960
drawings of helicopters for instance but

00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:59,000
this was not the case with Ruby you

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,530
could see even in the lane is the future

00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,799
find an outline even at that distance

00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:05,570
and I knew that it would had a huge way

00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:08,840
in the epic drama which would unfold in

00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:10,280
the next decade and say it began but but

00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,350
they would be replaced by the language

00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,549
and I'm not payin audience here as I

00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:15,560
mentioned earlier I was struck by the

00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:16,880
people who were adopted with the

00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,820
register right

00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,860
suspender wearing optimistic clearest

00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:23,750
excited by some shiny new toy they're

00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,060
people who had jobs to get down and more

00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:28,040
than anything motivated away to the job

00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,540
as best they could and understandably

00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,540
with his luck with his little house and

00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:34,970
as possible that Rose was intentional

00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,920
about promoting program of happiness but

00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:39,820
it was a technology not actually

00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:42,500
optimized for a machine the poor human

00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:45,170
and if these guys like that I had a good

00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,870
feeling about his prospects and if

00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,790
they're not really pragmatist the news

00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:53,150
probate is only half a decade ago had

00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,800
when I squarely in the future and in

00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:57,230
that spirit the spirit of looking ahead

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,670
while staying rounded as in fears the

00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,040
thoughts I wanted to share with you

00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:03,710
today so now comment say about the

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,200
future about dating and by how it will

00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:07,880
change the world I'm going to give you a

00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,970
glimpse in a way that I think you will I

00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,620
live to see now think is that this idea

00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:15,470
it's only like any other typical crowd

00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:17,300
well well that tightrope with me but

00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:19,550
balancing act of seeing the future as

00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,410
big as it can be but never venturing

00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:24,410
into the land of mere speculation or

00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:26,800
wishful thinking I'm going to show you a

00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:30,230
future that i think is inexplicably both

00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,730
impossible and yet inevitable and i want

00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:33,830
you to let me know if you feel like I've

00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:35,360
done this there's a drug known as

00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:37,760
wellbutrin that is prescribed for

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,280
depression and it has a line of

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,020
successful clinical history and some

00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,150
number of years ago people taking an

00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:48,110
ambien notice that the cravings for

00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:50,660
cigarettes I went by the makers of the

00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:53,060
drug lexicons will tested it and find

00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:56,930
out that the drug was in fact a highly

00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:59,780
successful smoking aid and so they

00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:02,420
repackaged the same exact drug under the

00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:05,540
trigger is over and it's prescribed to

00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:07,580
help people stop smoking now think about

00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,740
that with me for a moment nobody ever

00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:12,330
contemplated wellbutrin as an

00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,860
anti-smoking drug but only the humor

00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:16,290
because users of the medicine just

00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,780
happened to notice that it had this

00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:21,299
effect and it begs the question how many

00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:23,730
unseen connections either like that in

00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:26,220
the universe causes in effect that we

00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:28,020
cannot perceive because they're buried

00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,330
in the infinitude of data which

00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:34,020
populates the universe I think they are

00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:35,940
limitless another example schools would

00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,980
visit lighting children schools with

00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,350
fluorescent lighting get fewer cavities

00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:43,110
than children in schools with

00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:44,790
incandescent lighting why is this it's

00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,230
because fluorescent lighting increases

00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:49,050
the body's production of saliva which

00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:51,660
actually bites tooth decay the civil

00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,400
Interpol everything in the universe with

00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,040
everything else in the universe is

00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:59,100
dramatically more complex than we are

00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:01,560
able comprehend our ability to fail

00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,380
cause and effect with edit is highly

00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:07,410
suspect we spend them upon cars and

00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:09,900
associations almost by accident like the

00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:14,180
scientific equivalent of your chocolate

00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:16,680
is in my opinon butter and yeah i think

00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,450
this state of affairs will actually

00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,220
change due to the conversions of or

00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:25,650
trends the reduction in cost essentially

00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:27,480
204 things the three of these are rated

00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:30,570
everybody in this room the cost of

00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:33,360
storing data will go to 0 the cost of

00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:35,550
moving data will go to 0 as a constant

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,710
performing calculations on data will go

00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:40,169
to zero and the fifth one of these is a

00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:41,790
bit more subtle it is a reduction to

00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:47,660
essentially zero of the cost of

00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:49,650
collecting data in digital form

00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,660
presently if you think about it there is

00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:54,750
a minuscule amount of data that is

00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,370
actually in digital form I'm not talking

00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,500
about taking medical records at on paper

00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:00,330
and making real digital I mean all the

00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,720
trillions upon trillions of pieces of

00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:05,000
data created every second on this planet

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,770
seeing only the data will be collected

00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,530
passively due to the words for

00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:12,770
proliferation of cheap sensors whose

00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:15,090
cost is also rocketing toward zero and

00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,830
miss covering of the planet with these

00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:19,470
sensors is not going to be done by any

00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:21,680
central defense organization it is

00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:23,720
already happening because of the

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,350
meant improvements that data can bring

00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:30,229
to our lives a camera mounted on top of

00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:31,520
my house that scans the pieces of

00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:34,729
everybody that comes and knocks on my

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,100
door to see if their criminal is a good

00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:41,660
thing into itself it yet they also

00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:43,729
possibly collects data a skillet that

00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:47,180
detects botulism and remembers

00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:49,910
everything you ever kept in it is also

00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:52,430
quite useful inning of itself and it

00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:54,289
generates data now the cost of

00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:57,380
collecting this data whereas you assume

00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:59,210
it will become ubiquitous and the impact

00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:02,389
of this combined with the other three

00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:04,310
trends will be profound did you see

00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:07,490
already as you pass through later in

00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:09,949
life you leave a digital echo of what

00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:12,050
you do a picture of who you are and

00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:14,150
where do I what you're doing and more

00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:16,610
and more of your life leave such an echo

00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,139
and will continue to do so you can see

00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:21,530
it today right when you fill up your car

00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:23,000
and gas station it look when you pay at

00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:26,150
the credit card that records where you

00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,770
are and what you were doing when you did

00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:33,289
it and it's a labret tits a telling sign

00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:36,260
of your comings and goings you self a

00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:38,300
many labs everybody call and how long

00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:41,539
you talk to them and so take a moment

00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:45,199
with me imagine if this is pushed to its

00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:48,409
logical extreme imagine everything you

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,210
do is recorded movers are logged in to

00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:51,770
talk about privacy in a minute but

00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:54,620
assume that it is possibly collective

00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:56,150
can completely private basically I

00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,310
imagine every wave you said was written

00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:00,169
down and transcribed for your own

00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:03,470
personal reference and this would be as

00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:04,699
useful no no you no problem trying to

00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:06,259
remember what you promised the client

00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:09,229
last Friday you would just look at the

00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:11,659
transcript then imagine GPS is lowered

00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:14,419
it everywhere you go extremely accurate

00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:17,000
gps the trucks or every move even within

00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:19,430
your own who next imagine that

00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,680
everything you do is remember not just

00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,449
that you went to a certain address if

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,169
that that address was a movie theater

00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:27,770
and based on ways

00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:30,120
you saw what they said three of steroids

00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,259
now let's get no detail you're watching

00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,209
the TV and you're flipping through the

00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:35,880
channels every channel you pass on

00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:38,789
imitating you guys officiator you come

00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,800
back to all perfectly log in the kitchen

00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:42,810
that pan loves everything you cook in it

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,760
every piece of silverware you're going

00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:46,920
to own in the future when they are you

00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,360
the person hold of it and will calculate

00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,940
the calories and the nutritional value

00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,070
of every bite you consume your house

00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,899
would be aware of every room you are in

00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:57,420
it which are doing it it said think with

00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:59,130
me about everything being recorded every

00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,110
single thing you buy and everything Amir

00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:03,630
you ordered every restaurant that you

00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:05,670
visit every word that you type every

00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:07,470
book that you read the kind you had your

00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,779
sprinkler set to turn on the last time

00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:11,970
you went to the dentist everything you

00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:15,269
saw everything an eyeball track to and

00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:16,649
not just Mitchell I backtrack to it but

00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:18,570
how long you looked at it and what was

00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:22,230
your physiological response did your

00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:25,079
muscles tighten did you smile imagine if

00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:26,910
it were all recorded every day all of

00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:29,550
your medical records all of your tax

00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:31,680
records any same that you downloaded how

00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,870
many times you play it every person that

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,839
you need every single thing your body

00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:39,269
does every time your heart beats every

00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:42,620
bite that you eat every breath that you

00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:46,800
breathe imagine if it is all recorded

00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:49,920
every of digital echo of your life love

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,860
it or hate it this is the inevitable

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,880
direction the technology is taking this

00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:56,760
because this allows you as a byproduct

00:09:53,880 --> 00:10:00,180
of all kinds of things we want computers

00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:02,490
to help us do it is profound because if

00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,740
they can actually possibly collect and

00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:07,350
adina arrives generate we will have

00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:10,560
created a collective memory for the

00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:13,560
planet a record of every cause and

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:16,260
effect this would be a monumental

00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:19,019
accomplishment of humanity this isn't

00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:20,550
just indapur giddy it would mean it

00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:23,279
finally for the first time humanity

00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:25,589
caused an extremely robust collective

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,209
memory and that we need not learn and

00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:29,970
forget learner forget learn and forget

00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:32,600
again and again peons about the islands

00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:35,990
above us we could actually learn

00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:38,980
and remember them everyone's life

00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:42,259
experience every action and its outcome

00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:46,279
will be kind of data that make everybody

00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:48,860
else's life better so what's happening

00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:50,600
what about privacy I'm really interested

00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:53,720
in things we've built the Internet to do

00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,310
that have no offline corollary these are

00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,199
things that teachers about ourselves you

00:10:55,310 --> 00:11:01,009
know how do you need people wanted to

00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:04,069
sell stuff in their attic or send money

00:11:01,009 --> 00:11:06,709
to people because the 40 they came along

00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:08,209
before paypal came alone because the

00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:10,040
offline we haven't already invented

00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:13,819
garage sales they're Hardy invented

00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,139
western union the Twitter well that

00:11:13,819 --> 00:11:16,610
tells us something about ourselves we

00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:17,660
didn't know when it does us a lot of

00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:19,850
things about ourselves we didn't know

00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:23,089
the kind of information we will share

00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:25,339
the immediacy of it and any on I'm very

00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:29,180
proud the things for getting the

00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:30,980
internet to do it reflects very well on

00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:34,910
us we're building it to connect with

00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:37,189
each other and to share information to

00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:40,759
collaborate with each other into our

00:11:37,189 --> 00:11:43,130
mutual support now I know I listed all

00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:45,050
of the various uses of the internet but

00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:47,870
unbalanced were creating it for good

00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:50,449
purposes and when pretty big surprise

00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:54,110
was how much were willing to expend time

00:11:50,449 --> 00:11:55,339
and effort but it is you potato

00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:59,870
strangers people were never going to

00:11:55,339 --> 00:12:01,790
meet then Danny no fame no glee and you

00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,230
see it all over the internet and you're

00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:06,500
the last out hoping I would ever have to

00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:09,620
tell this to you put some patient

00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:12,230
problems you have on a blog and people

00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:14,329
give you advice then take time to write

00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:15,680
some big long a forum post just for you

00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:19,009
a total stranger they never going to

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,420
meet until it's nice isn't it think

00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:22,910
about it that we have a natural desire

00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,680
to want to help each other and so I

00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,689
think that people feel their privacy is

00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,519
safeguarded they would be willing to

00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:32,660
contribute their data for the greater

00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:35,000
good yeah it only happens when I buy a

00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:37,279
book on Amazon I'm going to use that

00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,310
fact to anonymously suggest that book to

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,019
someone else because you see over 20

00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:43,279
people will realize there

00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:45,110
reading for the construction of a

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,089
knowledge base that is a complete

00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:49,489
recording of every action that every

00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:51,800
member of humanity and this information

00:12:49,489 --> 00:12:53,779
will be used to better people's lives in

00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:57,170
very real ways as up as it were about to

00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:59,360
see so let's assume that most people do

00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:02,629
this that they share their digital echo

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:05,059
that this complete experiential logging

00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:07,100
of their life on an anonymous basis and

00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:09,019
assuming we have the ability to ask a

00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:12,290
questions that have never been asked

00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:14,449
before and get instant answers you can

00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:16,100
start looking around the lines that

00:13:14,449 --> 00:13:19,100
connect things we didn't previously have

00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:20,660
any idea where connected the machine

00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,220
might get you stated by surface and

00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:24,739
correlations it wouldn't be expected

00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,629
what if it turned out the people who

00:13:24,739 --> 00:13:29,209
drink a certain kind of cop who have on

00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:31,189
average higher incomes and things that

00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:33,619
people switch to that coffee see the

00:13:31,189 --> 00:13:37,369
incomes go up or that a certain group of

00:13:33,619 --> 00:13:39,049
people who are seemingly unrelated set

00:13:37,369 --> 00:13:42,439
of a dozen activities report a higher

00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:44,449
level of happiness than average or to

00:13:42,439 --> 00:13:47,029
continue with fictional cases what if

00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:48,769
some gasoline made it a certain refinery

00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:50,509
burns cleaner or better than other ones

00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:52,040
and what if the population of some

00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:54,439
endangered animal is declining

00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,869
everywhere but one place and why would

00:13:54,439 --> 00:13:58,670
it be the traffic jams appear in certain

00:13:56,869 --> 00:14:01,160
cities in comparable cities at the same

00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:03,350
solid why is the dropout rate in seven

00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:06,110
schools in lower the demographically

00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:08,029
match schools around the country so its

00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:09,879
dive a little deeper into one of these

00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:12,309
really win with medical implications

00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:14,689
imagine that everyone with breast cancer

00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:18,049
voluntarily shared their digital echoed

00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:20,329
this on an anonymous basis st. it

00:14:18,049 --> 00:14:21,949
included the mapping of their genome as

00:14:20,329 --> 00:14:23,449
well as every single thing they did in

00:14:21,949 --> 00:14:25,759
their daily lives every food that they a

00:14:23,449 --> 00:14:28,639
little exercise they did every single

00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:30,350
they heard everything that has been

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,759
passively logged about their lives now

00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:33,919
with breast cancer like many diseases

00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:37,119
some people get better and some people

00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:39,230
get ways that we really don't know why

00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:41,600
imagine the computer coding through this

00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:44,299
massive amount of data inconceivably

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,459
large the payout patterns and offending

00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:49,579
that look like this people who eat

00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:52,579
radishes it better slightly no happen

00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:53,230
than people don't now you don't know if

00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:55,450
the radish

00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:57,610
make people better or something that

00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:59,800
makes people crave radishes makes him

00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:02,170
get better so how did you do you dig

00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,880
into the data deeper and you see that

00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:05,920
it's only people who live in certain

00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:08,230
parts of the country the data shows

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,180
these pockets were radish efficacy is

00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:12,790
substantially higher in other places it

00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:14,080
is non-existent the computers would be

00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:16,360
see that most of the people who got

00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:19,240
better about their radishes and stones

00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,280
that were stopped from certain forms and

00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,200
naturally not just certain forms but

00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:25,840
farms that you set a certain pesticide

00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,490
and not just a certain pesticide but

00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:30,280
this decides that contain a certain

00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:32,140
chemical so what do we do with that

00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,580
poison doctors try to understand what's

00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:36,310
happening drug companies Commission

00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:38,230
studies to see if this particular

00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:40,870
chemical found in radish pesticides my

00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:42,070
cure breast cancer and then they went

00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:44,320
wrong as in they found that in the

00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:46,840
majority of cases it does help in a few

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,370
cases it doesn't and it figures have

00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:52,720
that it helps when you have a certain

00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:56,170
genetic marker and otherwise it's

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,690
ineffective Wow I mean all of you said

00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:01,120
you have this piece of knowledge but for

00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:03,760
people with the circle criteria this is

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,850
going to cure the disease time things

00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,380
like this are impossible today finding

00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:11,140
that this are absolutely impossible

00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:13,750
today we are unable to decipher the

00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:15,100
complex interactions of everything in

00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,290
the planet with everything else on the

00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,430
planet today to discover things I've

00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:22,300
where'd you turn helps people stop

00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:24,550
smoking to a chance and unlock if you

00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:26,860
can see where it's all headed instead of

00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:28,780
creating a hypothesis and constructing

00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,450
experiments and in modifying and

00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:35,500
retesting hypothesis we can make out of

00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:37,090
history a test we control for in 15

00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,310
trillions of pieces of data for

00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:42,550
meaningful information for divided you

00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:44,890
see is full of unexplained anomalies by

00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:46,480
the people who ran Academy Awards out

00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:49,380
where of people who are nominated to

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,200
don't win by the first baseman live

00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:54,980
statistically longer than any

00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,960
player on the TV you said the cat people

00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:59,120
lived shorter lives and short people in

00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:01,820
one instance our top people heavier ball

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,070
down more often Larry study suggests

00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,570
that it can all be explained by the fact

00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:08,570
that when fat people with how people

00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:10,130
fall down the fire further and there are

00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,949
many things like this that have some

00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:14,089
underlying reason that we can learn from

00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:17,270
I'm not really sure these are these are

00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:19,610
cases that are actionable in these cases

00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:21,020
but they arrest riveted the principle in

00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:22,790
reality but scientists are going to

00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:25,850
discover of there are several

00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:29,720
associations of diet and activity for

00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:31,400
certain behaviors in genetics and fill

00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,980
and at night venison the littlest

00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:36,920
insights in the huddle under happier and

00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:39,260
better and I guess is we won't have to

00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:42,410
absorb any of this information if the

00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:44,840
system conspirators will call it the

00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:46,820
system determines the people like me are

00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,770
happier and healthier with more violent

00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:51,290
in their system energies came up in my

00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:53,120
custom vitamin formulation which also

00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:55,130
includes all the other nutrients I

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,480
didn't get enough of that day it's

00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:59,000
inside the trust my doctor or

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,680
nutritionist to make a custom vitamin

00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,200
formula for me based on my medical

00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,610
records and have you massively looking

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,800
for letting the sisters were based on

00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:09,140
every bite that I swallow every bit of

00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,820
my genetic code and it invite the data

00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:13,580
it has an alliance of a billion people

00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:15,470
now body would be kept in perfect

00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:18,980
condition constantly monitored and

00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:20,530
optimized a safely because it is built

00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:24,380
on the collective memory and experience

00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:26,570
of the entire planet it is the end of

00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:28,820
the age of anecdotal evidence were

00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:30,050
because Aunt Martha takes a teaspoon of

00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:33,080
hunting every morning and she hasn't

00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:35,510
been sick in years I should as well and

00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:38,270
you would get a new could understand the

00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:41,780
outliers better maybe some people live

00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:42,920
to 113 they are inexplicably the people

00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:46,130
who need to stick of butter every night

00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:49,250
before bed he said that meets in your

00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:51,260
hips annual is it genetic maybe some

00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:53,570
people keep the minute facilities in

00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:55,100
lately live folklore tells us that

00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:58,250
didn't cross web presence helps keep the

00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:00,150
mode active this is true well you know

00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,680
in the future we may be too

00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:04,570
perhaps mental agility as a result of

00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:06,580
their extensive exposure to a chemical

00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:10,120
in pencil area news part that they

00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:11,440
observed by doing all those puzzles so

00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,660
we're gonna do we're going to have our

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,000
lives the best method maximized any and

00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:17,950
all factors that we may perform you to

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,290
you may decide we prefer a deep-fried

00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:22,510
butter on a stick or perhaps a rocket

00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:24,010
over to the estimated instead of the

00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:25,900
estimated two point four months of life

00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:29,740
we could have but the choice to finally

00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:31,360
be ours and it would baste on data now

00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:34,450
this future is going to pinterest

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,520
gradually more and more people magma

00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:38,740
data will be passively collected more

00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,590
people will participate in the passage

00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:43,720
of time embroiders repository successes

00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:46,150
will come engaging their data collection

00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,860
and more people to participate but this

00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:50,200
this ball gets rolling it will speed up

00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:52,750
quickly this new way to do science will

00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,520
not be limited to scientists anyone

00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:57,160
could sit down at their desk from you

00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,810
later hypothesis asking a question and

00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,940
receive an answer they could then

00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:03,610
mattify the question until causalities

00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:05,590
are found this method allows us to treat

00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:09,040
the entire world as a controlled

00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:10,780
experiment in which respect the dad

00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,790
would need ever smaller specialist

00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:14,170
pyramid complex-- work I'm not saying

00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:16,420
the research scientist is going to be

00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:17,890
replaced by the florist in Ohio I'm

00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,240
saying is the florist in a higher that

00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:21,250
will be one of the millions of people

00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:24,310
accessing the data looking for

00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:25,540
associations and testing hypotheses she

00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:27,520
maybe they had him figures out the

00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:29,650
people living in apartments who cares

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,270
arcaded with the shape of sealant the

00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:34,450
three terms won't likely to be taking

00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:37,360
into the person's a Beijing discovers

00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:39,190
like this not just not just health but

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,440
patterns in crayon myosin house is

00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:43,150
broken into more often than others while

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,150
your graduation will tire in certain

00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:48,250
schools I think great comfort in this i

00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:50,230
think the answers to life's most vexing

00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:53,140
problems can actually depend in the data

00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:55,510
and thus i think we're going to be able

00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:58,930
to transform the whole world does you

00:20:55,510 --> 00:21:01,120
see if you think about it most of our

00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:04,540
hardest problems are in fact technical

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,970
problems Thunder is simply a technical

00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:09,610
problem there's no reason that have to

00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:11,680
be hungry people disease is that those

00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:14,260
purely a technical problem

00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:16,270
is a technical problem being that their

00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:19,450
technical problems they almost by

00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:20,980
definition have technical solutions and

00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:22,650
so in the future I believe everyone is

00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,910
essentially going to be wiser

00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:27,730
effectively advisor than anyone who's

00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:29,640
ever lived and did they finally be able

00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:33,520
to sell what i call the lasagna problem

00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:35,760
now to talk about that in just a moment

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:39,580
I want to I want to speak briefly about

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:43,570
our history with knowledge and

00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:46,840
information and the high price of

00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:49,900
mistakes this is a guy named Archduke

00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:52,150
Franz Ferdinand and he was shot and

00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:55,000
killed by this man a 19 year old

00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:58,480
assassin named Gabriel a principal and

00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,120
he was shot because the driver Leah paid

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:04,570
Lopez who was driving Archduke to the

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:08,170
rain home and because he was shot this

00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:11,260
led directly to World War one a man of

00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:13,450
course led to the Great Depression which

00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:16,660
contributed to the oil worldwide rise

00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:18,310
and fascism which led to the Cold War of

00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:21,790
the dropping of the atomic bomb which

00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:24,040
led to the code word which in turn means

00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:25,390
that somehow or with over this entire

00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:29,650
time something like 80 know you people

00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:33,970
died 1800 and this and this t-shirt was

00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:38,980
created any of this because one man took

00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:40,690
one wrong turn two let's take it in a

00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:45,360
bit about knowledge it used to be that

00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:45,360
knowledge was a very fragile thing and

00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:51,100
the advantage point in the past the

00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,420
universe of all the things that were

00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,220
knowable was your little village

00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,720
probably three or four hundred people if

00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,460
somebody wins then agenda near the

00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,680
answer to something didn't really matter

00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:02,530
it was it like it existed so think about

00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:05,830
that humanity in this internet knowledge

00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:08,470
was 400 people and then connect matters

00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:09,820
worth villagers of a fragile thing it

00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,700
died with the person can you the

00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,780
information the minute they died

00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:16,720
unless I'm taking the time to teach

00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:18,910
somebody else and then they may about

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,620
lip or misremembered it and so even

00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:22,000
learn these things in some village

00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:25,150
similar and somebody who died when he

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,400
gone and yet progress came in this world

00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:29,620
and then things took a dramatic leap

00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,840
forward with the invention of this the

00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:33,820
modern the matter in bulk and not just

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,680
its invention but its widespread

00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:37,930
proliferation at a relatively low cost

00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,270
what this meant is it for the first time

00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:42,040
ideas were persistent they outlived the

00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:43,810
person thinking of the idea and they

00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,030
were mobile they could easily complex

00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:47,890
ideas could easily travel and it could

00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:51,340
be a bit places at once which a person

00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:53,200
can't but this led to a problem it into

00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:54,460
the patient of libraries and the problem

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,620
which I call the truth is out there

00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:59,140
problem and the truth is out that

00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:01,720
problem essentially says that if you

00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:03,010
know what the answer to your question

00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:08,080
assembly in this library which can't

00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:09,520
find it it says it doesn't exist she I'm

00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,860
going to talk about that for just a

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,830
moment pumping up the very first search

00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:17,940
engine the first search engine we date

00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:21,910
back to about 500 BC here in a little

00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:24,010
part of grief known as Delphie and in

00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:27,220
this creative briefs they lived in

00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:29,050
Oracle in the intercalated articles all

00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:31,600
over the world but the Oracle at Delphi

00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:33,460
was very well known and this may have

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,880
been King Croesus of Lydia this is

00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:38,380
probably say 400 500 BC King chris has

00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,320
decided he wanted to find out if these

00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:45,250
Oracle's actually had the goods so he

00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:47,380
did an experiment he found seven people

00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:49,750
that he trusted he sent them to seven

00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:52,360
different Oracle's and he said okay on a

00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:55,660
certain date let's just say July fatigue

00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:59,470
at certain times of 1 p.m. ask the

00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:00,940
Oracle what is ki kosis doing right now

00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:05,440
he didn't tell anybody what he was going

00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:07,180
to be doing but he he said ask him what

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:12,160
was king closest now the interesting

00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:14,350
thing is that the Auckland Fe got a ride

00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,860
she said if this very moment he's making

00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:17,690
his favorites to go

00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:21,170
to the steel which is in fact what

00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:22,580
Christmas was doing and this this which

00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:25,070
is enormous amount of failure brought

00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:27,080
about for the oracle of delphi-- and all

00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:28,700
of this essentially you would call it

00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,400
venture capital came pouring in all

00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:33,890
these donations came in to promote it

00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:37,220
now unfortunately this early search

00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:40,790
engine is horrible Delphie had on few

00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:43,040
problems the first was that you can only

00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:45,290
going to go the opals any day during

00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:47,090
spring and summer so I just by iris

00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:49,610
standard if you could say it had uptime

00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:51,679
difficulties the second thing is that

00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:54,049
you had to undergo some like great quest

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,480
to get there and the billiard in

00:25:54,049 --> 00:25:58,160
actually most damning thing is the

00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,140
orders answers were often quite cryptic

00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,210
so if you would ask you Oracle how do I

00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:03,710
treat a barn you know if I might say if

00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:06,440
you treat a Bernie was going to think

00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:08,840
like fire or something like that this is

00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:11,330
actually what I'm did closest he went to

00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,160
the Oracle and said should I trust the

00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:14,929
river Halas and engage the Persians in

00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,549
war and she said if you crossed the

00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:18,590
river hannahs a mighty empire will fall

00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:19,850
and it was only after he crossed the

00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:22,880
river Hollis that he realized it was his

00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:27,260
mighty empire that fell now flash

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:30,830
forward to the future for a moment in

00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:32,750
historic universe they've been made in

00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:34,850
article that was the computer on the

00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:38,660
enterprise if you can ask at these

00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:39,860
questions he would say things like let's

00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:42,559
appease his planet with dilithium

00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:45,980
crystals and it will tell you the answer

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:47,240
so this is very old dream and it's one

00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:49,280
that we even think about in the future

00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,830
but was very interesting about the

00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,540
Oracle on Star Trek was it you never ask

00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:55,820
it what you should do you would always

00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:57,980
just ask it where is the closest planet

00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:01,429
not should I be there and so what

00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:02,600
happened is our idea of what we're

00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:05,330
looking for in this Oracle kind of

00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:07,760
shifted and and I guess because it had

00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:09,470
to be a little more real it became you

00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:12,320
know like a really good version of

00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:14,360
Google more than than the Oracles of old

00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,950
which actually gave you advice they give

00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:19,820
you wisdom the country what you should

00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:21,470
under the ideal circumstances ship do so

00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:23,840
that brings me back to what i call them

00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:25,190
madam and then it was only problem which

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,190
is the lane I think we're going to solve

00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:30,200
for that has huge implications for us

00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:31,640
because remember if you knew all the

00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,590
information have access to it any

00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,480
question you wanted to ask you could get

00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:36,500
an answer it doesn't really matter if

00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,120
you don't know what question to ask

00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,590
doesn't matter if the answer is in the

00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,929
library somewhere if you can't find it

00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:44,059
so so bear with me here you're in san

00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:45,620
francisco and you know from there and

00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:47,840
you want to know where she'll go for

00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:50,600
Italian food tonight now back in the

00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,980
olden days like the 1980s all you have

00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,140
this data you could look at the yellow

00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:55,070
pages and that's what we used to do and

00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:57,799
it would give you a list of restaurants

00:27:55,070 --> 00:28:00,740
and you had no knowledge in a way to

00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:03,200
make a wise decision then a man came the

00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:04,490
web and you had data past knowledge you

00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,860
can see which restaurants were highest

00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:09,530
rated and well which ones the reviewers

00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:12,320
are I can say you were better off than

00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:14,270
before in the sense that you could make

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,590
a more knowledgeable decision but she

00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:18,530
was still working with biased

00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:20,500
information and it data information it

00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:22,940
ended up a few people nothing like you

00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:25,309
now to attempt to make a wise choice

00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:28,010
today you would take imperfect knowledge

00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:29,659
and you apply your unique value system

00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:31,940
to it you say I'm going to be able to

00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:33,890
taste good to me in a restaurant that

00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:36,409
looks nice that what i consider to be a

00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:38,990
reasonable price but the lid actually

00:28:36,409 --> 00:28:44,330
isn't able to automatically apply your

00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:45,919
unit values to UM to these questions so

00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:48,020
you make the best of it you know you

00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,840
need a few reviews you ask your friends

00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:52,520
you talk to the concierge at the hotel

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:55,070
if I had that I'll turn out kind of

00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:57,140
poorly we are essentially the wrong

00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:58,640
restaurant and I'll Drive you have

00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:02,210
seldom pick what would have been the

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,710
absolute perfect choice for us so I

00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:05,809
think in the future something very much

00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:08,409
like the Amazon suggestion village for

00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:12,799
all of life is going to emerge

00:29:08,409 --> 00:29:15,020
personally consider that all your

00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:17,450
friends people that have actual

00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:19,100
implement intimate relationships but

00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:23,750
basically goes away should

00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:26,390
go and have a thousand food and when it

00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:27,860
will start doing is it again look at all

00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:29,780
the people read Italian food in San

00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:31,280
Francisco to ask questions which one

00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:33,260
drove the furthest to get there which

00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,880
was Joe the fair this repeatedly to get

00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:36,890
there in a look at any restaurant you

00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,510
eat at and it will pay out of the

00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:39,679
ingredient list and it will compare that

00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:41,510
to people who eat at other restaurants

00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:46,660
like that collaborative filtering

00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:48,710
essentially it will look at westroads

00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:50,539
it'll weigh heavily people who

00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:52,610
restaurant three people with Italian si

00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:53,960
rooms it will look at Italian

00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:57,620
restaurants around the country that you

00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:59,150
eat out and look at the size of your

00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:00,770
favorite dining establishments and it's

00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:02,179
going to look at all these factors you

00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:04,130
would need another imagine we're late

00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:06,289
you know like where did you feel when

00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:07,730
the numerous fall or bill of the year

00:30:06,289 --> 00:30:10,370
the buildings were built or how many

00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:11,750
tables are in the hotel or eating in the

00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:13,429
restaurant or any number of other

00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:16,010
factors and it would be able to take

00:30:13,429 --> 00:30:18,020
billions and billions of pieces of data

00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:20,659
and actually come back to you and say

00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:25,070
you should eat Kamal Tomaso's on kearny

00:30:20,659 --> 00:30:27,260
street and this would be an actual

00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:31,039
decision based on your values and based

00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:33,440
on an infinitude of data and then the

00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:35,360
next day it'll maybe it will say did you

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,429
like it and you say man but maybe you

00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,840
would even have to tell it yeah it'll be

00:30:37,429 --> 00:30:40,789
self learning because when you go back

00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,890
to San Francisco if you don't go to that

00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:44,840
place again in a different place it

00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:46,970
infers you didn't like the first one it

00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,740
makes skin all of your emails where you

00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,750
mention canals and other words you used

00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:53,450
around it it can actually the concept

00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:55,520
learning and self optimizing and so

00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:56,900
every time the algorithms used to sift

00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,580
through all this there's life

00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:01,429
experiences what become so sophisticated

00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:03,679
and sale accurate the system will be a

00:31:01,429 --> 00:31:06,679
between an entertaining way to inform

00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:09,500
you and your decisions may of course the

00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:12,799
system can shape the decisions insofar

00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:14,090
as you take its guidance which begs the

00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:16,220
question what people find out advice

00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:17,870
they don't necessarily understand now

00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:19,280
firstly will when adapter says you

00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:22,220
should take this antibiotic and let this

00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:23,900
one you trust their expertise in their

00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,909
medical practice this is of course

00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:27,399
decisions Bay

00:31:24,909 --> 00:31:30,580
the bone the life experiences of

00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:32,109
everybody on the planet anything for

00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:34,179
choosing the right place to eat Italian

00:31:32,109 --> 00:31:36,609
food is a nation of wisdom and King

00:31:34,179 --> 00:31:39,879
Solomon kind of way but I continue this

00:31:36,609 --> 00:31:42,519
only native degree lady in measuring

00:31:39,879 --> 00:31:46,599
matters it convinced that we associate

00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:48,639
with wisdom Michigan College there is an

00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:50,499
inch bigger choice people face in about

00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:52,090
the Italian restaurant search they would

00:31:50,499 --> 00:31:53,919
be approachable for the aggregate life

00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:56,470
experiences of everybody in the planet

00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:58,419
where did they go to college where

00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:00,340
people who are studying with you want

00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:02,710
individual what the relevant saris

00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,940
common even a powerful and penances

00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:06,340
graduation what books are the

00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:07,869
professor's review one of the professors

00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:09,940
at that College voted online that you

00:32:07,869 --> 00:32:11,109
voted as well under people similar to

00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:13,090
you went to that college and an eye on

00:32:11,109 --> 00:32:14,649
antidepressants how many people met

00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:17,229
spouses and had successful marriage is

00:32:14,649 --> 00:32:19,840
going these places this is going to look

00:32:17,229 --> 00:32:21,369
at people I can't express have space the

00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,769
same preferences and make the same

00:32:21,369 --> 00:32:25,529
choices it will look at like living at

00:32:23,769 --> 00:32:28,690
the college and what the outcome was I

00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:30,460
could list a thousand variables that

00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:33,129
might affect your decision but usually

00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:36,369
we can deal with equations that big the

00:32:33,129 --> 00:32:38,759
computer can sign for it in an instant

00:32:36,369 --> 00:32:41,499
the computer is going to be able to

00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:45,580
attend to a jehovahs data and actually

00:32:41,499 --> 00:32:47,470
advises and made it knowing the right

00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:50,019
thing to do the right thing to do

00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:53,979
doesn't mean we will do it but people

00:32:50,019 --> 00:32:56,049
start smoking every day but but what we

00:32:53,979 --> 00:32:57,909
do know is that the cost of ignorance in

00:32:56,049 --> 00:32:59,830
our case of like one long term equals 80

00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:03,099
million people dead the cost of dignity

00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:07,509
which is in captive lehigh and now it's

00:33:03,099 --> 00:33:10,479
hard to believe that that this future is

00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:11,649
like right around the corner for us it

00:33:10,479 --> 00:33:12,789
is inevitable that we're going to start

00:33:11,649 --> 00:33:14,559
collecting this information we already

00:33:12,789 --> 00:33:16,779
are it's inevitable that will use

00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,340
processing power to data moment it's

00:33:16,779 --> 00:33:20,349
inevitable that will apply that back to

00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:22,840
our own lives and that we would learn

00:33:20,349 --> 00:33:24,879
more and more and more trust it even

00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,989
though we don't understand it you know I

00:33:24,879 --> 00:33:28,840
think maybe we've all had that

00:33:25,989 --> 00:33:30,609
experience of being an Amazon and buying

00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,799
something and suggest some product I

00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:34,400
bought a book and the thing that

00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,230
suggested I buy with

00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,520
robot salt and pepper shakers so to pass

00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:39,380
him you wind them up and they walk

00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:41,840
across the table I was like yeah I don't

00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:44,270
those and I wasn't looking at anything

00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,580
about robots or anything it's a imagine

00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:49,220
that on a universal scale and it can

00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:51,320
never be a world where everyone will

00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:53,930
essentially be wiser than anyone who has

00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,820
ever met that ever lived and nobody is

00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:58,100
good as wise as everybody is about to

00:33:55,820 --> 00:34:00,560
have access to so it's hard to believe

00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:03,110
that this that citrus manor seemingly

00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:05,030
snapping can change the world save

00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:07,610
radically but consider the Industrial

00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:09,380
Revolution you know if somebody had said

00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:10,580
by the way if you take a pass can break

00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,810
it up at the individual components and

00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:13,190
train people on it you can get

00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:14,690
efficiencies and bring prices down and

00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:16,159
make radical that our products the speed

00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:18,649
of innovation and it will change how

00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,419
everything's made everything and you

00:34:18,649 --> 00:34:22,640
know it would be like well let's sort of

00:34:20,419 --> 00:34:26,390
like a big leap to say from from this

00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:27,830
you know process change you'd get not in

00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:32,510
prosperity but that's exactly what

00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:35,120
happened then say I think that this is

00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:36,169
how the world is about to change I think

00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,240
we're going to sound for all these

00:34:36,169 --> 00:34:40,820
vexing problems that are fundamentally

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,440
technological in nature and I think you

00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:44,600
will I tell your children your

00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,940
grandchildren that you hear you were

00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:49,010
here the minute the entire oil change

00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:50,390
you see it's the vanity of any age to

00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:52,429
think they're living at the great

00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:53,870
turning point of civilization having so

00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:56,810
bad we are living at the great turning

00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:58,430
point of civilization and you're going

00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:01,100
to tell tell them if you were there you

00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:03,560
saw it happen and because the world did

00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:05,840
change because it changed radical for

00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,730
the better you can probably claim to

00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,970
have been part of its forming thank you

00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,970
very much

00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,670
