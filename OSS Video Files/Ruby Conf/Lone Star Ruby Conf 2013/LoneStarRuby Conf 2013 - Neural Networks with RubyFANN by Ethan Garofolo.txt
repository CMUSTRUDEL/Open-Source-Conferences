Description: 
	Neural networks (NNs) not only sound really cool, but they can also solve some pretty interesting problems ranging from driving cars to spam detection to facial recognition.

Solving problems with NNs is challenging, because actually implementing a NN from scratch is difficult, and knowing how to apply it is more difficult. Fortunately, libraries, such as RubyFANN, exist to handle the first problem. Solving the second problem comes from experience.

This talk will show a few different approaches to applying NNs to such problems as spam detection and games, as well as discussing other areas where NNs might be a useful solution.
