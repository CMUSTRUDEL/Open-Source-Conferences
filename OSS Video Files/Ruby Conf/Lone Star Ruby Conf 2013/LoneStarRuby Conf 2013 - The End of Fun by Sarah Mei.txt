Title: LoneStarRuby Conf 2013 - The End of Fun by Sarah Mei
Publication date: 2020-01-28
Playlist: Lone Star Ruby Conf 2013
Description: 
	I hate to break it to you, guys, but Ruby is old enough to drink. What started out as a small community full of fun, silliness, and connection has been growing. Our small codebases are now large. Our small companies are now large. And the large companies have finally figured out that they want in, too.

So maybe it's time to start tackling Real Problems and Real Solutions in the world of Real Innovation. Maybe it's time for the community to grow up, stop playing around, and get Seriousâ„¢.

But...that's not who we are. Our community thrives on creativity, play, and luck. And those things aren't just a weird perk like not having to wear shoes in the office -- creativity, play, and luck, when present, actually produce better software. As we grow our projects and our teams and invade the corporate cube farm, there are some things we can lay aside, and there are others we must hold on to as if our very identity depended on them.

Because it does.

good morning i am going to him to be

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,070
here in austin I've never been helpful

00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,169
in star ruby conference before but I've

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,910
heard about it for years and I'm really

00:00:28,169 --> 00:00:32,009
grateful to Lance into nola stove or

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,390
pushing me to get here I am a little bit

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,900
challenge sometimes when it comes to

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:39,330
things like overturning email any kind

00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,760
of organizational thing not my forte so

00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:44,340
I really appreciate that plants pushing

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,680
together here the last time I was in

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:51,000
Austin was when railsconf was here and

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,320
that was in the month of April and the

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,430
weather is a bit different this time of

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,140
year i discovered san francisco this is

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:02,280
what a normal morning in july looks like

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,690
for me so yesterday when it was 93

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,940
degrees out I started thinking maybe

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,210
this is a horrible idea it's a horrible

00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:15,060
idea to come to austin in july but then

00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:18,090
then I found this you guys this stuff is

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,710
amazing this is that is from the spot so

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,390
boring in China Texas if they're

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,359
seasonal summer beer it has grapefruit

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,859
and ginger in it and now that I found

00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:29,219
this I think you might never get rid of

00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:30,479
me anyway so so when I was first

00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:33,060
practicing this talk for some of my

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,929
co-workers a couple of months ago I ran

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,509
through the whole thing all of them

00:01:33,929 --> 00:01:38,159
turned to me and said yeah you are not

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:44,460
wearing enough eyeliner to pull off that

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:46,320
title and I said uh excuse me he said

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,210
well the title is to god this is a

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,240
really fun talk you should be scared of

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,549
people like that right I'm

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,920
this is what is expecting as expecting

00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:57,020
dreariness and black lipstick and

00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,540
gargoyles and fear and loathing and more

00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,399
eyeliner for sure why I later so how

00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:04,580
about that for a while at that you know

00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:05,899
out really do eyeliner so I decided to

00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,360
give my talk of title that describes

00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:11,870
what it actually is about which is work

00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,250
play and code less eyeliner for me more

00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:16,010
accurate description of content for you

00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:18,470
so uh so I'm going to talk about how we

00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,370
think about how we work but before I get

00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,110
into it let me tell you a little about

00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:23,090
Who I am this is me on all of the

00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:25,910
important parts of the internet which is

00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:27,560
basically just twitter and github I'm a

00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:30,080
developer in San Francisco the last

00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,519
three years I was at pivotal labs

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,860
working with clients on their rails

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,590
projects and I'm also the co-founder of

00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,780
railsbridge which is a way off for years

00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:40,069
old which is pretty awesome we try to

00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,440
make our kiddies more welcoming to

00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:45,709
newcomers we've done hundreds of events

00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,420
in places all over the world and we've

00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:49,670
introduced several thousand people to

00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,049
Ruby and rails and we just have on a

00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:54,170
Friday here in Austin which was super

00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:55,609
fun so that's me and my work at piccolo

00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,190
was working with clients as I mentioned

00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:59,390
and most of my clients were

00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,980
organizations that were growing rapidly

00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:03,620
and specifically they were growing

00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:06,079
rapidly by adding developers to their

00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:08,329
team so what I did with them was to help

00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:11,030
them build a product and also help them

00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:12,140
build team and out of those two things

00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,910
the team in the product what i've

00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:18,380
discovered is that building the product

00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:20,510
is way easier grown engineering team the

00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,040
right way is a really really hard

00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:24,230
problem even being a developer not a

00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:27,019
manager but it's a developer on a team

00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:28,609
that is growing quickly is a really hard

00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:29,810
problem so this thought comes out of

00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:31,010
those experiences and some research

00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:35,120
they've done on my own so getting back

00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:37,340
into it and city get started I'm sure

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,500
nobody in this room who has come to a

00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,239
baby conference on a Saturday falls into

00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:45,440
this category but who has fun writing

00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:47,600
Ruby code okay just checking thank you I

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,010
did you talk sometimes at non Ruby

00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,350
conferences and you'd be surprised what

00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:52,700
i get from that one ok so I'm well Ruby

00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,980
I love Ruby I love the language

00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:58,400
beautiful language a few months ago to

00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,670
turn 20 ruby is now 20 years old at the

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,860
not

00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:02,690
jimmy fallon face a few months ago matt

00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:06,200
said that 20 is the legal age of

00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:08,900
adulthood in japan so that means rudy is

00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,120
now a grown up what he didn't mention is

00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:14,450
that 20 is also the legal drinking age

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,739
in japan so small i'm concerned most

00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,980
important fund this milestone is that

00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:20,359
ruby is now old enough to have a beer

00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:23,960
although to declare can't have any of

00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:25,400
mine and so language language itself is

00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,740
awesome what i love about being a memory

00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,830
developer maybe even more than language

00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,990
itself is the community and that's as

00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,810
mentioned this in a bunch of tops of the

00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:38,030
last year Rivia slub events we don't

00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:40,720
talk into each other that's really

00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:42,560
unusual in a technical community and

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,810
personally i just love hanging around

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,790
you guys i'll skip at that out there

00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:50,540
I've never been a developer community

00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:52,460
that was more creative more social had

00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,520
so many other interests besides code or

00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:57,710
so many interesting projects to work on

00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:00,110
but many of this in this room have a

00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:02,570
problem and phonemes like this it looks

00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:05,030
like success ruby has been amazingly

00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:07,610
successful we've gone from a fringe

00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:09,320
language to a almost been mainstream

00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:11,450
language in just a couple of years and

00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:15,740
as a result many of the things that used

00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:18,080
to be small have gotten bigger symptom

00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,580
number one in the last year we started

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,800
seeing conference talks and blog

00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,840
articles even books start to show it

00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,560
around this topic of what happens when

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,270
your rails app grows up which I gave our

00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,860
rails engines we're talking about

00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,210
software architecture we're talking

00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,000
about services we're talking about

00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:38,030
object design and even th age is less

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,530
she hates what he calls / design is is

00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:43,970
engaging on this question because it's

00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:46,640
important right now to a lot of us these

00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:49,370
things aren't important in a small code

00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,900
base and what this tells us is that many

00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:52,820
of us are hitting the same growing pains

00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,990
at the same time a code bases that

00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,249
started out small I've gotten big

00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:58,119
symptom number two anyway

00:05:55,249 --> 00:06:01,269
remember when Twitter was 12 engineers

00:05:58,119 --> 00:06:03,889
Thank You Josh okay few other people

00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:05,809
that was a long time ago you guys that

00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:07,159
was a really long time ago and they're

00:06:05,809 --> 00:06:08,989
not the only one right companies that

00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:12,289
made their money on a ruby product or

00:06:08,989 --> 00:06:15,409
doing Ruby consulting they will make IPO

00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:17,899
they've been acquired and as a result we

00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:21,079
are finding ourselves working in larger

00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:22,999
teams within larger organizations and

00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:24,559
you can see that in the way that we

00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:26,689
discuss things like remote work for

00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:30,469
example small companies have gotten big

00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:32,599
and simply number three really really

00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:36,349
big companies have started getting into

00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:39,079
Ruby I have talked to people from HP

00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:40,879
from IBM from GE and these companies are

00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:44,179
throwing their thousands and thousands

00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:47,989
of Engineers intergrity which is a

00:06:44,179 --> 00:06:49,429
pretty amazing thing and my personal

00:06:47,989 --> 00:06:51,439
level I've had a lot of people tell me

00:06:49,429 --> 00:06:52,729
the same story over the last couple of

00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,129
years and the story is something like

00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:56,359
this their developer they went to work

00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:59,299
for a little company building a product

00:06:56,359 --> 00:07:01,039
in Ruby first it was amazing total

00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:02,659
freedom to set technical direction and

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,969
change it as needed as the business

00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:06,259
figure out what it wanted to be they can

00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:07,369
keep the cold code-based their head and

00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:12,039
then the products start making a little

00:07:07,369 --> 00:07:14,299
money so I had another engineer and

00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:18,079
single decision making power turned into

00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:20,409
community of 2 V 3 let me probably get

00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:23,779
some more money hired some are engineers

00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:25,279
team just kept getting bigger bigger and

00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:27,949
this little company is becoming a big

00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,299
company right the big code base and one

00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:33,379
day they realize they've got so many

00:07:29,299 --> 00:07:36,649
engineers that it's too chaotic and they

00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:38,119
start thinking about splitting teams to

00:07:36,649 --> 00:07:40,459
reduce the overhead of managing as sort

00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:42,259
of many to many relationship and they

00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:44,659
experiment without a process to reduce

00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:46,069
the chaos but everything they add seems

00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:48,679
to irritate people and push them away

00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:49,999
instead of making things better and some

00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:53,299
of them hire are the integers who don't

00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:55,639
write code to manage people and that

00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:56,689
does any well and they're afraid they

00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:57,709
can see it coming they're afraid of

00:07:56,689 --> 00:07:59,089
turning into this they're afraid of

00:07:57,709 --> 00:08:01,339
becoming a place where there's so much

00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:02,809
process but it takes a week to make a

00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:05,520
decision that they would have made in 10

00:08:02,809 --> 00:08:07,259
minutes before where experimentation

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,009
chaos are replaced by research and

00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:13,800
meetings the growth of an organization

00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:16,229
if it's done thoughtlessly can suck all

00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,080
the creativity and inventiveness out of

00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:21,000
developers jobs and when that happens

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,229
the quality of the solutions drops now

00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,229
companies do this for a reason of course

00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:28,349
that's because creativity and

00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:30,389
inventiveness are chaotic forces as a

00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:32,370
team grows you often add development

00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:34,050
process in response to too much chaos

00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:36,779
right if someone accidentally drops the

00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:39,329
production database so you out a process

00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:41,219
for accessing it but you need to be

00:08:39,329 --> 00:08:44,579
really careful because software

00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:46,920
development needs some chaos we are

00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:48,570
solving difficult problems that are

00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,070
important to our society and we need

00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,829
creative thought we need some of this

00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:54,360
chaos now unfortunately much of the

00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:56,630
advice that business schools will give

00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,430
you about growing an engineering team

00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:02,670
leads you down this path of suppressing

00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:04,920
chaos in all of its forms so the

00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:07,079
question that I'm interested in is for

00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,990
organizations that are so small how do

00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:11,040
we keep ourselves from becoming this and

00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:12,510
for organizations that are already

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,820
growing how do we as individual

00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:17,700
developers keep the fun and creativity

00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:20,880
in our jobs as the organizations grow

00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:23,940
around us now as a community we actually

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,190
talked about this a lot not explicitly

00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,050
very often but this conversation is

00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,459
implicit in a lot of the other

00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:31,970
conversations we have here's when it

00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:34,589
happens a lot there'll be a blog post

00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:36,600
nope idea the top hacker news reddit

00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:38,339
rate and I'll say there's two sides is

00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,260
developer you are on one side you were

00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:42,089
on the other if you're an established

00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,880
company person what you like is process

00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:47,459
you're very focused you know what you're

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,990
building we determine your unwavering

00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:50,670
and the other side would say that you

00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,170
have tunnel vision and if you're a

00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,120
startup person you're creative you have

00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:55,950
a lot of ideas you value disruption and

00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,310
the other side would say that you're a

00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:01,800
little immature now these categories can

00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:04,170
have lots of different headers if you're

00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,910
not going to par am confounded y

00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:08,250
combinator which is a Silicon Valley VC

00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,990
firm that backs groups of 20 some things

00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:13,279
in their garages

00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:15,170
your headers at the walls a conference

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:18,950
earlier this year one of the speaker's

00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:21,020
gaiden grams given these headers but no

00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:22,370
matter who's talking about it right it's

00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,839
clear that what they mean is that you as

00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:25,279
an individual developer at any given

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,560
point in your life are in one of these

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,390
categories or you are in the other you

00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,500
may move between them right Paul Graham

00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:33,080
seems to think you do as soon as you

00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,830
have 30 but the assumption here is that

00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:38,300
these are different types of people and

00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:39,770
some folks will go as far as so as to

00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,260
assert that you need both of these types

00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:43,760
of people in your organization in order

00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,410
to balance stability and growth will

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,640
come back to that moment right now I

00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,839
want to bring something into this

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:54,110
conversation that we haven't had before

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:55,430
in that science is so are really one

00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,870
person generalizing from their

00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:59,870
experience right in that can be useful

00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:02,560
but I need to remind you something like

00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:07,640
dad got a PhD in chemistry used to say

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:09,860
and that is that a collection of

00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:12,620
anecdotes does not add up to conclusive

00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:14,450
data so let's look at some data let's

00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:17,180
start with creativity because if you

00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:18,649
look at these lists the generalization

00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:20,360
here is that the state of sight is

00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:21,829
boring and I'm creative and the volatile

00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,110
side is fun and creative and all the

00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:25,520
other judgments all the other properties

00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:27,520
rather flow from those judgments so

00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:30,230
let's look at the science around

00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,820
creativity for a moment in the 70s

00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:33,500
scientists and really fascinating work

00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,300
on the qualities of creative people that

00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,649
took two groups people identified by

00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,770
their peers is creative and people

00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:40,730
identified by the Pierces uncreated and

00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:42,980
they looked for statistically

00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,300
significant differences between the

00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:47,810
groups here are some things that did not

00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:49,190
matter intelligence people of high IQ no

00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:52,790
more likely to be creative for people

00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:54,520
with average IQ age older people no more

00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:57,350
likely to be creatively younger people

00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:59,899
gender men no more likely to be creative

00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:01,190
than women why people no more likely to

00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:03,110
be creative and black people I sure will

00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:05,750
become where there are no statistically

00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:07,339
significant innate differences between

00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,770
people who are creative and people who

00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:13,610
are not creative but what they did find

00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:16,160
we're differences in behavior and

00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:18,410
inhabits now i'll come back to what

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,630
those differences are in a moment but i

00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:21,280
think it might help

00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:24,160
this point to define creativity because

00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,240
we are feeling it for what it is but

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,190
science has been thinking about this for

00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,940
a while that's what they think

00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:30,010
scientists actually distinguish between

00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,420
two modes of thought that human beings

00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,740
engage in in the psychological

00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:35,170
literature these are called closed mode

00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:37,260
and open mode only enclosed bowed you

00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:39,660
are getting specific things done

00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:41,980
psychologists call this being executive

00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:44,500
your goals are very specific you're very

00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,480
focused on them and an open mode you may

00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:49,570
have general goals but what you're doing

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,420
typically isn't very focused you're open

00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:55,240
to new connections it's an open mode

00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:57,270
where creative thought can occur so the

00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,920
first part of being a creative person is

00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:03,910
just knowing how to move between these

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:06,850
loads of thought in a deliberate way now

00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:10,050
at this point you might think these

00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:12,460
lists look a little bit familiar right

00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:14,020
because they don't like those

00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,070
categorizations we've been doing in our

00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,990
community and that we do to ourselves

00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:19,450
right am I a big company person or a

00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:22,390
small company person am i a stable or a

00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:23,800
volatile and it turns out that the

00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:26,740
people who would like to put us in one

00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:29,530
of these categories have hit upon a real

00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:32,800
dichotomy and human thought but these

00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:35,170
aren't different types of people these

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,960
are simply different modes of thought

00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:40,780
and the critical error comes when we say

00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:43,420
that a person an individual is one or is

00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:47,200
the other because we are all both at

00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:48,940
different times and when I realized that

00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,440
it took me a while to understand the

00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,850
implications there a person may be more

00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,560
comfortable in one mode of thought or

00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:56,080
the other but we are all capable of both

00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,250
and we need both and we all go to a

00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:01,450
decent amount of switching between me

00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:02,980
without even realizing it so when people

00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,120
say that you need both of these things

00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,820
to balance against each other they're

00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,200
right that's actually true we need both

00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,400
of these loads of thought in software

00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,660
development each of us needs to be able

00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,920
to do both but a technical leader

00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,690
shouldn't be trying to hire these

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,120
archetypes and then keep them in tension

00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:17,770
with each other a technical leaders goal

00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,320
should be to a lot of people to do both

00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:22,240
of these things at the right times and

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,210
at this point I think it's still fair to

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:28,240
ask what is being creative have to do a

00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:30,220
software development isn't it what we do

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:34,010
computer science

00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:35,540
that's what my degree says my brother

00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:40,190
who's a pharmacist thinks of what I do

00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:41,540
mostly is typing yeah what is what is

00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,880
what is what we didn't have to do an art

00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:46,520
or poetry or music humor or dance right

00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:50,500
those things are creative isn't what we

00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:52,790
do kind of mechanical by comparison I

00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,980
have never been a professional artist

00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:57,050
I'm just a consumer of art and as a

00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:00,110
consumer or when I see is the results I

00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:01,970
see the sculpture I see the dance as far

00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:03,710
as I can tell until recently what I

00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:05,150
thought how this worked so these are

00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:07,550
produced by an artist who goes into a

00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:09,710
cave does a bunch of stuff I don't

00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:11,600
understand and comes out with their work

00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:13,970
of genius turns out is completely wrong

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,490
this lady is an American dancer and

00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:19,820
choreographer named Twyla Tharp she is

00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:21,050
71 years old and at 71 is still

00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,530
considered one of the most creative

00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:25,730
forces in contemporary dance and she

00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:28,790
want a fantastic book called the

00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:30,380
creative habit and the core of it is the

00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,850
process she uses when she's coming up

00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,110
with a new dance and this happens over

00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:35,450
the course of several months first in

00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:37,910
the morning she dances her standard

00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:39,500
routines and for several hours she's

00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:41,090
moving her body and very familiar ways

00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,340
things that she's done for 30 and 40

00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:46,180
years she's executing she's very

00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:48,200
comfortable and then in the afternoon

00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:50,450
she works on coming up with new

00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,670
movements and the movement she does in

00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,980
the morning serves as the raw material

00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:56,420
and gives her a basis that she can even

00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:59,630
factored into something new in the

00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:01,400
afternoon her process moves her

00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:03,710
deliberately between the closed mode in

00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:06,650
the morning in the open mode in the

00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:08,300
afternoon she needs both to come up with

00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:10,790
a new dance because if all she does is

00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:13,100
dance the old moves she'll never come up

00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:14,720
with anything new but if all she does is

00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,640
new donor with new stuff she lacks the

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,570
base from which creative change can be

00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:21,890
made her creativity is a a lightning

00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:23,420
strike out of nowhere elbow that's what

00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:26,270
it looks like when you see her dance is

00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:28,880
up on the stage it's a repeating

00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:30,580
methodical habit that gets her in the

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,840
best situation for inspiration to strike

00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:34,790
and now winds up at the science right

00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:37,350
people who are creative have simply

00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:38,970
developed habits that deliberately

00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:40,890
in between the closed and open modes of

00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,420
thought and its movement between them is

00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:43,290
key because each one fees the other let

00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,270
me show you what this looks like when

00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:49,230
you're writing code hopefully this

00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:50,760
should look familiar people do this yes

00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:52,650
it's not the first time you said hey

00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,390
good so first you are a failing test

00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:56,310
then you write the code that makes it

00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:57,930
pass then you refactor the code to try

00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:59,760
and make it better now in practice of

00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:01,140
course is more like this right you

00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,460
started the red green red green you get

00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,160
some stand a little portion of the

00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:06,420
future done and then you go and refactor

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,460
just to give you a concrete example just

00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,720
in case you've never seen this before

00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:12,900
think about adding a method to a rails

00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,400
model you're the mall for bus and union

00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,530
method that tells you how many ipads are

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,110
on the bus so you write a mall respect

00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:21,660
that fails then you write the method

00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:23,700
into the novel class models that goes

00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,680
green and then you realize story or

00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:28,560
working on actually asks registered

00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:31,050
ipads okay so you add another line to

00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,400
the specs that goes right again then

00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,890
implement it in the model everything

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:39,210
screen me sit back and you look at it

00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:40,620
for a moment and yeah kind of realize

00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:43,320
maybe this stuff doesn't belong in the

00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:45,060
model exactly at this point you have

00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,410
thousands of options for what you could

00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:48,110
do with this code you could leave it

00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:50,490
where it is tests are green it's working

00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,990
you could extract it into a class you

00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:53,460
could extract parts of it leave parts of

00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,590
it in the model you could reimagine your

00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:57,000
domain model you could we learnt the

00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:59,010
whole thing in your look sir you've got

00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,270
lots of options

00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:03,040
and at this point you've done into the

00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:04,270
refactoring face so let's talk a little

00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,310
bit about what's different trees two

00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:09,550
phases of the cycle okay first the woods

00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:10,960
we say change I suppose if your parents

00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:13,960
what you say out loud if you're soloing

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,790
that this is your inner monologue but

00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,720
you know where you don't be discussing

00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,800
so the nuts and bolts of the

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,030
functionality like oh I think we're

00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,950
missing and ended up in there I'm a bet

00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:22,510
contacts doesn't need to be there and we

00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,860
start discussing larger concerns this

00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:26,740
method started out with a name that made

00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:28,690
sense it now it's not quite right maybe

00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,950
we could move it over there the second

00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,600
thing that changes is the keys that we

00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:33,850
press on the keyboard right you go from

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,170
entering code entering logic putting in

00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:37,330
our itches and orange x and a change

00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:41,110
like moving code around between files

00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:44,080
between classes and the third thing that

00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:45,310
changes is our physical posture when

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,480
you're doing a red green red green your

00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,830
hands are on the keyboard you getting

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,860
close to the screen you're looking at

00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:53,020
the code well here we thought a you lean

00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,820
back a little bit you take your hands

00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,290
off the keyboard you look at the code

00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,970
without changing it fundamentally what's

00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:59,590
happening of course is it in these two

00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:05,830
modes you are thinking differently in

00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:07,450
different ways about the code red green

00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:08,830
red green you're already in close mode

00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:10,120
you're getting stuff done you go into a

00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:13,060
factoring and you're operating in the

00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,470
open mode just like 12 effects process

00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,060
is a structured way for her to spend

00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:17,710
some time in open mode and some time in

00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,240
close node-red being refactor is a

00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:20,590
structured way of moving us between the

00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,290
closed and open modes when were writing

00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:25,030
code it's a habit that we have that

00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:27,010
gives us room to think creatively every

00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:29,020
time we write code as long as you

00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:31,840
haven't talked about of this puzzle and

00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:34,900
that is when you're in the open mode and

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:37,390
everything is possible how do you

00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:39,670
proceed how did the process has given

00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:43,060
you this creative space how do you get

00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:44,620
that lightning to strike add that is

00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,660
often the matter of being able to shift

00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:48,130
your context inappropriate way right to

00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,260
consider the code you just wrote in a

00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:51,550
larger context this shift is the germ of

00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:54,460
creativity no matter what type of

00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:56,110
creativity we're talking about painting

00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,730
and comedy and poetry and all these

00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,350
creative

00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,970
in their power by showing the viewer

00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:02,640
context they hadn't seen before let me

00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:04,799
give you another example here everyone

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,750
loves a good light bulb joke right how

00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:10,110
many folks ears does it take to change a

00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:11,760
lightbulb answer 51 to change the bulb

00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:16,470
and Florida sing about how much better

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:18,179
the old one was how many a notice does

00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:20,130
it take to change a light bulb to answer

00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:25,740
none because everyone knows they never

00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:30,059
change anything if i take the cheap shot

00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:31,500
that was with how many airfoils

00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:33,630
developers does it take to change a

00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:38,460
lightbulb answer we're not going to

00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:40,380
change it we think it works if the so

00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,490
it's a shift of context between a setup

00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,799
and the punch line that makes jokes

00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:45,120
funny so once you get into creative mode

00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:46,440
that's step one but if you want to be

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,230
able to come up with these flashes of

00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,610
insights you want to write the jokes you

00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:53,549
need to be able to make that context

00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:56,340
which once you're there if I remains

00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:57,929
been consulted which I'm not I'd call it

00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:00,120
thinking outside the box then you have

00:20:57,929 --> 00:21:02,070
to shoot me I think but it's really just

00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,990
contact shifty allows you to see a

00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:05,100
brilliant and unintuitive situation the

00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,570
problem at hand now I'll state the

00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,880
obvious he say that different developers

00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:12,059
have different levels of skill with this

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,320
type of thinking I've been paired

00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:15,299
programming full-time for more than

00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,220
three years this point I counted it up

00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:20,700
I've paired with about 150 different

00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:21,720
people and some of them who were saying

00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:24,660
here together and we're looking at a

00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:27,000
refactoring they always seem to come up

00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,710
with a pretty decent solution it feels a

00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,059
lot like luck sometimes and this year

00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,650
it's a big project there's lots of code

00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:34,440
no one person knows all of it but the

00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:35,880
lucky people always seem to have just

00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,990
been looking at some code in two

00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,090
completely different part of the

00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:41,520
projects they had a pattern that might

00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:42,990
work here if we change something so I

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,230
was thinking about that I never lost

00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:47,400
another piece of interesting science

00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:48,750
that looked at what's different between

00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,429
people who consider themselves to be

00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:54,150
lucky and people who consider themselves

00:21:50,429 --> 00:21:55,559
to be unlucky and the first thing I

00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:58,580
looked at is whether people who think

00:21:55,559 --> 00:22:01,140
they are lucky are in fact luckier and

00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:02,509
the way they did that was by giving each

00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,699
of these people a sec

00:22:02,509 --> 00:22:05,509
of the newspaper and they said okay look

00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:07,820
through the section of the newspaper

00:22:05,509 --> 00:22:09,139
figure out how many photographs are in

00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:11,719
this section and then come back to the

00:22:09,139 --> 00:22:13,399
researcher with your answer and on the

00:22:11,719 --> 00:22:15,229
second page of the section of the

00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:17,089
newspaper was a half page advertisement

00:22:15,229 --> 00:22:19,820
with no photographs the very large text

00:22:17,089 --> 00:22:21,409
that said stop there are 16 pictures in

00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:23,839
this section of the newspaper please go

00:22:21,409 --> 00:22:25,279
tell the researcher and what they

00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:28,219
discovered was that people who think

00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:31,070
they are lucky were much more likely to

00:22:28,219 --> 00:22:32,629
see that and save themselves the tedium

00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:34,909
of actually going through accounting the

00:22:32,629 --> 00:22:39,259
photographs then the people who thought

00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:40,549
they were unlucky and so then having

00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:43,309
established that there are differences

00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:44,719
in luck for whatever that's worth the

00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:46,369
study then tried to find differences in

00:22:44,719 --> 00:22:48,559
the people that explained this

00:22:46,369 --> 00:22:51,049
phenomenon and just let the signs and

00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:53,179
creativity turns out that there are no

00:22:51,049 --> 00:22:55,190
intrinsic differences between these two

00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:58,069
groups of people but there are

00:22:55,190 --> 00:23:01,579
differences in behavior and that means

00:22:58,069 --> 00:23:04,159
that just like creativity law is a skill

00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:06,699
that you can practice and get better at

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:10,309
it turns out that people who are lucky

00:23:06,699 --> 00:23:12,169
deliberately seek novelty in all parts

00:23:10,309 --> 00:23:13,579
of their lives so giving a choice of two

00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:15,919
paths so off they will pick the one they

00:23:13,579 --> 00:23:17,509
haven't got down before presented with a

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,389
menu they will pick a dish that haven't

00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:22,219
eaten before now these are little things

00:23:19,389 --> 00:23:23,809
but the theory here is that by

00:23:22,219 --> 00:23:24,979
deliberately exposing themselves to

00:23:23,809 --> 00:23:26,929
things that are outside of their

00:23:24,979 --> 00:23:28,459
immediate comfort zone they are changing

00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:30,979
the mode in which their brain works and

00:23:28,459 --> 00:23:32,269
because more open and that means they

00:23:30,979 --> 00:23:35,719
notice things that they wouldn't

00:23:32,269 --> 00:23:37,639
normally notice and the end result is

00:23:35,719 --> 00:23:40,129
that they are more able to see contact

00:23:37,639 --> 00:23:42,829
ships and that makes them more creative

00:23:40,129 --> 00:23:44,599
more unusual effective problem solvers

00:23:42,829 --> 00:23:46,009
they're setting themselves up for that

00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:48,619
lightning strike so you can practice

00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:52,999
being creative you can practice being

00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:54,619
lucky and that sets you have to take

00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:56,629
best advantage of both of these modes of

00:23:54,619 --> 00:23:58,789
thought because we want all of these

00:23:56,629 --> 00:24:00,529
things even the tunnel vision the

00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:01,999
immaturity we have these really hard

00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:03,819
problems that we need to solve and we

00:24:01,999 --> 00:24:08,779
want the whole richness of human thought

00:24:03,819 --> 00:24:11,779
brought to bear on these problems and so

00:24:08,779 --> 00:24:14,119
you might think well okay

00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:16,669
it has red green refactor exactly gonna

00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:18,049
get me all the way there well it turns

00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:19,369
out there are other ways that you can

00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:22,190
introduce creative space into your

00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:23,929
projects besides that the development

00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:25,219
passes at pivotal labs so I did the last

00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:27,440
three years has a lot in common with

00:24:25,219 --> 00:24:29,629
extreme programming so I super-cold a

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,009
how it works is that developers pair up

00:24:29,629 --> 00:24:32,599
to take whatever stories on the top of

00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:35,149
the backlog whatever it is and they work

00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:37,399
on it they didn't factor cycle they

00:24:35,149 --> 00:24:39,169
finish it a little bit then they go back

00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:40,759
to the backlog and they pick the next

00:24:39,169 --> 00:24:43,609
story that's at the top and they start

00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:46,489
working on that I call this the story

00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:48,679
mill because can you do this process you

00:24:46,489 --> 00:24:51,919
just turned three stories and it feels

00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:54,619
amazing it feels absolutely fantastic to

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,059
get so much stuff done you do this eight

00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:57,830
hours a day and you get a lot of stuff

00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:58,969
done but once a week in this process we

00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:01,039
do something slightly different we do it

00:24:58,969 --> 00:25:02,989
when a retrospective this is a meeting

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:05,539
there's our chance to consider how our

00:25:02,989 --> 00:25:09,200
process is working and how we'd like to

00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:10,639
change it sort of meta level right it's

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,889
process that's considering the process

00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:14,450
itself and I could not do this process

00:25:12,889 --> 00:25:17,119
let alone do it continuously for three

00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:18,710
years without those retrospectives

00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:22,789
because the story mill is closed voted

00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:24,950
it is really really closed and wretches

00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:27,889
are the open mode that balances that out

00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:30,889
because no process ever works the same

00:25:27,889 --> 00:25:32,389
for two different organizations but it's

00:25:30,889 --> 00:25:33,679
usually not obvious here when you're in

00:25:32,389 --> 00:25:35,659
the thick of it what exactly needs to be

00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,849
changed so doing is represents a week is

00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:40,999
a structured way to introduce creative

00:25:37,849 --> 00:25:42,649
thinking into our process just like the

00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:44,089
refactor stage is a structured way to

00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:47,419
introduce creative thinking into our

00:25:44,089 --> 00:25:49,669
coding because process when it's done

00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:51,710
right is what enables us to be creative

00:25:49,669 --> 00:25:53,450
and being creative is what enables us to

00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:56,629
build great software the process should

00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:59,749
give us that space it teaches us the

00:25:56,629 --> 00:26:02,179
habits of creative people and if that's

00:25:59,749 --> 00:26:03,940
not where it feels like should think

00:26:02,179 --> 00:26:05,779
about refactoring it in that direction

00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:08,149
because if you're out of competing

00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:09,760
that's growing or is already big and you

00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:11,500
stop needing to add more structure

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,900
she development process there are

00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,950
thousand ways to do it and the right

00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,170
thing to do for your organization

00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:18,370
depends on your people your market your

00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:20,800
financial structure but the one

00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:22,750
fundamental thing that's important to

00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,670
make sure the process you add is

00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:27,190
enabling rather than squashing

00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:29,020
creativity make sure what you're adding

00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:30,700
isn't squeezing all the fun out of your

00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:33,070
development because it's that fun and

00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:35,770
that play that makes it possible for us

00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:37,270
to write great software and finally as

00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:38,980
developers it's our job to set ourselves

00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:41,590
up so that the lightning can strike when

00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:43,180
it needs to right what that means is you

00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:44,590
need to introduce enough novelty into

00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:46,650
your life to take advantage of the

00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:48,610
creative time that the process gives you

00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:49,810
need to go to art school or anything

00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:51,730
like that here's something you can do

00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:54,760
when you're looking to make you more

00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:56,740
open first is look at parts of your code

00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:58,750
base beyond what's just immediately in

00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:00,640
front of you if you see a method being

00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:02,290
used you don't know where it's a blended

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,000
go look it's going through parts of the

00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:05,200
code you haven't seen in a while fill

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,770
your mind with the raw material for

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:11,380
creative thought similarly talk to

00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:13,810
people who aren't programmers go to

00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:15,670
lunch with some sales people try and

00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:18,390
figure out you know get get outside of

00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:20,500
your little bubble of developer land

00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:22,120
second trying to bury what you do as

00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,730
much as possible switch projects every

00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,930
couple of months if you can if you can't

00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:27,280
sense the time writing JavaScript if

00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:28,840
you're a back-end developer or do some

00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:31,540
co optimization if your front-end

00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:33,430
developer the rule here is that when you

00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:38,410
start feeling comfortable it's time to

00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:40,000
move on and similar is that very what

00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:41,110
you do during the day don't spend eight

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,390
hours a day sitting in front of your

00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:49,120
keyboard get up get outside at lunch

00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:50,440
take breaks walk around the block doing

00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,510
something different things during your

00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,920
day helps you get into the mode where

00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:55,800
you can actually be more productive when

00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:59,200
you're sitting in front of the computer

00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:00,640
and finally seek out teams that have

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,930
people that don't look like you know

00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,220
this is an interesting hack there's been

00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:05,020
some research that tells us that if you

00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:07,390
have to problem solving teams and what

00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:09,640
they do requires creative thought and

00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:11,730
won t is better qualified on paper but

00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:13,200
they all look the same in a team

00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,340
is less qualified on paper but the

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,900
members have some kind of visual

00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:17,370
difference between them which means

00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,260
things like height and race and gender

00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:21,270
and ability and things like that the

00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:24,840
material is less qualified on paper will

00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:27,570
consistently do better and the reason

00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,190
for that is the same as the reason as

00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:31,170
same as a science behind creativity and

00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:33,570
luck and that is by deliberately putting

00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:34,980
yourself into a place where you are not

00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:37,470
as comfortable with the interaction

00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:39,270
modes between you you are putting your

00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:41,280
brain into a place where it is more open

00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:47,940
and would be better able to come up with

00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:49,590
creative solutions and finally find ways

00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:52,410
to keep the creativity and fun in your

00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:54,480
job because we won't solve these

00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:56,310
important problems about it I remember I

00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,830
had a client once was fairly new to the

00:28:56,310 --> 00:29:02,040
process and we had a story come up to

00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:03,720
the top of the backlog and it was really

00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,310
important that we got something done by

00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:08,820
the end of the day for him to show his

00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:10,440
manager and it was a fun problem we were

00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,930
setting up the basics of an API for a

00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,870
mobile app and he really needs to be

00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:18,540
done we really needed to get it right

00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:19,860
and so far developers picked it up and

00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,390
they worked on it for an hour so and

00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:23,940
then they got up and they went over to

00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:26,250
go play ping pong and I was in the

00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:28,770
kitchen at the time and client came over

00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:30,270
looking very worried he looked at me he

00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:33,030
looked at the guys playing ping-pong he

00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:35,700
said you know this is a really important

00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:37,410
story it's really important that we have

00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:41,070
enough time to get this done right by

00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:44,460
the end of the day and I said yep that

00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:47,930
is why they are playing ping pong and

00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:47,930
