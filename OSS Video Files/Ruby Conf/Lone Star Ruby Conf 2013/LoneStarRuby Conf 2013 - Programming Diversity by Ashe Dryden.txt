Title: LoneStarRuby Conf 2013 - Programming Diversity by Ashe Dryden
Publication date: 2020-01-28
Playlist: Lone Star Ruby Conf 2013
Description: 
	It's been scientifically proven that more diverse communities and workplaces create better products and the solutions to difficult problems are more complete and diverse themselves. Companies are struggling to find adequate talent. So why do we see so few women, people of color, and LGBTQ people at our events and on the about pages of our websites? Even more curiously, why do 60% of women leave the tech industry within 10 years? Why are fewer women choosing to pursue computer science and related degrees than ever before? Why have stories of active discouragement, dismissal, harassment, or worse become regular news?

In this talk we'll examine the causes behind the lack of diversity in our communities, events, and workplaces. We'll discuss what we can do as community members, event organizers, and co-workers to not only combat this problem, but to encourage positive change by contributing to an atmosphere of inclusivity.

Objectives:

Educate about the lack of diversity and why it is a problem
Examine what is contributing to both the pipeline issue as well as attrition
Isolate what is and isn't working
Inspire direct action by examining our own behavior and learning more about the people around us so we can empathize better

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,309
railsbridge rails girls girl develop it

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,670
black rose code related programs like

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:46,949
that if you teach programming or if you

00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,680
are a mentor or if you in any way help

00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:51,600
someone new get into programming or into

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,250
Ruby or rails please stand up well raise

00:00:51,600 --> 00:01:03,540
your hand can you give these guys a

00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:05,850
round of applause please thank you say

00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,229
I'm talking today about diversity in

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,180
tech it's something that is really

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:11,430
important to me in something that I've

00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,430
been very lucky to be able to talk to a

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,439
lot of people about lately so like I

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,850
said my name is Ashton I'm Astrid and

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:19,920
pretty much everyone on the internet a

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,480
lot of the information that's in my

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,860
slides I also tweet about on a regular

00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,630
basis so if you're interested in

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,960
learning more you can check out my

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,910
website or my Twitter stream so just to

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,920
set a baseline I want to talk about web

00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:34,110
diversity actually is a lot of times

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,000
when we have this conversation it's kind

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,740
of code for where are all the women and

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,170
it's important to remember that

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,240
diversity is more than gender it's

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,659
actually more than just the binary of

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,090
male and female its people compromising

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:50,010
various backgrounds experiences and

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,510
lifestyles so it's a lot more than

00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:53,580
Jenner it's a lot more than what we've

00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,810
been talking about lately the other

00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,340
thing to note is that it's not always

00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,960
visible there are a lot of things that

00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,020
are diverse about a person you can't see

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,640
from the outside there are a lot of

00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,890
disabilities physical and mental health

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,630
aren't always visible your economic

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,000
class which really impacts a lot of

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:11,879
people who are in programming and

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,970
education so put some pretty little

00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:17,400
bubbles so this is a selection of some

00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,870
of the ones that are larger groups that

00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,430
we talked about on a regular basis and

00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,170
just so you can kind of set a baseline

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,300
so we can have this conversation and

00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,820
kind of know

00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:28,100
I each other's language i'm going to set

00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:30,410
some vocabulary terms the first one is

00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,060
intersectionality this is a big word and

00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,740
if you need me for any amount of time

00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,110
you've probably heard me spell this word

00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,760
quite a few times intersectionality is

00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:40,790
basically all of these traits about a

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,740
person and how they interact and what

00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:44,660
how society treats them for the way that

00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,010
those things interact so we're looking

00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:48,560
at those pretty little bubbles before

00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:51,230
the way that those things overlap kind

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,720
of like a pancake if that kind of is

00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:56,300
what society decides your experience in

00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,400
life is going to be so for instance if

00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,350
we look at in the United States women

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,300
earn 80 point nine percent of what men

00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:04,700
do that's a pretty big difference and

00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,410
that's better than it has been actually

00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,870
in the past four years that number has

00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:10,970
actually gone down unfortunately but

00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:13,370
this is for controlling for all the

00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:16,610
factors including education timing it in

00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:18,350
and away from the industry and so that's

00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:20,840
terrible and it makes me really sad

00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:22,460
especially as a woman but with

00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,040
intersectionality employ when you look

00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:28,489
at let's hina women they make 59.3

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,010
percent of what white men make that is a

00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:33,440
huge difference so just those two traits

00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:36,800
and play being female and being a woman

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:40,430
of color makes you earn almost half as

00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:42,170
much as a white man big deal in the

00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:44,720
united states depending on who you trust

00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:47,060
for these statistics and the employment

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:51,200
rate is about 7.5 percent for the blind

00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:54,380
community it's ten times that huge huge

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,880
difference so privileged is the next

00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,440
term that we're gonna cover really quick

00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,450
and quickly just basically an on an

00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,489
advantage you get for just being blonde

00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:03,890
the person that you are or having the

00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:05,690
traits that you do so for instance I

00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:08,000
have a lot of privileges I'm very

00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:09,410
privileged in a lot of different ways

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,820
including the fact that I'm white that's

00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:14,540
probably the biggest one in the United

00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:16,489
States I appear to be straight i speak

00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:20,330
english as a first language I'm middle

00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:22,460
class I'm able so there's a lot of

00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:24,860
things that you can see about me that

00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:26,300
gives me a lot of privilege having

00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,640
privilege doesn't necessarily make you a

00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,560
bad person it just means that because we

00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,650
get these extra things from society just

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,240
for being this person we have to keep in

00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:37,280
mind what those things

00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,410
and because we get them who is not

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,789
receiving them so I was talking to

00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,750
somebody earlier this weekend I was

00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:42,970
talking about if we have a hundred

00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,400
dollars in the middle of a table

00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:49,430
privileges I get 95 of those and you get

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,410
five so specifically because of who I

00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:53,180
happen to be I will get more and that

00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:56,210
means that you are getting less so

00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:58,069
there's this huge inequality so some of

00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,509
the things that you get just for being

00:04:58,069 --> 00:05:02,030
privileged include things like better

00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:03,680
education access to technology at an

00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,660
early age which is really important in

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,360
our field specifically getting paid

00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,460
higher being assumed to be competent

00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,960
that is a really big deal when you're

00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,940
looking at when people go to interview

00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,840
for jobs that is really big deal when

00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,580
you're talking about going to

00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,740
conferences and people will ask you what

00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:22,190
you do and as a woman will assume that

00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:25,430
I'm not a programmer a quality of social

00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:27,949
and professional network the one of the

00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:29,990
greatest indicators for a child going

00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:31,460
into a stem field which is science

00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,190
technology engineering and math which

00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:36,800
are usually lumped together is whether

00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:39,710
or not the child's father was also in

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,860
STEM fields because that father has

00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:46,759
access to a network that allows them to

00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:49,009
get into good schools allows them to go

00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:50,930
to libraries to have a computer in their

00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:53,389
home to talk about things that are

00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:56,419
important when it comes to things in

00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:58,639
stem you also seen as a skill set

00:05:56,419 --> 00:06:00,440
instead of traits so this could be

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,719
something like identifying as a geek

00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:06,169
versus somebody identifying me as a girl

00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:08,300
geek we automatically assume that the

00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:11,120
word geek and this is just a lot of what

00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,190
we do at a society in general we have

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,069
these stereotypes in mind so we assume

00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:18,800
geek means white male generally youngish

00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:20,870
and and then the next one is being able

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:25,069
to easily fit into or identify with the

00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:27,409
subculture so being able to being able

00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:29,810
to go into a culture and say we have a

00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:31,699
geek culture here which generally tends

00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:34,130
to mean what we play video games you

00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:36,830
like board games we like to stay up late

00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:37,639
coding in dark rooms and you really

00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,680
probably drink

00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:41,240
caffeine and a lot of people don't

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,349
necessarily identify with that it makes

00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:47,539
them feel different on the outside so

00:06:45,349 --> 00:06:50,060
the next vocab time is stereotype threat

00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:53,270
and we learned earlier that stereotypes

00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:55,819
from Sandy wherever she is you call back

00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:58,819
to Sandy awesome so a stereotype threat

00:06:55,819 --> 00:07:00,520
is there if there exists a negative

00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:04,099
stereotype about a group of people and

00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:05,389
there is a threat that a concern from

00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:08,210
that person that they might actually

00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:10,599
meet that threat so I'm sure that most

00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:13,310
people have seen this comic before and

00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:14,750
so and i'm going to describe what the

00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,650
slides are and i'm usually going to read

00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,750
the slides because there are a lot of

00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,189
people that aren't necessarily visually

00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,229
impaired that won't not otherwise be

00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:24,889
able to get the context so the left-hand

00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:26,960
side you have two men at a whiteboard

00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:28,969
doing math and one man says the other

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,409
while you suck at math and on the other

00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:31,849
side you have a man in a woman and the

00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:36,310
woman is doing math and the man says so

00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:39,080
my girls suck at math it's actually

00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:42,529
those are actually shown that if u prime

00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:44,870
women specifically going into a math

00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:47,300
test saying you know women 10 minute to

00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:50,360
do is well on math do you know that they

00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:52,580
will do less well if you don't prime

00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,460
them they'll do just as well or better

00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:57,969
than their male counterparts so this is

00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:00,469
something that they can't necessarily

00:07:57,969 --> 00:08:02,810
affect for themselves it's something

00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:05,120
that society has decided for them and

00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:07,759
puts on them and set extra stress of not

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,979
being able to perform or basically being

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,479
judged and having all of the summit all

00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:14,599
the people in their group also being

00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:17,300
judged in the same way so the last vocab

00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:21,259
term is I don't remember which of these

00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:24,649
waters is mine so sharing germs with

00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:26,899
someone yeah so the last man is imposter

00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:29,180
syndrome and this is actually something

00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:31,520
that affects everybody this is being

00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,680
unable to internalize your

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,630
accomplishments so you might hear

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,190
somebody say I'm not good enough to

00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:40,010
speak at a conference or I'm not good

00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:42,019
enough to apply at github I don't know

00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,279
enough and they might be a brilliant

00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:44,230
program on who's worked in the industry

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,330
for a long time

00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:48,040
really brilliant things to say but they

00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:49,420
just can't and other people might also

00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,600
say that to them but they just can't

00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:54,100
make themselves feel that inside this is

00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,330
especially pronounced when we're talking

00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,640
about people who have negative

00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:59,110
stereotypes that exist about them and it

00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,540
makes them less likely to apply for

00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:04,150
certain jobs especially in groups where

00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:05,890
competency has to be proven it also

00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:07,990
makes them less likely to submit talks

00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:10,180
to conferences and less likely to even

00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:12,910
attend a conference because these people

00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:14,140
are not like me I'm gonna go there and

00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:16,330
I'm not going to understand anything

00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,410
that they're talking about somebody is

00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,110
going to point out that I don't belong

00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,890
there it's a really scary feeling

00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:23,880
actually allowed to you there is one

00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:25,780
more vocab term idolized so

00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,060
mechanization if you think about the

00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:29,620
margins on a paper on a college roll

00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:32,080
paper you have that pink line and

00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:34,240
outside of there's a very skinny narrow

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,320
area where you can write things it's

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,410
kind of the same thing then we're

00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,540
talking about the area of people so

00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:42,580
marginalization is basically taking

00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:44,140
somebody and pushing them to the side

00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,630
and ignoring the things that they need

00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:49,230
or they desire just because they're

00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:51,280
outside of the default or the normal and

00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,960
society teaches us to do this with

00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:55,240
everyone within marginalized groups and

00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,430
I know many of you are probably thinking

00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:00,040
things like this right now I'm different

00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:06,220
I'm logical and want to share germs

00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:08,200
thank you the best so you might be

00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:10,900
thinking things like I'm different I'm

00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:13,270
logical and rational I don't see gender

00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,950
or race please don't raise your hands

00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:17,470
but think about a time where you may

00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:19,060
have said this i know that in a past

00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:22,360
life i have personally said these things

00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:23,950
and and it's interesting because the

00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,480
people really filled up in our society

00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:27,760
as being the most logical in the most

00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,590
rational people like scientists and

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,080
professors at universities that study

00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:33,550
stem and teach them actually also do

00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,140
this to each other there's this

00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:37,240
experiment that was done at either Yale

00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:40,300
or Harvard I can't remember where they

00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:43,360
gave two resumes to two different sets

00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:45,580
of people and they said let us know who

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,960
would rather hire the resumes they

00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,600
didn't tell the groups were exactly the

00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,640
same the only difference was the name

00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,100
and they said I'm scared when 27 tennis

00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,500
who

00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:56,029
never work with i administered and that

00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,319
she would pay the person and give us

00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:59,690
some adjectives about how you would

00:10:57,319 --> 00:11:01,730
describe you to these people so when

00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:03,319
resume is John the other one is Jennifer

00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:05,630
again exact same way as may be the only

00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:08,720
difference is the name the group's came

00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:10,009
back and John was given a 44 on the

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,300
scale of one to seven or whether they

00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:17,180
would like to work with this person and

00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:20,000
Jennifer again exact same resume 3.3 so

00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:22,160
exactly the same resume the essay asked

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,569
how much would you like to pay each of

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,620
these people Jennifer was paid

00:11:23,569 --> 00:11:29,230
eighty-seven percent less now something

00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,519
that I left out of this story is that

00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:34,610
modulus people do this to each other too

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,889
so those two groups that they asked to

00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,630
look at these resumes will mix gender

00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:40,699
groups so they have women in these

00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:43,310
groups they are making the exact same

00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:46,279
assumptions and paying women exactly

00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:49,250
less and rating them exactly less than

00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:53,269
their male counterparts it's kind of

00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:56,420
insidious right makes me sad so so how

00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:58,850
do verse is the industry here is a

00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,350
pretty recent graph and you can take a

00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,990
look at some of these bars are a little

00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:05,029
bit off so if you take a look at the

00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:06,740
green or the blue bar up on the top

00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:10,519
versus the black boy the blackboard

00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:12,470
being the u.s. population women are in

00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:15,050
the industry at about half of what they

00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:16,850
are in the general population what's

00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:18,470
really annoying is the Hispanic

00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:20,810
population which represents about

00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:24,500
one-third of who is actually in the

00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:25,819
country so those are actually a Hispanic

00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,829
and black communities are actually the

00:12:25,819 --> 00:12:34,189
most underrepresented communities in

00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:35,839
tech all right so let's take a look at

00:12:34,189 --> 00:12:38,360
something very specific and one of these

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,220
examples unfortunately are specifically

00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,300
related to gender specifically related

00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,920
to women because that's where a lot of

00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,810
the funding for this research comes from

00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,819
but this isn't only a problem when it

00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:48,230
comes to women so they make up about

00:12:46,819 --> 00:12:50,959
twenty four percent of the industry as I

00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:53,720
had noted before that only three percent

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,980
of open source contributions so think

00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,720
about what this means when we have

00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:59,689
companies that are requiring open source

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,430
contributions to even apply does that

00:12:59,689 --> 00:13:04,680
person basically even exist in the end

00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:06,660
field that you're looking for them in if

00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:09,420
you're also requiring that they have a

00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,920
computer science degree considering that

00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:13,200
women make up about eighteen percent

00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,490
right now of computer science graduates

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,220
and that number is actually falling

00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:18,810
dramatically since the 70s the person

00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,550
that you're looking for that is an open

00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:22,560
source contribution open source

00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:25,529
contributor and has a computer science

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,230
degree is a unicorn it's very unlikely

00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:29,880
that this person exists this person it

00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:31,200
doesn't already have a job because

00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,520
somebody has probably already snapped

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,950
them up is paying them way more than

00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,690
you're willing to pay them so they won't

00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:39,089
be available to actually apply for your

00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:40,529
job so when you say things like other

00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:42,060
there's a highly women but none of them

00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:45,990
ever applied this might be something

00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:47,220
that's stopping them and I had talked

00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,810
about about the United States but this

00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,570
isn't only a problem in the United

00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:53,640
States if we take a look at computer

00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:55,500
science graduates in countries around

00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,570
the world we see statistics like this

00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,250
India has about eight percent of women

00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:01,470
that graduate the United States is

00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:03,510
seventeen percent the UK is eighteen

00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:06,390
point to get a little better here France

00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:10,560
and Brazil about that 20 South Africa is

00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:11,790
at 25 and I get to this point and a lot

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,010
of conversations with people and will

00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:15,209
say you know I just maybe women just

00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:17,070
aren't interested in programming that

00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:18,630
you know they're just it's obviously

00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,890
they don't want to go into it because

00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:21,029
otherwise you know they would put

00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:22,410
themselves out there they would go to

00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:23,940
school they would do the same kind of

00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:26,750
work that I had to do to get where I am

00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:28,860
today but it's interesting to note that

00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:31,709
programming in general actually used to

00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:33,390
be a women's specific job the way

00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:35,459
computer actually comes from a job that

00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:36,750
a woman used to do the first compiler

00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:40,920
and programming language were written by

00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:43,740
women it's actually interesting i'm the

00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:45,570
second female programmer in my family my

00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:48,000
grandmother is also programmer so yeah

00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:49,079
they were pretty awesome and i didn't

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,430
know this and tell us a little bit older

00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:52,860
and I started talking to her about you

00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:54,839
know I'm in this field and they really

00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,220
aren't any other women they're like it's

00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:58,740
kind of weird to walk into a room and

00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,899
I'm the only woman in the room and she's

00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:03,120
telling me the story about how any ad

00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:05,520
shows in chicago in the 80s she got into

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,200
programming and went to school just like

00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,450
everybody did in the 80s pacifically for

00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,160
programming and she looked at one of the

00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:13,980
largest insurance companies in the

00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,840
country and all of the other programmers

00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,210
for women

00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:19,400
which already sounds really unusual tee

00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:21,710
off sugar all of the other programmers

00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,330
are women all of them sit in the middle

00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:25,100
of the office and a huge insurance

00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:28,730
company that takes up most of the floors

00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:35,270
of a sky rise in Chicago and they sit in

00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:37,970
a cage locked from the inside super food

00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:39,320
right and I said when that seems really

00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,970
strange to me looks like your zoo

00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,560
animals me said well is that from the

00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:44,440
inside because we had to be protected

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,300
from the men on the outside because

00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,920
harassment and people touching us with

00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,480
such a big deal that happens so

00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:54,080
frequently that this is the only way we

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,420
could get our work done like so have we

00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,740
come fall yeah I mean I'm very glad I

00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:01,700
don't have to work at a cage every day

00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:03,470
thankfully okay but and this diplomatic

00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,600
issues where when you're leaving the

00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:09,080
industry at a really high rate and far

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,120
fewer women are getting into it so the

00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,130
other thing that people in that is you

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,110
know what maybe women's brains just

00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:18,200
aren't formed right for them to be good

00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:20,570
at programming you know because there's

00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:25,430
evolutionary advantage to being able to

00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:27,740
write Ruby you know we know that it if

00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:30,980
we don't write well then a cheetah will

00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:32,570
get us and give us and we went be able

00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:36,320
to procreate and we won't have little

00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:38,840
Ruby babies say but as you mentioned

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,460
earlier there's no who there's been

00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,370
research that shows there's no physical

00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:45,980
or biological difference that impacts a

00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:49,580
person's ability to be a programmer this

00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:52,610
crosses race this crosses gender there

00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:54,400
is nothing about you being the one that

00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:58,010
makes you good at being a programmer

00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:59,240
nothing we are all born without any

00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:01,670
knowledge of programming and it's

00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,500
something that's weren't so the good

00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:05,780
news about this is that means that all

00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,180
of these forms are purely social and

00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:10,370
cultural constructs that means that we

00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:11,660
can change them which is actually a

00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:12,950
really good thing to hear this is

00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:16,010
something that doesn't have to exist

00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:17,570
this this way forever and then of the

00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,160
statistics that I didn't want in that

00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,330
group with the the countries that I was

00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,000
mentioning mentioning earlier was

00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:25,580
Bulgaria which is seventy-three percent

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,470
of the people to graduate with computer

00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:30,409
science degrees are women compare that

00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:33,840
with the seventeen percent United States

00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:35,429
so out of curiosity a show of hands how

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:40,559
many people have thought about Bulgaria

00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:43,860
this week awesome my hero of course it

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:46,049
was Katrina of course so the dairy has

00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,460
really gotten to this place in the past

00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:49,020
20 years once they kind of pull

00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,850
themselves out of poverty and started

00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:53,940
sending more people to schools and they

00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:56,190
have such a strong ethic for setting

00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,900
people into STEM fields it's something

00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:59,700
that they recognize is really important

00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,559
to rebuild their country to put

00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,570
themselves in the map for a population

00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:04,679
that's extremely intelligent and knows

00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:08,309
what they're talking about and can

00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:10,320
innovate and they have so many women

00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:13,049
that are going into the into computer

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:16,020
science so we can we can get better this

00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:20,490
is a positive trend for them so we can

00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:23,340
get better as well so why does diversity

00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:26,370
matter to you looking at in the audience

00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:29,520
I don't see a lot of visual diversity

00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:31,650
the route of white presumably straight

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,090
men that are able and that's what the

00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:35,820
vast majority of our industry looks like

00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:37,409
and so how does this affect you how does

00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,400
it affect your everyday life if you know

00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:40,890
you don't have to worry about getting

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,289
paid fifty percent of you know your

00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:47,580
other colleagues do how does it affect

00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:49,740
you personally well I assume the vast

00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:52,890
majority of people in here work or are

00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:55,260
going to work eventually and working in

00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:57,419
a team that's diverse actually means

00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:59,850
that the company you work for has a

00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:02,039
greater sales revenue number of

00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:04,320
customers market share and profits

00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:06,780
relative to its competitors when your

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:10,260
racial and gender diversity work force

00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:11,700
increases so if your company is making

00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:14,820
more money that means you can make more

00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:18,960
money so because I'm making less money

00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:22,650
you are making less money kind of sucks

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,450
right not so cool and so groups of

00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:26,370
greater diversity can also solve complex

00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:29,309
problems better and faster and that's

00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:31,620
kind of what we do for a living right so

00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:33,179
having more people that are able to

00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,470
think outside the box there are able to

00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:35,850
do things that are differently than us

00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,770
to bring a different perspective to the

00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:40,020
team means that we can do our jobs

00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:42,210
better diverse teams or

00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:44,640
and creative and stimulated through

00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:47,850
persistent exposure to minority view

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,340
points so we can do things that non

00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:52,620
diverse teams can't do we make better

00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:54,960
decisions we generate more innovation

00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:57,000
and considering the fact that we're on

00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,600
the forefront of innovation basically in

00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,880
the world this is super important so if

00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,430
the financial success and viability of

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,100
your company that you work at or the

00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:09,710
company that you've started is directly

00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:13,890
dependent on the amount of diversity

00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:17,970
within your workforce why aren't you

00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:19,710
hiring more diverse people diversity

00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:22,230
also matters the society this is

00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:26,070
something that actually an appeals the

00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:27,900
most to me because to me the lack of

00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:29,520
diversity is a moral issue I want

00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,470
everybody to have equal access I want

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,690
everybody to be able to come into the

00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:35,070
community and enjoy what I enjoy I want

00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,170
everybody to be able to walk through the

00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:38,490
doors of this confidence and be greeted

00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:41,520
by the friends that they haven't seen

00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:42,870
since last year and get a hug you can't

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:47,640
get that in every industry I'm not

00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:51,090
everybody tool to experience that so we

00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:53,550
make a lot of money like way more than

00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:55,920
most most people our age should should

00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:58,380
be making depending on who you ask right

00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:01,050
and we had a lot of people outside the

00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:03,150
industry that probably went to school

00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:06,120
longer than us may have more debt than

00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:08,520
us have more people to take care of than

00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:11,100
we do and they're getting paid less and

00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,630
they have fewer opportunities in the

00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:16,740
United States alone there are a million

00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:18,420
and a half jobs that are going on what

00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:21,060
is the word I want they are remaining

00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:23,670
open because we can't fill them we don't

00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:25,680
have the people to put in seats that's

00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:27,000
when we have people competing over you

00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,130
know programmers that we see just coming

00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,240
out of computer science programs or just

00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:33,120
coming out of programming schools

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:36,060
because they need them so badly they can

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,010
take the time to train them so if we're

00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:40,620
actually looking at bringing in people

00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:43,080
outside the industry that need the money

00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:45,890
so much that are in a class that's lower

00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:48,270
than probably the majority of hours and

00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:50,260
bringing a lot of people out of poverty

00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:53,650
we can start actually to hear

00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:55,990
the unequal pay that we've had in this

00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:57,970
country for a very long time and doing

00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:59,100
maxius class mobility and that's

00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:01,420
something that's important to me because

00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:03,100
in the road today the class that you're

00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:05,020
born into the socio-economic class II

00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,970
are born into is more than likely the

00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:08,500
class you will buy in the class you're

00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:11,610
born in is the class that your parents

00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:14,680
were born in it's extremely unlikely

00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:16,810
that you will escape that so if we can

00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:19,090
take somebody out of high school and we

00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:22,030
can train them and the things that we do

00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:24,340
and we can have them on their first job

00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:26,320
making probably mode and their parents

00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:30,780
have made in the past ten years in their

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:32,920
first year think about what that can do

00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:35,500
additionally the wage gap is a lot

00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:37,240
smaller in STEM fields so I mentioned

00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,520
before that women in the general

00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,470
population earn 80 point nine percent of

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,890
what men do but in seconds eighty-seven

00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:49,060
percent so that's better so what's

00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:50,580
interesting about this is too far here

00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:54,070
we go eighty-seven percent okay um

00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:55,810
that's interesting about this is women

00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:57,640
who have stem degrees whether or not

00:22:55,810 --> 00:23:00,280
they choose to continue to work in stem

00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:03,820
will continue to make more than their

00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:09,370
non stem degree counterparts by thirty

00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:11,170
percent so I stem field degrees so

00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:13,180
important yes definitely do they still

00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:15,670
necessarily relate to the jobs that we

00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:17,170
do every day maybe not but as somebody

00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:21,970
who is in a marginalized community

00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:24,120
seeing stats like that means a lot so

00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:26,770
why do you have a lack of diversity

00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,730
pipeline is one of the bigger issues and

00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:31,000
this is something that a lot of people

00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:32,850
are working on and I've had a lot of

00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,500
people ask me and only have daughters

00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:37,630
how do I get you know them to care about

00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:40,210
computers and like I mentioned before

00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:42,460
just being a dad and just being there

00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:45,130
and just being a home and just exposing

00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:46,690
your children to computers just exposing

00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,620
them to your friends or the kinds of

00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:50,669
things that you're passionate about

00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:52,559
helping them get their way on

00:23:50,669 --> 00:23:55,049
journey and learning how something

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:58,499
that's really important and playing with

00:23:55,049 --> 00:24:01,970
things and experimenting increases their

00:23:58,499 --> 00:24:05,220
odds so much of going into this field

00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:07,320
but we have issues like culture cues

00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:10,739
that tell us that geeks only look a

00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:13,200
certain way we have things like the

00:24:10,739 --> 00:24:16,559
differences in toys we give boys and

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,809
girls when their children that says one

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,309
of you is suppose to imagine use ur

00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:22,200
imagination and build something you've

00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:24,659
never built before solve a problem and

00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:28,049
then the other we have a tour you can't

00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:31,019
do very much with walk arounds it put

00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:32,129
different clothes on it there's actually

00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:33,899
an awesome toy that came out pretty

00:24:32,129 --> 00:24:35,669
recently called goldieblox which you

00:24:33,899 --> 00:24:37,230
have if you have a little girl who's I

00:24:35,669 --> 00:24:40,950
think under age 9 you should look it up

00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:43,409
it's a toy that actually gets girls to

00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:46,649
start engineering with a really simple

00:24:43,409 --> 00:24:49,019
fun toy we ask you don't have any famous

00:24:46,649 --> 00:24:50,879
role models that represent us if you ask

00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:52,289
anybody to talk about the people that

00:24:50,879 --> 00:24:53,970
have come before them and the people who

00:24:52,289 --> 00:24:56,940
have really set the stage for what we do

00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:59,730
every day their name a lot of men this

00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:02,039
is a rave man a lot of American men a

00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:04,289
lot of British man and they look a lot

00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:06,809
alike we don't have a lot of people that

00:25:04,289 --> 00:25:11,190
are similar to us that are doing really

00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:13,710
amazing things in this field when I am I

00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:15,779
was talking recently about how you know

00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:17,850
he's trying to do a lot of different

00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:20,820
things and make it very visible to the

00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:23,039
black youth community because he wants

00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,239
kids to be able to see that they can

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,950
experiment and they can try different

00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:27,570
things and they can fail with them and

00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:31,440
that's fine and they can get up and try

00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:33,570
something else not having access to

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,749
technology as I mentioned before is a

00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:38,340
really big detriment to a lot of people

00:25:35,749 --> 00:25:41,100
boys get access to the first computer at

00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:45,389
the age of 11 on average anybody get

00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:48,659
there as earlier okay let's get there's

00:25:45,389 --> 00:25:50,249
a 14 so imagine when you were back in

00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:55,379
puberty I know it's super hard and

00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:58,559
painful what you were doing around that

00:25:55,379 --> 00:26:03,510
time um we started programming around

00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:08,230
the age of 11 or before okay

00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:10,510
okay um and then we're looking at along

00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:12,160
racial lines are their lower computer

00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:14,830
ownership leaves and broadband adoption

00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:17,710
among african-american and hispanic

00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:19,570
households that in the last 10 years

00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:21,280
we've also seen that the same

00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:24,940
communities adopt smartphones in a much

00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:27,010
higher rate which begs the question how

00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:29,100
bad is the mobile experience of your app

00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:31,330
right now of whatever you're running

00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:34,210
imagine that is the only internet you

00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:35,770
see every single day can you do all the

00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:38,740
things that you do on your desktop app

00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:41,620
on your mobile app think about like

00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:43,540
think about how painful that is to only

00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:47,170
being acts only being able to access

00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:48,250
that so you also don't have access to

00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:50,770
quality education at the same rate

00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:52,180
quality high school education is one of

00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:55,480
the greatest indicators of earning

00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:57,280
potential and and when we're looking at

00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,960
the fact that we have a very high

00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:01,150
dropout rate for certain populations in

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,030
the United States we have a lot of poor

00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:06,040
neighborhoods with poor schools I went

00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:07,930
to a school where we didn't have desks

00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:11,770
for enough kids so I sat on the floor

00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:14,230
for a lot of my classes there is a huge

00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:16,000
problem with being able to focus with

00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:18,430
able being able to retain good teachers

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,380
to get new textbooks to have access to

00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:22,360
computers or broadband internet in

00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:24,610
schools we're shutting down libraries

00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:28,690
which means a lot of neighborhoods don't

00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:31,000
have access to computers at all schools

00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:32,680
in pen neighborhoods have lower quality

00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,570
math and science programs there's a

00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,730
twenty-five percent difference between

00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:39,340
the readiness of african-american and

00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:42,100
Hispanic students in science and math as

00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:44,590
compared to white students so in your

00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:46,690
name in college and they have you test

00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:49,930
out of certain classes or they see that

00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:52,060
you have AP classes of your report cards

00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:54,550
and your transcripts that means you're

00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:56,890
automatically being bumped up well an

00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:58,420
entire other population is being sent to

00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:00,400
remedial classes to be able to learn

00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:03,010
these things Mia's classes cost a lot of

00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:06,640
money right like how much money did you

00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:07,720
spend on college classes having access

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,970
to health care is something that's

00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:12,130
getting increasingly worse in the United

00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:13,410
States and people include with

00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:15,360
disabilities and edge beach

00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:18,180
you people have less access to quality

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:20,760
health care now think about having to

00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:22,050
change jobs when you have finally done

00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,480
health care that you might pay a lot for

00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:27,060
but you can now get medications that

00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,130
might save your life that you can be at

00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:30,450
work and you won't have a seizure that

00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:33,090
will kill you when you're sitting at

00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:34,380
your desk that's a pretty big deal i

00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:37,440
mean not something that a lot of people

00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:39,870
are hesitant to take risks for because

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,560
it could literally mean them dying

00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:45,780
having to change a job women are more

00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:49,740
likely to be caregivers of children and

00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:52,170
elderly or ailing relatives and so they

00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:54,000
have these people that they have to take

00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:55,560
care of and switching health insurance

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,030
might mean that their children and their

00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,800
other relatives are going to lose the

00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:01,020
care that they're getting that they

00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:05,610
don't have access to hospice care for

00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:07,110
elderly family members the second area

00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:09,240
is attraction how are we actually

00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:10,920
getting people to look at the things

00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,170
that we're doing and wanting to come and

00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,250
do the same same things that we do like

00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:15,780
I mentioned before there's a lack of

00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:17,670
role models and you don't really see a

00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:21,480
lot of people representing us in

00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:23,010
companies and conferences and when you

00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,960
think about the fact that a lot of us

00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:26,940
tend to know people that are like us we

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,230
had a hard time empathizing with people

00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,550
that are in different life situations

00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:30,930
with us that we don't necessarily

00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:33,060
understand because we've never

00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:34,380
experienced it when you have spoken with

00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:37,890
somebody that's experienced that same

00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:39,600
thing also when I spoken about this one

00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:40,890
publicly I think a number of people have

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,270
heard me talk about this one before but

00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:43,730
the geek stereotyping this is one of the

00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:46,590
more interesting papers i read recently

00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:50,940
they took a group of women that were in

00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:53,790
a technical college and they brought

00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:57,540
somebody who met the geek stereotype in

00:29:53,790 --> 00:30:00,300
to teach them something and then six

00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:01,770
months later they check to see how many

00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:05,340
of those women had dropped out of that

00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:08,070
program and regardless of that person's

00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:09,390
gender who came into that representing

00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:11,940
the geek stereotype that came in to

00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:14,130
teach them they were far more likely to

00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:16,320
drop out and they were less interested

00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:17,700
in going into computer science because

00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,250
that person met the stereotype that

00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:21,390
wasn't like them this is somebody's you

00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,720
know this is somebody that I didn't

00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:23,970
think that

00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,800
to get along with and that you know am I

00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:27,750
going to have friends when I when I go

00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,040
into this industry like if people are so

00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,810
radically different for me am I going to

00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:35,130
feel welcome am I going to feel like I

00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:36,870
belong and that last area is attrition

00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:39,900
and this is the one that scares me the

00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:44,790
most fifty-six percent of women leave

00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:46,440
tech within ten years I'm very lucky and

00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:48,180
very privileged that I've been able to

00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:52,710
avoid this I've been in tech for about

00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:57,480
12 years but this is twice the attrition

00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:59,160
rate of men that's really big and it's

00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,720
really scary to me I mean I talk to you

00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,310
a lot of women that are interested in

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,440
getting into tegra spoke with a 15 year

00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:06,480
old girl actually last weekend about

00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:08,430
what she was interested in and the kind

00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,920
of invention and some things that she

00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:13,830
was doing to try and figure out what she

00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:14,850
wanted to do with their life and I told

00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,680
you the kinds of things that I talked

00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:18,480
about in the kinds of things that I've

00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:22,230
been educating people about and I told

00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:24,090
her this statistic and she said okay I'm

00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:26,490
determined to beat that now which is

00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:28,320
really hurtful for me um but I can

00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:30,300
definitely see how the years have worn

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,920
me down and they've been definitely a

00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,600
lot of situations where I thought you

00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:36,000
know this might be the thing that sets

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:42,710
you know me off the edge and I just

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:45,540
can't handle it anymore and thanks

00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:47,820
harassment is a huge issue like a

00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:50,160
mission before my grandmother worked in

00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:52,260
a cage literally in a cage and I'm lucky

00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,670
that I don't have to do that and that we

00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:56,720
have a different kind of harassment

00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:59,370
going on one of these very subtle and

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,780
for instance people in mentioning those

00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:04,440
groups or twice as likely to be harassed

00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:06,750
or mistreated and a lot of people

00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:09,440
outside that group I said those groups

00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:11,160
don't recognize that it's happening I

00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,810
have been in so many situations

00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,830
specifically at conferences where

00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,850
something has happened to me and

00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:17,910
somebody has said something really

00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:19,320
inappropriate and I'm shocked because I

00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:20,700
can't believe a human being would do

00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,740
something like that to someone else and

00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:25,200
the other people that were standing with

00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:27,180
me will turn around and walk away I've

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,440
never had somebody stand up and say hey

00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,550
maybe you shouldn't do that actually I

00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,790
take that back i had somebody do it

00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:34,169
yesterday so thank you it was really

00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:36,809
awesome and

00:32:34,169 --> 00:32:38,429
but over the past 12 years that's the

00:32:36,809 --> 00:32:43,049
one incident where somebody has stood up

00:32:38,429 --> 00:32:44,789
and say hey that's not okay 12 years so

00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:46,529
means when we say things like I've never

00:32:44,789 --> 00:32:48,359
seen somebody get her get her ass you

00:32:46,529 --> 00:32:50,429
know it does it must not happen at the

00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:52,009
rate at which you're saying what you're

00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:54,480
saying to them is I don't believe you

00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:56,399
how many how many incidents have to be

00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:00,359
reported be reported before we take this

00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:02,159
issue seriously discrimination is a huge

00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:04,830
issue like I mentioned before we have an

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:07,830
issue with pay there's a big difference

00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:09,629
in clearly pay what and but also in

00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:12,059
advancement and job offers who we offer

00:33:09,629 --> 00:33:14,970
jobs for instance in Silicon Valley men

00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:17,460
are 2.7 times more likely to be promoted

00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:18,809
to mid-level I'm sorry the women are

00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:21,600
just as likely to be promoted to

00:33:18,809 --> 00:33:23,850
mid-level jobs as men but men are 2.7

00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,070
times more likely to be promoted to

00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:29,669
senior positions like vice president or

00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:32,419
senior management the only issue of the

00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:34,830
only difference being gender this

00:33:32,419 --> 00:33:36,330
accounts for things like the amount of

00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:38,549
time they've been out of the industry or

00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:41,940
may have taken off for children 2.7

00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:45,450
times more likely to be promoted so

00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:49,499
Millie pick I'm conniving use my army so

00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:51,330
congratulations you have an enlisted you

00:33:49,499 --> 00:33:52,649
don't get any like special sheriff

00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:56,399
badges or anything is kind of invisible

00:33:52,649 --> 00:33:59,399
but really quick so the change starts

00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:00,899
with us we're very lucky that a lot of

00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:02,580
us are in a position where we can start

00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:04,200
changing the ways that we think about

00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:07,379
things and we can start eliminating some

00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,879
of the biases that we have and I really

00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:10,980
found that educating people about these

00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:13,589
issues is an excellent way to teach

00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:15,359
people empathy a lot of people don't

00:34:13,589 --> 00:34:17,429
necessarily understand that this how

00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:20,010
greatly this kind of thing impacts

00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:21,359
people or how much and how many people

00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:23,250
leave the industry because they have to

00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,649
deal with these issues every day so talk

00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:26,879
to people about the issues you face

00:34:24,649 --> 00:34:28,319
tattoo people about the things that

00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,839
you've heard here today the things that

00:34:28,319 --> 00:34:32,760
you read all the time and speak up when

00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:35,549
they say when they do terrible things

00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:38,250
please um get to know people bit of

00:34:35,549 --> 00:34:39,510
different than you um in society in

00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:41,099
general we tend to know people that are

00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:45,790
like us and in this industry it's very

00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:47,020
easy to do that very easy so we need to

00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:48,280
get to know people that are different

00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:50,260
than hasta have had different

00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:52,900
experiences than us that have different

00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:56,560
concerns and means in their careers and

00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:59,380
ask them what you can do to help them

00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,270
you know can you can you help them get a

00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,800
better job can you help put them in

00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:05,530
touch with a mentor can you help put

00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,090
them in touch with the mentee remember

00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:10,090
the bias and discrimination are often

00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:11,230
subtle remember that the story I told

00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:12,610
you about my grandmother that kind of

00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:15,240
thing necessary isn't happen anymore

00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:17,170
hope nobody in here is working in a cage

00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:19,600
that are out of the strike that we deal

00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:21,250
with on a daily basis our comments that

00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,440
people make that make assumptions about

00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:24,970
us I go to conferences a lot and I speak

00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,170
in a cinnabon stage and say I am a

00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:28,660
programmer and I've been a programmer

00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:29,980
for 12 years and when would I do and I'm

00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:32,050
really passionate about the things that

00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:33,520
I do and then I'll go to an after party

00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:36,490
and people ask me if I'm a project

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:40,180
manager yeah that necessarily mean thing

00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:42,220
do people mean to insult me to say that

00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,870
a project manager know but the

00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:45,430
assumption is made that because I'm on

00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:46,810
women because there are more women and

00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:48,250
project management but I'm more than

00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:50,410
likely a project manager and not a

00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:51,880
programmer so instead of asking some

00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:52,810
nearly a project manager asked them what

00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,070
do you do for a living what are you

00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:56,650
really passionate about what projects

00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:59,590
you working on right now learn to

00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:02,560
apologize my friend Rhonda actually has

00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:04,480
a really awesome analogy for this so do

00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,460
you ever wonder kids and we had all

00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:09,340
these drills the stop drop roll drills

00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:11,080
what you do when you're on fire she said

00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:12,720
it's really great because they drew you

00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:15,520
drive it into you when you're a kid

00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,770
because when you're an adult in a

00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,890
situation when you're on fire you have

00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:22,810
to remember that your own failure you

00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:26,380
don't necessarily have the fat process

00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:29,260
so it says hmm now what should it do now

00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:30,610
that I'm on fire well I think that I can

00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:33,130
see that there's a fire extinguisher

00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:35,440
over there so I look very calmly and

00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:36,670
fire extinguish myself off that's not

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,040
the kind of reaction we have we have

00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:41,860
panic because we are on fire and

00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,030
apologizing is is the same thing we have

00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:45,250
somebody that calls us out for something

00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:47,260
that we've done and we panic the first

00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:49,960
thing that we do is we act we react very

00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:52,150
badly a lot of times we make the

00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:54,670
situation worse yeah which is

00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:56,740
unfortunate and say

00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:59,680
three steps to apologizing very simple

00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:01,630
what I did was wrong I'm sorry if he

00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:07,390
said busting stop and start over access

00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:10,710
not an apology and make it up by trying

00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:13,240
not to do that again very simple

00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:14,440
advocating for change I'm very lucky

00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,180
that I have the privilege to stand up

00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,650
and speak before everyone today that

00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:19,270
I've had a lot of people that have been

00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:20,860
very supportive of the research that I'm

00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:22,570
doing and the things that I'm talking

00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:24,070
about that they're willing to sit in

00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:25,300
chairs and listen to me and willing to

00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:28,500
bring me to conferences to talk about

00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:31,120
this but not everyone else does

00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:34,000
typically these issues openly and it

00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:35,230
gives more people the power to stand up

00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,170
when they see that you're doing it

00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:39,040
nobody wants to be the first one

00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:40,870
remember that you can say something as

00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,770
simple as that's not cool this is

00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:46,630
actually my most used tweet on Twitter

00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:48,220
and includes this the family face every

00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:49,750
time system maps to tell people like

00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:52,060
what you're doing isn't okay so you

00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:54,430
should probably change it have the whole

00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:55,570
conversations in public I talked to a

00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:57,940
lot of people about this kind of stuff

00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:59,560
in public because I laugh bystanders to

00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:03,250
see and be able to learn from the

00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:06,700
situation includes influence change in

00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:08,680
communities and what places I've been so

00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:10,630
happy to see how supportive and

00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:14,620
inclusive this conference has been so

00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:17,530
thank you so much it's amazing increase

00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:19,210
education and access help facilitate

00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:20,710
events for marginalized people in tech

00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:24,790
go to things like black girls code

00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:26,320
Latino startups whales bridge and go

00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:28,720
develop it there's tons of groups out

00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:31,120
there volunteer local schools and groups

00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,170
that unless always wrap people like us

00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,090
to come in and talk about what we're

00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:36,160
passionate about come in and talk to a

00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:40,120
half hour show people how to write basic

00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,830
HTML commit financial resources if you

00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:45,480
went to an Ivy League school and you

00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:49,360
write them a check every year stop it

00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:51,850
they didn't hit any of your money send

00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:54,310
them away to a technical college that's

00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:56,650
in your area a college that serves our

00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:58,360
marginalized population work with

00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:00,310
colleges and universities and ask them

00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:02,440
things like what are you doing to help

00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:06,040
students who have had less exposure to

00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:07,140
technology remove bias from our schools

00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,670
and universities

00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:10,380
there's a really awesome study that was

00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:11,700
done by heavy mud where they doubled the

00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:13,410
number of women that graduated from

00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:16,440
their computer science programs but

00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:19,500
asking one question IMA 101 course which

00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:21,480
will is have you programmed before being

00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:23,010
able to remove and put in a different

00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:25,350
room the people who had program before

00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:27,240
we knew that threat of these people are

00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:29,430
way smarter than me I am never gonna be

00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:33,300
able to catch up I am not smart enough

00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:34,560
to do this change our workplaces think

00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,450
about what your about page looks like

00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:39,450
right now when you get a chance take a

00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:42,000
look at the tumblr 100% men and let me

00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:43,940
know if it looks the same it's really

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,410
really sad and scary tumblr actually

00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:49,410
change your culture it's a lot harder to

00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:51,540
retain them recruit diverse people think

00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:53,490
I've your culture is a garden you want a

00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:54,780
lot of variety you value variety you

00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:57,030
probably don't want an entire garden

00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:58,740
full of carrots that's a lot of carrots

00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:00,720
to eat and the fact that you want to

00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:02,340
prune needs if there are people in your

00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,190
company that are scaring people away

00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:06,360
that are doing sort of saying terrible

00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:08,960
things to other people that are making

00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:11,430
people uncomfortable please remove them

00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,410
vocally support this kind of thing the

00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:14,670
active in the community create diversity

00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:17,550
statements and actually follow through

00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:19,140
mmm attend events and job fairs for

00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:20,640
marginalized communities if you're going

00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,500
to job fairs and you want hitting up

00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:25,410
historical black colleges women's
