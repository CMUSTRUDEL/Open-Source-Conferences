00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:37,540
there's anything out any may have to

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,150
adjust as a step transition the people

00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:42,430
at Apple have not come up with the

00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:45,480
calmly soften to silence option on the

00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:49,300
transitions this is scott has been said

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:53,470
my name is definite blooms I I I am a

00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:55,750
doctor and and they must confer jokes

00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:57,910
about the afternoon but if you've got a

00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:00,430
payback period of Java on your plane

00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:02,500
joke please you know for the key will

00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:08,020
just tell you a little bit jokes and I

00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:13,479
have never been updated okay say I have

00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:15,760
not found many pays to Bing doctor well

00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:17,320
I remember I saw my PhD those are web

00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,600
page i found is the wave had been

00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,479
invented and people put stuff on it and

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,450
and and it said these are the reasons

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,670
you shouldn't do a PhD like it was

00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:29,260
trying to warn people in time ago good

00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,909
he is an easel few laughs and you're not

00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,340
that old at the time so it's you know

00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:37,149
you trying to help people turn up to it

00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:39,270
to the often get real jobs and those are

00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:44,350
the reasons i was going to do this

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:48,460
upgrades just before dr. ladies and none

00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:50,350
of those things came real and so big

00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:55,270
answer death is I don't want talking

00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:57,189
about this way um silence this sounds

00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:59,350
some time to think if I enjoyed for that

00:01:57,189 --> 00:02:00,609
as well so I never check I want to

00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:02,049
introduce you to something I think's

00:02:00,609 --> 00:02:03,460
really cool and I'm gonna do that by

00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:05,770
watching the video glasses longer

00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:09,039
pretend to chuck I'm typing that's not

00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:12,430
real i cant pretend so this is client

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,260
family and so I I wish we came from an

00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:16,000
GI bleeding in squads and great but I

00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,500
factory came out in cycles you know

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,390
secretly thought it's really cool

00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:23,860
couldn't talk about it because wasn't

00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:25,690
what we used but so this is this an open

00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:28,060
source and this is it running a hokey

00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:30,010
build back for Ruby automatically picks

00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:33,370
up the vision maybe this image n file or

00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:34,330
stuff to get evoke a little cool pop is

00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,880
this is running am I

00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:38,680
his own account and I can do exactly the

00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,110
same video and I could say this is where

00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,720
my opens that machine I'm shaped so I

00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:45,460
only one opens dr. one machine it's just

00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,070
a clever way to run OpenStack in

00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:52,690
production while moving machines for

00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:55,240
resilience etc and I found in my tire

00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,670
center at Engine Yard where we obviously

00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,100
if not use engine India girls first you

00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:02,140
should definitely consider them is one

00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:05,740
of the options for things that are

00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:08,440
bigger than Tony elapsed that's there's

00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:10,660
a pattern a that cares about other

00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,790
people that don't get to use the whole

00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,320
crews and engine yards of the world and

00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,180
I start really care about this idea that

00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,340
one day I was going to have a job

00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:21,070
in a large company and they're going to

00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:24,240
maybe use tools and I saw today

00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:26,410
about that person whose future me and

00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,030
I'm there you know we talk about other

00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,920
people it's like you're standing that

00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,000
spoke about how you know we should do

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,520
things for other people and that's

00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,560
awesome and I really great well as other

00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:40,060
people is me so I regulars got a lot

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,300
more time think about make my life

00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:45,070
better especially picture me and so I

00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,540
started to become very empathetic to

00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:48,040
this idea that's that I was going to

00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,410
have to go into work another crazy i can

00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,019
imagine the rest of my life say never 30

00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,220
30 years of working on 38 and i plan to

00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:56,800
looking for a long time because it's

00:03:54,220 --> 00:04:00,310
going to keep you alive tip that retire

00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,630
kills you um and I mean sandy talked

00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,350
about a father being 18 still doing

00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,739
things I think that's an excellent

00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:06,940
career plan a lot plan so imagine being

00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:08,920
a wiki large companies thinking that

00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,630
 things like bad technology and if

00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,190
we can make like technology outside

00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:14,890
that's great but we have to give us all

00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:16,390
these companies and so are the very

00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:19,359
least in content because I wanted to get

00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:21,070
it inside big organizations and the

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,160
reason is and this or this idea if it's

00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,479
it's sugary and delicious who's ever

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,680
worked in large companies with bad

00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:32,200
technology yeah and and and it's the

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,090
safe haven is to leave and you get to

00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,820
pick up technologies like Moody and use

00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:38,440
things like yogurt and lots of shafts

00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,210
companies right well what beautiful

00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:44,200
websites and you're not allowed to use

00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:45,380
any of them and that so have you been

00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,740
classified into the company

00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:52,130
so my first my first goal and dream and

00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:54,620
the thing that you know I work a lot to

00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:57,080
decide your balance I hear about it and

00:04:54,620 --> 00:05:00,500
I think that's it's fine I don't do

00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:03,140
balance very well I have children and a

00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,520
wife and I try to make sure that they

00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:07,190
think that I paying attention all the

00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,710
time I have my parenting face on that

00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:10,940
looks yes that's really interesting

00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:13,910
whilst I'm thinking or something else I

00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:17,900
do not represent necessarily someone to

00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:20,270
copy in how to live a happy healthy long

00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,440
life I've who knows um well I think

00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,450
about this stuff all the time I can

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,980
justify because this I think this is

00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:27,470
really important this idea of getting

00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:30,680
put tools to to people who don't

00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:34,070
necessarily get to choose good tools and

00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,810
so I like playing Fanny because you know

00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:37,250
it's if you've ever had to set up your

00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:39,680
selling service is better than that if

00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:41,270
you'd rather have to do that with papers

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,090
share for puppet it's far better than

00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:46,280
that and you get this easy interface to

00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:48,410
it and build packs etc obviously make

00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,700
for a simple way of sharing but the part

00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,500
I care the most because you can go and

00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:54,260
use for a PPO shias public cloud foundry

00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,850
but Apollo really care about is not just

00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:58,010
how you see this to use as a user of

00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:02,360
broad fender but how easy it is for me

00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:06,170
to run the bastard we never talks about

00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,610
that like if someone's in here awesome

00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:09,800
Nick I'm going to run cloud foundry in

00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:12,290
my company where do I get started and I

00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,700
don't have a good answer then I've said

00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:18,190
well one hope that people gets nice

00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:21,140
shiny sugary things but I hate you and

00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:23,480
so I care very deeply about the idea of

00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:25,280
not distribute on the outside but sugary

00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,040
for the people that are going to run

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,560
stand this thing up um so this is the

00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,120
shawnee loader for cloud fabric it is as

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,340
much as I definitely understand the

00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,070
premise in my heart of idea of the open

00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:41,000
source is owned by someone I'm pivotal

00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:43,850
which is so he's been owned by freedom

00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,960
where and then being where and someone

00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,760
else even see you got together and

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,250
create a new company if I heard the

00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:52,280
night pivotal from pivotal labs and that

00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:54,320
create a new company that amongst other

00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,380
things is to think now the sponsor and

00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,780
maintainer and owner of these projects

00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:03,320
is rabbit De Laurentiis of java based

00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:06,320
and since right this is new company and

00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:08,240
but they never once this alone and draw

00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:11,540
a flower factory kind of confusing to me

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,100
for a while but feel cool part is unlike

00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,750
something like perhaps OpenStack which

00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,790
is just Ted's of companies all

00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,930
contributing and absolutely no they ship

00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,690
things every six months and you said

00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:22,790
hope it goes well as much as it doesn't

00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:25,190
fit into my mentality watching pivotal

00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:27,950
actually build product it's pretty

00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:30,650
impressive that the stuff that comes out

00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:32,540
so I just out from sales person on the

00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,010
outside like watching this project which

00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,840
is control the episodes mood for this

00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:39,020
has been really impressive for last six

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,430
months this is the public website if you

00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:43,640
want to use you know if you instead of

00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:46,640
using her p you could use a run it's the

00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:49,640
wrong doc pivotal duct I oh I think it's

00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,750
in public better now and so I decided

00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,210
that I was going to leave engine yard

00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:56,870
and create company to do stuff with

00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:58,550
Cloud Foundry because I kind of figured

00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,570
this would be a good business plan so if

00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,460
you're looking for something that's

00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:03,020
going to project you like sandy talked

00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,120
about you know you you know it never

00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:08,900
felt that good job as a rails developer

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,940
was a bit too you know differentiating

00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,500
like you know everyone's a rails

00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,730
developer how do i be different that's

00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,830
why i sort of big fat fatty i thought

00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:17,540
yeah if i was to sort of work in the

00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:19,970
spice and it became a successful spice

00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:23,090
I'd have a successful company and get to

00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:25,610
you know not have to worry about you

00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:27,890
know the invention of lizard fe or

00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,810
whatever I'm I can keep doing my thing

00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:32,900
if I pick the winner so now I have to

00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:34,280
convince you we follow the logic I had

00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:37,280
to convince you that this is going to be

00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:41,930
successful so that it become successful

00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:43,219
so that I'm right which is very

00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:46,340
important to me because I'm not being

00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:48,020
wrong so I just sort of thing with me up

00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:51,650
front this is consider I'm much better

00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:55,040
for me um okay so why cloud foundry I am

00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:57,620
there's lots of good reasons and firstly

00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,350
if most people would have used for

00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,910
because anyone not used her okay we've

00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,110
sort of demo so you get the gist but I

00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,960
do appreciate that someone may never

00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:07,870
have seen it it is I like to refer to as

00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,730
a the private vision of her

00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:13,360
and I can do that because I don't know

00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:14,589
either of the brands if you're a fine

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,240
family person probably not gonna say

00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:17,950
that welcome to compare so that's not

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,270
what brands do that that's it huh you

00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:22,120
know we don't like to talk about them I

00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:24,850
like to say it's just like a local hick

00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,640
and runners and you know otherwise you

00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:29,050
have to go and work on her okay and you

00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,820
know that's one option but you know

00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:32,800
running itself is really cool the

00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,270
ability to play with others there's lots

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,880
of awesome people have ever done devops

00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:38,710
tough c7 administration obviously what

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,120
this is doing is completely automating

00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:44,500
all of this so it's great to go to play

00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:46,060
with others p puts lots of here i have

00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,070
no doubt that this thing will continue

00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:51,570
to develop a very long time which is

00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:51,570
important to ensure pick a tech stack

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,130
Jamie Jamie Van Dyke other was no fear

00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,660
fish is a british guy he said he said to

00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,870
me who's getting into car fire and he

00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:04,300
said I thought this is such a nerd fest

00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:07,690
and I would never used the phrase out

00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:09,610
loud but he said it sri lankan site near

00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:13,390
solution the sun is cool stuff in there

00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:15,310
it's not almost entirely late- be busy

00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:17,520
faces have been written go over time and

00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:21,070
the container systems written in c and

00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,570
the saving money you know for some

00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:24,850
people saving money is a good thing so I

00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:28,000
thought it'd be entering a circus and I

00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:30,279
do apologize i got this is no lower a

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,290
few verses clarify the idea but since

00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:34,000
with those rupee we all know their

00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:37,300
pricing model I just want to sort of put

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,790
it in a context um so called us so here

00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,290
are some comparisons of not competing

00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,820
companies but different people

00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:45,100
essentially selling container

00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,839
technologies and if you just disagree

00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,660
with these prices I apologize what did

00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:51,190
the math wrong but there's the URLs for

00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:53,130
locked up clouds passing whatever this

00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:56,230
is just a bunch of companies selling

00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:58,600
containers so it would obviously

00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,500
connected up in run apps so the plants

00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,690
interesting I haven't really understood

00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:04,660
what digital ocean is for found their

00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:06,070
pricing was really interesting but I

00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,690
don't think they provide that the whole

00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:09,160
past experience of deploying app so

00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:11,709
perhaps perhaps they're still of DevOps

00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,089
chef worked a bit on top of that viewers

00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:14,709
work was sort of interesting as well if

00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:18,100
you've never bought or looked at the big

00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:20,500
pricing of Amazon when you start buying

00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:23,020
their big Williams think it really cheap

00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,520
and if you buy them with the last one is

00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:27,130
if you buy them like the other reserved

00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,839
instances pay for faith like a three you

00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:30,100
know you pay upfront so I'm going to

00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:32,829
reserve this for four years and if you

00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:37,209
buy for three years to get down to a

00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:41,829
dollar fifty for a container is not

00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:43,990
worthy I mean it's it's an impressive

00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:45,010
price difference to consider their you I

00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:46,570
don't have to run it yourself that's

00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:48,040
gonna be so this is not for everyone

00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:50,200
someone said well I'm hanging about Tori

00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:53,740
bucks to parthania sugar care I can Tory

00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,089
better green okay listen yeah and the

00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,890
running version of blackberries listened

00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:58,810
is someone else is doing other up stuff

00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:00,940
way since this is really for people who

00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:03,540
were ya running going because their own

00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:05,529
companies I don't know how to run things

00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,370
that kind of let someone else run it

00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:09,100
they've been around on their own

00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:10,720
infrastructure vsphere OpenStack and so

00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,800
I just want us to compare process car I

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,110
don't know why those interesting well

00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:19,690
tie fighter you guys have its own

00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:21,970
container technology because doc I

00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:23,500
hadn't come out yet and I must admit

00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:25,959
like a very cranky at the cloud foundry

00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,510
people a year ago when they first our

00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:32,290
service or wooden and I said this is

00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:33,910
awesome this this is bullying I should

00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:36,700
show the demo then they did nothing with

00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:38,320
it to promote it independently so just

00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,510
SAT hidden inside of plat foundry and

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,660
the doctor came at everyone going daucus

00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:45,579
bring it here and subdora is quite that

00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,320
they've got that and perhaps one night

00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:49,930
club and via Rick Dees doctor who knows

00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,329
I'm the very similar premise the ability

00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:54,060
to spin off containers through a slight

00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:55,980
apps and give them dedicated resources

00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:58,570
just like what hurts who's been doing

00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,770
well and so certainly very cool if you

00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:02,079
would want to play with cool interesting

00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:05,050
tech darker and Warner a really

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:08,170
interesting so let's look at how you

00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:11,529
would build a platform a service should

00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:12,760
you wish to because certainly people now

00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:15,190
that things like dr. have come out

00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,769
people think I might build a pass and so

00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:20,249
let's talk about what

00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:22,860
has this big one so first you're going

00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:24,149
to run processes going to leave the apt

00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:27,779
it's going to rack up well server

00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:28,920
whatever it is and and and that has to

00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:29,730
run someone will do that in a second

00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,399
we're going to put that inside a

00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:33,809
container so just to go through this

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,410
container thing so when hope you had

00:13:33,809 --> 00:13:39,420
their ask them and bamboo stacks they

00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:41,220
were not using containers over your app

00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,589
date sort of they had more primitive

00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,480
ways of isolating each one's everyone's

00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:46,799
apps that ran on the same machines but

00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,920
when they came a container technology

00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:53,970
they were using LXE which this is a some

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,319
sort of advanced linux or mix it's using

00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,749
a thing called see groups other their

00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:59,339
operating systems have their own

00:13:56,749 --> 00:14:04,129
container technologies like jails etc

00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:06,839
and and but if you've ever use your

00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:09,389
cedar then you've used containers and

00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:11,999
they're truly a wonderful technology for

00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:13,709
getting great reviews of technology you

00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:14,939
obviously multiple of them but when you

00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:16,019
realize that you are going to need

00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:17,819
something that's going to manage that

00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:20,369
contention ology not going to build your

00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:21,929
own contain technology there are many

00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:23,689
many other harder problems to solve if

00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:26,160
you're going to build your own pass

00:14:23,689 --> 00:14:30,720
let's just use someone else's dhaka

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:32,369
wooden LXE and then so then that's some

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,540
standalone next thing i want is

00:14:32,369 --> 00:14:35,069
something to represent you a pass

00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,679
something's going to tell it to his nap

00:14:35,069 --> 00:14:39,540
here's a bill pack please run it please

00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:40,740
connect it to the internet and then you

00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,149
want to run that in the server and

00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:45,269
you're then going to want to say well

00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:46,199
one service great on your service and to

00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:48,779
just to go through the picture again

00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:50,189
we've got this is just our scaling out

00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:53,670
our pads if you ever wondered my officer

00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:55,980
Kirk is running on amazon and until

00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:57,540
recently it was us East one and there's

00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,100
lots of the m's and I think they've been

00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:01,259
demonstrations that you could figure out

00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,299
that they're running it on the high

00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:05,579
memory double extra-large Azure the quad

00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:07,079
extra larges and they run your donors on

00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:08,699
that and that's what we're talking about

00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:11,129
sure is running large numbers of these

00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:13,559
things well you learn some way that if

00:15:11,129 --> 00:15:16,679
at the end of the service disappear that

00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:19,619
the apps running on them pop up

00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:21,749
somewhere else so they're self-healing

00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:23,480
hope you talked about 80 dematic

00:15:21,749 --> 00:15:27,319
released out everyone's dinos every day

00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:29,429
just to keep them healthy and fresh and

00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:30,329
because you Brett and also if they're

00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,189
not going to survive

00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:33,329
stop you kind of want to know now as

00:15:32,189 --> 00:15:35,279
soon as possible rather than when

00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:36,899
something bad happens so it could keep

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,309
civil and make sure they behave

00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:41,249
correctly you're going to want an API

00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:42,959
the tools to this tantalizes it you're

00:15:41,249 --> 00:15:45,360
going to want to command line tools to

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:47,970
talk to the APR and perhaps most

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,959
importantly you don't want traffic to

00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:53,279
get in it's a bit of a bubble if you've

00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:54,389
got these wonderful apps running and

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,389
there's no way for the internet to get

00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:59,790
to it and so the router new snow what

00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:01,619
apps running and where and then you want

00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,779
another database is a message buses etc

00:16:01,619 --> 00:16:05,879
anything you've got choices this is this

00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:07,739
question of how do you run this yourself

00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:09,059
you have to you know if you're going to

00:16:07,739 --> 00:16:11,610
do this and truly I think this is

00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:13,259
fascinating stuff you can try to say

00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:15,360
well if I put one in every p.m. i got

00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:18,420
lots of the ends if I co-locate than my

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,819
a few of PMS and certainly I I didn't

00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:22,769
have lots of money to spend on running

00:16:20,819 --> 00:16:24,239
Cloud Foundry so I run it those many

00:16:22,769 --> 00:16:27,299
things as possible on a single VM and

00:16:24,239 --> 00:16:28,589
then I scale out the DA's there's

00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:32,879
different customers we do it differently

00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:34,679
for them but but that's kind of it and

00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:37,049
there's more bits in flower family issue

00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:39,689
there's a company so there's a new thing

00:16:37,049 --> 00:16:41,489
coming out called Flynn there's a it's

00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:44,040
based on dakka there was something that

00:16:41,489 --> 00:16:45,839
quickly came up called Dooku go through

00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,899
something like that which is like a

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,669
yahoo it went inside a single server and

00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:54,089
so demonstrate the principle of building

00:16:50,669 --> 00:16:55,439
her own pass and then they went off in

00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:57,119
the building some good Flynn and that

00:16:55,439 --> 00:16:59,009
might be interesting to the idea of

00:16:57,119 --> 00:17:01,230
running on paths I think it's going to

00:16:59,009 --> 00:17:05,579
grow more and more and so like when you

00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:07,679
when the next rails rails run book comes

00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:12,000
out and once again no doubt you

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:13,350
sponsored by line owed the first thing

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,970
we might do is actually install one of

00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:16,380
these hazards just so you like that's

00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:18,750
done we don't do any more mucking around

00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,600
with with config cetera then L can just

00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:24,539
do they're pushing luck with the wisdom

00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:27,000
um so nice to me yesterday buddy is in

00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:28,679
town and we're going to chat and this

00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,779
has been one of my pet peeves about open

00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:33,120
source Fisher Cooper open source or open

00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:34,350
source that comes from companies and my

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,470
favorite example is a thing called

00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:40,710
Zipkin when hit concave out from Twitter

00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:42,570
and it was away

00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:45,480
spin shot at the top of the readme is on

00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:46,950
github it was open source and it had

00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,020
beautiful screenshot the purpose of it

00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:50,669
was you can watch all the traffic coming

00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,529
through your service orientated

00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:53,610
architecture so every request the

00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:55,649
Panther you can see where it was going

00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:57,419
and and how long it was taking and to

00:17:55,649 --> 00:18:00,390
start optimizing that's it sounded

00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:02,370
minutes and then they said he's the

00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:05,279
architecture diagram ok well the bits

00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:06,960
you're going to need to run this it

00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:08,820
included Cassandra which is a

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,770
non-trivial thing now it has changed

00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:13,500
since then but notice the point it kind

00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:16,440
of Cassandra you needed new keeper you

00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,299
needed to other things and one of those

00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,860
itself exploded out into this large

00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:23,880
diagram of things that you need to run

00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:25,980
and I it wasn't the first time that I've

00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,870
been frustrated that there's someone it

00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,110
opens or something without actually

00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:33,870
telling anyone how to run the bugger

00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:36,149
it's kind of rude what's the point but I

00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:37,649
can't run it in if you know honestly

00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:39,510
don't want me to run it why did what was

00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:41,789
the point of open sourcing it and others

00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:44,309
that I have regular disagreements with

00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:45,750
Travis on this topic flat they've open

00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:48,270
sores Travis but then it really want

00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:51,270
anyone to run it and it's not right or

00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:56,970
wrong as me just disagreeing because

00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:58,380
they wronged you ops works there so the

00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,669
chef chef with Chef server such a

00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,640
complex thing that no one really wanted

00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:04,200
to run themselves and in cloud fairies

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,510
the practical side was big and complex

00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,919
and you know when it first came out they

00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:10,110
they say we eventually I say oh here's

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:13,409
some chef recipes and some people able

00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:14,850
to figure how to run it anything I think

00:19:13,409 --> 00:19:16,649
I vision are really excited about it

00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:19,200
that spikes are possible and the thing I

00:19:16,649 --> 00:19:21,179
want a demo now is that is a thinker

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,130
blush we actually lets you run complex

00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:25,230
things and bosh could run all of these

00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:27,059
things that's hard to do Alexa yeah

00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:29,070
really focusing on Cloud Foundry but um

00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:31,260
but I do want to sort of keep the peak

00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:33,299
intro to an idea to to that I built on

00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:35,610
top of Washington proper prior fabric so

00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:38,429
that basically you could deploy all that

00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:40,710
stuff it with one command line and then

00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:43,770
change it over time the next five years

00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:45,860
as it as new versions come out because I

00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:49,380
think if it's any harder than that I

00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:53,020
don't want to do it at regular tolerance

00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:54,280
to pain I work a lot to avoid pain

00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,330
and that guy that you know there's

00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,770
something kind of take 20 minutes or

00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,330
repeated behavior I'll spend three days

00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:01,030
building a tool to avoid the 20 minutes

00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:04,000
of pain it's a very twisted life I live

00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:07,270
and I've been working on variation this

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,520
tool for the most of this year so I'm

00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:11,650
very excited about this so this is this

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,560
is booting up Cloud Foundry as a command

00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:17,020
called Bosh p XE f currently you put in

00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,970
the the public dns and the perhaps a

00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:20,770
floating-point Opie and it validates

00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:23,710
those things dust double checks that you

00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:24,850
set that stuff up quickly confirm that

00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:26,890
you're close security group ultimately

00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:29,860
in a few weeks it will automate all of

00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:32,650
that built it for you and and it starts

00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:34,600
the point you've got nothing you've got

00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:39,550
no service you've got no persistent

00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:41,380
disks if got no no you have a snapshot

00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:43,180
at anything yet and so it says right

00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:45,880
you've got nothing I wild on crazy stuff

00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:48,940
I know that the you by default it picks

00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,350
a medium-sized deployment which is 5pm s

00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:54,130
so I sort of some of the things occur

00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:57,430
located and if such bid him up I this

00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:59,740
takes 20 minutes or so so don't think

00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:01,360
that it's this quick manage your

00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:04,000
expectations if you've ever watched

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:07,240
neighbors on vm boot up manage your

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,950
expectations are properly they don't all

00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,660
come up the same speed you can still see

00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:12,100
at the top has disappeared that small

00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,840
three took five enough minutes to come

00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,640
up to some of them fast on the slide it

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,850
does then study to as BM sequentially

00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:21,250
which perhaps could be sped up over time

00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:22,750
but is up this is cloud foundry bush

00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,220
comes with different ways to look at at

00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,930
what the ends you thought and what

00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:28,750
there's no way you can read that I

00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:30,270
understand but there were five bm's it

00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,380
shows you what the health of each one is

00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:37,090
so if you've ever built these sorts of

00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:38,440
tools and hey this is I fell in I'll be

00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:39,760
honest in forever watch my true account

00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,910
the last year for why should we talk

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,410
about Bosh and this is my attempt again

00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:46,750
to try and make Bosh more consumable

00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:48,550
because it does a wonderful a relative

00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:52,770
of services but it's kind of hard to use

00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:55,360
all realness I want to say impossible

00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:57,970
because obviously we made it work but

00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:01,159
the amount of things it does and it's

00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:03,080
open source does mean that it's a little

00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:06,320
well chicken work with so this is an

00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:07,999
effort to try and make hide Bosh bit

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,259
like you know you avoiding is a ruby

00:22:07,999 --> 00:22:10,759
project you don't go and just get the

00:22:09,259 --> 00:22:13,489
source from github and then try to

00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:14,989
compose all sources rubygems if the

00:22:13,489 --> 00:22:17,149
project comes with a command line app

00:22:14,989 --> 00:22:19,340
you don't have to put that somewhere and

00:22:17,149 --> 00:22:21,950
then add that to your path ruger gender

00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:24,889
doesn't so this tool the the bosch 500

00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:26,119
will an attempt to subside great Bosh

00:22:24,889 --> 00:22:29,359
does everything but you don't need to

00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:32,269
see Bosh will just deploy this thing and

00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:34,759
and then over time change it so that's

00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:37,129
how you learn it it can run 80 s

00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:39,830
OpenStack vSphere someone started adding

00:22:37,129 --> 00:22:41,629
CloudStack support to Bosh and someone

00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:45,409
else to start with donna Rackspace CPI

00:22:41,629 --> 00:22:49,159
certs it's not uncommon comparable to

00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:50,809
something like fog but it's specifically

00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:54,559
what it's trying to do what gosh can do

00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:57,229
is 50 ms delete VMS boot attach

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,249
networking boot disk delete this like 12

00:22:57,229 --> 00:23:00,679
different operators and if you can do

00:22:58,249 --> 00:23:01,879
those 12 operators you know you can yeah

00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:06,440
have cloud foundry and other things

00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:08,119
running on you but perhaps then you

00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,979
perhaps the reason that I got excited I

00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:12,590
blush and other people don't is because

00:23:09,979 --> 00:23:15,259
the time I spent engine yard where you

00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:16,789
get to watch yeah several thousand

00:23:15,259 --> 00:23:18,649
customers go through the life cycle of

00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:20,570
running production systems and the

00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:21,529
problems we had to solve all of them so

00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:24,559
one of the problem they have to solve

00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:28,789
with stack control what i mean by that

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:30,200
is is we look at is you know what we

00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:32,450
used to do is force everyone up right

00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,789
all the time but if you want to go and

00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:35,869
add a new vm it's like I just what I

00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:38,419
hadn't of the end that's what I want to

00:23:35,869 --> 00:23:40,609
do engineer I've got ten beams when I

00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:43,309
had one more and we and what the product

00:23:40,609 --> 00:23:45,710
is to first you to do is upgrade which

00:23:43,309 --> 00:23:48,379
what like your product yeah because of

00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:50,299
your cookbooks plus engineer's cookbooks

00:23:48,379 --> 00:23:51,859
might not converge and all who wants to

00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:53,269
do is get past the scaling is your head

00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:55,460
right now and we forced you upgrade

00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:56,749
customers pretty cranky about that and

00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:59,179
obviously the customers got no Spanky

00:23:56,749 --> 00:24:00,529
where the most valuable customers so we

00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:02,269
implements that control and what that

00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:04,369
meant was it to couples when you

00:24:02,269 --> 00:24:07,669
upgraded from our products requirements

00:24:04,369 --> 00:24:08,989
and said I I was aware of that and

00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:10,339
that's one things into a back just

00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,340
because the new version cloud factory

00:24:10,339 --> 00:24:12,930
comes out

00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:15,810
come out every week doesn't mean you

00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:17,820
have to upgrade and this tool supports

00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:21,510
will support area of inversions ever

00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:23,000
came out and and let you operate in

00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:27,330
there in time the scale at your own time

00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,350
so I I try to make you understand hope

00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:31,560
you understand that these are hard

00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:33,900
problem solving and if you move on big

00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:35,160
systems or sat next to big system being

00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:38,550
wrong perhaps you'll ever see so this is

00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:41,250
changing something what it comes with a

00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:43,890
gives you a full geek default disk size

00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:46,350
on the data BM you might want to change

00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:48,390
a commuter to the VMS you know gosh p.m.

00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:50,760
showed you the patrick's filling up so

00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:51,900
now you just put a bigger number it'll

00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:55,410
prompt you to say is that what you

00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:57,030
really want to do and then it'll then it

00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,890
goes back to Bosh and says we want to

00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:01,470
make this change and Bosh orchestrates

00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:03,260
through the change so on that vm none of

00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:07,050
the other vm to get touched but that vm

00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:08,550
the disc will be stopped and you just

00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:09,960
brought up the contents have come over

00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:12,480
whatever it is that needs to happen on

00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,070
that particular infrastructure and then

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,200
the jobs and everything running a vm

00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:18,660
will be restarted if you've ever had to

00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:22,650
do this stuff will appreciate someone

00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:23,820
else automating is I've done lots of

00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:25,470
talks on Bosh sorry I don't want to

00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,970
educate your brush because if if you

00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:29,010
know if you're interested you'll learn

00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:36,240
it eventually but this tool means you

00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:41,000
don't have to and but the idea of why

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:44,370
Bosh who's only written chef recipes

00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:49,110
who's ever written pepper thing is what

00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:53,370
a proper thing is called manifests who

00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:58,470
is over buddha to vm server who's ever

00:25:53,370 --> 00:26:00,450
managed physical machines and my guess

00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:03,180
if you've done any of those things you

00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:04,920
have you may have use the same tools you

00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:06,780
may have you share a puppet but every

00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,400
single one of you has either done it

00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:11,820
manually and all written a bespoke

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,350
orchestration layer right i mean

00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,820
engineer spends tens of millions dollars

00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:16,860
on its orchestration layer we pretty

00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:19,230
nice dashboard on it if we want to work

00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:20,419
there and that's the core product was an

00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:22,159
orchestration layer

00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:25,850
build out their own orchestration of

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:27,320
amazon and everyone that's ever done it

00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:29,419
when you manually learning knife

00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,619
commands per share for with you yeah

00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:33,619
you've written something that doesn't

00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:35,450
automatically it's deeply saddens me

00:26:33,619 --> 00:26:37,700
that this is not a community solved

00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:39,799
problem of managing infrastructure so

00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,230
that was one of the reasons I fell in

00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:44,590
love Bosh there are lots of reasons and

00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:47,029
engineering is Jen to to manage OS and

00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:50,179
we didn't have any good tooling around

00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:52,190
we have better to leave now so that as a

00:26:50,179 --> 00:26:55,369
result of me leaving but by the time I

00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:56,899
left we had better orchestration you

00:26:55,369 --> 00:27:00,999
know we wouldn't have a good way to ship

00:26:56,899 --> 00:27:02,749
new face images to customers

00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:05,210
independently because I can't just force

00:27:02,749 --> 00:27:08,059
everyone and so we didn't we have a good

00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:09,019
way of creating new base images and we

00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:11,409
do have a good way to get them out to

00:27:09,019 --> 00:27:13,850
customers and so what that meant was

00:27:11,409 --> 00:27:18,220
people couldn't upgrade to new packages

00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:21,139
because we couldn't get them new GCC and

00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:22,159
these little problems you know if you're

00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:24,559
just building something up for the first

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,359
time you getting care of its problems if

00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,759
you think about the life of a system or

00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:31,399
application over five years 60 months

00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:33,559
sup just challenges to be solved out the

00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:34,970
first then as so says hey look how

00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:36,350
awesome the first month is the

00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:38,480
challenges you're running systems is the

00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:40,279
next fifty nine months we're not just

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,779
your application is going to change over

00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:43,129
and over every day you're going to

00:27:41,779 --> 00:27:43,999
change what version of most simply going

00:27:43,129 --> 00:27:44,989
to use you're going to change what

00:27:43,999 --> 00:27:46,009
packages you going to use you're going

00:27:44,989 --> 00:27:47,480
to change what OS you're gonna do

00:27:46,009 --> 00:27:48,679
Colonel patching you're going to have to

00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,779
move for money infrastructure another

00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:53,210
infrastructure and that's why I like

00:27:50,779 --> 00:27:56,749
wash this brush has this magnificent

00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:58,279
bowl of making all that possible so

00:27:56,749 --> 00:27:59,570
we've all heard of the unique principle

00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:04,159
of the one thing that does something

00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:05,600
well that is not bash it does not care

00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:09,649
about doing one thing well it wasn't do

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:12,350
everything which is we're definitely

00:28:09,649 --> 00:28:15,200
pros and cons that right car why does it

00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:16,609
have its own packaging system I can't

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,320
answer that question I mean I know it

00:28:16,609 --> 00:28:20,629
does and I know the print benefits of it

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,830
up but why I didn't choose to just use

00:28:20,629 --> 00:28:24,100
one of the off-the-shelf packaging

00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:29,080
systems and bundle it not entirely sure

00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:32,920
but whatever so we did dance we did

00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:35,500
gregor shoulders was how simple this 22

00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:38,380
change the system but also upgrading is

00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:40,300
it will be as equally simple they just

00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:41,980
started cutting weekly releases so like

00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:43,930
if you are doing OpenStack stuff they

00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:46,360
like six monthly releases are so stable

00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:48,700
because Cloud Foundry is running

00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:51,640
production whatever they running the

00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:54,670
production is cut and that's then the

00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,500
open source version it's really hard

00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:58,030
thing to do is to have an open source

00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,660
project that's also your production

00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:03,250
company you know money making system and

00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:04,510
and if you ever were faced with this

00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:07,510
problem app she would have invented

00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:12,210
these tools as well but it's pretty

00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:14,410
impressive so what else what else hey

00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:15,760
I'd like to spend all the rest of time

00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:18,310
just helping your book this thing up

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,260
it's two commands a little years and

00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:21,700
there's two tools failure so firstly the

00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,770
templates there's a premise of how how

00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,660
does this even possible that new

00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:27,820
versions come out and and you can keep

00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:29,320
using the same tools on apps legacy

00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:33,490
stuff and there's a whole system and

00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:35,170
templates such that it knows for any

00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:36,910
given version of flyer page that came

00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:37,990
out for any given infrastructure you

00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:40,420
might be running it on and whatever

00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:41,500
diplomat sighs there's a template and

00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:43,330
perhaps I'm just impressing myself

00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:46,150
eprint don't appreciate the problem

00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:48,700
that's trying to sell but it really is

00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:50,140
as easy as the video and now they're

00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,190
just two tools you need to use one is to

00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:53,680
get bus running which has completely

00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:55,600
skipped over brush is like chef server

00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:58,300
it's a thing that runs you're gonna run

00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,520
a 1pm or many bm's and there's one

00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:02,380
command line to run for that that's that

00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:05,290
command line at the top which you can't

00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:07,150
read Bosh bootstrap to play and ask you

00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:09,580
some questions you've ever used for

00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:12,190
before and you've got file or we'll just

00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:14,410
steal that and start using it and then

00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:16,780
you'll have gosh takes about 10 minutes

00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:17,860
and pretty quick and then you have the

00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:20,560
problem of how do i deploy in the cloud

00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:22,000
foundry and then you use the tool we

00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,010
sort of talked about witches you just

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,840
run wash prepare CF which is going to

00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:28,990
upload a bunch of stuff to to the boss

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,400
is it washes owns the universe when

00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:31,780
you're deploying something the bar

00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,790
does not go out to the rest of the world

00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:36,220
and say our review jens say you're awake

00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:37,840
and you up I'd like some gems please

00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:40,150
like you'd help any chance you can do

00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,190
something for me today so if you've ever

00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:43,900
experienced we've been inconvenience by

00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:44,430
those two systems which is the ones that

00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:47,640
come to mind

00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:50,710
debian possibly have outages I'm sure

00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:52,930
bus services you know I'm going to be in

00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:55,030
charge of everything all right just give

00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:58,150
me all the bits and I will guarantee

00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:59,650
that this works and so that's what the

00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:01,810
prepare step is it's giving it the base

00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:03,520
stem cell the image the OS image so on

00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:06,070
amazon it's keeping it the bits that are

00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,600
going to become an ami on OpenStack is

00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:10,600
going to give it the bits that become an

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:13,680
OpenStack image and then the crate CF is

00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:16,750
where it starts building up the MS and

00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:20,290
there the projects I could talk for

00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:23,560
hours I chose not to because I don't

00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:25,330
want to make a second point I've done

00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:27,400
the same for six months this is this is

00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:29,470
awesome I you know if you don't need to

00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,150
run cloud foundry I hope at least now

00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,710
that you meet someone they work in a

00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:34,990
crap environment and they want to have

00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:38,080
nice shiny toys you can either send them

00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:40,870
to me and I'll fix him up well I'll do

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,880
is I'll tell go meet these two things or

00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:43,890
you can point them to to project to say

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,220
you can run your own cloud foundry

00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:57,150
anyone can have nice things nice things

00:31:48,220 --> 00:32:01,240
of everyone and I I don't want to stop

00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:03,700
but I think that we should use the rest

00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:06,370
of time to look at those two projects

00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:09,700
and to run them except they take like

00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:11,980
hours to run ah good enough

00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:14,170
infrastructure from scratch isn't quick

00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:15,850
all right the quickness happens later on

00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:18,700
when you get two containers but managing

00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:21,730
OpenStack moving yeah gigabytes of its

00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:23,530
around is no quick I'm sorry I hope down

00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:25,510
the track filter you have cloud foundry

00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:26,830
size problems for your company I hope

00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,240
you all go back into a crap working

00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:31,000
environments you think I need to fix

00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,620
this and I'm going to use 500 because I

00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,150
think it's gonna solve most of those

00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:36,150
sorts of problems so thank you very much

00:33:06,669 --> 00:33:08,730
