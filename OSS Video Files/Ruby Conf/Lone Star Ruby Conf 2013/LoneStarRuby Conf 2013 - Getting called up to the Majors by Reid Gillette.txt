Title: LoneStarRuby Conf 2013 - Getting called up to the Majors by Reid Gillette
Publication date: 2020-01-28
Playlist: Lone Star Ruby Conf 2013
Description: 
	Shifting from an amateur web developer hacking away at my own projects in my living room to a professional Software Engineer at a startup in San Francisco was a huge change in the way I developed. After joining Mavenlink a year ago I went from tiny apps that were 100% my code, with fast test suites, hosted on Heroku to a giant Rails app with a complicated data model, a CI test suite that took an hour, and a legacy codebase touched by 30+ people. I've worked hard the last year to step up to the challenge and I've learned so much in the process. As the developer pool gets more and more junior there will be more people making the same journey as I did.

In this talk I will cover:

skills that are important (some I had, others I had to develop)
iteration planning
testing
debugging/support
polyglot skills
contributing to a team much more skilled than you
pair-programming with someone much more senior or junior than you
how culture at Mavenlink has helped me succeed
what you can do to help onboard and train up your Junior Developers
things you should look for in a Junior Developer candidate

before i get to started my name is

00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:23,689
reggie let and i wanted to share my

00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:25,279
story how I ended up being a

00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:28,430
professional web developer which I've

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,679
been for last year before we get too far

00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:33,440
along just to get an idea of what kind

00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:36,559
of audience I have how many people here

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,250
are what I'll describe as junior

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:44,839
developers so people who aren't doing

00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:47,719
professionally good good welcome because

00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:52,760
I don't know if you I was here two years

00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:55,520
ago and sort of felt like an interloper

00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,530
or that I was sneaking around among

00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,320
people who were supposed to be here but

00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:02,449
I hope by now you've you figured out

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,910
that you are supposed to be here this is

00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:06,920
where you're supposed to be and good for

00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:09,950
you for being here that's a important

00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:13,429
step and just out of curiosity where's

00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:17,060
the more senior people for perhaps the

00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:19,720
people who are supervising and a couple

00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:23,030
of them too good good welcome everybody

00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:26,960
so I started putting this together and

00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:28,820
as I was thinking about all of the

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,340
different things that I wanted to share

00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:33,320
i realized there was a common common

00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,850
thread between everything everything was

00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:39,170
was coming back to the people that i met

00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:41,780
the people that I was interacting with

00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:43,460
the people that encouraged me and so I

00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:47,119
wanted to introduce you to a couple of

00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:51,500
those people now the first one is Felix

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:57,880
and he displayed despite the photo he's

00:01:51,500 --> 00:02:00,860
actually a real generous nice guy and I

00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,479
was friends with Felix before I wasn't

00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:04,780
doing any development i was just happily

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:09,979
designing retaining walls along highways

00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:13,010
none the wiser and after fiddling around

00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:15,530
with some PHP because that's what i had

00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:19,220
fiddled with before writing a web app

00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:21,380
database backed it was kind of a kind of

00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,669
a nightmare i didn't know frameworks i

00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:26,700
didn't know anything so i was basically

00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:29,459
writing this ORM by hand

00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,410
and in PHP really horribly and I happen

00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:33,120
to mention to him that I was doing this

00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,550
and he said you've got to check out Ruby

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,330
on Rails I was like really he said yeah

00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:42,230
so I got the Exile web development on

00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:45,150
Rails like probably many people here

00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:49,470
potentially did and started developing

00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:51,780
that and as I i did that i had this

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,310
resource in felix i could go and talk to

00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,709
him hey i'm running into this problem

00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,860
hey here's the here's what the

00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:00,959
interaction that i'm trying to create

00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:03,209
what do you think and he was an amazing

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:08,519
sounding board now we never never paired

00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:10,019
it was never that close I honestly I'm

00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,880
not even sure he's ever seen any code

00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:13,290
that I've actually written but we we did

00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,420
a lot of white boarding we did a lot of

00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:18,209
disk discussing that discussing of

00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:21,180
technologies and things like that and he

00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:24,660
was he encouraged me to come to lonestar

00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:29,340
two years ago and that was incredibly

00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:32,549
valuable and then a year ago he and I

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:35,989
also went to ruby comp or sorry rescomp

00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:39,120
in here in Austin and that's when I met

00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:42,660
andrew andrew is the vice president of

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,600
maven link and met up with him

00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:50,370
interviewed we seem to get along he

00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:54,540
seemed to understand my passion for what

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:57,540
I was doing and talking and learned a

00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:01,380
lot about maven link about pairing about

00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:05,340
the their stack and oh what they could

00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:07,019
offer and he said in a informal

00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,760
conversation we had that later we picked

00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:10,200
up later you kind of said would you be

00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,599
interested in moving to San Francisco

00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:16,109
well I had come come to rails comp

00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:18,599
without any i said i was going to look

00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:21,599
for a job but I never actually thought I

00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:24,120
would look for a job and all of a sudden

00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:25,979
somebody's saying would you be

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,840
interested in moving to San Francisco

00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:29,880
and I thought about it after a while and

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,890
I was like yeah actually I would be

00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:37,260
interested in moving to San Francisco so

00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:39,840
accepted an offer and it was about three

00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:43,650
weeks in between accepting the offer I

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,890
sold everything I owned and moved to San

00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:48,510
Francisco with two but duffel bags into

00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:51,900
moving into a hotel room that I had for

00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:53,820
two weeks it was it was awfully intense

00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:56,130
it was it was kind of crazy I don't know

00:04:53,820 --> 00:05:00,150
if I could do it again but it has turned

00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:04,740
out really great and so working at maven

00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:06,360
link i found i met another person and he

00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:11,370
wouldn't give me a picture so he gets a

00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:13,469
grumpy cat picture uh so Chris his his

00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,390
background he had been with maven link

00:05:13,469 --> 00:05:18,390
for maybe six months or so by the time I

00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:20,159
I joined and chris is not a web

00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:22,229
developer he does web development now

00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:24,060
but he wouldn't describe himself as a

00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:25,979
web developer doesn't really like web

00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:30,659
development doesn't really like Ruby

00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:34,680
that much he did some some game

00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:37,620
programming and and worked it at Kaiser

00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:41,729
a just huge the stories he tells me

00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:44,610
about working in a truly giant faceless

00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:49,340
enterprise corporation are pretty

00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:51,900
amazing but a lot of times I think

00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,700
people would would discard somebody like

00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,740
that and and because he doesn't like

00:05:53,700 --> 00:06:00,090
Ruby he doesn't he doesn't like rails

00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:03,000
and he's vocal about it but I took that

00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:06,840
as an opportunity that's that's still

00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:11,729
somebody that has been so informative to

00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:14,610
me in what in my progression as a

00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:16,530
developer because suddenly I had

00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:19,020
somebody because we we all get here in

00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:21,120
Bravo Ron Ruby's great and I like Ruby a

00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,310
whole lot but it's interesting to hear

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,620
somebody say here's what I don't like

00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:28,530
about Ruby here are things that Ruby

00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:32,460
does that is weird and because of that

00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:34,650
I've learned some Python and because he

00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,960
really likes Python and so we'll go back

00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:38,849
and forth and it's interesting too it's

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,810
nice having that resource of somebody

00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:46,469
that I can talk to and and bounce ideas

00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:49,200
off of and just because I like Ruby and

00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:51,450
he doesn't so much he's a tremendous

00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,249
resource so i would i would encourage

00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:56,999
you to not

00:06:53,249 --> 00:07:00,299
somebody who is saying who doesn't like

00:06:56,999 --> 00:07:02,879
Ruby just like we had the talk yesterday

00:07:00,299 --> 00:07:04,919
about elixir that was incredibly

00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,199
informative and that changed the way

00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:10,829
that that will affect the way that you

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:13,019
right Ruby hopefully in a in a good way

00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:17,069
even though it's functional it'll change

00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:21,029
the way you're thinking about code so it

00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:24,649
was these people and a cat but it was

00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:29,729
these people that were so important to

00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:32,909
how to my progression and my my leveling

00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:34,799
up as a developer and it wasn't just

00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:39,569
these three people there a lot of people

00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:42,179
I I actually we have a guy who's 19

00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:43,889
years old he graduated graduated high

00:07:42,179 --> 00:07:46,439
school married to his high school

00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:49,049
girlfriend and moved to San Francisco

00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:51,299
just like I did and he works there and

00:07:49,049 --> 00:07:53,189
he's one of our best developers and even

00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:55,919
though he's ten years younger than me I

00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:59,249
still like it's amazing what I can learn

00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:05,819
from him and he said he's a great

00:07:59,249 --> 00:08:08,939
developer actually and so the takeaway

00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:10,759
is the junior developers you guys are

00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:15,119
some over here and there some back there

00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:17,939
find these people and surround yourself

00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:20,360
with them and like Chris was for me they

00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:23,189
may not be who you think they are there

00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,829
they're all around I've got good news

00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:28,319
you by coming here you found a lot of

00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:30,989
them you've you found these site types

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,360
of people these are these are who you

00:08:30,989 --> 00:08:37,110
want to be around and for the senior

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:41,669
developers be this person be one of

00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:45,540
these people and Felix Felix was a i

00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:48,209
would say quote unquote mentor these

00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:51,480
other people they didn't seek out to

00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:52,860
mentor me they're not highly invested in

00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,790
and what it is they want to see me

00:08:52,860 --> 00:09:01,199
exceed but the amount of interest that

00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:03,959
they it took very little for them to

00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:06,750
encourage me and that that small amount

00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:09,810
of encouragement was worth

00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:12,750
volumes so I'd encourage you I hope I

00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:14,910
hope everybody's involved in the Ruby

00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:19,380
user groups may be around or these

00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:21,090
conferences it's you can make a whole

00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,910
lot of difference with very little

00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:26,820
effort and I'd encourage you to to try

00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:31,530
and do that wherever because it can it

00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:36,690
can really help the really help a junior

00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:40,830
developer so maven link i chose maven

00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:43,680
link for for a couple of reasons the

00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:46,760
thing that stood out to me is they did

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,560
one hundred percent pairing maven link

00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:52,140
bootstrapped their engineering bootstrap

00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,270
the app at pivotal labs I'm sure many of

00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:57,210
you have heard about that pivotal pairs

00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:59,460
all the time pivotal's philosophy on

00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:02,250
pairing is on the spectrum from

00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:05,370
everybody solos and every everybody is

00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:09,090
pairing all the time always everybody

00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:14,430
soloing has drawbacks everybody pairing

00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:16,620
has has drawbacks too and but more

00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:18,150
pairing is better than less pairing and

00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,610
so rather than try and make that

00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:23,040
distinction let's always pair and and

00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:26,700
that's that's greatly simplifying their

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,770
philosophy but and what what I was

00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,110
encouraged when I was interviewing and

00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:32,610
talking to their engineers which you

00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:34,200
should absolutely do when you're when

00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:36,300
you're looking for a job is talk to them

00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,270
and try and get a vibe what they think

00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:42,000
about the company almost almost try and

00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:44,190
put them in your shoes and find out what

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,630
they would say or what questions they

00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:50,339
would ask and I asked them about parent

00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:53,010
what do you think about pairing how does

00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:55,800
that work how how do you think that has

00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:59,780
helped the company and what I heard from

00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:03,780
several people is we pair all the time

00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:06,839
it's not it's not the the Silver Bullet

00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:10,620
it doesn't solve every problem but

00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:14,130
that's what we do and hearing hearing

00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:15,510
that realization of hey this we know

00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:18,810
that this isn't always the best thing

00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:20,279
but it's what we do that that to me told

00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:22,740
me that it wasn't it was

00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:24,660
pairing pairing there wasn't dogma and

00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,220
that told me that a lot of things

00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:30,029
weren't dying but they were interested

00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:32,370
in being flexible in moving around being

00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:34,019
willing to change things that weren't

00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,490
working it wasn't just going to we're

00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:37,980
going to continue trying to do that and

00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:42,870
that that was comforting the code base

00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:46,019
at maven link when I joined they had

00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:49,860
just upgraded to rails 3 2 this is an

00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:53,339
app that started pre rails 23 and a lot

00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:55,949
of engineering effort went into keeping

00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:59,850
that up and it made me feel comfortable

00:11:55,949 --> 00:12:03,230
because as a junior developer I had not

00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:06,689
really used rails two three or earlier

00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:09,769
and so I felt comfortable that I could I

00:12:06,689 --> 00:12:13,079
could go in and read the code and

00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:14,639
contribute immediately I wouldn't have

00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:18,149
this huge learning curve and that was

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:20,759
important to me and the dev stack was

00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:22,769
very similar to what i was using we use

00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:26,309
Ruby mine which is something I hadn't

00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:28,829
used but generally my sequel that kind

00:12:26,309 --> 00:12:32,879
of things it's pretty typical rail stack

00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:36,300
but it was it was important to me to

00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:40,350
feel comfortable because I much like I

00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:42,300
said at my first lonestar that I felt

00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:45,449
like an air Loper I kind of felt like I

00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:50,040
had tricked them into hiring me and I

00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:52,589
know that's not the case now and I think

00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:56,610
that was that was critical when I when I

00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:59,250
interviewed I I almost tried to not let

00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:02,459
them hire me I was very upfront and very

00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:04,829
vocal of here's what I don't know here's

00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:06,629
here are things that maybe I'd like to

00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:09,800
look into but I can't because I'm just

00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:15,029
doing this in my living room here are

00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:17,879
gaps in my skills that I know and by

00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:21,569
telling them that I then felt confident

00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:23,959
that they hired me knowing that I didn't

00:13:21,569 --> 00:13:28,019
I didn't trick them into doing that and

00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:31,110
that also let them know hey he knows

00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:33,370
about these things that means he's going

00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:35,920
to try and correct these or or

00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:42,180
not correct but but fill this in that

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:49,110
was a was a show of of passion of me and

00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:52,240
the it allowed allowed a a focus on

00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:56,500
those things I didn't do a whole lot of

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:59,320
JavaScript I pretty much began 2013 i

00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:01,990
had my six-month performance review and

00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,300
they asked what do you want to work on i

00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:06,970
said well i still don't feel super

00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:09,910
confident in JavaScript can I do more of

00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:12,640
that and I said sure and so most of the

00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:15,339
last six months I've been doing backbone

00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,500
and its really helped and it's nice to

00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:19,900
have a company that will let me do that

00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:22,270
they know hey you're not as strong here

00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,710
you want to be strong let's put you in

00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:27,430
that position so that you can succeed

00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:29,830
and it's through people like Chris who

00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:32,230
can't who have helped me learn that

00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:37,900
because I can ask him these questions

00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:39,880
and I get both the good and the bad I'll

00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:44,529
talk a little bit more about pairing

00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:48,550
because I pairing has been absolutely

00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:51,850
critical in bringing bringing me up we

00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:55,300
actually hire we have a fairly junior

00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:57,250
junior team and I don't I don't know

00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:00,580
it's alec in here I don't see you oh

00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:05,890
he's back there Alec is also from maven

00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:10,770
link and he was also hired as a junior

00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:13,839
developer and it's very good for

00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:15,790
training people I don't have have the

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:23,770
junior people had much exposure to

00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:26,580
pairing some so the there's kind of two

00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:29,800
ways that we would end up pairing and

00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:34,450
sometimes it would be jr. jr. and that's

00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:37,080
not necessarily jr. jr. was good putting

00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:39,940
two junior people together was good for

00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:46,300
certain bug fixes certain things like

00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:47,139
that but the it sort of becomes a blind

00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:52,329
leading the blind

00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:54,790
to a certain extent what was best I felt

00:15:52,329 --> 00:15:57,819
was pairing a junior person with a

00:15:54,790 --> 00:16:01,989
senior person and this this has a big

00:15:57,819 --> 00:16:04,049
downside which is you can fatigue your

00:16:01,989 --> 00:16:09,399
senior the senior person in that pair

00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:11,470
pretty easily it works well to match

00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:14,049
strengths with weaknesses for example

00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:16,779
Chris doesn't know rails as well or

00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:18,220
didn't when I started and but I actually

00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:20,980
even though he was a much better

00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:24,069
developer than I was I knew more rails

00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:27,279
than he did and that was that worked

00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:29,829
really well between us because he knew

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,809
the code base he knew better what

00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:35,290
techniques he wanted to use but I knew

00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:37,660
how to get it done in rails and so he'd

00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:39,850
go you'd go put something in there I was

00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:45,419
like oh we can just use pluck in this

00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:48,429
case and that that was also very

00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:51,220
supportive to me because once again it

00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:53,649
gave me the opportunity to feel like I

00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:55,689
was contributing like I hey this guy has

00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:59,709
way more experience I'm the junior in

00:16:55,689 --> 00:17:03,549
this pair but I can help him learn he

00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:09,699
can help me learn more recently we did a

00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:12,459
project where we it was sort of we call

00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:14,949
it extreme pairing kind of with a wink

00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:17,079
because it's really more two people

00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:23,439
working on separate things next to each

00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:27,569
other we it's not soloing what we did on

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:29,500
this project it was I was regularly

00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:31,840
conversing with him he was regularly

00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,580
conversing with me both on what he was

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,799
working on and what I was working on

00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:38,559
there was still a shared contacts it

00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:41,070
just wasn't two people at the same

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:44,350
computer and it worked out really well

00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:47,019
in in that case front end versus back

00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:50,590
end he was doing something in backbone

00:17:47,019 --> 00:17:54,429
I'm doing something in in rails and Ruby

00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:57,250
and he'd say a I need this I need this

00:17:54,429 --> 00:18:00,440
data like give me an end point like cool

00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:04,180
I'll bust that out and create a creative

00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:08,090
controller action or add that add that

00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:11,570
at a method or output that in the JSON

00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:14,120
or whatever he needed and we were that

00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:17,030
that provided that interface the in a

00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:19,820
lot of ways our our pairing our coding

00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:21,860
mimicked how are how our respective

00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:26,290
software was going to be interacting I

00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:29,300
think that worked more for me now after

00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:32,660
working there for a year as as less of a

00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:37,000
junior and he's still much more senior

00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:42,440
than i am but i think that that is a

00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,970
very valuable tool and ping-pong pairing

00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,920
which i don't know if people are

00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:48,080
familiar with that's where one person

00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,510
would write the spec the other person

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,850
would write the implementation and

00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:54,620
that's if you're doing it correctly

00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:56,540
sometimes it turns into one person right

00:18:54,620 --> 00:19:00,740
to the implementation the other person

00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:05,920
writes the spec but that that works out

00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:09,350
really well and can be good for the

00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:11,870
because the senior person can set up the

00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:16,040
junior person and you're writing this

00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:17,960
the you have specs so you know here's

00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:22,760
what it needs to do and a lot of times

00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:25,730
the specs are going to give away what

00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:28,610
your what your the actual code needs to

00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:31,760
look like and it can become a a tutorial

00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:33,770
where the senior person can go to to to

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,730
toot and put in their their spec and

00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:39,770
then go pong and now the junior person

00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:42,710
has to sit there and drive which is

00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:47,570
critical for these junior senior pairs

00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:50,030
so tips if you're pairing as a junior

00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:54,890
and especially I'm thinking about the

00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:57,980
first month that I was there where I've

00:19:54,890 --> 00:20:01,430
never seen this code base I the amount

00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:05,210
that I can contribute I felt was very

00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:07,340
very little it's it wasn't but it was

00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:10,760
hard for me to get used to I'm coming to

00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:12,800
work I'm I'm claiming to be a web

00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:16,220
developer but I barely touched this

00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:20,000
uter it's it's a very strange feeling at

00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:22,780
first and they're there are ways you can

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,450
do that you should be following along

00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:29,630
intently see what see what they're doing

00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:32,360
and you want to look at the style

00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:35,540
because the style that you learned the

00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:38,840
style that you may be more comfortable

00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:40,850
with while that's that's perfectly

00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:44,120
acceptable you want to match the style

00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:47,780
of the code base I was I was working on

00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:52,250
my own little project for the previous

00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:55,640
place I worked for and I had a certain

00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:59,420
style a certain testing style as well

00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:02,000
and now I was in this giant code base

00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:04,580
it's my responsibility it's my job to

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,710
match that style you can you can tweak

00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:10,010
and I and I'm not as good about it as

00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:11,690
possible i'm a big fan of explicit

00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:14,270
returns and things like that which i

00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:22,760
don't see in our code base very much i

00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:24,500
just got to get a no head shake but it's

00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,890
important to do that because it you'll

00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:30,320
find eventually those those lines of

00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:33,740
code even if it's in the style that you

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,720
like they will stick out like a sore

00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:37,760
thumb as you're scrolling through your

00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,920
like who wrote this method or I've I've

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,600
before gone who wrote this method this

00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,820
doesn't look anything like the rest of

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,470
this code base and I'll go over and i

00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:47,720
know i shouldn't but I get blame it and

00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:50,500
and sure enough there it says Gillette

00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:53,230
right next to it I'm like ha and

00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:56,630
sometimes i rewrite sometimes I don't

00:21:53,230 --> 00:22:01,220
this was also something that I gained a

00:21:56,630 --> 00:22:03,170
lot from senior watching the senior

00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:06,800
people do it is there there would kind

00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:09,140
of be on a particular particularly hard

00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:13,190
problem they'd implement it in their own

00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:16,520
style get the specs to pass and then

00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:20,810
refactor it into the quote-unquote maven

00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:24,340
link style you should also be asking

00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:26,320
questions and as

00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:29,830
as a junior developer it is your

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:33,279
responsibility to ask questions if you

00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:37,809
don't understand like I said I tried to

00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:40,720
tell them here's what I don't know and I

00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:42,580
couched it in here's what I'd still like

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,179
to learn but effectively I was telling

00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:49,120
them here's what I don't know and you

00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:51,750
should be asking questions and if it's a

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,429
company that has a pairing culture

00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:56,559
you'll be expected that to ask questions

00:22:54,429 --> 00:22:59,770
and you should do that don't hesitate to

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:02,200
interrupt and if they may be in the

00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:04,870
middle of a thought they'll finish that

00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:08,070
thought and come back come back that's

00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:11,470
that's kind of the pairing contract and

00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:16,990
you should also try and drive which

00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:19,179
actually operating the keyboard it it

00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:22,120
will feel intimidating it will feel

00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:27,760
slower especially especially early on

00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:30,520
but I think Katrina was saying you have

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:33,520
to practice and this is this is how you

00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:35,679
will get better and I was I was not

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:39,190
particularly good at driving I would

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:42,070
follow along I would be engaged but this

00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:44,710
guy can type faster than me he's much

00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:48,070
better at operating an IDE and all of

00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:51,820
this so I'll just let him him do it I'd

00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:54,460
still work with him do it I was severely

00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:56,169
holding myself back and and the last six

00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:59,039
months especially i've been i've been

00:23:56,169 --> 00:24:03,730
trying to be aggressive at the keyboard

00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:06,010
and that has that has really helped so I

00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:10,770
would encourage you do not feel

00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:13,960
intimidated you you will be rewarded

00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:16,029
handsomely for taking that initiative

00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:19,990
and grabbing that keyboard whenever

00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:21,789
possible it there is a I will put an

00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:24,370
asterisk there you do have to get a feel

00:24:21,789 --> 00:24:29,169
for the pair there's there is a given

00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:32,320
give and take but if you're a senior

00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:34,990
developer working with a junior

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,659
developer there's a lot of there's some

00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:43,299
things that you can do you should

00:24:38,659 --> 00:24:49,190
explain the why of a solution if if they

00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:53,269
don't seem to be following an example

00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:55,639
would be we we use for matching

00:24:53,269 --> 00:25:00,139
determining you know if it's if it's a

00:24:55,639 --> 00:25:05,509
if two objects belong if one object is

00:25:00,139 --> 00:25:07,970
is maybe the like primary contract on an

00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:10,669
account or something like that you could

00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:15,799
you could just say dot account equals at

00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:18,649
account or dot dot contract equals at

00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:23,450
contract you could absolutely do that

00:25:18,649 --> 00:25:26,419
what we do and it's the style is use dot

00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:31,279
contract underscore ID equals contract

00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:33,799
ID because that that saves you another

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,479
potentially saves you another database

00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:36,950
lookup and you're still comparing IDs

00:25:35,479 --> 00:25:40,009
you're still doing the same comparison

00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:43,820
comparison and that's a that's a very

00:25:40,009 --> 00:25:46,220
basic explanation but explaining that

00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:49,149
may not be readily apparent to to a

00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:51,739
junior developer sitting next to you so

00:25:49,149 --> 00:25:54,309
explain why you're doing that because

00:25:51,739 --> 00:25:58,549
I'm sure they're they're smart they'll

00:25:54,309 --> 00:26:00,169
they'll know that that works but they

00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:02,359
may not immediate may not be read of

00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:07,639
readily apparent why you're doing that

00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:09,019
over some other solution and try and try

00:26:07,639 --> 00:26:10,609
and let the junior drive try and

00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:13,369
encourage them to drive ping-pong

00:26:10,609 --> 00:26:17,029
pairing is is a is one great way to do

00:26:13,369 --> 00:26:18,710
that because pong and take your keys off

00:26:17,029 --> 00:26:20,299
the keyboard you make a big show of it

00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:25,609
like I was doing that's kind of the joke

00:26:20,299 --> 00:26:26,989
that we do and so I side note we we

00:26:25,609 --> 00:26:29,299
typically do that as somebody will

00:26:26,989 --> 00:26:31,099
somebody will be doing some terrible

00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:32,809
implementation and get to a part in the

00:26:31,099 --> 00:26:34,609
problem that they can no longer figure

00:26:32,809 --> 00:26:37,639
out and they'll just kind of go uh huh

00:26:34,609 --> 00:26:38,929
huh ok pong as though they they've got

00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:40,460
it figured out now it's time for the

00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:42,649
other person to just implement the test

00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:49,190
when really they didn't figure it out

00:26:42,649 --> 00:26:52,259
but it's also good to show show your

00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:57,369
style versus the company style

00:26:52,259 --> 00:27:00,700
that that has been that has helped me a

00:26:57,369 --> 00:27:03,190
lot in saying it may be your style may

00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:05,559
be clearer to you your style ms could be

00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:09,700
clearer to the junior pair as well and

00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:12,369
if your if your test driving you know

00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:14,769
red green refactor get it working and

00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:16,299
refactor it into something that the code

00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:20,679
base is going to be that can help them

00:27:16,299 --> 00:27:24,340
see the solution in a different way I've

00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:26,919
done that before with say an

00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:32,649
implementation of using inject versus

00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:34,960
some weird select map thing where they

00:27:32,649 --> 00:27:36,879
may be used to they there may be a

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,450
better understanding of how select and

00:27:36,879 --> 00:27:42,220
map or reject or one of one of those

00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:45,940
innumerable things work but they may be

00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:47,559
less comfortable with inject and it

00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:50,169
becomes a really good tool because you

00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:53,769
can implement it in a way that maybe

00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:56,499
makes it is clearer or air is clear in

00:27:53,769 --> 00:27:59,409
one context you have the specs you know

00:27:56,499 --> 00:28:03,869
the specs pass then you can demonstrate

00:27:59,409 --> 00:28:07,539
here's how inject works here's how this

00:28:03,869 --> 00:28:11,710
this series of methods works with inject

00:28:07,539 --> 00:28:13,899
and you do or you had your read your

00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:15,669
grain and then you can refactor and the

00:28:13,899 --> 00:28:19,599
specs stay green it's a good good

00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:23,139
reinforcement of it and I talked a

00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:26,349
little bit about our extreme pairing

00:28:23,139 --> 00:28:30,220
we've done a little bit of soloing since

00:28:26,349 --> 00:28:35,679
I've I've been there this kind of grew

00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:38,200
out of my own or how I started doing

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:45,279
some soloing at work was my own interest

00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:50,080
and there's there's a it was good on on

00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:52,299
maven link Andrew who I introduced 11

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,190
weekend for the heck of it I was playing

00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:58,629
around with ec2 and set up a minecraft

00:28:54,190 --> 00:29:01,149
server on ec2 just I had no intention of

00:28:58,629 --> 00:29:03,849
actually running a minecraft server I

00:29:01,149 --> 00:29:05,080
just wanted to play with ec2 that seemed

00:29:03,849 --> 00:29:08,230
like something that would be fun

00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:10,060
to play around with and so in talking to

00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:12,250
Andrews like Oh what do you do this

00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:14,110
weekend oh well I set up minecraft

00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,880
server on ec2 he said oh are you

00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:17,950
interested in that would you like to

00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:21,340
keep doing that here's here's the

00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:23,380
company's amazon credentials why don't

00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:25,540
you oh it's not that bad it's not that

00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:30,070
bad why don't you play around with our

00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:32,260
CI server and because we were using

00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:34,660
Jenkins at the time and he's like we

00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:37,750
don't really like how are how the CI

00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:40,590
server is why don't you log on see see

00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:47,200
what you can do with it and so over over

00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:51,730
23 months I rebuilt our CI server mostly

00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:56,350
in in my own time but now I really know

00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:59,680
how that all works all of that all of

00:29:56,350 --> 00:30:02,020
that struggle and if you if you get an

00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,940
opportunity here's a here's a pro tip

00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:07,090
for junior developers if you get an

00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:09,490
opportunity to set up a continuous

00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:13,600
integration server dump it's a bag of

00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:15,760
hurt we've we've since moved to Travis

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:18,280
Travis's kind of its own bag of hurt and

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:23,020
completely different completely separate

00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:27,190
problems but it now it's as somebody

00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:28,930
else you get soloing even on certain

00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:31,630
things over the Christmas break we

00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:34,980
nobody came into the office and those

00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:39,670
that weren't taking vacation so load and

00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:41,770
that the feature that I worked on I feel

00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:44,110
incredible ownership I feel more

00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:46,990
ownership from that thing that I did six

00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:50,980
months ago then the thing I did too two

00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:53,020
months ago and I couldn't wait as soon

00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:54,760
as we get back from Christmas I couldn't

00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,200
wait to get that thing that I worked on

00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,730
over Christmas into the code base

00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:01,060
because that was mine and there were

00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:02,830
very few things that I felt were mine

00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:05,290
and that's that's a downside of pairing

00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:11,440
you do lose that sense of sense of

00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:15,550
ownership and you're not you're not

00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:19,000
alone as you're doing this it's soloing

00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:22,480
but we're on HipChat

00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,910
were sitting next to to a person they're

00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,790
there to ask questions I asked questions

00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:29,230
about about side projects that I'm

00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:31,210
working on I was doing ember I'm the

00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:34,330
only only person in our office who has

00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:36,610
experienced an ember but that's even

00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:38,650
been valuable to ask them you know how

00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:41,050
would you how would you troubleshoot

00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:42,340
this and inevitably they're like oh put

00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:43,570
a console log is like well that's not

00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:47,800
going to work in amber because there's a

00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:51,130
run loop anyway I digress you're there

00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:53,860
still advise and and questions and you

00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:57,880
can learn a lot from having to ask

00:31:53,860 --> 00:32:03,370
questions too it's very easy to ramble

00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:05,650
in your solution and having to get that

00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:07,390
question having to ask somebody who

00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:10,060
doesn't know anything about the problem

00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:12,100
you're trying to solve you can it's a

00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:17,800
skill to be able to boil that down to

00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:21,210
three sentences that tells them what

00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:25,840
that that helps them answer the question

00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:29,350
and one one last thing i'm almost at a

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:33,760
time here hiring a junior dev you want

00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:36,910
to see I I notice the the not just

00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:40,830
looking for a paycheck which isn't to

00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:44,050
say not looking for an actual job I've

00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:48,220
in in San Francisco especially i'm not

00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:52,630
sure what it's like in in austin there's

00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:54,460
there's programs that that train of devs

00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:58,650
and i think i think that's those are

00:32:54,460 --> 00:33:03,550
those are very good in san francisco

00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:04,930
especially there seems to be because of

00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:06,640
the startup culture there's a lot of

00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:08,020
people who are involved in startups but

00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,710
not the engineering side they're in the

00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:13,960
business side and there there have been

00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:15,790
people who were doing that and went hey

00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,830
this startup stuffs kind of fun all

00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:19,870
those engineers over there they make a

00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:21,910
lot more money than me and it looks like

00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:24,760
they're having a great time and aren't

00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:28,030
working very hard and I'll go do that

00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:32,530
and they don't have the passion and

00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:34,450
drive that I think is is really valuable

00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:39,270
and and don't have a desire to learn

00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:39,270
there they got hired there they're done

00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:45,970
for the the junior developers here you

00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:52,870
are not those people by the very nature

00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:54,310
that you're here and so finding looking

00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:56,890
for that drive looking for that desire

00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:59,680
to learn will will get you the absolute

00:33:56,890 --> 00:34:03,430
best junior developers that that you can

00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:04,930
find and they they are out there and it

00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:07,450
worked out really well I was hired as

00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:10,000
junior I'd like I like to believe that I

00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:12,669
contribute a lot to maven link maven

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,980
link has contributed a lot to me and I'm

00:34:12,669 --> 00:34:17,590
very grateful to that and also to this

00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:19,840
community that that was a foundation

00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:25,990
that I was able to stand on in order to

00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:30,310
achieve that I think that's all the all

00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:32,919
the time I have please come come talk to

00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:35,380
me I very much would like to talk to

00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:39,659
anybody but especially the junior does

00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:39,659
because I know it can be intimidating

00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:48,659
