Description: 
	Rails Engines are useful. We can make our code well structured and reusable using Engines.

Rails Engines are fun. You can publish your Engine repo to the world, then make yourself and the world better and happier.

During my talk, you will get to know what exactly Rails::Engine is, and you will see some of my crazy Engine tips, ideas, and implementations around Rails::Engine.
