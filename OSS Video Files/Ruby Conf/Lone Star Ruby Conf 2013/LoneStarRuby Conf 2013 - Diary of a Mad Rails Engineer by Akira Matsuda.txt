Title: LoneStarRuby Conf 2013 - Diary of a Mad Rails Engineer by Akira Matsuda
Publication date: 2020-01-28
Playlist: Lone Star Ruby Conf 2013
Description: 
	Rails Engines are useful. We can make our code well structured and reusable using Engines.

Rails Engines are fun. You can publish your Engine repo to the world, then make yourself and the world better and happier.

Rails Engine is a sophisticated system. Even though çŒ¿äºº (en-jin) in Japanese means "ape-man".

Rails Engine is zen. Everything in our Rails app is an Engine, and Engine is everything. Even the Rails app itself should also be an Engine.

During my talk, you will get to know what exactly Rails::Engine is, and you will see some of my crazy Engine tips, ideas, and implementations around Rails::Engine.

percentage you but I heard bless you the

00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:19,390
language creator max Kyoto business

00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:30,820
conference right so my biggest insist

00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:35,380
the problem is here I ok you see man's

00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:40,030
name spelled Japanese like this and his

00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:44,800
family name of the model shares the same

00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:48,659
contractor my night actually actually we

00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:52,780
shave it the most important one for him

00:01:48,659 --> 00:02:00,820
which paper knows not so you see

00:01:52,780 --> 00:02:05,970
obviously i also met uh but please don't

00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:16,959

00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:23,650
so and I on a bit more about myself I'm

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:28,350
a monster object on github ignore these

00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:28,350
things Ruby language rails

00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:51,780
on the road oxido hardy which is the

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:55,260
most definitely excellent video on

00:02:51,780 --> 00:03:03,180
everything everybody chooses so we did

00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:06,060
like what I do want to do and ok Reuben

00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:13,340
hi so today Oh Bravo be reduced as a

00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:18,840
title for Gaza the relief Kylie 2014

00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:24,629
thank you would probably be held around

00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:32,720
September's please schedule on your iPad

00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:32,720
work I mean I James Isis

00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:44,310
see here so next year it's your turn to

00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:50,260
come through again so the question for

00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:57,340
you we here are giving yourself as a

00:03:50,260 --> 00:04:01,720
real engineer is riveting okay plus

00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:04,230
thank you also let me stalking talk with

00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:10,840
a quotation that defines what is

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:14,560
engineered so you know this like this

00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:20,410
this person is a creator of both Ruby

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:24,760
board and play experience is the most is

00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:28,000
a extremely wonderful program and he

00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:32,140
shared his excellent where one thing he

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,110
talks to an engineer / Boeing Company

00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:38,140
and introduced himself as a software

00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:41,770
engineer then the going man really got

00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:44,500
angry and said hey hey you shall call

00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:52,750
yourself an engineer LSU word around

00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:55,570
engines like me so literally that guy

00:04:52,750 --> 00:05:00,090
works for engines and he said that we

00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:03,880
software engineers are Paul's interview

00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:06,180
but very luckily we still have a chance

00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:09,490
to be an engineer

00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:14,770
probably the Boeing man's a note but all

00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:17,800
framework rail also have engines so so

00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:20,980
let's hang on growth engines then we'll

00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:34,750
be able to be genuine software engineers

00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:38,470
right so what engine this is engine is

00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:44,440
the rails again and engines can be

00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:47,230
consumed miniature applications I cited

00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:51,070
is from rail choice thank you and you

00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:53,260
are a divided so some of you might

00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:57,960
remember that they had been a blogging

00:05:53,260 --> 00:06:01,630
platform of engines in yes rebels 10

00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:05,280
that provides for example like login

00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:08,610
engine wasn't it but this one is

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,610
something's afraid

00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,240
actually

00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:19,520
real ng and ism is the kind of Prince

00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,890
ballgame said engine is ready for you

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:27,410
and Rispoli n is actually moving with a

00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:30,800
chip in round three and four seven so

00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:35,090
firstly let's explore layout rails

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:44,920
plugin from bottom up you know what does

00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:44,920
hand grips these realms application

00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:12,590
so first thing we need brain engine is

00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:17,570
just Christmas a plug-in is this year so

00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:21,800
the gym so it should be like this this

00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:26,980
is the skimmer the gens take that as the

00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,980
minimum requires its maintenance Bridget

00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:41,340
so it's very fun

00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,800
you

00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:23,660
me

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,660
yes thank you

00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:50,670
Helen bond off and come on up there

00:08:51,029 --> 00:09:00,240
successfully reasons you check

00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,880
actually

00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:20,010
it's in my law is all

00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:32,850
so make sure that the gym is probably

00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:39,089
loaded let's check a little bit because

00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:39,089
revision adds little origin

00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,670
sorry baby

00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,610
yes

00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:55,390
okay with a bug in this look it doesn't

00:10:49,480 --> 00:11:01,570
do anything right so given does not have

00:10:55,390 --> 00:11:04,590
the late directory in so thanks let's

00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,590
implement a future

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:45,640
so so this should be actually quite

00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:49,240
peaceful beautiful volume in every time

00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:53,320
you started anybody server or consular

00:11:49,240 --> 00:12:04,450
whatever is this hello to you it makes

00:11:53,320 --> 00:12:08,800
it happy so now that I've image am NOT a

00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:16,680
biggity a bit deeper you know to see how

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:21,970
it works provision as color corrected ok

00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:25,900
then someone called the illness RB and

00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:29,890
RC an autogiro somehow that's why with

00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:33,460
hello world chosen right so let's see

00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:35,710
football you can check it like this I

00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:41,910
don't do this because I don't have

00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:45,840
enough confidence but this shows that

00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:51,579
the caller was polymer unless required

00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:58,370
option yeah seeing this this

00:12:51,579 --> 00:13:02,209
just cause Colonel dog before with final

00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:05,450
Hardman and file argument with James

00:13:02,209 --> 00:13:08,300
Bennett is also required for his name

00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:10,760
and I didn't say anything to also

00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:14,180
required to itself just requires good

00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:17,510
name there's equivalency required and

00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:22,339
miss Morrissey the plugins name that's

00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:24,470
why I n since slavery was included is a

00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:27,500
look that's a final agreement good point

00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:33,709
la courcel a bonus or sido bien does it

00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:36,670
then it prints out hello so support this

00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:41,019
was just a demonstration of our religion

00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:48,760
so and not like they're real specific

00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:52,510
behavior but yes it's so easy just put

00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,510
something like this easy

00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:01,720
summary knowledge

00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:08,050
but what like this just in everything

00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:11,290
ray almost felt I what is inheriting

00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:15,220
real talk and the initial icicle this

00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:21,220
actually goes and it usually selected

00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:25,510
through this this real gin and this face

00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:32,080
it it brings initializing many answered

00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:37,120
the implications an exponential so what

00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:41,110
we just have to explicitly like register

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:45,910
dings on the rock quarry into system

00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:52,920
global variable something white just

00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:57,340
just this work this is because plain

00:14:52,920 --> 00:15:03,970
inherit / 30 side it goes frances

00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:06,960
underneath it and then ends it the chow

00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:09,960
Plastics is something some grave

00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,960
consequences

00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:22,060
when your application called initialized

00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:27,730
then it

00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:33,330
finally calls real tries new inside of

00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:40,000
us knew it it knows the real time

00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:44,080
sunglasses right so this way it knows it

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:50,910
can collect the subclasses it all like

00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:50,910
specifically define it

00:15:51,420 --> 00:16:00,530
so anyway I'm not going to make it more

00:15:54,330 --> 00:16:06,810
secret this domain public is engine so

00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:11,340
rare engine it is constructed with these

00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:16,700
things so the biggest difference between

00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:21,000
grams engine and audio introduce an

00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:23,970
engine is nobody gives a but it can

00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:28,460
contain with application models and

00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:31,050
follow the students of it rolls etc and

00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:36,810
manjit should contain it so classic

00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:40,370
rails ng this example we have mine and

00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:40,370
jam and jiggle

00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:49,850
so let's very simple processes like this

00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,660
there's an Indian

00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,530
next

00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:28,990
so let's see what's supposed to happen

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:32,140
again if we inherit turn the engine

00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:36,309
please well the engine passes are headed

00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:43,630
the brilliant books on the internet both

00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:50,740
here and and the engines exits its final

00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:53,830
location pearl and from the cockpit and

00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:58,960
and then store the path into the engines

00:17:53,830 --> 00:18:01,659
gracias answerable is wrong and the

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:10,620
topes is not a flea you see so that

00:18:01,659 --> 00:18:10,620
means it means without me in a class

00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:16,470
actually can be

00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:33,430
this is the one engine and again what's

00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:36,280
important is just to call engine in 30

00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:43,870
so we don't need a class option and I'm

00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:46,030
name per subject and and and now that

00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:50,430
the question is no name it doesn't have

00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:50,430
to be named space on the right

00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:02,090
so this is the smallest penalty

00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:18,680
the nominative engine should be able to

00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:21,650
contain models or controllers the folio

00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:27,710
so let's write it let's put simple

00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:30,040
request like this just say spoon and put

00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:30,040
it there

00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:12,110
and it's running

00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:28,200
it works

00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:28,200
so

00:20:29,389 --> 00:20:41,809
what happened here was engine called the

00:20:34,969 --> 00:20:44,629
food class inside the model and the

00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:48,739
loaded with the quest without being

00:20:44,629 --> 00:20:52,339
required I mean how could rails from the

00:20:48,739 --> 00:20:55,419
lupus it'll call any required first of

00:20:52,339 --> 00:20:58,219
all energy was editing to look back and

00:20:55,419 --> 00:21:03,909
second model director was headed to the

00:20:58,219 --> 00:21:06,429
engine press Bureau but I'm not going

00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:11,109
describing himself of a girl of

00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:21,709
autologous it's a bit off topic and not

00:21:11,109 --> 00:21:24,940
it so thanks so just make sure that it

00:21:21,709 --> 00:21:24,940
was added into the bureau

00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,440
so I bring out a

00:21:53,309 --> 00:21:59,090
this engine places in evil of taxes

00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:06,830
because I created a very important

00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:22,639
so almost business because uh I think

00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:27,080
I'll until time but in the same manner

00:22:22,639 --> 00:22:30,590
we can config routes and a controller

00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:34,279
and do what we want like it should just

00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:36,409
act like a rails application I think you

00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:40,009
can guess what my happens of fun no

00:22:36,409 --> 00:22:42,919
skipping so that's it that's that how

00:22:40,009 --> 00:22:46,549
about engines and that clear is an

00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:51,649
argument now now let it prove that an

00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:54,200
engine access software changing the

00:22:51,649 --> 00:23:01,250
model inside of engine could be loaded

00:22:54,200 --> 00:23:04,070
from the theory of replication right the

00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:08,000
engine is is a gem that can contain

00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:13,009
models and unfollowers and it works like

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:16,820
a fine reputation so this is handled it

00:23:13,009 --> 00:23:19,460
probably now you know the real engine of

00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:22,070
their simple but useful feature so

00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:26,240
canuck suree how this could actually be

00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:33,169
used in our applications so this is my

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:36,919
first example my first real name I

00:23:33,169 --> 00:23:40,669
created a position for game as my first

00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:46,279
reading i created this around three

00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:49,340
points 00 maybe bit worn the press

00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:52,009
release so as far as i know that this

00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:57,440
was the second rail changing the first

00:23:52,009 --> 00:23:58,649
one was Josie devotees against mine was

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:06,399
ok

00:23:58,649 --> 00:24:08,710
the line shows the engine revs engine

00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:11,590
can contain controllers model spew

00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:14,080
scalpers and pay attention library

00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:17,080
consists of model extension and helpers

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:21,600
Indians so I thought who this is but

00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:24,369
natural to people as an engine right so

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:30,580
yes that's how I can show the front row

00:24:24,369 --> 00:24:34,889
and this is how community director stop

00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:39,070
to this money has helpers and builds as

00:24:34,889 --> 00:24:47,909
just like little girls application and n

00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:47,909
pass along some and

00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:56,700
yeah actually the current version is so

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:59,010
complex so together the design pulse it

00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:02,809
i'm going to show you various movies

00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:02,809
this must be nice

00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,060
well

00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:53,880
was

00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:58,700
this one

00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:58,700
and here in laser food

00:26:05,049 --> 00:26:19,609
then we poured money ponds notify is a

00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:22,729
multi-engine it just contains so numbers

00:26:19,609 --> 00:26:25,329
don't look at this action regarding this

00:26:22,729 --> 00:26:25,329
is the board

00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:45,680
and use birthday LPS so so this wasn't a

00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:54,010
very good dog for me in short it is very

00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:56,930
sore slowly very tricky code the and

00:26:54,010 --> 00:27:01,900
expert on this great I'm not gonna

00:26:56,930 --> 00:27:08,080
explain because it's yeah off-topic

00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:08,080
entire extent exit records each semester

00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:19,820
instead you can find several my nerves

00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:22,280
about of this building works i'll be

00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:28,460
there so between visit basic look at

00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:34,900
these ideas and instead then excuse a

00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:38,060
little bit of the gems name i know that

00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:45,040
the name community is that hard for you

00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:50,710
to memorize with pronounced actually

00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:55,570
I tried to find more like English name

00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:58,000
like Beijing something finish but you

00:27:55,570 --> 00:28:01,660
know every possible name was already

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,560
taken taken so my friend is just in

00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:11,320
tonight I probably inspired by the movie

00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:17,800
and well the community the word means

00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:20,020
under or lightning check and actually

00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:23,590
gem has been mentioned by several online

00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:29,470
media like girl chance for a bit while

00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:32,470
but they say like culinary then the

00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:38,920
sound was in a slightly different

00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:41,190
reports so i brought a correct south of

00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,190
Japan

00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:09,840
yeah this is my like two year old

00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:17,460
daughter speaking miss whisset ears all

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:17,460
are equal to this so this is the breasts

00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:29,740
are warmer than 49 the next version will

00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:39,940
be zero point 15 so hopefully coming

00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:46,240
soon so yes I have only ten percent so

00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:49,990
thanks Appa gets multiple engines so the

00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:55,380
previous version of I mean with the

00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:55,380
engine had some problems life

00:29:56,330 --> 00:30:05,539
did kind of the models fellows inside

00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:08,480
easily could conflict between engine

00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:11,450
sport with sometimes with Romanians so

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:14,799
the solution since Ralph you want we

00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:18,440
have we have isolated Mountain it

00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:22,519
bonsall engine is a saint it with a bit

00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:26,330
so we can bring a model engine like this

00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:30,639
and looks like this we have another

00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:33,740
method of isolating inside the engine so

00:30:30,639 --> 00:30:37,039
what can a multiple engine do it can

00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:40,580
provide safely thanks based models

00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:45,919
controllers well it can be mounted onto

00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:47,480
the period rails entities on soon and he

00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:52,870
can make bird the parent application

00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:57,880
through the folder is use and to me so

00:30:52,870 --> 00:31:03,760
real world example I bro two examples

00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:03,760
pretty one is any relations library

00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:16,390
invited on this Laurel I developed this

00:31:10,409 --> 00:31:21,100
during real home I still think so was

00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:25,179
made in office and it's a mounted engine

00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:28,350
that those maniacs models and roasted in

00:31:25,179 --> 00:31:28,350
simulation diagram

00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:18,130
um

00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:18,130
I guess

00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,070
why

00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:29,360
long

00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:58,730
it draws state entity relationship

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:58,730
diagram and begins a bottle like this

00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:47,870
this and how it shows a relation and you

00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:50,419
also in safety positions of these ones

00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:57,549
so it's different from the PDF

00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:57,549
generation anything also change

00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,270
in vain

00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:40,960
then the gentle prd so in this gem it

00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:46,000
lows the parent applications walls right

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:48,840
from the mountain engine and this

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,840
provides these

00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,840
why women

00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:03,500
so the time

00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:21,390
it nons itself that we don't need no

00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:27,120
configuration so another example is so

00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:29,480
given all that gender draws a phase

00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,480
transition

00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:42,710
a

00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:03,970
yourself

00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:52,410
Oh

00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:28,330
for example

00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:45,610
and possess the other fat and build and

00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:45,610
please and show back right

00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,310
Oh

00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:28,060
fine

00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:43,670
draws a diagram like this you see I

00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:48,200
didn't do any documentation documented

00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:51,800
or extra programs it profits just what

00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:59,960
does it program online we generates this

00:38:51,800 --> 00:39:09,609
firm brings back right the yellow yellow

00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:09,609
one is get a bonus post and is

00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:38,270
fine I wanted to introduce one more Jam

00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:38,270
but ok another time soon ok

00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:01,920
well this year

00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:14,390
you're at least at 41 with a multiple

00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:18,800
engine so as far as i know this is this

00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:22,599
was the first month 19 and this reports

00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,599
it grows there is action

00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:59,060
this this bloody memorizes what I did

00:40:50,270 --> 00:41:03,940
and it puts guess it happy birthday sit

00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:03,940
down me Android these things

00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:42,770
