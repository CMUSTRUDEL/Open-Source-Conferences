right no seriously more often than we

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,820
see it here we hear his voice as a

00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:45,940
regular panelist on the rebuilds podcast

00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:49,360

and then as author of just all these

00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:58,000
kinds of books that help us deal with

00:01:54,940 --> 00:02:07,360
exception or write confident code etc

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:09,280
please welcome audiogram my second

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:14,520
contestant wrote the book that changed

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,520
all of our lives programming a book sir

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,330
before he did that he also wrote about

00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:27,430
the neighborhood of programming Ruby and

00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,650
before you like that he also a little

00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:33,190
bit you may have heard of called the

00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:36,610
pragmatic programmer and yeah as a

00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:38,350
signatory of the agile manifesto and all

00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:40,570
those things I think there's little

00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:43,090
about how much influence dave has had on

00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:46,019
our day-to-day development so please

00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,019
welcome Dave Thomas

00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:55,330
my third contestant is a born teacher

00:02:52,660 --> 00:03:00,520
and I know we all learn things from him

00:02:55,330 --> 00:03:02,920
every day in philosophy and when you

00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:07,140
voted to his bag he is usually spending

00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:10,750
time saving open source projects or

00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:14,710
continuing wise legacy or triaging rails

00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:16,740
issues about a million other things I'm

00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:20,880
pretty confident he does not sleep

00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:20,880
please welcome Steve clapping

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,950
alright so we have our contestants and

00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:34,760
now we need some categories for again so

00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:37,340
these will be our categories I all of

00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:40,299
these categories are related to ruby in

00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:43,849
some way except a notable exception but

00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:48,530
so this is people in history of ruby is

00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:51,620
the first category syntax a ruby so

00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:54,680
things like operators and keywords and

00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:57,819
stuff like that are fair game core

00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:00,760
method so this is anything in Ruby that

00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:04,280
you get without using a require stick

00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:07,370
it's fair game here any version of Ruby

00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:10,909
is fair damn up to and including Ruby to

00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:13,549
the standard library so anything that

00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:16,639
ships with Ruby that you can get with a

00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:19,940
require statement that's fair game any

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,940
version rails we're gonna have a rails

00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:25,669
topic and this is any version of rails

00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:28,699
up to and including rails for that newly

00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:31,760
released rails for that's rails and then

00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:34,099
the final category is a free-for-all I'm

00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:37,370
not going to tell you what's in there so

00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:41,080
choose it and find out let's see advice

00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:44,650
there so here's our game board oh yeah

00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,650
okay go right

00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:55,310
we have 200 400 600 800 and a thousand

00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:59,389
uh let's see I guess we usually choose

00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:01,400
randomly who goes first is that right I

00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:03,220
don't know somebody write a random

00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:08,480
number generator break your programmers

00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:15,050
come on red too bad sounded random deep

00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:17,120
Thomas looks like we're I'm not here to

00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:21,680
to answer questions I'm here for advice

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:24,680
on hair care products he came to around

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,180
race yeah okay so what do I have to do

00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,460
you have to start with a category and

00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,740
type the top there is that right any any

00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,900
spot on the board is accepted Deborah in

00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,340
Jack's right yep that's true it's just a

00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,229
stupid thing where you have to ask a

00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,000
question as the awesome yes yeah i'll

00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:40,130
give you the answer you give me the

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,930
French okay so and you are off to an

00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,990
excellent start

00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,990
you

00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:53,000
okay can you explain the roaster we have

00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:54,830
an assistant I had to bring an assistant

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,729
do you sit do you like my children's

00:05:54,830 --> 00:06:00,889
story here I'm a dad so I solve problems

00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:03,229
with children's toys and this is our

00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:06,850
buzzer and Dana is helping me out of

00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:06,850
that Dana give us the rules of Jeopardy

00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:16,430
okay so you essentially you call out the

00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,410
category and the price that you want so

00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:20,479
if I were playing and I wanted to play

00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:25,910
an off topic i would say on topic for

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:29,270
200 200 commits right it's 200 would be

00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:32,650
no Jimmy Rosie o yeah okay so 200 rupees

00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:36,530
and then James will read the answer and

00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:38,300
then the contestants all have to push

00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,800
their little button whoever hits it

00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,530
first will light up the other two will

00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,750
be disabled and that person who has

00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:49,729
their light on gets to ask the question

00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:52,220
that is that response to the answer okay

00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:53,840
and if you get it correct you get that

00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,910
many points and you get to ask again if

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,919
you get it wrong from when I was

00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:59,750
convince repeat until somebody gets the

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,380
answer or until James takes pity on you

00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:08,780
and gives it to you as Miss points wins

00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:11,449
okay yep hey all right all right it's

00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:19,460
not gentle and I'll take Stein apps for

00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:21,590
200 all right it is the company named

00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,330
after this operator will be pleased to

00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:24,139
hear that the rumors of its camping

00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:28,909
really one

00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:40,150
exaggerated and Steve what is a hash

00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:43,520
rocket that's it ok Stevie a choice hmm

00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:47,900
I'm intrigued I'm gonna take off topic

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,069
for 600 rupees for six monday yeah I'm

00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,039
if you're gonna do the weird thing you

00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:53,990
must look amazing this is the technique

00:07:52,039 --> 00:08:01,550
of personally cooking food so that it

00:07:53,990 --> 00:08:11,229
can be finished later his Russian trade

00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:11,229
now yeah well isn't freezing

00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:25,350
mmm luckily she rules I understand the

00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:32,430
right Steve uh what is par bacon

00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:38,800
marketing we'll take it yeah Steve again

00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:40,479
yeah let's do rails for 200 rupees well

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,419
Victor and you Steve might know

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,640
something about this category this is

00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:48,970
the only command you don't need to

00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:53,290
prefix with bundle exec comm stiff what

00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:56,980
is rails new rails knew I think we'll

00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:58,660
take it it's what is rails it was for

00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:01,480
any other command other than rails new

00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:03,550
has to be bin rails whatever the command

00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,589
okay that's a bad boy that's good yeah

00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:10,990
reason why i said recognition we're all

00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:13,330
learning things here okay so we'll take

00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:16,770
that deep interracial i should just push

00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:20,320
the advantage and go with rails for 400

00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:23,830
you way else for ya he ran out of these

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,600
categories eventually yo if you had a

00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:28,950
javascript event trigger in your

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,950
application but is misbehaving

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:46,529
Stan what is turbo links how did he know

00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:52,290
that hey Steve your choice again this is

00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:54,720
600 let's keep doing it by its routing

00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:57,269
feature can restrict matches to request

00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:01,110
on a specified subdomain you're using a

00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:06,410
given protocol this here what is

00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:06,410
constraints constraints yes that's right

00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:17,339
all right finishing off 880 going we'll

00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:19,980
get to the Ruby standard library and I

00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:22,680
enjoyed this one this no longer

00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:25,230
evacuated automation will reverse then

00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:30,389
reapply the last set of database schema

00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:38,449
changes Dave Thomas uh it's a great DP

00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:41,519
might redo their ego and backwards dare

00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:46,069
get some points okay babe your choice

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:50,519
would you like to do rails 4000 sure

00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:52,559
thing about y'all gonna get out the way

00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:57,959
rails 4000 you're gonna take that let me

00:10:52,559 --> 00:11:00,180
know it's over this rarely seen flag to

00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:03,980
the Association macros gives rails the

00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:09,629
inter ears and in memory Ruby instance

00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:14,850
Oh see we took this out and you said any

00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:20,970
versions now I'm like one easy yeah gas

00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:23,959
is going once okie what is inverse up

00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,959
there we go

00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:30,910
not out i thought we're talking with the

00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:34,900
identity map app so then don't worry

00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:38,050
inverse of is not going away Stevie gave

00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:40,210
everybody yeah yeah I'll be bad I have

00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:43,330
been your tricks I'll take standard

00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:45,480
library for 200 interlibrary 200 he's

00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:48,460
trying to get back at Steve here we go

00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:54,130
this library gives rubies cryptic global

00:11:48,460 --> 00:12:00,310
variables much more readable man what is

00:11:54,130 --> 00:12:02,860
English what is English and Steve your

00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:08,470
choice key let's do Ruby standard level

00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:10,750
4 400 or can this library can be used to

00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:13,360
generate random bytes strains of X a

00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:15,370
decimal characters here you IDs and more

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,340
does that work my lot of buzz in before

00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:25,990
you get right what is secure random base

00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:26,980
security yes that's right he said he

00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:29,020
didn't know anything about this

00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:31,830
narrative library remember i watch true

00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,830
be topless a lot

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,050
let me like it up

00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:49,480
let's do courses for 200 I Rapids for

00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:51,220
200 this mixing isn't as popular as a

00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:55,170
new mobile but it does add several

00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:59,320
methods for ordering objects datums

00:12:55,170 --> 00:13:05,260
comparable to what is comfortable oh

00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:08,080
yeah it's comparable de Vere choice oh

00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:13,030
um next one done whatever that is 400

00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:14,950
comments okay the sky raider was added

00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:17,380
as an alternative doing jet when the

00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:22,660
same object is always returned from the

00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:30,460
block Dave bonus reduce and ID what does

00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:36,150
each one object that's right ok and I'll

00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:39,580
be your choice for methods for 600

00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:41,350
methods for 600 this method flips some

00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,820
common iterators from greedy too

00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:45,010
conservative allowing for the

00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:49,060
construction of infinite data pipelines

00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:53,710
Dave Thomas to search this present yes

00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:55,870
so what is to know chewing gum that's an

00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:57,460
interesting and through fri yeah i

00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:00,060
actually make sure but it's not the one

00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,060
I have in mind

00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,460
no no

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:33,760
some people write books are moving in

00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:36,730
early may know everything Steve what is

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:40,839
lazy yeah that's right i had my it's

00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:42,459
yeah 3 me too conservative in a row you

00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:45,220
can't do it with two income as well

00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:52,270
right that's kind of a maybe how about a

00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:56,680
dancer please come back oh please we

00:14:52,270 --> 00:15:20,290
want a promise we'll add an elixir

00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:27,820
category dead we may see you got your

00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:30,279
refreshments all rise hey it's

00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:33,850
definitely debatable if Julie now does

00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:36,100
allow that I think it does but it wasn't

00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,300
there to everyone okay so second was

00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:41,360
afraid you were gonna say you were

00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:44,750
thinking of enum for which is an alien

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,910
really mean that we been bad all right

00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:48,440
Steve your choice uh we haven't done any

00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:51,620
people in history so let's do that for

00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:53,870
200 you're boring history for 200 also

00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:56,860
Steve you've counted off off topic i

00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:59,930
seem to have scared you off of that yeah

00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:04,450
here we go here's where the first two

00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:04,450
books published about Ruby and English

00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:14,990
babe i would guess programming sorry

00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:17,930
what is proving Ruby we'll all probably

00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:23,269
Ruby and Ruby way that's right presently

00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:25,670
would be in the middie way and here this

00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:27,740
one is interesting because I could not

00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:30,769
remember which one of these actually

00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:32,690
published first and I did the bet my

00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:34,519
best effort because I had a suspicion it

00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:37,610
was the Ruby way but maybe I remember

00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:40,670
that wrong and I tried to find out and

00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:42,440
the internet just is not agree on which

00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:46,149
one of these hit first they hit very

00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:48,980
close to each other in 2001 I think

00:16:46,149 --> 00:16:51,110
where's programming baby first okay they

00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:54,140
were really close like I think within a

00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:57,500
month or so and yeah those are the two

00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:59,990
books Dave their choice Oh keep on going

00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:07,569
down there please okay give my history

00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:07,569
for 400 are you saying take 2009 steep

00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:15,299
hey Dex that nightmares dead snake see

00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:18,419
now have to guess the phrase in you pick

00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:21,299
what is water weight a slide it will

00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:23,370
take that at what is a day why the lucky

00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:29,730
stiff with spoon from the Ruby cake yeah

00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:34,140
same thing right Matt all right Steve

00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:38,940
your choice to off topic for 200 rise to

00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:41,840
the challenge a dictates get there can

00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,840
be no interference

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,200
yeah what is the prime directive that's

00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:50,200
right

00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:04,270
we need that's on top a copy your choice

00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:07,630
oh how do you have points for a piece

00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:12,280
right syntax for 400 syntax before

00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:14,770
number this operator was added such as

00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,780
port method like parameters but its data

00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:22,120
and Ruby even after block parameters

00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:25,390
were enhanced babe um it's the stubby

00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:28,180
pro what is a semi-pro miss debit yes

00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:31,500
our operators stab you and us a beep

00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:34,410
rocked yeah Oh same thing that's correct

00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:40,120
Dave your choice Oh keep on going down

00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:42,160
syntaxin syntax this abuse of another

00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,870
operator is generally relegated to

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:49,780
scripting hacks that involve quick and

00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:51,460
dirty filtering of data and it's dave is

00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,960
it you're talking about the sir yes

00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,060
that's question are you talking about

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,450
the episode operated for of doing things

00:18:55,060 --> 00:19:04,480
like Tupac and stuff and yeah you should

00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:08,740
be doesn't he get a score as well

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:12,890
next time Dave will be checking my

00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:16,700
dancers right now at filtering of data I

00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:22,039
think makes it not be a person Steve

00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:27,860
Harvey I Ted shot nope we're gonna let

00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:29,779
this one go I can't show ya yes Oh what

00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,760
is the flip-flop operator and sea beasts

00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:34,010
of the range operator right filtering

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:41,330
data which is a flip-flop operator

00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:43,929
operator I don't it's not nice okay now

00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:46,630
so I'll recognize the football recognize

00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:51,289
me he not portability we're pretty sure

00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:56,330
okay so Dave your choice again why

00:19:51,289 --> 00:20:00,950
bother oh yeah I'll go from syntax again

00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:03,289
same times again even these expressions

00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:05,090
have an implicit to s typed under their

00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:06,919
results deep what is string

00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:11,289
interpolation that's correct what is it

00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:14,570
interpolation I staybridge choice uh

00:20:11,289 --> 00:20:19,010
let's do off topic for 400 topic for

00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:21,110
fork know their mother is wide music

00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:23,870
capital of the world this city hosts a

00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:27,190
nearly ruby conference steep what is

00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:27,190
Nashville know

00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:46,730
anybody else for a vacation there what's

00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:52,810
normal I'm being I'm sure if you like to

00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:52,810
take it yeah yeah

00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:06,510
there was a question mark at the end of

00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:14,700
her load up that's a range operator that

00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:17,430
you recognized me no choice um I'll go

00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:21,150
in for some abused people in history for

00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:24,000
600 in history for six hungry heels the

00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:26,070
all-time record for Wales commit ahead

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,280
of David Hyneman Hanson Aaron Patterson

00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:35,610
amor Steve who is Jeremy Kemper that's

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:39,090
correct please Jeremy Cameron and Steve

00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:44,370
beer choice uh let's do standard library

00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:50,220
for 600 600 this library the abuser

00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:58,460
level access to Ruby's parser hobby what

00:21:50,220 --> 00:22:00,480
is Ripper yes what is Ripper it's right

00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:03,210
let's go so I didn't know that's mighty

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:08,370
big nihilistic with standard library

00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:10,500
okay 400 yeah all right it got

00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:12,690
considerably easier to get this size of

00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:15,210
the terminal ruby is running in when

00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:18,150
this standard library was added what is

00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:24,059
console io console yes but is iowa

00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:27,380
console let's take all the way up to a

00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:30,000
thousand okay standard library free pass

00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:32,309
they're not its primary purpose this

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:40,320
library gives us a great one liner for

00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:41,700
launching a web server nobody knows

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,030
about this when right the examples

00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:52,400
always use Python yeah iphone how does G

00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:52,400
server no black Steve Dave United shag I

00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:59,190
remember no I don't think this one is

00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:01,380
even documented in the programming will

00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:05,010
be added the library is decorated but

00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:08,490
this use of it is not exactly um wait

00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:11,220
yeah I'm sorry I didn't mean to spoil it

00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:13,860
for your car what is on this is the one

00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:18,260
mate at primarily which gives windows

00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:23,130
commands that you would love you need

00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:25,980
not make it up if you do on its hope or

00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:28,200
I'm yeah hope I think it will explain

00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:31,890
the various commands on the last one as

00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:35,070
HTTP HTTP and it will launch I've sir

00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:40,470
yeah but sure pretty cool stuff and we

00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:43,800
got that one I was odd these pic syntax

00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:49,290
for 800 see I we only have a browsing oh

00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:51,270
ok that one this character is the only

00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:53,340
way to define a parameter list that

00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:58,290
accepts multiple arguments but sets no

00:23:53,340 --> 00:24:00,929
local variables object the splat the

00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:02,550
store yes triska what is the action

00:24:00,929 --> 00:24:04,920
strengths or a committee good splash

00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:07,800
just called in the Ruby tapas episode

00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:10,620
yeah can slurp all the arguments but not

00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:15,539
put them in variables that was obvi and

00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:19,109
your choice again off topic 300 mm

00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:20,999
here we go humans share about sixty

00:24:19,109 --> 00:24:37,769
percent of their DNA with this calming

00:24:20,999 --> 00:24:42,539
food item well what is lettuce then yes

00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:49,139
now Abby what is chicken yeah Steve

00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:50,580
you're eating again oh no no idea all

00:24:49,139 --> 00:24:54,059
right there he ain't me out incidence

00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:58,429
yeah that's right what is it began yeah

00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:58,429
sixty percent of idea name that's banana

00:25:00,109 --> 00:25:08,899
okay I believe it's your choice alright

00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:11,849
core methods 800 core methods for 800

00:25:08,899 --> 00:25:13,739
this method recently headed to a rayon

00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:20,309
range has the potential to speak at some

00:25:13,739 --> 00:25:25,229
very large data traversals I like to

00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:27,269
work on their face this one is

00:25:25,229 --> 00:25:30,119
documented in programming Ruby so dave

00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:31,889
has no excuses actually I do have an

00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:42,470
excuse i'm missing like a large part of

00:25:31,889 --> 00:25:45,179
my brain anyone going once going twice

00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:49,649
about the animals you know this one oh

00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:55,970
wait Steve wearing a jack sure about

00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:55,970
what is P each to tuck it at it ph go

00:25:56,419 --> 00:25:59,899
darkness into the DNA

00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:07,790
hey I dance do you know what this one is

00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:13,460
anyway not lazy no I'm sorry heading

00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:16,550
here cover new yep there it is what is

00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:18,770
be searched binary search was added to

00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:23,890
ruby in an iterator you can outdo

00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:23,890
iterative binary search playful side

00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:31,460
which is that one it was just a lobby

00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:35,540
yeah well people 800 people in history

00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:37,340
for 800 before his death he used his
