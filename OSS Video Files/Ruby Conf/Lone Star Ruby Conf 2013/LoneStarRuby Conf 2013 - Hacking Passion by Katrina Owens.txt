I wanted to be extraordinary if I could

00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:29,259
have chosen at 15 what to be

00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:33,940
extraordinary at I probably would have

00:00:29,259 --> 00:00:35,200
picked science I liked science I was

00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:39,940
pretty good at it too

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:43,120
but not extraordinary I'd come to

00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:46,180
believe that talent was some sort of

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,400
genetic boolean you want to have it or

00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:54,820
you don't you're born with it or you're

00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:57,340
not and I apparently was not at 15 I had

00:00:54,820 --> 00:01:00,219
not shown a single glimmer of

00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:02,320
extraordinary talent in anything and

00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:04,629
because scientists do their best work

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,590
when they're young and I was already 15

00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:14,110
I figured it was too late

00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:18,759
so I pivoted for years I tried to ferret

00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:23,320
out my innate talent I was going to be a

00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:24,850
Potter I was an apprentice Potter for

00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,439
about a week and then I was an

00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:28,810
apprentice artisan woodworker for maybe

00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:34,710
six months and I was like screw this I'm

00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:34,710
going to High School of Performing Arts

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:39,070
after three years on the tenor saxophone

00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:42,490
it was obvious that I was not cut out to

00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:45,070
be a jazz musician I was pretty good at

00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:46,840
composing things like baroque choral

00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:49,990
music so I put together an application

00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,670
for a college of musical composition for

00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,619
film and before I even sent off the

00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:56,259
application I tried out for a theatre

00:01:53,619 --> 00:02:00,700
school after a week of auditions I was

00:01:56,259 --> 00:02:02,380
inexplicably accepted as a student after

00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:06,149
a year I could tell you with certainty

00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:11,200
that theater was not my talent

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:15,760
neither was ballet or fencing or

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:18,850
contemporary French circus I tried a lot

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,190
of things and not half-heartedly either

00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:23,110
I worked really hard but whenever

00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:26,260
something is really difficult there was

00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:29,889
this voice that reasoned it must not be

00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:31,640
my talent because had it been my gift it

00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:37,459
would have come naturally

00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:39,230
QED I believed in the genetic

00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:41,240
explanation of greatness I thought you

00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:44,060
just had to stumble across that

00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:47,900
accidental match to find the luck for

00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:50,360
which you are the key and inevitably by

00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,100
aiming in every possible direction at

00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,070
once hoping to hit a target

00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:57,350
I wondered blindly into a low-paying job

00:02:55,070 --> 00:03:02,360
where the only requirement was that you

00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:03,800
could type 80 words per minute I woke up

00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,400
on my 25th birthday

00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:09,709
thinking a quarter-century and then

00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:15,170
washed up evolutionary dead end in a

00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:17,300
backwater dead-end life I performed a

00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:19,370
reality check and came to the conclusion

00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:22,250
that even if I couldn't be an

00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:24,739
extrordinary scientist I could still

00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:28,010
probably become a top-tier mediocre

00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:32,780
scientist all I needed was a university

00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:34,370
degree in something scientific having

00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,920
majored in saxophone in high school

00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:39,500
there were remedial credits involved I

00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,959
began to teach myself math and physics

00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:44,660
and chemistry and because I knew I

00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:49,549
wasn't talented I didn't expect it to be

00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:51,079
easy I expected to suck I just started

00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:53,930
at the beginning did one thing at a time

00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:57,230
by the book until I learned it and then

00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:59,630
I moved on whenever I panicked I'd

00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:01,640
remind myself that this is not rocket

00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:03,920
science this is basic math if I don't

00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,260
understand it I must just have skipped a

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,940
step and so I'd slow down and do some

00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,310
research and sure enough within a few

00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:14,200
hours or sometimes days I'd be right

00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:17,620
back on track cheerfully slogging I

00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:20,359
found that I was balancing on a

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:23,240
continuum and that there was a sweet

00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:26,900
spot and that sweet spot had nothing to

00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:30,710
do with math or physics and it works

00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:33,470
like this you're asked to perform a

00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:36,110
particular saxophone tune at 88 beats

00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,940
per minute this falls squarely within

00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:42,200
your capabilities so you can perform

00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:43,700
this task effortlessly confidently while

00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,440
you're doing so

00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,570
you can think about other things for

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,950
example how to adjust your attack based

00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:53,570
on what the drummer is doing you can

00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:56,000
react to something that happens in the

00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:58,210
audience without fumbling or losing your

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,210
place

00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:05,480
when you're asked to perform that same

00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:08,900
tune at 105 beats per minute you can do

00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:11,980
this but it requires every bit of

00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:14,930
concentration that you can muster your

00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:18,380
skill level is perfectly balanced

00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:21,980
against the challenge the difficulty of

00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:23,170
the exercise is barely met by your

00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,670
ability

00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:29,240
you're being stretched and being

00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:31,880
stretched is painful remaining in that

00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:36,130
place that painful place that stretches

00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:40,160
you requires a monumental effort it's

00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:44,390
exhausting it's hard it's not fun it's

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:49,370
also satisfying empowering deeply

00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:52,000
rewarding when you're asked to play that

00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:55,670
tune at 120 beats per minute you panic

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,020
you simply can't do it the challenge has

00:05:55,670 --> 00:06:02,630
no counterpart whatsoever in your skill

00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:06,160
you flail your executive function shuts

00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:09,160
down your output becomes erratic it's

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,160
terrifying

00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:15,200
this continuum is a measure of how

00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:18,410
effortlessly you can perform a given

00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,060
task at one end of the continuum you

00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:24,320
have your comfort zone where you can

00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:26,180
perform effortlessly you don't level up

00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,780
in your comfort zone because you're

00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:31,730
doing stuff you already know how to do

00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:33,290
at the other end of the continuum you

00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,760
have your panic zone where you don't

00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:38,240
level up because you're busy freaking

00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:40,400
out between the two there's a space

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,670
where your ability and the challenge

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:47,300
barely overlap and this is where you

00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:49,280
level up now I'm not saying you should

00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:52,250
never be in your comfort zone or your

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:55,750
panic zone not at all your comfort zone

00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:58,390
is where complex skills be

00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,890
come reflexive you have access to

00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:02,410
higher-level thinking you should

00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:06,820
absolutely spend time there especially

00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:11,130
when you need to be productive your

00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:13,870
panic zone is an excellent place to

00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:16,600
experiment to play to find your

00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:18,730
boundaries because as long as you don't

00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,790
need to be delivering value your fear

00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:25,990
can be transformed into thrill and

00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:28,120
discovery you should absolutely spend

00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:35,890
time there but not when people are

00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:37,990
paying you money in other words you

00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:41,950
should spend time in your comfort zone

00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:50,160
and your panic zone you just shouldn't

00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:52,180
try to learn stuff there I spent months

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,940
working through math and physics

00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:57,280
problems and during that time I learned

00:07:54,940 --> 00:08:00,760
as much about practice as I did about

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:05,500
calculus and mechanics and practice is a

00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:07,750
strange beast it's not play it's not

00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,000
intended to be fun and it's also not

00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:13,960
work it's not intended to produce

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:17,200
anything practice is a thing entirely

00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,940
unto itself what a lot of people

00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,220
commonly think of this practice is

00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:23,169
futzing around kind of doing stuff that

00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:26,680
seems relevant to what you think you

00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:30,910
might want to kind of get better at this

00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:32,440
sometimes kind of works for practice to

00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:37,180
be truly effective it needs to be

00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:39,729
focused and deliberate most basic form

00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:42,719
of practice is the drill now a good

00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:46,500
drill boils down to three elements focus

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:49,540
repetition and continuous feedback a

00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:52,120
drill warps and activity until you're

00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,190
focusing on a narrow slice of that skill

00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,040
in a way that's repeatable and which

00:08:54,190 --> 00:09:02,800
provides immediate and continuous

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:04,360
feedback how narrow a slice depends on

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,580
your capability if you're in your

00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,580
comfort zone you need to ratchet up that

00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:11,000
drill and

00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:13,120
if you're in your panic zone your

00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,220
adaptations will be random and

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,540
accidental and you'll find yourself

00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:20,950
practicing doing it wrong more than

00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:25,040
you're practicing doing it right

00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:29,779
practice doesn't make perfect it makes

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:31,339
permanent if you're practicing in your

00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:34,910
panic zone you'll wind up being

00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:37,880
permanently wrong you want to find that

00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:43,370
sweet spot that space where your ability

00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:46,060
in the challenge barely overlap so find

00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:49,010
something that you can kind of almost do

00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:51,829
what bit until you're focusing on a

00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:53,899
particular aspect of that skill make it

00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:57,380
repeatable so you can do it over and

00:09:53,899 --> 00:10:00,829
over and over and then make the feedback

00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:08,600
loop as short as possible and then go do

00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:10,430
it and then take a nap not all focused

00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,649
and deliberate practice activities are

00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:14,649
drills take simulations for example

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:22,430
athletes have scrimmages in therapy it's

00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,770
called role play in programming we do

00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:29,570
weekend projects and hack fests and code

00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:32,950
retreats in a simulation you improvise

00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:39,589
as though it were the real thing when

00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:44,360
you make a mistake nobody dies you don't

00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:46,130
lose you don't fail you also don't stop

00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,899
go back and immediately do it over again

00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:51,820
correctly because that's what frills are

00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:55,480
for in a simulation you keep going a

00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:57,949
simulation doesn't warp activities it

00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,290
intensifies them you provide a more

00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:02,209
concentrated learning experience by

00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:06,459
putting together implausible

00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:09,170
combinations of unlikely occurrences

00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:14,149
another interesting type of practice is

00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:17,180
the case study athletes watch videos of

00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:18,800
practice essence and performances chess

00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,810
players study games played by

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,520
grandmasters in

00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:23,230
try to determine what the next move

00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:29,140
would be and then when they're wrong

00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:33,580
they analyze why in programming reading

00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:38,020
code is a case study what were they

00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:40,930
thinking what pressures caused them to

00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:45,460
choose this approach what are the

00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:47,830
trade-offs case studies are about

00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:50,800
observation and analysis and critical

00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:54,250
thinking and then you have direct

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:57,580
practice those precise notes and perfect

00:11:54,250 --> 00:12:01,300
pauses of a violinist playing a concert

00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:04,150
piece while nobody's listening direct

00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:07,330
practice when done deliberately and with

00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:10,300
focus Holmes clockwork precision making

00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:11,890
it reflexive we can shift your attention

00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,600
away from the mechanics of your

00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:16,060
performance you can focus all of your

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,890
creativity on the subtle details that

00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:23,710
lift your performance from the subtle

00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:25,720
and mundane to the exquisite typically

00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:27,430
we associate direct practice with

00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,680
musicians but it's just as much the

00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:32,380
domain of stand-up comedians and trial

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:40,530
lawyers and contemporary French circus

00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:44,950
acrobats and then there's imitation

00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:47,380
overlooked and undervalued when you're a

00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:47,770
beginner you don't know what you don't

00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,870
know

00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:52,180
imitating masters will teach you things

00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:54,100
that you don't know you need to know and

00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:59,950
often things that the masters themselves

00:12:54,100 --> 00:13:02,500
are unable to articulate in our culture

00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:05,470
we tend to hype individuality and

00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:07,570
creative self-expression and it's really

00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:11,140
hard to be creative without having

00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:15,250
internalized a vast store of techniques

00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:18,810
and idioms don't be a snowflake go copy

00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,810
someone who knows what they're doing

00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:24,450
no matter what type of practice activity

00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:29,410
are doing no matter how good you are

00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:32,230
practice is grueling drills simulations

00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:33,190
case studies direct practice imitation

00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,530
these are all ways

00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:39,730
of stretching you to the edge of your

00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:44,530
ability that's equally difficult for

00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:46,330
experts as it is beginners that said

00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:49,210
practice is particularly challenging

00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:51,910
when you're grossly incompetent not so

00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:54,970
much because you suck per se but because

00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:57,400
feeling stupid is so powerfully

00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:59,680
unpleasant it's one of the important

00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,720
drivers behind procrastination when

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,150
you're feeling overwhelmed by your own

00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:09,160
ineptitude it's easy to become

00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:11,680
fatalistic another disadvantage to being

00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:14,830
a beginner is that so many practice

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,830
activities lack inherent feedback when

00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:22,350
they're vastly unskilled your judgement

00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:26,550
is completely unreliable everything

00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:29,470
including the right thing feels wrong

00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:32,260
it's easy to consistently make the wrong

00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:35,460
adjustments leaving you with deeply

00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:35,460
ingrained bad habits

00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:45,100
it took me 18 months to pass all of the

00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:47,920
prerequisite exams when I was ready to

00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:50,080
apply to university I was accepted to to

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:54,330
study programs one in aerospace

00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:56,560
engineering and women molecular biology

00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:58,060
when people had me realized that I was

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,660
serious about this university thing I

00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:05,110
got a bit of pushback they're like holy

00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:08,740
crap you're gonna be like 32 by the time

00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:10,960
you finish if we're gonna be realistic

00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:17,610
about it though I was gonna be 32 anyway

00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:20,800
I picked molecular biology the

00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:23,680
University was completely uneventful

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:26,550
I wrote papers I did lab work I read

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:29,140
books I took exams it changed my life

00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:31,270
not so much because of the papers and

00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:33,190
the exams but because I was learning I

00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:35,820
was practicing and I was introduced to

00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:35,820
the bash prompt

00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:42,899
before university i am occasionally

00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:48,119
experienced flow mostly when solving

00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:52,199
trust problems and mechanics telling the

00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:55,290
computer what to do was like trust

00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:58,009
problems except better I kept coming

00:15:55,290 --> 00:16:00,929
back to an exploring programming

00:15:58,009 --> 00:16:02,160
exploring not learning learning is what

00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:04,699
I did with math and physics that was a

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:08,610
steady tedious rewarding diet of

00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:10,829
deliberate and focused practice it said

00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:13,550
a really long time before I transitioned

00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:16,470
from exploring to learning programming

00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:18,869
even when I did make the transition it

00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:24,449
was hit or miss a lot of the resources I

00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:29,869
found were confusing or outdated or just

00:16:24,449 --> 00:16:32,279
hopelessly advanced after three years I

00:16:29,869 --> 00:16:35,579
had a bachelor's degree in molecular

00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:37,980
biology some basic ability to write

00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:39,929
control structures and far more

00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:43,259
importantly I've come to accept that

00:16:39,929 --> 00:16:45,360
talent is not a boolean it's not some in

00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:49,709
a genetic trait that you have to go and

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:55,019
look for and may or may not find the

00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:57,299
truth is talent is skill can be

00:16:55,019 --> 00:17:00,209
developed systematically and a system is

00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:06,329
awesome a system you can understand a

00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:10,039
system you can hack the technical term

00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:11,309
for skill development is levelling up

00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:13,289
now

00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:15,569
a pair of researchers a couple of

00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:18,890
brothers by the name of Dreyfus created

00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:22,579
a model for how leveling up works and

00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:26,039
their scale goes like this

00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:27,899
novice where you know nothing advanced

00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:29,899
beginner where you still suck but you

00:17:27,899 --> 00:17:31,740
kind of see what this might be about

00:17:29,899 --> 00:17:34,500
competent where you can start getting

00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:36,960
 done proficient where you get

00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:39,029
done really well an expert where the

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,080
 and get done seems like magic to

00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:42,080
pretty much everyone else

00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:55,030
when we're novices we can be in one of

00:17:48,380 --> 00:18:00,800
two states mindless obedience or

00:17:55,030 --> 00:18:03,370
overwhelmed as novices we're in the

00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:06,410
unenviable position of being only

00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:10,730
millimeters away from our panic zone at

00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:12,860
all times if a role is unclear or stuck

00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:15,860
if we accidentally skip a step we're

00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:18,110
stuck if we get a result that deviates

00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:21,860
even slightly from what we expected

00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:26,540
we're stuck we have no frame of

00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:30,500
reference when we advanced beginners we

00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:32,420
see 1,000 disconnected details and we

00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:35,350
give every single one of those details

00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:38,929
equal consideration

00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:41,390
there's no cohesion we remember to

00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:45,320
distinguish between relevant and

00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:50,840
irrelevant and incidental we can look

00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:53,450
things up but we can't troubleshoot when

00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:56,860
we're competent we've gained the ability

00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:59,150
to evaluate relevance within a context

00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,950
we also gain the ability to perform

00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:03,050
routine procedures and do basic

00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:05,030
troubleshooting here we can be

00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:07,670
productive without stepping outside of

00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:09,470
our comfort zone maybe why so many

00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:14,179
people stagnate at this skill level

00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:17,480
indefinitely when we're proficient we

00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:20,420
can make much finer discriminations we

00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:24,320
can evaluate the significance of subtle

00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:27,830
indicators we look further ahead we make

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,929
predictions we prognosticate we

00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:32,480
recognize underlying patterns we apply

00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:34,460
overarching principles all in the

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:39,370
intricacies of the subject matter come

00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:42,920
together in a vast and fascinating web

00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:46,250
when we're experts we see a thousand

00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:48,040
details and immediately disregard 999 of

00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,760
them we focus in on the one that matters

00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:52,380
how do we do it

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,830
no idea we don't know

00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:58,050
how we know what we know a lot of people

00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:59,330
talk about instinct or intuition as

00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:03,690
though it's some sort of superpower

00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:06,300
it's not magic it's powerful processing

00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:09,390
that happens very very quickly and it's

00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:15,230
based on a gargantuan store of knowledge

00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:18,870
and experience described in this way

00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:23,310
skin development sounds so sequential

00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:26,190
and regular and inevitable leveling up

00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:28,410
in a series of climaxes win after win

00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:32,040
after win as though life were a

00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:34,950
television commercial this is a

00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:39,240
scientific model a scientific model is

00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:41,070
like a UML diagram but for science it's

00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,140
a simplification about the world it's a

00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:47,840
useful lie that you tell yourself in

00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:47,840
order to navigate a messy reality

00:20:49,160 --> 00:21:01,200
so maybe sequential but regular hardly

00:20:55,340 --> 00:21:05,400
inevitable we should be so lucky life is

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:10,190
messy leveling up happens in spurts and

00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:13,010
sudden surges and there are plateaus a

00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:15,360
lot of people seem to dread the plateaus

00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:18,750
cutting past them as best they can

00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:21,510
always with their eye on the goal am i

00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:26,820
variate am i done yet

00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:29,730
am i good yet plateaus are

00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:31,950
neurologically important the way sleep

00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:34,410
is neurologically important they

00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:37,170
interject injects time into your

00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:41,040
practice and those complex skills to

00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:42,870
become deeply embedded plateaus are

00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,360
where your skill is being refracted so

00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:47,730
that you can scale if you're in a rush

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:54,140
you're going to end up with brittle and

00:21:47,730 --> 00:22:00,380
fragile skill focus on what you're doing

00:21:54,140 --> 00:22:02,929
not how you're doing there's the saying

00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,520
amateurs practice until they get it

00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:06,169
right

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,780
professionals practice until they can't

00:22:06,169 --> 00:22:11,090
get it wrong and that's what plateaus

00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:18,500
are about they put the level and level

00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:21,020
up I use my university degree exactly

00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:24,799
once for the first real programming job

00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:28,400
that I got the CTO of a startup looked

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:30,200
at my resume and said huh a degree in

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:34,400
molecular biology in biological

00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:38,659
chemistry you must be pretty smart and

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:41,600
