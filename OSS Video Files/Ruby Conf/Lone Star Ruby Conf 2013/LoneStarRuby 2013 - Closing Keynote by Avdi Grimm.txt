I want to show yourself so on a while

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:33,630
ago I wrote a library called join it's a

00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:36,690
toolkit or for building null object

00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,730
classes in Ruby now don't worry alright

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,309
this is not one of those Hawks where I

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,809
show you a library that I just wrote the

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:45,059
other day and I tell you all to go use

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:47,820
it in your production house it's not one

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:50,520
of those talks I just want to share some

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,700
of the fun parts of buildings library

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:59,490
some of the things that make me happy so

00:00:53,700 --> 00:01:03,990
a quick brown who here does not know

00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:05,519
what an all out there goes couple of

00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,890
people to the benefit of those who

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,590
aren't familiar with the null object

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,780
happen there's a really really quick

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:16,500
introduction here's a method which does

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,000
a lot of logging and it may or may not

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,100
have a longer depending on whether

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,290
somebody love passes one in and so it

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:26,310
keeps checking to see if that logger is

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:29,970
present before you can use it here is a

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:32,729
null object implementation of a logger

00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,950
interface so here's an object which will

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:37,470
respond to any of the usual logger

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:42,090
methods but it'll be not it'll just

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:47,400
remind them we can take that and we can

00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:49,590
apply it to this method and we can make

00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,960
that null logger the default rather than

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,940
and rather than appeal and when we do

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,110
that it enables us to get away from all

00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,360
that checking to see if the lockers

00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:00,630
there because they can just confidently

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,340
all those lauter methods and your real

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:05,659
lager or will be no longer either way

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,940
it's not alone so I'm all objects is

00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:14,360
basically it's just a way to simple

00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:16,370
microphone as you just seemed clearly we

00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,910
do not need a library for building all

00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:22,340
objects we just build one so why build

00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:24,560
one well one reason is I wanted to make

00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,480
these things easier this is the

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,330
equivalent not code or building that

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:33,260
same null class we just say not filled

00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:34,940
and we say they got INEC logger and it's

00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,800
going to mimic that longer here face and

00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:39,260
it's going to return he'll from from all

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,210
those methods of United so a little bit

00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,530
simpler a little bit shorter the other

00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,760
reason I wanted to do this is it turns

00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:47,810
out there are a number of single

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:50,780
variations on LMK active so this top

00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:56,150
block is one sub variation here is a

00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:57,890
black hole I've object it is an i/o but

00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,170
beyond that also a black hole which

00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:02,750
means that it will return itself from

00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:04,640
any method that is halt on it and that

00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,530
means that we can chain that this

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,760
infinitely which means that we can do

00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,290
things like chaining the shuttle

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,620
operator which was nice to have if

00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:15,290
you're doing I oh the second example

00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:17,090
here is another variation on a null

00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:20,000
object here is a traceable null object

00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:23,510
that's not object nose on what file and

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,459
line it before and this is handy if you

00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:27,200
are debugging and trying to figure out

00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:32,150
why you have a null object when you

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:35,570
expect not now now I would like I would

00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:40,790
like to tell you that yet implementing

00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:43,190
not I had a solid business case you know

00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:45,290
I had an application that i needed null

00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:47,720
objects all over the place and i

00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:51,100
extracted this go down but that would be

00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:53,390
a lie um I have a up confessions made

00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:57,140
out of a dirty little secret the truth

00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:59,470
is I just love that program I think it's

00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,470
fun

00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:10,200
if our programmers find different things

00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:13,290
fun Katrina talks about therapeutic

00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:16,169
refactoring refactoring just for the

00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:20,010
sheer pleasure of it some programmers

00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:21,840
enjoy covel reducing a program to the

00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,150
smallest possible number of characters

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:30,990
this believe it or not is a to-do list

00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:34,950
application in 140 characters I met a

00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:36,680
program for fun and if you're going to

00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:39,720
if you're going to met a program for fun

00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,460
ruby is a pretty cool language to do it

00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,100
in after all it is a language that was

00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:47,010
created to increase developer happiness

00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,690
and it's got some nice features for meta

00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:52,770
programming course you can that program

00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:54,770
in lots and languages in C and C++ you

00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:59,040
did it with preprocessor macros or

00:04:54,770 --> 00:05:03,110
template metaprogramming C sharp and

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:06,690
Java have elaborate reflection api's and

00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:08,490
then of course list is legendary for the

00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:11,810
kind of repetitive metaprogramming you

00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:14,280
can do with macros of course the the

00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:17,669
trade-off teammate for that bargain you

00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:21,050
make is that you have to write your code

00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:24,360
in the forum vs team of those macros

00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:27,930
manipulated but it kind of a commonality

00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,729
among all of these i think is that for

00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,430
each one preach language there's there's

00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:36,510
kind of two levels there is the code

00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:38,490
level and then there's the metal up and

00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:40,560
movie metaphor during a movie is a

00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:44,370
little bit different because in groovy

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,890
you can take an array and you can ask

00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,180
you how big it is and it will tell you

00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:50,340
when that's the ordinary program and

00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,130
then you can ask it what other messages

00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:55,320
you could send to it the same way

00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:58,760
blasted helping it was and that's really

00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:01,050
not a program that's a meta message and

00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,830
then you could ask and then the thing

00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:06,200
that that responds with is

00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:08,360
right and you can ask that array what

00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:12,190
size is and so on and so forth the point

00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:15,070
is it's all kind of mixed together um

00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:17,420
there aren't these separate levels of

00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:19,700
regular programming and meta programming

00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,870
so I feel like roofie is kind of rooting

00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:24,290
that's kind of a punk-rock

00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:26,720
metaprogramming ethos when when Ruby

00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:29,210
decides to sell a new patch lines jeans

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,730
it just sits down and so is the patch on

00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:33,580
while I'm still wearing the jeans and

00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:42,140
sometimes so is the jeans to its leg but

00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:43,490
mostly works out this is the thing is

00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,170
though this makes another programming to

00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:46,460
review really accessible and I think

00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:50,470
that's probably a big part of why i'm

00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:53,900
actually its image anyway back zip code

00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:55,520
so obviously this toolkit for generating

00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,230
all update classes is going to be

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,000
heavily concerned with generating

00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:01,130
classes so how do we generate classes in

00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,710
Ruby well when we want to generate a new

00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:06,410
object we send a new message to the

00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:10,370
object class when we want to generate a

00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:15,560
new class we send the new message to the

00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:17,000
class class again no two different

00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,010
levels we're not entering another

00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,970
language here it's all the same I love

00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:25,550
the parity here and if we want to want

00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:28,370
to say specified that we derive base

00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:31,460
class we can say we can have seen that

00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:33,530
face buttons argument now that when we

00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,240
generate classes in this fashion they

00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:36,350
come out and anonymous they cannot kind

00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,960
of ugly they don't have a name they just

00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:41,900
have a number but the first time we

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,120
assign one to a constant it takes on the

00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,560
name of that constant from then on it

00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,120
knows its own name and this is a little

00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:51,760
bit surprising at first that's very very

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:54,110
convenient so this is the first part of

00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,970
generating a male class it's going to be

00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:57,040
just class taught you and we're going to

00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,570
pass in

00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:02,230
our face classic we're going to bake

00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:04,450
these on basic competence now it seems

00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:07,960
like a good default behavior for a null

00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:12,070
object would be that it would respond to

00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:15,130
any message with nil and would do

00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:17,020
nothing and it should also if you ask it

00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:19,390
it should report that it will respond to

00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:23,620
any message so how do we do that well it

00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:25,450
turns out being prejudiced over first of

00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:30,250
all implement method missing to respond

00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:31,810
to any missing message and if you're not

00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:35,190
familiar with the syntax here where it's

00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:38,260
just the lone asterisk that's saying

00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:40,419
take any arguments and nothing with them

00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:42,610
to ignore them all I have seen that

00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:45,250
called The Naked splat but it occurred

00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:59,320
to me this morning that this could also

00:08:45,250 --> 00:09:01,420
be called the lone star now and then to

00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,940
complement this we also have Linda spawn

00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,850
to again takes any arguments and then

00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:08,320
just responds truth everything and

00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,450
that's it that is like the core of our

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,310
novel object class generation right

00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:17,380
there so few lines of code incredibly

00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:18,550
some piece of cake this stuff makes me

00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,470
happy

00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,420
and I've been thinking about happiness

00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:26,290
and joy lately been thinking about what

00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:28,029
sort of things bring me joy when I think

00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:30,250
about that first things to come to mind

00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:35,800
another thing that has brought me joy

00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:39,910
throughout my life is music has anyone

00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:42,700
seen the movie Garden State this is one

00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:45,070
of my favorite movies and there's a

00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:48,160
scene in that movie that boy stuck with

00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:49,959
me relatively early in the film now the

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,990
importance character or meet zach

00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:55,750
braff's character in a doctor's office

00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:57,750
waiting room and she's listening to

00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,950
music on his great big bear a bit phone

00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:03,820
and she says you got to hear this one

00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:08,500
song changing like I swear and she gives

00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:10,120
a minute those and this this statement

00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:14,829
reason that scene 6 with me is that this

00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:18,310
statement just sums up the way I felt so

00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:22,149
many times about a piece of music you

00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:24,040
know and the joy that brought me you

00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:27,310
know I think about this I think has a

00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:31,060
piece of code ever brought me that kind

00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:34,480
of joy and a piece of code can code

00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:36,760
change your life as I thought about this

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,420
earlier I realize you know Ruby Ruby

00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:42,730
changed my life see I used to work at a

00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:45,520
big faceless corporation I wrote a lot

00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:48,450
of C++ I even wrote some visual basic

00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:53,680
and you know I lived in a cubicle and I

00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:57,070
filled out my share of TPS reports 10

00:10:53,680 --> 00:11:00,790
Island Ruby it was fun but there was

00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:03,399
more to minute I got involved in Ruby

00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:07,300
community and I met people who were

00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:09,180
organizing meetups just for fun I met

00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:13,029
people who are organizing conferences

00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:16,029
just for fun people who are optimizing

00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:20,270
their lives or happiness that people who

00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:24,350
are optimizing their jobs for happiness

00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:27,500
and from there that has led me down this

00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:30,140
this long road to this this moment now

00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:36,010
where I am a much much happier hacker

00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:36,010
today than I was then because Ruby

00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:46,840
Mexico so far we've been building these

00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:49,460
null placidus on basic object but I

00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:53,680
realized I really wanted to enable users

00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:56,000
of this library to vary based class

00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:00,440
maybe they wanted to be based on objects

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,260
as a basic outfit another feature that I

00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,940
really wanted to support is something

00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:07,330
called impersonation yeah I get an

00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:10,220
impersonation that sometimes you'll have

00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:12,440
you'll have a piece of legacy code that

00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:14,630
has a lot of hard coded type checks in

00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:19,010
if you want to introduce a null object

00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:20,660
to that code forget to be able to

00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:22,400
successfully pass through those hard

00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,170
coded type checks now you're going

00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:28,310
through a change in a letter code up

00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:30,710
it's going to have to actually be the

00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:32,180
class that those checks are expected

00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:33,980
it's going to have to actually inherit

00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,330
from that class and so I wanted to

00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,490
provide the possibility of actually

00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:40,180
inheriting this null object from some

00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:42,880
arbitrary classes using a First Nation

00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:46,220
well this aspros a wrench in the works

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:49,760
because so far in that build block I've

00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:52,250
been hauling these I've been performing

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,050
these actions on a class that's under

00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:56,300
construction you know like nimach it

00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:57,860
says define these methods on the class

00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:01,700
that's under construction well how can I

00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:03,500
do that if I'm not even sure yet but the

00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,910
base glass is going to be I can't have a

00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,400
class under construction if I don't know

00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:10,970
base class yet so I've got a chicken and

00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:13,190
egg problem what do i do I realized that

00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:15,290
I was going to have to start queuing up

00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:19,790
some deferred operations

00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:22,310
later so that sounds like a pretty big

00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:24,649
reorg let's see what that entails first

00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:29,360
of all I need a queue of operations are

00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:30,829
very worst then I needed to arrange so

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,750
that once the null class is finally

00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:34,940
generated all of those the third

00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:36,470
operations would be performed and that

00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,870
was a simple matter of iterating through

00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:41,959
the operations and hauling each

00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:45,649
operation on with that Mel class as

00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:48,649
Arnie and finally I find a little helper

00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:50,959
for deferring operations over it takes a

00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:53,480
block it turns that look into a frog

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:57,680
implicitly and it sucks it into that

00:13:53,480 --> 00:14:01,940
queue of the road operations so let's

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,290
see how this applies to mimic and flats

00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:05,120
that feature that we will get a little

00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:07,220
bit already so if you know the idea then

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,220
again we can say they've got mimic give

00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:13,910
it a classic so mimic like lager here's

00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:16,430
the code for that before I use deferred

00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:18,139
operations pretty straightforward it

00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:20,930
does a module eval of the classics being

00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:22,910
being find it goes over each of the

00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:26,000
instance methods of the class to mimic

00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:29,810
and defining to subversion here's a code

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
after I introduced a third operation and

00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:34,760
really the only significant change here

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,420
is that part of that logic got moved

00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:40,490
into a bit further and it says exactly

00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,560
what I want to say it says for this part

00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:43,940
of the operation to later although I say

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:48,410
the same with the furthest Markel very

00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:50,269
late I love this it's clean it adapts

00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:54,980
the language to exactly what I want to

00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:59,709
say and I got a major change in behavior

00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:59,709
from a relatively minor change to go

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:06,270
back to garden see

00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:09,540
one of the reasons that the scene sticks

00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:12,270
with me is because I think it says

00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:17,520
something really profound about the

00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:18,900
practice of joy because there's there

00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,990
are a couple of things going on here me

00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:25,800
first of all um you can see portman

00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:29,910
scheduling loves music um but it goes

00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:32,360
beyond that because she she loves his

00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:34,890
music so so much that she feels

00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:38,120
compelled to share it with someone else

00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:41,310
and I think this is a fundamental truth

00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:44,400
about joy I think that we complete our

00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:46,470
joy when we share it with someone else I

00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:52,500
think that is the moment that brings

00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:58,110
that to its full fruition this is why

00:15:52,500 --> 00:16:01,650
I'm sharing the scope of you today one

00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:05,400
of the best ways that we have program

00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:08,520
sharing with each other is practice the

00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:10,950
pair program to programmers sit down in

00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,660
front of keyboard maybe next to each

00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:15,960
other maybe remotely and they work on

00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:17,180
the same problem I've got some

00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,200
experience of pair programming

00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,760
particularly last year I spent a big

00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:25,920
chunk of time doing nothing but care

00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:28,740
program I paired with thousands of

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,660
dozens of people all over the world all

00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:34,190
different skill levels spin hundred 100

00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:37,530
hours doing this and this process

00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:41,100
brought me this experience brought be

00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:43,450
immeasurable amounts of joy

00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,880
it also gave me kind of a unique

00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:47,560
perspective now I know what it was like

00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:52,150
to come to the Ruby community ten years

00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:53,980
ago but these pairing sessions gave me

00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:58,000
the opportunity given the privilege of

00:16:53,980 --> 00:17:00,010
finding out from from the newbies that

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,880
I've heard with what it's like come to

00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:05,560
the Ruby community today and over and

00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:09,550
over again I heard the same things I

00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:14,020
heard them tell me how welcoming and how

00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:18,790
warm and how helpful and how kind and

00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:25,030
how excited the Ruby community was to

00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:29,740
them friends we have some drama

00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:34,870
sometimes we have some community fatigue

00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:37,690
sometimes but make no mistake we still

00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:40,020
have the finest community in this

00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,020
industry

00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:54,900
you all are part of that so this

00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:57,030
experience of hearing was wonderful and

00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,590
I wanted more people to to have that

00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:02,850
experience and so I've been a kind of a

00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:05,040
personal campaign to to bring for people

00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:07,350
to get more people to scare pair with

00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:10,590
each other on more widely more diverse

00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:12,180
Lee more often on outside of it you know

00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,950
even if you're repairing even here

00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,420
arguing pair programming & Eggar job may

00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:16,590
be terribly somebody you know paired

00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,570
with before it so I've been asking

00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:21,900
people to put this pair of me back up on

00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:25,890
the blog and their their websites or use

00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:27,990
the pair with me hashtag and with the

00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:30,000
help of the community I also put

00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:33,510
together a website care program with me

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,540
that has some resources for getting

00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:39,000
started with remote programming and the

00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:41,130
the results of this have been really

00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,590
really great and really pleased to see

00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:45,270
what's going on there are some just

00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:47,670
random things that people have said

00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:51,330
about this being re-energized you might

00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:55,710
question be a ruby dip I might be hooked

00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:57,450
on remote care on remote carry this pair

00:18:55,710 --> 00:19:02,790
with me thing is really deepening the

00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:05,790
sense of community I feel and the cool

00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:09,660
thing is that that these days there is

00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:11,190
no excuse left not to to go here with

00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,990
something even if you are so low

00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,010
developer even if you are the middle of

00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:16,500
nowhere if you have an internet

00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:17,940
connection you have the ability to spend

00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,880
some time there parents now the program

00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:25,440
somewhere it's fantastic anyway back to

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:27,390
the code so interface subsetting there's

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,450
a fancy term for you what is interfaced

00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:33,870
upset well back to mimic talked about

00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:38,190
this a lot um let's say me what a mimic

00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:42,720
a lot that means we want to know what we

00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:44,790
want to stub out methods like info but

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,799
not necessarily want to stop out for

00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:50,059
methods that are

00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:54,009
every object like object ID so we really

00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:54,009
want to still about an interface subset

00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:58,970
so the first thing that might scream

00:19:56,659 --> 00:20:00,799
lineman plane finally come up with this

00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:03,100
your face subset well what about if you

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,669
keep calling since methods with false

00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:08,989
argument like we talked about earlier

00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:10,489
the rogue session then you get just

00:20:08,989 --> 00:20:12,830
instance methods that are fine on that

00:20:10,489 --> 00:20:13,909
class none of its superclasses but

00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,529
unfortunately this doesn't really hold

00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:18,230
up because let's say we have a class

00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:19,970
called my lager and you derive slaughter

00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,769
and adds one more method really I think

00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:24,019
what we want here when we mimic my

00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:26,210
loggers we want to mimic all methods on

00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:27,649
log or plus that one who mended but this

00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:30,259
is just going to give us that one method

00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:34,399
so this is not a sufficient interface

00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:35,359
upset so we need to solve this a

00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,799
different money here the build a

00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:39,529
building blocks we use to solve it first

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:42,379
of all vacuum collinson's method on a

00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:44,649
class and it will return an array of

00:20:42,379 --> 00:20:47,989
simple slower than a policeman's method

00:20:44,649 --> 00:20:50,480
secondly the fact that in Ruby arrays

00:20:47,989 --> 00:20:51,889
have set operations to find on them so

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,059
you can take two arrays and you can get

00:20:51,889 --> 00:20:56,629
their intersection you can get their

00:20:53,059 --> 00:21:01,279
Union and you can subtract one set from

00:20:56,629 --> 00:21:03,679
another so we put these two together and

00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:05,929
we say in your list of methods which is

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:09,109
the methods defined on that on that

00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:12,200
class minik minus the method is defined

00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:13,999
on object and then we set for each of

00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:19,639
those methods and we find a sub for sub

00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:21,950
version of each a folder is good so

00:21:19,639 --> 00:21:23,869
interface subsetting turns out to be not

00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:26,059
as scary as it sounded but make no

00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:29,840
mistake here this is a pretty advanced

00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:32,570
operation it's just really simple

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,759
because of the way we put these building

00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:41,839
blocks that Ruby gives us

00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:45,979
together love this so we'll talk about

00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:47,869
pairing a little bit more I've been

00:21:45,979 --> 00:21:49,549
obviously I've been banging the pairing

00:21:47,869 --> 00:21:51,079
drum for a while now and here's

00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:53,779
something that I've heard in a row time

00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:55,129
people feel intimidated by the idea of

00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:57,309
going as Kerry with somebody else

00:21:55,129 --> 00:22:01,489
because they feel like I know actually

00:21:57,309 --> 00:22:04,609
what value hi great to our programming

00:22:01,489 --> 00:22:09,169
session some some strange for the truth

00:22:04,609 --> 00:22:12,889
is you don't need it recently I asked

00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:17,779
around I asking people what was the

00:22:12,889 --> 00:22:19,279
latest Ruby wow that you had you know I

00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:20,749
got a bunch of answer is of course I got

00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:26,959
at least one answer that just left me

00:22:20,749 --> 00:22:29,059
scratching my head but I also cancers

00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:30,949
like this getting able to reopen an

00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:32,779
object or class how many people in the

00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:35,059
snow room no you can do that same could

00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:38,440
show it to somebody else there you go

00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:38,440
everything you can blow something line

00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:44,730
okay but maybe you are a total you just

00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:48,000
started learning for me this weekend

00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:48,960
maybe you deserve the right program what

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,880
could you possibly break through the

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,130
table I have an answer for that I'm

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,360
going to answer it a little bit rounded

00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:58,260
up you know blue bow roundabout fashion

00:22:54,360 --> 00:23:01,410
I have kids who he rescues all right if

00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:06,950
you if you have kids you know that one

00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:11,070
of the pleasures of raising them is that

00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:14,390
you get to rediscover the world through

00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:17,750
their eyes here are two of my children

00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:21,660
discovering track maintenance equipment

00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:25,200
now if you don't have kids you may not

00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:27,630
realize that by combining a tractor with

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:31,490
a train track maintenance equipment is

00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:31,490
basically the most mind-blowing thing

00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:43,580
and I got to share these moments with

00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:45,950
them it's fantastic back to that seen

00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:47,540
the garden state between these two

00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:49,040
characters radish carrot performance

00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:51,470
character what you think has a better

00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:53,330
deal here my money is on porpoise

00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:55,070
character because sure die grafik

00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:58,850
couldn't listen to the shins and that's

00:23:55,070 --> 00:24:01,430
nice but Portman is getting to share

00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:04,480
something that is special to her with

00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:09,770
somebody new for the very first time and

00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:14,450
that is a precious experience when I

00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:16,100
paired up with new be programmers I got

00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:20,870
to I got to experience those wow moments

00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:25,520
over and over again I learned things

00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:27,380
about what I knew things I didn't

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,270
realize that I do because they were to

00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:31,850
sort of implicit I learned things about

00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:35,870
life didn't and needed to learn more

00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:43,340
about and I learned how to put the ideas

00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:45,770
in my head it works so if you are any

00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:48,800
our beginner and you take nothing else

00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:50,690
away from this talk I hope that you'll

00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,960
take this way when you bring your

00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:56,270
beginner's mind is that turning table

00:24:52,960 --> 00:25:00,340
you give your parry partner a profound

00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:00,340
and precious gift don't forget

00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:04,110
hey Mexico

00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:09,929
so I have at least operations that can

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:13,590
be performed on an all-glass as it is

00:25:09,929 --> 00:25:15,270
being struck and I kept them all in

00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:16,860
class called null Platts builder and

00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:19,170
there was a method for each one of these

00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:20,490
operations and it starts to get big as I

00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:21,929
added more features with a matter of

00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:23,940
fact it's our to go if you hundred miles

00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:25,530
long and so it felt like it was time to

00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,720
start moving some this functionality

00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:29,730
know sort of glory factor and I thought

00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,850
it might make sense to do one of the

00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:35,190
classic refactoring sprout up man so

00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:40,170
rather than having a method / mimic we

00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:42,210
have a we have a class called which is

00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:44,010
inside the man's name space and its

00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:47,280
initializer take all your usual

00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:49,590
arguments to the mimic method and then

00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:54,030
it has Paul which I was the actual logic

00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:55,620
of things inside and then back in the

00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:58,290
null Flash Builder all we have to leave

00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:01,260
behind is this sort of stuff one line

00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:03,690
where we instantiate the command and

00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:06,000
feed it all the arguments and then call

00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:07,290
it and this is nice but it's a little

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,150
tedious I have to put one of one of

00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:13,050
these subs in for every new feature that

00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:14,370
I had and so I bought all you know we're

00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:17,000
having fun with metaprogramming already

00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:21,570
wouldn't it be cool if we could just

00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,540
dynamically discover these commands so I

00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:25,559
said about doing that first of all I

00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:28,200
wrote myself with the help of the

00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:29,880
internet I wrote myself a little a

00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,700
little helper just to convert command

00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,890
method names into man names and you

00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:40,950
working on Nell's session earlier now

00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:42,690
you hope that was all about um and I

00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:46,470
find method missing on an all pass

00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:47,640
filter and this method missing face with

00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:49,440
the slopes in the commands namespace

00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:52,200
looks to see if I can find a man that

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:55,679
matches that method name if so it's

00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,710
angie is it and pulse and of course

00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,750
design made

00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:03,360
a polite met a programmer I also defined

00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:06,850
responsive missing to use the same one

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:09,700
and now has a client programmer you can

00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:11,950
use these commands and some of them may

00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,659
be defined as manned objects and some of

00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:15,190
them may be fine is method threaded an

00:27:13,659 --> 00:27:16,179
old fast older but you don't know you

00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:22,990
don't care it's completely transparent

00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:24,909
to you that's all because these commands

00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:28,270
are dynamically discovered within a

00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:30,419
man's name space anybody else who

00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:33,039
defines a command within that namespace

00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:35,500
though that command is now available

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:37,840
within the little blog so i basically

00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:40,049
gave myself plug-ins for free how cool

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,049
is that

00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:53,970
throw this to a close first of all I

00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:57,169
want to do with this bed net program

00:27:53,970 --> 00:28:01,910
it's awesome at least I think so mm-hmm

00:27:57,169 --> 00:28:07,110
secondly I really want to encourage you

00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:09,330
to take time to embrace joyful coding

00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:10,559
enjoy embrace coding for fun and make

00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:12,750
sure that at least some of the time you

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,340
spend every week is doing some kind of

00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:15,900
coding whether you enjoy refactoring

00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:21,510
whether you enjoy dull pain whether you

00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:24,270
enjoy performance optimization whether

00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:28,289
it is responsible coding or

00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:29,549
irresponsible coding the Sun is

00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:31,049
important this stuff is this stuff

00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:34,080
stretches are among the fun coding

00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:41,220
stretches your mind Justi was telling us

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:44,010
and um any other show me show me a

00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:46,740
developer who is not writing some fun

00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:48,780
coat have some fun writing code every

00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,400
week and I will show you the developer

00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:55,770
who's not working at her peak

00:28:50,400 --> 00:29:00,390
effectiveness the subs would work I also

00:28:55,770 --> 00:29:02,610
want to encourage you to retain your joy

00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:06,500
this has been this has been a fantastic

00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:06,500
conference am i right

00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:16,680
report where to go home from here

00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:18,890
feeling energized and feel like excited

00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:24,050
you're going to want to try new things

00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:25,950
but that feeling is going to fade and

00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:28,170
you might not be going to another

00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:33,350
conference like this for another six

00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:36,900
months or another year I know a way to

00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:40,020
bring back that feeling over and over

00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:42,120
again and I know it because time and

00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:45,300
again I look at my calendar and said oh

00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:49,320
god varying session schedule I just want

00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:52,050
to go watch TV and then halfway into

00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:55,800
that pairing session with some person I

00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:59,550
don't work with before I am excited I am

00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:02,850
energized I'm enjoying what I'm doing

00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:04,560
I'm making notes about projects that i

00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:06,450
want to try that the this working on

00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:09,060
this new project that they brought in

00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:12,060
has given me ideas or making notes for

00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:16,170
batavus episodes I'm getting that same

00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:18,600
charge excitement um energy that I get

00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:21,360
coming home from a conference and every

00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:23,690
single time when I was done I was glad

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:28,830
that i had that pair programming session

00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:30,960
so most the most important thing going

00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:37,940
to leave you with is I just want to

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:42,360
encourage you to share your joy um to

00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:45,090
tell me do that um I have been passing

00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:47,460
around a little tin of carrying cards

00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:49,290
hopefully if it's been around room all

00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,930
the way I don't know if there was not

00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:53,250
everyone but they've got a URL on them

00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:55,230
and a coat on them and you can take

00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:57,810
those home and you can punch that in and

00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:59,670
you will be hooked up with somebody else

00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:00,870
to care with so so now you don't have

00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:03,960
the excuse that you don't know if it a

00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:05,610
car would and I actually gave up gave

00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,990
out a bunch of those at the Ruby nation

00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:08,820
com conference and once they go so you

00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:11,640
might be guarding something from pc um

00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:13,620
and so yeah I just wanted to make that

00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:17,280
one that step a little bit easier for

00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:19,980
you hopefully you got one just when you

00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:21,660
go out out from here I hope that you

00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:23,340
will you will make an effort to share

00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:25,020
your code enjoy with somebody else you

00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:28,910
never know it might just change their

00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:28,910
life thank you very much happy happy

00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,300

00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:03,510
