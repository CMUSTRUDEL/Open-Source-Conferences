Description: 
	If you work in Rails and have ever wondered about Ember.js, you should know that Ember and Rails go together like Nutella and pretzels. (Which is to say, quite well indeed.)

Get an inside look of the experience of going from having never tried Ember to shipping a production application in it. What makes Ember a good match for certain types of applications? What's so different about it compared to other frameworks? What are the drawbacks?

Using anecdotes, code, and crudely-drawn stick figures, we'll dive into using Ember and Rails, including war stories of climbing over some of the (often surprising) roadblocks encountered along the way.

With this quick tour, you'll be equipped to jump in and start seeing the kind of crazy-ambitious applications you can build when you've got Ember.js in your toolset.
