Title: LoneStarRuby Conf 2013 - Ember on Rails: #REALTALK by Brandon Hays
Publication date: 2020-01-28
Playlist: Lone Star Ruby Conf 2013
Description: 
	If you work in Rails and have ever wondered about Ember.js, you should know that Ember and Rails go together like Nutella and pretzels. (Which is to say, quite well indeed.)

Get an inside look of the experience of going from having never tried Ember to shipping a production application in it. What makes Ember a good match for certain types of applications? What's so different about it compared to other frameworks? What are the drawbacks?

Using anecdotes, code, and crudely-drawn stick figures, we'll dive into using Ember and Rails, including war stories of climbing over some of the (often surprising) roadblocks encountered along the way.

With this quick tour, you'll be equipped to jump in and start seeing the kind of crazy-ambitious applications you can build when you've got Ember.js in your toolset.

is my own bills here top that's the name

00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:43,490
of the top this is also the name of the

00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:47,090
top I'm panda his tip i see on twitter i

00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:48,170
am a reduced by training not sure if I'm

00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:52,160
allowed to tell you who I'm a contractor

00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:54,650
for their you can come to the telegraph

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,080
and telephone business the way we will

00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:58,640
sleeping outside all right I didn't we

00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:02,420
should put in that's not over to talk

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,950
about i am not a fan of animating fields

00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,979
and presentations but this presentation

00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:10,040
has two animations in it so you guys go

00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:13,460
alright chosen not my story is a story

00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,920
of an unnamed developer named Brendan so

00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:19,009
okay Jocelyn all right it's not me it's

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,659
like some similarly named person finding

00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:22,100
is big red heating up in rails and

00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:23,899
getting to be pretty confident here as

00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,329
well as easy to get an application up

00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:28,070
and running he knows his chin file

00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:32,499
really well he could push off an

00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:32,499
application after development I'm not

00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:39,360
does like 25 things in higher score

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,770
developers forum Linden has got opinions

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,650
in a short time as the Doppler he's got

00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:47,410
a disproportionate amount of opinions so

00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:49,330
a web page is document somebody told

00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:51,190
themselves giving yourself which it's

00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:53,140
for displaying content a simple flexible

00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:55,120
web stack is the way to go you or your

00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:58,060
web pages to be snappy and you want to

00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,350
keep your focus on your users here from

00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,760
the Church of the eighty percent years

00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:04,060
case I think they have missionaries ago

00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:07,030
two by two and teach people about ph's

00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:10,630
plan for Apple like focus on the eighty

00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:11,890
percent and MVC fits that it's a great

00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,230
agent percent in this case for the web

00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,970
it's thoroughly that adopted in the web

00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:18,700
world and it separates concerns in an

00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:21,580
attainable way and the only problem with

00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:23,860
this is that that works careless over

00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,030
but how much of your app think about

00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,010
this how much of your application is

00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:28,330
actually written in JavaScript I do you

00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:30,280
actually underestimate it but if you

00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,540
look at how giftable tell you that a lot

00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,670
of your application is written in

00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:37,450
JavaScript and so now experts are like

00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:39,660
oh you need NDC on top of your MVC all

00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,660
right

00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:53,530
so wait put MVC in your embassy so you

00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:55,030
can tell a web application right this is

00:02:53,530 --> 00:03:00,010
like maybe now sitting exactly right

00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:02,020
that sounds weird so okay per se maybe a

00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,900
little skeptical that this team this

00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:09,940
solution were making happy thing is this

00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:11,800
is problem mini-boss content saying oh

00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,480
my gosh she's just tears streaming down

00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,730
her face google reader is dead can you

00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,710
believe this like how can people do this

00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,420
to me we are going to do something about

00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,830
this I have nothing to read anymore but

00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,070
the good news is at times of change and

00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:25,270
we all get my name's from Tori anyway so

00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:27,010
picking through the woods on Twitter to

00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:29,170
try to find the news that's relevant and

00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:31,510
valuable and clicking the links isn't

00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:34,150
very good to do so let's fix that let's

00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:36,280
build something so then it's like okay

00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,870
let's do it and then all of a sudden set

00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,570
semen on your list of features come down

00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:43,000
and it starts getting clingy and it's

00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:45,130
like oh so we want to have like multiple

00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,110
kinds of photos and have them like live

00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:49,360
update on the speed and real time this

00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:53,230
is done and start basically down this

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,430
road lies an intense kind of pain when

00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,650
you're trying to build a sophisticated

00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:59,709
user interface that involves persistent

00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:04,450
state we feel unique and new forms of

00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:05,740
pain so basically if you remember if you

00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,300
don't miss kind of stuff before and I'm

00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,280
almost certain you have if you work in

00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,440
rails you write the controller to serve

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,690
your HTML to store the data actually in

00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,900
the Dom to give the Ajax call to send to

00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,310
the controller to grab my

00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,709
 to stuff into the template to

00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:22,490
catch the fly and in a row by the fly

00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:26,419
and probably all die soon about us does

00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:28,520
a little dirty tonight so this is time

00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:30,830
continue it trying to bend the wagon to

00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,240
this pretzel shape trying to hold all

00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,889
this info in our heads which from the

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,030
debug let one simple problem that's

00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:38,300
bouncing around a lot of different

00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:39,979
concerns but there's a different engines

00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,570
to do pretty much everything that like

00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:44,000
whales shins except they also I've do I

00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:46,130
on my oh it's got my CSS it's awesome

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,560
say you have like no plug in and it

00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:50,470
helps to values help a little less and

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,970
then three plugins start to really hurt

00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:54,919
so now you have a couple choices ahead

00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,570
of you it's one thing to scale back on

00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:58,190
futures but it's another thing to scale

00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:02,000
back on the user experience for those

00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:03,889
features so I feel like putting us in

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,900
Karbala this is already dancing

00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:07,900
references you guys buckle up it's

00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:12,760
so I mean we can pretty much dismissed

00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,950
us all right but we do it more than we

00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,660
like to admit we subconsciously often

00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:19,180
limit ourselves we can do with user

00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,880
experience because of limitations and

00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:24,100
the technology that we're sitting on top

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,140
so with the other choice like I benden's

00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,450
ready to take the high load and go ahead

00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:30,520
and suck it up and write the ball of mud

00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:33,880
what does not look like well we'd only

00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:36,100
no one even knows like computers so now

00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,840
some have javascript is in script tags

00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,550
sometimes it's in your gem file

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,920
sometimes it's in your blender assets

00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,330
sometimes in regular assets sometimes I

00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,720
senior patrol options and heaven help

00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:49,060
you if it is in your strings stored in

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,690
like your lip folder well I have worked

00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:54,720
on that application so also i meant to

00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:56,950
introduce a new database called don t be

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,930
it's a really awesome place to start

00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:01,270
really important data and it's on your

00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,890
web page so you serialize everything out

00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:04,660
to your web page and then use your web

00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:06,550
page to manipulate the data and then

00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,020
like set that back up into your server

00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:10,390
and the great news is you're already

00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:13,419
using it so it's like I already got

00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:15,730
Micah penetration so maybe maybe that's

00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:17,020
not so reliable and maybe it's kind of

00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:20,350
hard to chase down problems in it

00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:23,020
sometimes in my experience I don't know

00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:24,280
I try to try to think about it I also

00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:28,240
goodnight Brenda doesn't say goodnight

00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:30,880
either so I do like Han Solo it's just

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,220
like Kayla and say please please code

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,440
base all together the thing is this was

00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,750
supposed to be fun like we got into this

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,760
thing because this is our like web

00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:42,430
applications is like exponential benefit

00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:44,590
for some amount of effort but every

00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:46,540
tweak and every feature that we use that

00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,620
we add seems to break previous ones and

00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,970
you're suddenly like doing stuff with

00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:51,910
JavaScript you may not completely

00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:53,770
understand like a prevent default yes

00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,529
top repetition stuck immediate

00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,859
propagation

00:06:54,529 --> 00:07:00,379
ok and then so mountainous I am now

00:06:57,859 --> 00:07:01,969
officially in the water um he's wanted

00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:05,379
to put cool stuff but this took all the

00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:07,519
fun out of it so all right so he

00:07:05,379 --> 00:07:09,679
trepidatious least steps toward a

00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,959
JavaScript framework he's desperate

00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:13,939
enough to try something and the spring

00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:16,459
work promises to bring sanity instead of

00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:19,009
this disparate and fragile code that we

00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:22,009
often rely on but the real question here

00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:23,179
is convinient ever be happy usually ajs

00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:24,859
framework because it's about developer

00:07:23,179 --> 00:07:26,509
happiness that's a mission of Ruby and

00:07:24,859 --> 00:07:27,739
that's kind of what we'd like to carry

00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:31,399
forward even when we work in other

00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:33,769
languages there's a trick to this there

00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:35,929
is a proliferation of JavaScript

00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:39,289
frameworks out there look at Sammy

00:07:35,929 --> 00:07:40,879
backbone spine angular knockout Batman I

00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:44,539
could invent names like six morn you

00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:46,249
believe me number one concern here is

00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:48,229
obviously was going to be around a year

00:07:46,249 --> 00:07:50,479
from now to be supported be continually

00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:51,829
used I have a couple of dead ones and

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,129
encode basins that are no longer

00:07:51,829 --> 00:07:57,079
maintained that's not super fun but in

00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:59,299
Detroit sublet and for various reasons

00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:02,059
that we will not get into until if we

00:07:59,299 --> 00:08:04,009
have time for bonus slides he landed a

00:08:02,059 --> 00:08:06,379
number so let's take a shot at it all

00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:08,809
right let's get going here all right Jim

00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:10,849
install all right okay then from the

00:08:08,809 --> 00:08:13,009
command line you rails generate embo

00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:16,009
bootstrap and you have ember in your

00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:17,750
application okay Jim installing I know

00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:21,200
this message

00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:23,930
there are some challenges which I make

00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:26,630
some challenges and the initial

00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:29,840
challenges wait a minute everybody wants

00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:31,430
to own big chunks of the ride so if it's

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,409
not a can't be dropped into an existing

00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:35,510
out it's just that from that point

00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:36,860
forward then even drop it in it kinda

00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:38,539
wants to drive from you or else to

00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,159
everything that's a little more than a

00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:42,800
sprinkling of JavaScript that we're told

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,950
that we're supposed to want the bending

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,750
both had servers on so he jumps in and

00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:49,520
says all right like how do I get going

00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:52,790
with this gosh it's just not that much

00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,440
could you use your controller and set up

00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:57,380
a basic control and well everything to

00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,940
that if you want a full ever control web

00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,260
application you just r out everything

00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:03,340
the amber and say you handle this i

00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:05,780
don't i don't feel like it so and then

00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:07,400
getting an app out into the world from

00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:09,530
the ember side is really minimal you

00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,870
define a router tell it to go somewhere

00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:13,700
and spit out some text in your

00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:15,680
application like your application htib

00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:19,340
and we'll talk about that our theme in a

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:23,180
second so like okay and

00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:25,550
and there's really I mean that was saved

00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:29,270
us a huge amount of time and building a

00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:31,700
web app I the various more complicated

00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:33,890
not but to get in the next step where's

00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:37,990
has taught us many things about NBC that

00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:40,580
are not bad but they just don't fit and

00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:42,020
so for one thing though to start with

00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:45,650
models are pretty much what you're

00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:47,720
already expecting them to be modest have

00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:50,570
two jobs they define in the hill

00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,340
properties for domains models and they

00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:54,590
also can retrieve and persist changes

00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:56,710
although that's kind of added in if you

00:09:54,590 --> 00:10:00,110
decide to use a persistence framework

00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:01,640
routes are already like going to be will

00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:03,260
out what you expect now there's a thing

00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,060
called a proud rjs will look at in a

00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:07,310
minute it's going to be pretty much what

00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:09,230
you are thinking of in terms of what

00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:11,600
else file should look like except for

00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:13,040
them it passes to abouts handler that

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,900
does a bunch of heavy lifting like

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,490
grabbing the model object stuffing it

00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:19,640
into a controller and passing it along

00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:21,560
which sounds a lot in Wills like what a

00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,380
controller does okay so with the heck

00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,870
are these for well controllers are not

00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:29,720
at all like whales controllers they

00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:32,390
appeal for decorating the the model to

00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,920
add logic for display and again this is

00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:35,270
just to point out the fact that these

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,820
are different from what you're expecting

00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:39,890
and we'll go through in a second and the

00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,330
and there's something else I'll show you

00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,650
where I'm not going to even try

00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:44,330
explaining as well as someone else did

00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:47,720
so if use are also not what we expect

00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:49,190
they're not templates I've actually sort

00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,340
of broken myself at the habit of calling

00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:54,950
templates views in Wales even actually

00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:57,020
has a new layer in between what

00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:59,390
controller does and handing off to the

00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:01,400
template that is pretty much coming from

00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:04,490
you but you can grab hold of that and

00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:06,620
start messing with it they're optional

00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:09,500
they're just for handling user input and

00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:11,360
display logic and lastly it uses

00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,550
handlebars for templating I don't know

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,550
if any have used handlebars or any of

00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:19,580
its kissing cousins for for real stuff

00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,630
but it's actually pretty cool and Avars

00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,460
is really powerful

00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:24,890
like mustache is very logical asst and

00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:26,840
in great militant about not doing that

00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:28,790
stuff about putting any logic in your

00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,010
template and handlebars is like it's

00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:33,170
cooler cousin and it's like yeah like

00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:35,900
you can smell just go outside go bad

00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:38,840
it's fine stone did put it in a poker

00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:42,740
and has really cool little features like

00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:44,870
elsker zero state so I explained is so

00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,520
clearly at an ember chance me up that

00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,960
somebody else felt compelled to the

00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,700
immediate next month to get an entire

00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,860
talk fixing all the stuff that I broke

00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,820
and then turn it into a screencast that

00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,200
I highly recommend you check out

00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,150
actually no matter whether you decide to

00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:59,060
use ember or not but breaking down the

00:11:56,150 --> 00:12:01,700
concepts of model-view-controller kind

00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:04,760
of from the ground up so even though

00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:06,140
challenges been real goes and searches

00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,640
for help so he's trying to build his

00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,440
application and he pits searches for

00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,600
help on the new router and scumbag stack

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,970
overflow which one's clear and concise

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:19,010
answers on a syntax that nobody's used

00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:21,380
for over a year so whip alright ever did

00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:24,230
it so we need to persist data to the

00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:26,600
database and then you could only find

00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:27,830
ember data and we can try to figure out

00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,330
how to light the entire persistence

00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,920
layer from scrap yourself because I

00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:33,410
guess that's kind of JavaScript culture

00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,990
if the period persistence library in

00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:38,510
town was publicly declared to be not

00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:41,420
ready for public consumption okay wait

00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:43,940
what alright and then keeping up with

00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:48,140
the framework like like multiple datas

00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:51,590
I'll see 13 RC six at now RC 6.2 and the

00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:53,450
daya Beals handle those betas and every

00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:55,670
single updating to break some settle

00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:59,450
dependency between all three of them and

00:12:55,670 --> 00:13:00,950
miss stuff and fixing things that broken

00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:03,680
and bring deeper went through this

00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:11,030
process over and over again I'm sorry

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:13,610
what so these challenges are specific to

00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:17,330
picking up and learning with a brand new

00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:19,310
framework in beta that's just filling in

00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:21,830
short of it you have to understand what

00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:23,300
this is my well as a 14-3 if any of your

00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:25,910
old timers enough to remember that I'm

00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:28,460
literally not but my old timer friend

00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:30,950
helped me with that so it's not real

00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:34,340
three it's not two three it's certainly

00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:35,690
not well spoil yet all right so we

00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,790
understand now you got the boy who

00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,840
played on with other core concepts and

00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,490
we've accepted this is a framework

00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,770
that's a little bit in a flux although

00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:44,510
stabilizing but we've got to build a

00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:46,370
twitter news team leader let's get going

00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:49,340
on this you ready getting on we should

00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:50,450
get going all right let's dive in so we

00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,850
want to start reading shared lates

00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:55,160
through twitter we're going to design

00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:56,750
our duas right up front so the first

00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,250
thing that we do is we decide all right

00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,860
we have a thing called shared items it

00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:02,660
is a thing and immediately we see that

00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,790
there's a nested shed item if you use

00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:07,220
rails that should look pretty familiar

00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:09,260
not super revolutionary we was in the

00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,700
history API but you can use that the

00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:14,630
older style yet to support older

00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:17,540
browsers there's also now that passes to

00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:19,700
a route so instead of a controller

00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:21,170
immediately taking that on but actually

00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,810
putting it to a route that decides what

00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:25,370
controller comes next and here we're

00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:27,320
going to go grab all the shared items

00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:29,360
this is actually using ember model to go

00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,100
to grab all the shared items from the

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,210
world server behind the scenes and pass

00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:37,250
that to the controller of the same name

00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:38,540
so it's important note not writing this

00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,950
control yet we're skipping right over

00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,990
that and we wrote that controller for us

00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:43,670
so all the other bug is doing is saying

00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:46,610
hey we got a model here let's iterate

00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:48,230
over it and link to each one and if

00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:51,380
there isn't anything we're going to save

00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:53,450
new items so that's not cool else helper

00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:56,450
on iterators it's just kind of really

00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:59,510
handy and then oh well what is that out

00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:01,900
loud for that outlet is actually tied to

00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:03,490
the nested route so we have shared I

00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,500
which has a collection of shared items

00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:07,360
that and we decided that underneath that

00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,400
route when somebody clicks on a link

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,860
that links to the route under new book

00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:14,950
it will take you to the shared item and

00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:18,880
that's this super complicated code look

00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:20,230
out everybody it's got a URL in it don't

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,520
worry I'll show you more about how this

00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:26,760
actually fits the other visual in a

00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:30,840
second API it's just rails did do do do

00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:32,890
okay the thing is this style coating

00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,180
will change the way that you think about

00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,320
building web applications and that's

00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,510
that's really what I want to get across

00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,460
today where's things to active record is

00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:41,380
super awesome is super wonderful but its

00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,730
database dominated you think about from

00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,440
day one from minute one of your

00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:47,320
application how is this thing going to

00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:49,090
be stored you become experts on data

00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,200
normalization just by nature the fact

00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:52,810
that we're using active record to

00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:55,060
persist emma is URL and user experience

00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:57,760
dominated how is this thing that amused

00:15:55,060 --> 00:16:00,910
and this structure of taking us data

00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,260
putting it into a pool out of you from

00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,700
your server to your client and letting

00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,410
the client and do whatever it wants and

00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:07,150
define it the user experience models

00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:11,110
however you want is an extremely

00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:12,910
valuable abstraction for instance i made

00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:14,050
me start using one on persisted models

00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,760
maybe it's just going to go grab some

00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:18,280
stuff from an api not persistent and

00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:21,460
just display it to a user all right this

00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:24,220
is this is like a totally hopefully not

00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:27,180
too confusing but they added red box

00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:29,410
it's the entire application route and

00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:32,260
application route renders application

00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:35,020
template and it it's by default hitting

00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:36,490
the slash route route and well kind of

00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:38,710
also stopping on the slash view out here

00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:40,240
when we hit the sack shamir out millions

00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:42,820
the show we hit the shared items about

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,440
and we just rented that into its

00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:46,240
application l that we saw the

00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,920
application had an outlet we take

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,930
whatever was in the shared items and

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,030
stuff that into that outlet and then

00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:53,800
window remember how we iterated over all

00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:56,530
those links well if you click one of

00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,660
those leaks it will render into its own

00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:00,970
outlet the next thing down in the shared

00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:02,170
routes until you run out of them and we

00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:03,180
didn't because we were just displaying

00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:06,720
the URL

00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:10,200
whatever comes with that content all

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:12,540
right gonna do something insane i'm

00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:17,160
going to attempt to buy demo what this

00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:19,410
looks like look how beautiful my

00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:22,650
beautiful beautiful beautiful butterfly

00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:24,840
is so then then built it and he brings

00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:26,640
it to his boxes she says this is really

00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:30,540
cool you got this going and how long

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:33,390
like a couple hours yeah and so does it

00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:36,000
do anything besides very slowly over

00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:38,370
cellular connections load these leaks no

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:47,070
it does not okay we'll get back to work

00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:48,510
all right fine hey well so here's where

00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:50,550
we haven't done it works it's obviously

00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:52,850
not even close to complete we haven't

00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:55,350
put together a complex you I we haven't

00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:56,850
put together any Twitter off we haven't

00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:58,830
particular any semblance of real life

00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:00,810
usage but what we have done is we've

00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:02,670
already done we've already defined some

00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:05,070
of the domain model some of the URL

00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:06,930
design define words for our API and

00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:10,020
we've got some stuff on the screen which

00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:12,120
is pretty awesome its flipped our model

00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:15,210
from data centric to you act centric so

00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,770
now some some real talk ember has been a

00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,300
very challenging for Brendan Diaz

00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:20,610
getting up to this point you start about

00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,800
eight months ago it was very very

00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:24,450
painful if you've expanded to remember

00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,000
the past and you've been frustrated then

00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:29,280
it is totally with you it's totally

00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,070
understandable is right there the theme

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,240
is today I can say personally from my

00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,070
experience and learning from his

00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,340
experience that this is a ready

00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:41,190
application framework now it's ready and

00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,960
it's awesome so here's a couple hi

00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:44,730
problems that that existed before that

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,630
had been resolved in the last seriously

00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:51,600
who leaving month two months data

00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:53,250
authentication and closing div tags okay

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,260
so there's a dozen times I don't see any

00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,190
responsibility

00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,630
without really well that's your

00:18:55,190 --> 00:19:00,470
application up so close your gift tags

00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:02,030
everybody do that in the model never

00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,860
have we said imitating what seniors

00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:05,000
imitate is still not ready and it's one

00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,130
of the most ambitious JavaScript

00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,440
projects I've ever laid my eyes on it's

00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:11,680
beautiful it's just not ready to use so

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,300
M bonanno is like a stripped-down a

00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,710
go-kart fast version of that that's

00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,150
totally customizable and you can do

00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:19,160
whatever you want and this should work

00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:21,020
push basic this is your model definition

00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,460
we're defining some attributes setting

00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,440
well to go get it and telling it that

00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,710
it's restful and you don't do anything

00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,630
else it's embarrassing it easy to use

00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:31,580
fine goes and gets all of them find with

00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:33,050
an ID doesn't get to that ID and we can

00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:37,270
save it and it will persist it there's

00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:41,810
like no like crazy stuff going on here

00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:51,350
hi and we there's two microphones here

00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:54,110
somewhere oh we good okay can you guys

00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:57,790
get me over there all right okay I'll

00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:59,630
try to be quiet so all right

00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:01,160
authentication was really hard with Ava

00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,330
before it's really easy now because

00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,740
they've changed routes to be

00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:05,330
asynchronous I won't get into the

00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,650
details of it but basically I'm going to

00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:08,030
show you a really naive solution that I

00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:11,900
got up and running in like very very

00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:14,270
short amount of time I use my I set an

00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:17,240
application token randomly generate it

00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:18,800
put it in amber and just check for that

00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,690
if it doesn't fit before I load the

00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:24,590
model kick the back user back out to the

00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:26,330
landing page so that's when Brendan

00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:28,880
found the treasure chest a back-breaking

00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:31,670
Lee huge heavy treasure chest if he were

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,440
broke Brendan's brain and my friend Dave

00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:34,700
Brady says that's because we would break

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,130
a brain it means there needed to be a

00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,540
hinge installed there so basically

00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:40,310
grasping some of these concepts really

00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:42,380
shook his Ohio foundations and made him

00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:44,210
feel really dumb because brendan is an

00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:45,920
imperative programmer by training this

00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,450
is what I want this is how to do it

00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:51,860
don't do it for me bring it back to me

00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:53,540
shut up okay so ember is about

00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:55,670
declarative programming about saying

00:20:53,540 --> 00:21:00,860
what you want and I really care how you

00:20:55,670 --> 00:21:03,170
do it I how like this broke his brain so

00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:05,090
declare it takes away all about how and

00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:06,200
just leaves you to ask what but the

00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:06,809
thing is it doesn't have to be that

00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,269
complicate

00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:11,100
to explain think like a big v8 diesel

00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:13,950
truck trying to push something up a hill

00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:16,379
instead think sent in San Francisco you

00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:18,120
have this cable-car cable cars work by

00:21:16,379 --> 00:21:19,889
this crazy pulley system underneath the

00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,749
city and you just latch on to it and it

00:21:19,889 --> 00:21:23,309
carries you around all the work is being

00:21:21,749 --> 00:21:24,809
done underneath the surface and all you

00:21:23,309 --> 00:21:26,820
do is you declare what you were buying

00:21:24,809 --> 00:21:28,950
too and it will take you around the city

00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,360
if you'd like so instead of trying to

00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,679
get bigger and bigger engines and more

00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,749
and more complicated you actually just

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,309
say I just want that and let it carry

00:21:33,749 --> 00:21:38,190
you around you don't necessarily have to

00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:39,749
understand all the complex this is what

00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,980
is referred to when people say like

00:21:39,749 --> 00:21:42,179
there's almost a stereotype in ember

00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,860
Lana says Wow look at what you can do

00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:46,529
with so little code because you just say

00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:49,289
what you want it uses a pattern called

00:21:46,529 --> 00:21:52,529
functional reactive programming it is

00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:54,419
too complicated for me to explain it

00:21:52,529 --> 00:21:56,129
works like Excel it's not too

00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:57,769
complicated I just don't understand it

00:21:56,129 --> 00:22:00,179
well enough to explain it to you

00:21:57,769 --> 00:22:02,639
basically it's embers own take on this

00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:03,809
pattern and it's not pure functional

00:22:02,639 --> 00:22:04,980
reactive programming according to some

00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:06,869
of the people i talk to but it's

00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,659
basically needs to embers killer feature

00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:11,850
so the only request i got and getting

00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:13,740
this talk was please do not give another

00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:15,960
talk about why computed properties are

00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:19,350
so obey the computer properties are so

00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:21,779
great they're so great it's sort of a

00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:23,970
four-dimensional concept so I'm just

00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:26,070
gonna have to show it to you all right

00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:29,730
well the kid knows is Brendan have been

00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:33,299
working real hard and he like put CSS in

00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:36,480
here and everything and he actually

00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:38,159
realized something last night talking to

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,139
his friend his friend said hey you know

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,450
I just realized this thing isn't for

00:22:40,139 --> 00:22:44,639
sharing news links with Twitter this is

00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:47,639
for starring animated gifts on Twitter

00:22:44,639 --> 00:22:48,840
and gathering all of those so he decided

00:22:47,639 --> 00:22:51,179
he was going to build some features

00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:54,179
around browsing news that comes in it

00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:56,159
imports on the rail side imports all the

00:22:54,179 --> 00:23:02,029
links from Twitter and just renders them

00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:05,650
out to the Ember app so now we have

00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:07,870
awesome animated gif browser

00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:09,400
so there's so much with this i want to

00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:10,960
show you but let me show you some of the

00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,020
stuff look at down here at the numbers

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:19,030
which I can't read but I'm assuming

00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:21,130
they're changing you see these red on

00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:22,540
red numbers changing so these are

00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:24,700
different filters that I've applied just

00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:26,170
by declaring a basic computer property

00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:30,640
that I'll show you just one second but

00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:32,320
the idea is I I these things will update

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,600
i actually wrote no code to get those

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,460
numbers I just said watch those just

00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,020
give me that property and ember is

00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:39,610
calculating all of that stuff underneath

00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:41,260
the surface and when i'm applying

00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:43,750
multiple filters like just show me

00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:45,520
animated gifs and only show me unread

00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,710
ones cuz im so bored with those old ones

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,750
oh that's nice that's a good one what

00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:53,740
about this one all right now they're red

00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:57,780
so they go into the red pile I don't

00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,780
know why that was good to me a good time

00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:03,550
any he was also asked to add JK

00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:08,560
navigation oh cool JK navigation that

00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:10,150
was easy alright so this was always

00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,650
supposed to be just for animated gifts

00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:14,350
but all of these things are things that

00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:16,030
I have done before and and definitely

00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:17,020
brendan has had to do this before many

00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:18,970
of you probably had to do this before

00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:21,460
where you use jQuery to update these

00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:24,400
things and then your next two weeks is a

00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:26,050
hell of running down why this thing was

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,570
removed from this list and added to this

00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:31,270
list and the code to actually do this is

00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:32,790
very straightforward so I'm gonna see if

00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:36,550
I can show you that could really fast

00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:41,950
and my my timer reset I don't know how

00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:45,790
I'm doing anybody know and ends in 12 5

00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:47,560
and 12 to none all right okay I'm just

00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:51,250
keep rolling until somebody up actually

00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:52,930
like it's a sniper tower all right let's

00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:57,370
look at some code really fast also

00:24:52,930 --> 00:25:01,540
always something that you that's easy to

00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:02,860
do in a presentation all right so this

00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,750
looks like a lot of stuff but really all

00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:05,800
i'm doing is i'm calling the same over

00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:08,110
and over again I'm calling the same

00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:10,410
apply filter and in this case I'm

00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:15,100
calling apply filter with gifts and

00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:16,570
let's see if this works and do you see

00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,220
that what I'm doing with that apply

00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:18,870
filter all kind of gloss over what I'm

00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,250
do with the applied

00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:22,260
but it's talking to the controller and

00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:25,620
saying just give me a collection that

00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:28,950
matches gifts that have the property

00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:30,840
matching is gift so only is gif is going

00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:32,910
to return in that collection so this

00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,350
collection iterates and and you see that

00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:36,150
it calls property URL so I'm just

00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:40,640
watching URL that's as much code as it

00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:43,410
took to do that let's see if this is and

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,930
here if filter is gifts I'm going to

00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:47,400
return get gifts content which all it's

00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:49,230
doing is calling this filter property

00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,820
function and then there's this goofy

00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:52,770
thing here but this is so important if

00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:56,010
you do this like you'll be building cool

00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:57,780
stuff in no time so you declare you

00:25:56,010 --> 00:26:01,020
write a function that says watch this

00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:02,610
attribute or this property and that's

00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,780
going to be this filtered content that

00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:04,920
I've actually run through a couple other

00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,360
filters because you can chain these

00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:09,000
things together because it's totally

00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:11,130
awesome and sweet and i'm going to say

00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,559
watch each one of those for changes in

00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:14,880
the URL I'll tribute and so all I'm

00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:17,100
doing is I'm declaring a few of these

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,850
event bindings and that winds up giving

00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:22,500
me this cool web application it took

00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:25,740
certainly less time and effort and

00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:29,460
fragility from what I would normally

00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:32,760
have done in jquery and trying to manage

00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:35,100
all that stuff so that's that's what I

00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:37,500
love about computing properties it's

00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:40,770
basically allows you to bookmark and

00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:42,150
save gifts from Twitter so that's like

00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:45,000
what else is in the world could you

00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:47,220
possibly want anything to do so we have

00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,440
a second nobody's stopping me so all

00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,910
right we're going to do the super

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,500
awesome bonus section and then we're

00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:55,590
going to talk about what to select for

00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:57,990
in in frameworks I love Ruby and rails

00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:59,370
community there are lots of criteria

00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:01,770
though that you can choose to select

00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:04,590
frameworks Brendan's money and my money

00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:08,490
is on community I vote with community a

00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:10,530
bet on community ruby is love this is

00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:12,690
something that Dave Brady quoted in a

00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:15,840
conference talk a couple years ago that

00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:17,070
matt said and it could be this

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,110
translated or whatever but I actually

00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:21,090
really like that thought it's basically

00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:22,650
like what's so weird and charming about

00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:23,970
the Ruby community it's like a family

00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:25,530
complete with like the awkward

00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:26,940
Thanksgiving dinner where people maybe

00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:30,390
don't get along they have differing

00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:32,990
views and they just like some little you

00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:35,900
know sometimes our drama javascript is

00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:37,760
party people come from everywhere some

00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,960
might even programmers some of whom you

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,150
know their front end people or other

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,620
languages don't have people everybody is

00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:44,590
like just comes in and the focus is on

00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:47,720
phone and humor and drunken bar fights

00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:48,920
so amber is awesome because its way to

00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,750
get elements of both of those

00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:53,450
communities together i highly recommend

00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:57,860
you find a meet-up i happen to know of

00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:59,030
one in austin so the thing is so if i

00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:01,280
mean it personal for just a second i

00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:03,620
went with community as a new developer a

00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:05,780
few years ago it has not steered me

00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:07,730
wrong sense i really am very grateful

00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:09,710
there's no way that would be not just

00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:11,210
standing here soon I be a programmer if

00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:12,920
it wasn't for a couple people seeing me

00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:16,309
like and putting their arm around me and

00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:17,540
rescuing me for myself so there's been

00:28:16,309 --> 00:28:19,250
some criticisms and some of them are

00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:22,900
very valid there's been some criticisms

00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:25,910
of MVC frameworks and JavaScript and

00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:27,590
this one is pretty common hey I haven't

00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:29,809
heard anybody actually say this yet okay

00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:32,809
so let me be the first to links was

00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:35,240
faster and cleaner than doing this with

00:28:32,809 --> 00:28:37,850
jquery and moving stuff around we're

00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:39,440
talking about a very specific type of

00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:41,360
application that often we find ourselves

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,070
having to write that winds up turning

00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,290
into a ball of mud and avoiding that at

00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:47,990
all costs is worth learning of really

00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:49,309
amazing framework so a note on testing

00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:51,200
this is something that i know that maybe

00:28:49,309 --> 00:28:54,950
people are really into I'm heard I don't

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,630
know TVD has definitely encouraged there

00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:57,950
hasn't been a great amount of

00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:59,929
documentation but it's actually getting

00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:02,030
better really really fast in the last

00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:05,240
week new documentation has gone up on

00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:07,220
their site Brendan actually used

00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,450
capybara back in the day and that

00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:11,750
actually wound up being sort of

00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:15,020
suboptimal this is actually one of the

00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:16,910
fastest improving communities that I've

00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:19,070
seen outside of early rails in early

00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:21,260
early node it's really cool to see this

00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:23,300
community come together last note about

00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,890
functional reactive programming so cool

00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,030
you should totally check it out nobody

00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:29,570
in this room there's anything about it

00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:32,000
especially not collabing Oh for real oh

00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:33,800
my gosh it's like we planned this which

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,410
we totally do not but it's worth

00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:39,400
investigating some resources there's a

00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:42,140
JavaScript framework called bacon j/s a

00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:44,419
fellow knight named joe Farini who's

00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:45,250
super cool wrote a simple explanation

00:29:44,419 --> 00:29:47,470
about it

00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:49,000
you have no other option in the future

00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:52,360
for a learning anything about frp so

00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,030
forget it go home all right last thing

00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,950
thanks to Stanley who dropped ember into

00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:59,050
into Brendan's first project and left

00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:59,920
the app but he's actually got a heart of

00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:01,510
gold and there's no way this

00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:04,510
presentation would have ever gotten made

00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:06,190
or tweet links without his help and a

00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:09,100
fellow by the name of Jeremy row is

00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:11,800
super awesome and took me put his arm

00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:13,540
around me and taught amber and and

00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:16,570
paired with me for like six months on

00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:19,450
the application they're just very very

00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:22,090
painful early days so it's a lot better

00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:24,310
and it's it's the community that makes

00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:26,440
impossible things possible so thank you

00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:31,170
guys very much please no questions JK

00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:31,170
lawl second animated thingy

00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:08,390
