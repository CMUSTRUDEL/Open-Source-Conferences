	00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:20,619
we're going to start let's just

00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:23,050
introduce left to right and tell us your

00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:25,720
name your role and tell us a little bit

00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,760
about your company sure my name is Greg

00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,490
Nokes I lead the technical account

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,760
management team at Roku some icon yes

00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:40,390
okay um basically what we do is we work

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:42,780
with we work with a number of customers

00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:46,090
on the hooker platform to help them with

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,260
architecture scaling advice just about

00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:51,190
anything they need to help them be

00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:53,260
successful on the platform yeah my name

00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:55,179
is up prashant throughout I'm with HP

00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:57,160
cloud services I run the sales

00:00:55,179 --> 00:01:00,730
engineering solution architecture team

00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:04,379
so HP Cloud is a public cloud offering

00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:06,220
that's based on OpenStack and

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,130
essentially it offers a number of

00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,820
capabilities whether its infrastructure

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,130
as a service as well as

00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:15,930
platform-as-a-service competitive

00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:20,200
offering to Heroku and and the others

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:21,730
yeah that's what Rick I have dr. Nick

00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,210
and I've just sent the seat without a

00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:30,640
microphone it was very good planning in

00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:32,140
my behalf yeah that'll be awesome I run

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,260
a consultancy called stock and wine

00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:37,390
which is the I believe the only company

00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:41,460
ever to have not one but two fictional

00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:44,110
founders and we're finally appropriate

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,360
almost entirely focused on Cloud Foundry

00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,560
and getting it adopted and used and with

00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,110
the hope that then I'll have something

00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:53,320
to do I had to help those people so it

00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:55,360
runs on on top of HP or could run on top

00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:59,380
of HP runs in Amazon any OpenStack

00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,450
environment any vSphere etc so it's a

00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:03,760
yeah as we talked a couple hours ago

00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:06,180
bringing green cloud foundry to your

00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,580
organization

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,229
alright so my name is Jay Austin QAM a

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,880
field application engineer at engine

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,530
yard and as yards a platform as a

00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,560
service that presently runs on Amazon

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,260
ec2 though we are moving that to other

00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,250
infrastructures as well in the future

00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,780
basically you know deploy your code we

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,390
bootstrap an entire singleton

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:28,380
environment stack with gentoo linux is

00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:31,110
the US and yeah Ruby nodejs and PHP

00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:33,170
support you got a zoo oh yeah sure is it

00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,150
then well i'm going to later oh yeah

00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:38,040
sorry that's a nick always pulling out

00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,900
new and interesting information i'm jim

00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,700
meyer i am a vp of software development

00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,430
in the cloud products division at

00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:48,959
Rackspace however you may know me as

00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:50,520
either perp on twitter or github I go

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,959
back to about two thousand seven in the

00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,780
Ruby community which does not predate

00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:58,260
another person on this stage where I

00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:00,000
walked out of animation and into the

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,280
internet and started dealing in

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,260
milliseconds and had very smart people

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,660
such as some of the people at this place

00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,130
start teaching me what what's going on

00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:13,709
so I'm really excited to be on this side

00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:19,220
of the days of the five of you panelist

00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:21,390
and the the platforms that you represent

00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:26,670
gonna see a show of hands how many of

00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:32,459
you actually use Amazon ec2 as your

00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:35,580
infrastructure as a service okay okay

00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:37,170
dude so now let's let's we're going to

00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,090
do a little bit more one-on-one stuff

00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:42,140
right so that we can keep everybody up

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:45,540
with this can we get an explanation of

00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:48,420
how we use Amazon what is infrastructure

00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:51,810
as a service give us the nature of the

00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:54,720
architecture of your solutions

00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:57,570
individually and explain to me why why

00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,090
is that architecture better perhaps than

00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,260
someone who's doing it differently here

00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,690
we start with the rec space people

00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,130
whatever I should I would say the other

00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,239
way around let's let's start with the

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,700
people who've chosen to build a business

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,850
that's purely on an IAS rather than the

00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,710
people who provide it where's looking at

00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:17,800
me okay so

00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:20,110
heroku is completely built on Amazon we

00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,610
are in the u.s. East region right now

00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:23,290
spread across the majority of

00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:24,970
availability zones and we're a

00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,770
multi-tenant infrastructure as opposed

00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,840
to say engineering singleton and

00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,460
infrastructure what that means is when

00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,860
you deploy your code you're deploying

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:35,470
your clothes code into a cloud that is

00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:38,350
supporting multiple other application

00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:41,850
simultaneously the routing mesh sits on

00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:44,440
top of what's called our dyno manifold

00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:46,750
has nothing to do with Dinosaurs though

00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,550
though I wish it did that would be

00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,960
awesome it would be awesome although

00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,120
even more awesome is when i worked at

00:04:49,960 --> 00:05:00,960
Inchon yard my son thought that was a

00:04:52,120 --> 00:05:04,780
train conductor will exactly but um the

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:09,820
strictest the strength there for us is

00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:13,240
that we can scale beyond imagination I

00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:16,270
believe we're running close to 2.5 or 3

00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,250
million applications right now so you

00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:22,510
know when you deploy to something like

00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:24,910
Roku that you have a lot of company that

00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:28,480
if something goes wrong it's not just

00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:30,100
your application down it's the AIDS 2.58

00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,150
a different way we need to play your ok

00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,910
you'll be one of two million

00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:37,990
applications and hope they find you oh

00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:39,340
yes exactly but um so you know that

00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,300
there's a lot of bright people working

00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:44,590
very hard to get those other

00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:46,660
applications along with yours up you can

00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:48,370
go oh you want me to go next ok all

00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,530
right so um engineers been around for a

00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:52,360
while we're basically on ec2 because of

00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:55,570
the time that was pretty much your best

00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,800
bet for building you know and if Pat

00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,390
platforms to service on top of a

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,250
probably the most mature infrastructure

00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,300
as a service of the time they've been in

00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,640
the game for quite a while so they've

00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,870
got quite a bit of innovation behind

00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,100
there I mean Netflix is one of the

00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,050
largest customers and they've been

00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,340
building a lot of innovative new

00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,200
products and services to try to meet

00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,480
that demand at a low that Netflix throws

00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,040
at them so you know that's one thing

00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,680
although we are taking it in a direction

00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:20,440
to go multi infrastructure in the future

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,120
for example we are building windows

00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,729
azure integration right now not on

00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,830
Windows OS but just their cloud product

00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:28,600
infrastructure that also runs linux

00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:31,090
so that's just one of what we hope will

00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:35,470
be many possible infrastructure choices

00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:36,970
in the future they're the pivotal people

00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:40,240
that run Cloud Foundry is a hosted

00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:42,130
service chose this year move from from

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,920
vSphere data center tour these

00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:46,330
fear-based data center amazon and I I

00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,120
think that starts and finishes with

00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:52,000
relative cost and and the stability of

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,580
got that platform so you know if you're

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,230
going to commit to Amazon you get you

00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,760
can you know you can put pony up some

00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:59,590
money and get some we have pretty good

00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:03,460
discounts on their their their

00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:04,720
off-the-shelf pricing and you know

00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,430
unless you want to run your own data

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,970
center there's a lot of belly to be

00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:12,760
gained from the 80 s or Rackspace HP so

00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:14,530
there's there's a deep stack I mean if

00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,640
you ever learn rails if you pick up

00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,850
Rosie there's going to be awesome

00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:23,830
anything I gotta learn JavaScript and

00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:25,540
HTML and CSS and Ruby and about 50 gems

00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:27,820
that come with with it and then or

00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:30,430
another 50 you got to pick and work and

00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:32,620
then ran and our mental Unix commands

00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:39,520
and then how to configure my sequel and

00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:41,110
then had a configure postgres and you

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,880
know it just goes down and down and down

00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:44,740
so if you keep going down you have to

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,200
stop somewhere and that's I think the

00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,720
basis of why Amazon you know has been

00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:52,750
that were the service they provide and

00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,860
then why i wracked by HP I think that's

00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,390
probably one of the strengths of a

00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,730
platform as a service over

00:07:55,390 --> 00:08:00,070
infrastructures of service is that going

00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:01,840
down stops a lot higher know what's

00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:03,190
something like Heroku or Engine Yard you

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,520
don't have to learn how to configure

00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:08,200
postgres or or MySQL you can will do

00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,990
that for you you don't have to figure

00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,190
out how to consider configure

00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:14,740
application containers or application

00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:16,450
servers you just run them in their way

00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,740
and they just work that's true although

00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,660
there is a lot of value in knowing how

00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,490
to do that stuff because once you do

00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,350
know that stuff you can actually figure

00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:26,230
out oh yeah this is family because x y&z

00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:29,550
much faster well you also get the you

00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:32,530
get the opportunity and the pain that

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:34,690
was fun you get the opportunity to paint

00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:35,860
22 to optimize right i mean that's

00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,479
that's part of the challenges that

00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,870
you're starting to scale a nap and

00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:42,610
in 2008 the theme of railsconf was rails

00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:44,260
can't scale but scale is not your

00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:46,510
problem because your problem is getting

00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:48,610
your idea to market right and so when

00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:50,440
you're in that phase a pass makes total

00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,670
sense let me get some place so I could

00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,620
just get my idea in front of customers

00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:56,230
and see if they think it's good because

00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:58,570
I gotta tell you I think left-handed

00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:00,670
feathered gloves are fantastic they're

00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:03,639
going to go big this year right so so

00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:04,959
consequently when you find that you

00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:06,370
start having problems of scale whether

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,350
it's inside of the framework whether

00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,000
it's inside of well now i need to do i

00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,529
need to separate concerns in my large

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,420
app and make two different pieces of a

00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:15,279
service-oriented architecture that's

00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,959
when you start thinking about well how

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,420
far down do I want to drive my knowledge

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,100
in order to gain optimizations either in

00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,899
the way that my code performs my

00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:26,139
maintainability or sometimes just

00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:27,399
straight up costs right there's a lot of

00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:29,320
times that you want a balance between

00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:31,029
those two as well because sometimes you

00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,560
you might want to go the whole you know

00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:34,000
straight up I'm gonna you know build my

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,500
own stack in you know if you need to do

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,490
that they need to do it but sometimes

00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,139
you know you don't really wanna get

00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:40,180
mired down in that spending days weeks

00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:41,889
getting that stuff bootstrap and set up

00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,089
and ready to go which is where a past

00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:44,860
that you know can provide a lot of

00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:45,970
flexibility is very handy because you

00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,500
know you can automate it with say you

00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,089
know chef or something like that yeah

00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,310
not that you can't you know with an

00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:53,560
infrastructure but how much of it do you

00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:55,240
have to automate because you know for

00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,920
example in in gr we do have a lot of the

00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:00,130
the standard stack engine X you know

00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:02,620
memcache post car CD etc postgresql

00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,790
excuse me already built in so you don't

00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,199
have the right shown chef that I got to

00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,550
worry about configuring it and then you

00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:08,380
can write your own for the pieces that

00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:09,610
you do need to so it's kind of a balance

00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,649
point you know how far do you want to go

00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:14,230
yeah I mean and and there's where you

00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:15,160
start talking about how much you care

00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,019
about your environments your

00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,490
orchestration right and I don't know if

00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:20,319
any of you who are here for the cloud

00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:22,690
foundry talked earlier and just

00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:23,769
discussing the idea of I don't want to

00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:26,949
think about I just want a container that

00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:28,449
runs the thing right except that kind of

00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:30,670
the underlying message of that and Nick

00:10:28,449 --> 00:10:34,730
you can call me a liar in a second oh I

00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:36,260
just that's me I mean the underlying

00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,430
message of that though under in bosch

00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,839
and in what we're doing what we're

00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:41,149
starting up with rum and i think several

00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:42,500
other people's efforts is you know what

00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:44,060
i do sometimes care about the container

00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,860
so I'd actually like to structure the

00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,600
way that I want my container to be I

00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,970
want to be able to blueprint it a little

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,130
bit and then spin those out particularly

00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:54,040
Nick you were saying earlier like custom

00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:57,350
guys in the UK came up with a Cassandra

00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:59,480
container a Cassandra iteration of Bosh

00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:02,180
it's like here wash yourself out you've

00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,649
got a Cassandra instance now if you care

00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,899
you have the tweak ability right I can

00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:09,050
lean into it I can get insight if I want

00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:10,459
to it's not just a big black box that's

00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,959
frankly a rackspace one of the things

00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:14,149
that we believe is hugely important as

00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:15,529
we want to provide we want to give you

00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:17,990
the chance to drive it down as far as

00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:20,600
you need to and then as broadly as you

00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:23,180
need to so that's part of why we care a

00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,320
lot about you'll hear us a hybrid cloud

00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:27,620
now how many people here in the room

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:30,670
know what a hybrid cloud really is yeah

00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:33,170
that's what I expected how many about

00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:35,360
well justjust for correlations sake how

00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:38,899
many people in the room are a CIO at a

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,870
major enterprise yeah roughly same

00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:43,250
number has so the higher all we're

00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:45,560
saying with a hybrid cloud is that

00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:48,410
sometimes you need things which aren't

00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:50,810
in the public cloud like you might need

00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:52,279
a particular f5 load balance or

00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:54,230
something else so being able to actually

00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:56,029
pull these things together and let you

00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,980
optimize your application in any

00:11:56,029 --> 00:11:59,440
direction and optimize your architecture

00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,639
in any direction is a valuable thing

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,139
yeah that's absolutely correct them and

00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:04,610
just it add on to that with regard to

00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,920
the hybrid cloud I mean the hybrid cloud

00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:08,690
allows you to have essentially the right

00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,370
cloud for the right to use case or

00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:13,160
scenario so whether it's a private cloud

00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:15,319
or managed cloud or a public cloud being

00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,060
able to have the capability access

00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:19,639
resources across those different types

00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:21,019
of clouds for your particular scenarios

00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:23,660
what you need because there may be

00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:26,209
regulatory requirements I just concerns

00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:29,149
etc that a public cloud may not be

00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:32,899
suitable for so we can all agree the

00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:35,510
heroic is wrong that we're all agree I

00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:37,780
can go with that let's vote someone off

00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:40,220
the island

00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:42,170
let's let's see a quick show of hands

00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:49,070
please raise your hand if you deploy to

00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:51,860
Heroku you're wrong obviously I could

00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:54,770
show I could do it avail oh but I won't

00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,060
do that sorry now let me say that dr.

00:12:54,770 --> 00:13:00,350
Nix gonna have a hard time getting out

00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:02,420
of this room yeah sorry let's talk about

00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:07,250
level of abstraction for a minute and

00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:09,620
and we'll start you know at the high

00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:11,300
level and then deep dive right so i

00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:15,740
knows i stop with the abstraction then

00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:18,320
remove exactly um I've deployed to

00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:20,450
Heroku thousands of times so that's my

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,950
disclaimer right I've deployed to

00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:25,280
engineer it I haven't important anywhere

00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:27,260
else I may be biased I'm sorry but I'm

00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:29,000
trying to just get it out there right

00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:32,660
why did I deploy to Heroku because

00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Heroku made it so darn easy for me right

00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:37,400
I'm not a system administrator I want to

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,410
focus on my code i deploy to Heroku and

00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:42,230
I forget about it now I have another

00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:44,690
number of individuals on my staff that

00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:47,750
do not like Heroku because it's so

00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:49,640
highly abstracted they want to write

00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:52,010
their own chef scripts they want to

00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:54,050
manage their own infrastructure they

00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:55,910
want more visibility into what their

00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:58,280
machines are doing they want to provide

00:13:55,910 --> 00:14:00,590
rugged you know they want software

00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:03,290
watching software I mean I'm that sort

00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:05,150
of person that's why my life that's why

00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:06,860
I like Cloud Foundry is because it

00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:08,870
provides that feature and you can you

00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,670
can run it and it's a black box if you

00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:12,410
wish it to be a black box but it is

00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:14,120
entirely open sores it's running

00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:16,550
entirely open source you know services

00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,350
etc and you can start digging into it

00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:20,900
you know get all nerd fest e on it all

00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:23,420
why should you like there's a lot of

00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:25,040
that's code there I'm sure if a new

00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:27,800
employee joining Heroku if they wanted

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,810
to know all the code base themselves I'm

00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,510
sure the truck ton of code they know I

00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:33,590
spent two years engine yard before I you

00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:35,210
know and during that period of time I

00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:36,380
eventually got to the point where I

00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:38,980
could explain any part of it to anyone

00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,899
but it still took months and perhaps

00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,250
every year to feel constipation when you

00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:46,720
get down to how the helped into works

00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:51,490
yah yah urge world that's right is

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:53,139
always another layup of height he speaks

00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,610
the truth so you know something that is

00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:56,980
that me the great thing about all of

00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:59,139
them is I'm sure they even even the way

00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:01,060
that the is is the two is has Rackspace

00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:02,350
ranch basin and Xperia Pro still build

00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:05,380
an entirely open source and that's

00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:06,880
really that core idea is is really

00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:10,600
important the idea that you can as

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,220
necessary peak in debug fix you know

00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,399
because this is your company we're

00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:18,279
talking about in if you know engines

00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:20,139
again I describe it yes there this

00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:22,209
obviously blends across the employer

00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:24,310
said about hurricane be no black boxes

00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:26,260
can cause you grief now the great thing

00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:28,990
Heric you has now is build packs so at

00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:30,579
least that part I don't think you know

00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:32,110
this all the services are all going to

00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:34,980
be black boxes because we're all here

00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:37,870
Hercules grace or the SAS companies but

00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:39,639
yeah I think it's part of the ability to

00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,889
sleep at night as the ability to say if

00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:44,170
it goes down what's what's my debugging

00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:47,069
process and what do I do about it I read

00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:49,750
a really good article a few months ago

00:15:47,069 --> 00:15:52,959
cio was talking about moving his company

00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:56,920
to the cloud they said the the big chip

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:59,260
for him was from being on the phone and

00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,510
calling engineers when they had an

00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:03,430
outage to taking a jog when they have an

00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:05,290
outage in knowing when he came back that

00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:07,149
the cloud engineers that they had hired

00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:11,470
would have them back up and running I

00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:14,139
think that's kind of that's loopy he's

00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,610
still gonna care just he now the people

00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:17,470
are gonna fix it don't work for him so

00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:18,519
he can't yell at them oh he can yell at

00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:21,459
them you can take her money elsewhere

00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:23,589
you know I don't see how how he changed

00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:27,010
his his jogging habits and his phone

00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:28,630
handling habits I don't know I'm

00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,920
confused about that so if you could

00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:31,899
explain from a different way than to be

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,630
helping me I think that it's you know

00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:36,579
knowing that some of the smartest people

00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:37,959
in the industry but these smartest

00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:40,600
people i mean i'm sitting next to one of

00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:41,769
the smartest people i believe but some

00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,579
of the smartest people in the industry

00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:47,670
are working on on your problem

00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:49,769
and fixing it as fast as they can is

00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:51,959
that the assumption that would be the

00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:53,910
assumption that some skeleton hire the

00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:56,189
best people but he assumes that with the

00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:58,459
enough abstraction the best person is

00:16:56,189 --> 00:17:00,389
working somewhere in the stack exactly

00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:01,499
like I make sense from an economic

00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:03,149
standpoint if you're kind of a you know

00:17:01,499 --> 00:17:04,740
small to midsize firm you know are you

00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:06,209
gonna necessarily have a budget or you

00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,029
know the notoriety to hire somebody that

00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:10,019
you know amazon could you know yeah

00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:12,689
you're talking about fractional

00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:16,559
expertise right essentially I can by

00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:18,059
spending my dollars in sales I can well

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,519
so so on so I should have actually

00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:23,970
introduced myself hi i am the son of an

00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:25,500
English teacher is so my vocabulary well

00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,120
an English teacher and a geek so my

00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,610
vocabulary is both expensive and tends

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,559
towards I want to put it into words so

00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:33,720
at any rate right you're reaching out

00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:35,220
safe I spend my dollars here I get

00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,019
expertise that can be applied to my

00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,580
problems whether they're the problems

00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:40,200
I'm currently having oh god it's on fire

00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,360
please let's not that have that problem

00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,940
or the problems that I don't want to

00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,409
have like oh god I am NOT going to be on

00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:50,159
fire because it's all been taken care of

00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:51,690
and well done I honestly I absolutely

00:17:50,159 --> 00:17:53,850
agree i think that that's the key just

00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:58,139
wrenching her perky in the semi excited

00:17:53,850 --> 00:18:01,019
hmm you know and what has outages ride

00:17:58,139 --> 00:18:02,549
sitting over there XY some HP never

00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:04,909
Vantage's but the two i mentioned dude

00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:04,909
and

00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:12,009
yeah sure I mean my Twitter to give

00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:13,389
anybody you said my twitter face never

00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:18,219
been filled up with ppl bitching about

00:18:13,389 --> 00:18:19,989
Rex place our hands and you know so when

00:18:18,219 --> 00:18:22,629
they it's like or you can do at that

00:18:19,989 --> 00:18:25,059
point it's just just the Mon to each

00:18:22,629 --> 00:18:26,469
other I call it a social outage it's

00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:29,859
Wayne everyone shared infrastructure

00:18:26,469 --> 00:18:32,589
dies and brings on I know that's working

00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:34,809
so maybe it's a social image it's um but

00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:37,119
then yummy not that I'm looking to be

00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:39,669
the apologist for Heroku but let's be

00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:42,399
clear my twitter feed fills when when

00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:44,409
Amazon East goes down when core

00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:46,329
functionality at pretty much any major

00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:48,879
cloud provider suddenly takes a dump

00:18:46,329 --> 00:18:52,719
yeah oh yeah you hear about it right and

00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:54,969
and so I guess I get back to then with

00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:56,979
nothing I can do about it I think that

00:18:54,969 --> 00:18:58,539
the sum that well that so that doesn't

00:18:56,979 --> 00:18:59,799
like split taste but I think that the I

00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:01,509
think that the statement was be made I

00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:03,389
think it's absolutely true is that what

00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:05,619
happens is you vote with your dollars

00:19:03,389 --> 00:19:09,249
right and that's the thing is that you

00:19:05,619 --> 00:19:12,099
take if if your app stack takes a dump

00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:13,719
on me repeatedly I'm either first I'm

00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:15,519
gonna drive further down right i want it

00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:17,709
i want my technical stack to be like the

00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:19,299
waters of the Caribbean i want to be

00:19:17,709 --> 00:19:20,799
able to see completely and clearly to

00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:23,139
the bottom I don't necessarily want to

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,819
go diving all the time but I want to

00:19:23,139 --> 00:19:28,749
know that if I'm gonna I can see what's

00:19:24,819 --> 00:19:30,159
in there and consequently if you're

00:19:28,749 --> 00:19:32,049
taking a dump on me and I have no

00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:33,219
insight yeah I'm going to vote with my

00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:35,019
feet I'm going to take my business

00:19:33,219 --> 00:19:36,459
somewhere else and so the only advantage

00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:38,409
that you have if you choose to treat

00:19:36,459 --> 00:19:40,169
your customers that way is I'm going to

00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:43,329
make it so damn hard for you to leave

00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:45,459
that you just can't possibly and I mean

00:19:43,329 --> 00:19:48,579
the great news is regardless of what you

00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:51,909
think of any of us up here you work in

00:19:48,579 --> 00:19:54,099
frameworks that have deployment tools to

00:19:51,909 --> 00:19:56,079
get you anywhere you need to go right

00:19:54,099 --> 00:20:00,519
how many people here primarily work on

00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:02,199
rails apps yeah so that's a good half so

00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:03,909
at least half of you are our sort of

00:20:02,199 --> 00:20:06,459
huge improved right because you're in a

00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:09,009
supportive community and any one of us

00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:11,979
can happily hook you up I mean I'm not

00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:14,319
ashamed to admit in 2007 I was one of

00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:15,759
engine yards first customers i actually

00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:16,020
was having the joy of gentoo then there

00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:19,050
now

00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:21,210
the regret of gentoo but with highly

00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:25,080
tooled cab deploy recipes and everything

00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:27,450
else and again coming straight out of an

00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,540
entirely different industry oh my god

00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:31,860
the learning burden seemed enormous oh

00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:33,420
and then by the way by day i was also

00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:38,370
showing the pitch deck for the startup

00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:40,200
and all of the rest and sleep much so at

00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:42,900
the same time that learning does have

00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,280
value i think that i would recommend

00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,980
regardless of where you are what you're

00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:49,140
doing the further the further down your

00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,640
stack you can see the better you can

00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,950
understand the technical current

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,190
concerns underlying it you have the

00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:59,340
opportunity to then judge better whose

00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:02,070
fractional expertise our trust right who

00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:03,300
has the people who have concerns have

00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:05,610
smartness around the concerns that you

00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:09,540
have so if i could sell your company for

00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:12,780
you and an HP both OpenStack yes sorry I

00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:14,970
mean I in terms of Technology choice I

00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:17,220
mean that they least I don't know how

00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:18,930
different you are from pure OpenStack or

00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,670
you know I know you some kind of

00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:22,860
launched it show show show doesn't have

00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:25,950
nothing by the way Amazon law has been

00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:28,290
Thursday for three years today sorry

00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:30,090
that does it I mean amazon launched two

00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:32,040
ec2 and they weren't using it so you

00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:34,590
know it was years before they put

00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,150
amazon.com on it mmm yeah i mean i

00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,860
appreciate the ability to sale at least

00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:40,410
i can look at and understand how your

00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:42,180
product works or doesn't mm-hm I guess

00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:48,180
the black box benefit Amazon's you can't

00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:50,370
see hmm the crap yeah but I visibility I

00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:52,560
think in terms of knowledge of coh CTO

00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:56,370
visibility's ability to be visible

00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:59,040
busily to to fix is important event or

00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:00,750
Mac thanks please so gentlemen let's

00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,170
let's do this let's remember that we

00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:06,720
have a room full of Ruby developers okay

00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:09,770
um let's assume that we're all going to

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,770
dives elixir talk

00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:16,650
let's assume that they're still trying

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:21,520
to figure out what the hell cloud is

00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:22,750
right some of you said you none of there

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,430
were some of you that did not raise your

00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:27,010
hand when we talked about are you

00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:29,410
deploying to Amazon right yet you have

00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:34,860
two people work another company like a

00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:37,930
good fun you asked it the past tense

00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:39,940
let's take a step back and talk about

00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:43,120
what we're talking about what is cloud

00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:45,970
computing right why does it matter some

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,190
of you have hybrid clouds out of how the

00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:49,810
heck did you get there why are we

00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:50,980
calling it a hybrid cloud and why I

00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:53,890
think most importantly why does it

00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:56,380
matter to the folks in this room renting

00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:57,880
api's and renting I mean though the

00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,050
papacy other than others can elaborate

00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,750
on that but I think they're the two key

00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:04,450
aspects of you know what was the premise

00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:06,220
of SAS and cloud is perhaps you know SAS

00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,800
as an infrastructure infrastructure as

00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,790
assess the ability to rent something as

00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,500
opposed to have to make a capital

00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:13,930
investment which sounds awesome i mean

00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,670
tax deductible wise i think if you buy

00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:18,280
machinery you can kind of depreciate

00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:19,780
it's also similar but there's that

00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,490
aspects italy great for when you don't

00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:23,440
know exactly what you need and then

00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:26,260
there's the AP ipod mean if you've ever

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,300
had to send a fax in to someone or an

00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:30,390
email saying i'd like something you know

00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:32,710
it's not going to be the most efficient

00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:35,290
purchasing acquisition experience ever

00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:37,330
but when you know if there's an API and

00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:38,560
we can now that you know it feels

00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:40,570
the pitcher matt how long it takes for

00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,910
the end turn up like let's just go back

00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:44,170
a few years and how he likes secrets

00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:45,640
there's a there's a wonderful

00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:47,710
presentation before i came engineer i

00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:50,320
watch the talk from ezra who's over the

00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:51,970
founders of engine yard and an atom from

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,620
from opcode they did a talk of lossy

00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:56,800
comp and they'll talking about this what

00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:58,930
is cloud as 2009 and any idea where

00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:01,450
these two said was things as things

00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:03,610
change based on earth when you remove

00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:05,560
the bionics so what is cloud was the

00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:07,320
consequence of cloud is that we went

00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:10,270
from a bottleneck of getting new machine

00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:12,400
perked from de purchased two delivered

00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:14,620
not provisioned not right around app but

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,870
just in your in your infrastructure six

00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:20,310
weeks to a minute and a half

00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:22,650
so that's one bottle neck kind of gone

00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:24,390
so so when you go to the six-week thing

00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:26,100
it's not really appropriate to take

00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:28,020
three days to set that machine up

00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,790
anymore and that's where Adam was

00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,320
talking about chef and the importance of

00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:33,090
this stuff and I think this is part of

00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,590
what what is the why you need to care

00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:36,780
about cloud is every part of the

00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:38,610
bottleneck of not just running your app

00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:42,980
and deploying it but owning it is being

00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:45,240
aggressively removed and you know I

00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:49,290
don't know what the point was well so

00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,760
actually I'm just gonna say so so nick

00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:55,710
is it okay if I use fractional again oh

00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:57,330
yeah so it so like you said it's renting

00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:59,010
in its api's so it's being able to

00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:01,560
programmatically interact with a set of

00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:03,810
resources that you can that you can use

00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,670
fractionally so I can buy a very large

00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:07,560
box and stick it in my data center in

00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:10,530
one of the six or eight that we've got

00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:13,380
laying around and you can borrow a piece

00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:15,630
of it for a short time what this

00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:18,900
actually results in is you have this

00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:21,240
enormous reduction in capital to being

00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:23,010
able to say hey I've got an idea I'd

00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,480
like to take an idea to the market when

00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:26,520
you rise money now you're not rising it

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,570
for Catholic cost any more exactly right

00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,860
you're not worrying about putting a

00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:30,540
bunch of things in a data center and

00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,400
having a bunch of guys who know how to

00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,750
like take a box out of a box and stick

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,820
it into a rack and deal with all of that

00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:37,380
you're just saying okay I've got my

00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:39,840
Amazon key I've got my rack space key

00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:42,630
I've got my hero cookie whoever and I

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,340
can get this going this means that we're

00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:47,520
actually living in this golden age of

00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:50,520
ideas if the buddy right this is this

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,970
means that you have this chance to say i

00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:55,470
can get my idea to the market frankly i

00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:58,200
can find out the first five of them are

00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:00,030
crap but the sixth one might be gold I

00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:03,240
think to distill it down a little bit

00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:05,700
beyond that it's you know the first Ruby

00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:09,210
app rails app I ever deployed was to a

00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:11,700
dell 2950 sitting in iraq at a data

00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:16,170
center that I owned running on mob Ruby

00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:18,480
with Apache it took me probably three or

00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:19,950
four days after putting linux on and all

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,250
that to get it set up and running and

00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:23,250
all

00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:25,170
that now I can do a git push and I have

00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:27,630
my application up and running in five

00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:30,600
minutes it on a slow day I think that

00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:33,390
that's a distilled down cloud it's just

00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:36,570
simply an evolution of deployment from

00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:37,500
incredibly slow and painful to something

00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:39,000
you don't even really think about it

00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,860
Gregory slow and painful and someone

00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,750
else's job yeah young companies

00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:44,520
constantly also said well I think it's

00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:46,170
also important just from a foundational

00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,730
point of view too let's talk about the

00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:49,590
terms namely you know we'd had the

00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:52,620
description of basically it's you know

00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:54,660
you rent services you rent is paid by

00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:57,150
use basically as well as its automated

00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:58,530
via AP eyes but also we really need to

00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:59,760
look at the different layers I mean here

00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:02,580
of course we have to infrastructure

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,230
vendors Rackspace and HP cloud with

00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,730
essentially offering the infrastructure

00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:07,680
as a service and which that can be

00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:10,740
broken down into storage networking and

00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:12,720
compute so and then on top of that you

00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:15,930
have the platform as a service offerings

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,780
whether it be Heroku engine yard in a

00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:22,260
case of HP Cloud we've om staccato which

00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:23,670
is a fork of cloud foundry and Rackspace

00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:26,190
I believe they have been offering as

00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:29,580
well as version it's an old version okay

00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:30,990
and and and then on top of that once you

00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:33,060
get higher up the stack you'd go with

00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:35,370
SAS solutions of course like Salesforce

00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:37,710
so all of these have been generally fall

00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:39,270
under the rubric of cloud computing and

00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:40,680
I think you know what we're talking

00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:43,290
about here in particular for Ruby

00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:45,140
developers one that kind of threads we

00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:48,060
had earlier was whether you want to have

00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:50,670
focus at the past layer at the platform

00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:52,350
as a surface blur or have visibility

00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:54,480
down into the infrastructure layer where

00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:57,000
you can actually deploy a private pass

00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:00,480
at the infrastructure layer and have

00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,950
complete control as nicholas eng so it

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,690
kind of depends on where you want there

00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:05,970
are some benefits and drawbacks from

00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:07,560
that of course so wait a minute so i

00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:10,490
just heard that you guys are all up

00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,490
there for working each other

00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:15,590
the real question is what are their

00:28:13,549 --> 00:28:17,830
similarities what are the commonalities

00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:20,269
between your platforms and your services

00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:22,759
well they're two different three

00:28:20,269 --> 00:28:25,070
different layers faintest unit so just

00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:28,279
to clarify to infrastructure guys sylvie

00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:30,649
m's like amazon and as in networking in

00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:33,919
and disk and possibly services that you

00:28:30,649 --> 00:28:35,239
know all the way to Engine Yard does

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,009
similar what Bosh does which is

00:28:35,239 --> 00:28:38,659
orchestrates there to make it simpler as

00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:40,700
a you know the focus on getting app

00:28:38,659 --> 00:28:43,999
deploy in your database deployed and the

00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:46,460
life cycle of that and they're not so

00:28:43,999 --> 00:28:48,969
the cloud foundry and Heroku is where it

00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:52,789
says there's an app as running now

00:28:48,969 --> 00:28:55,849
everyone cut and said the kind of you

00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:57,469
know different levels of is I don't know

00:28:55,849 --> 00:28:59,450
how are you supposed to yeah it's not

00:28:57,469 --> 00:29:01,729
deeply want to go yeah I was gonna say I

00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:03,950
think that I mean among this I would say

00:29:01,729 --> 00:29:06,080
the HP public cloud and Rackspace are

00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:07,580
most similar in that we're both running

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,889
OpenStack and say you're going to have

00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:11,479
the same exact set of api's and full API

00:29:09,889 --> 00:29:14,629
compatibility and full portability

00:29:11,479 --> 00:29:16,700
between the two right again we strive we

00:29:14,629 --> 00:29:18,259
don't want lock in you may have heard

00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:20,529
somebody at Rackspace a fanatical

00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:23,479
customer support we want you there

00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:25,549
because you can't stand to be somewhere

00:29:23,479 --> 00:29:27,259
else because we do so much good for you

00:29:25,549 --> 00:29:28,399
because you value our fractional

00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:31,759
expertise I'm going to use that phrase

00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:33,019
every chance I get that's great right

00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:35,599
you value everything that you're getting

00:29:33,019 --> 00:29:37,729
in the package from us so much that you

00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:38,839
don't want to go but if you want to go

00:29:37,729 --> 00:29:40,249
we want to make sure that you can

00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:41,869
because there are a number of people now

00:29:40,249 --> 00:29:44,479
coming out saying you know what this

00:29:41,869 --> 00:29:46,399
OpenStack idea is great and we we agree

00:29:44,479 --> 00:29:49,549
let's let you see to the bottom of the

00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,419
water come join us right yeah that's so

00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:51,950
that's one of the things that a lot of

00:29:50,419 --> 00:29:53,059
people don't really focus on is that

00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:54,379
when it comes to infrastructure as a

00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:57,139
service for platforms of service I

00:29:54,379 --> 00:29:59,749
really focus is on the first letter but

00:29:57,139 --> 00:30:01,219
not on the last one service human means

00:29:59,749 --> 00:30:05,200
doing things for you helping you out

00:30:01,219 --> 00:30:05,200
leveraging their fractional expertise

00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:12,630
I'm sort of saying that every time I

00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:16,530
can't now to just gonna start tweeting

00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:17,970
it with AB dr. Nick yeah flash mosh zu c

00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:19,890
see what somebody out there right now

00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:22,440
please tweet ab dr. Davis actual

00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:23,940
expertise yes please be sure to hashtag

00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,420
it for exercises you want to throw in

00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:28,410
there well yeah I mean it's a key thing

00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:30,300
right I mean you've got to have that

00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:31,620
service back all those great

00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,330
technologies because eventually you know

00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,560
we're all human beings we're all make

00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:36,630
mistakes something Bad's going to happen

00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:38,340
either you're in on one of our and it

00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:40,110
doesn't matter it's gonna happen so you

00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:42,480
might as well have some fractional

00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:44,160
expertise to help you out at the end of

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,910
the day so service doesn't matter quite

00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,560
a bit and that's one of the key

00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:48,480
differentiators that engine yard really

00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,950
tries to keep it on as well is that we

00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,990
don't want vendor lock-in anymore either

00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:56,280
you know so we do try to compete on that

00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:58,920
area as well all right question about

00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:00,210
OpenStack can I see a show of hands of

00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:03,630
individuals who understand what

00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:06,060
OpenStack is alright we've got about

00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:11,100
fifteen percent who strive to deploy

00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:14,490
artistic themselves yeah cool brave

00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:17,790
souls can one of you please explain

00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:20,270
OpenStack to the crowd ever at the

00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:20,270
Heroku guy

00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:28,930
sure I'll make it on ok sure so

00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:31,180
OpenStack was an initiative that was

00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:32,680
founded three years ago they she just

00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,120
recently had their birthday who's

00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:37,240
actually initially founded by Rackspace

00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:38,500
and NASA Rackspace contributed the

00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,940
essentially what's called an object

00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:43,390
storage which is equivalent to Amazon's

00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:45,820
s3 and NASA contributed a module called

00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:47,140
nova which is equivalent to Amazon's

00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:50,160
easy to basically the ability to spin

00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:52,480
spin up virtual machines so at the time

00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:55,330
so there's a lot of other history behind

00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:58,270
there but with the evolution of that

00:31:55,330 --> 00:32:01,630
basically OpenStack became probably the

00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:04,600
largest open source cloud computing

00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:07,330
platform in the world right now so I

00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:10,120
hate to use this analogy but I mean to a

00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:11,920
certain extent OpenStack is to cloud

00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:14,080
computing like Linux is to operating

00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,870
systems so I mean that's very late you

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,340
know kind of simplifying it quite a bit

00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:20,800
but it's a very large initiative it's

00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:23,560
got thousands of developers across the

00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:25,870
world HP as well as Rackspace and it's

00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:28,990
essentially it's an it's an on it

00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:30,670
exposes non-proprietary AP is for all of

00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:32,470
the services that expose and there's

00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:34,510
many different projects whether it's

00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:35,860
virtual machine capability object

00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:38,770
storage capability block storage

00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:41,350
capability networking with Cohen with a

00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:42,790
product that's not called neutron so

00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:45,150
there's all these projects that

00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:48,010
essentially interact via messaging pair

00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:50,530
using RabbitMQ or zeromq depending on

00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:52,270
their choice and essentially they're

00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:54,520
kind of loosely coupled but they all

00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:57,540
expose a REST API so you can automate

00:32:54,520 --> 00:33:00,190
everything in OpenStack via the api's

00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:02,200
it's completely well I think by and

00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:04,420
large it's written in Python it's by and

00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:07,570
large Python I think the other flavor

00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:10,030
that I would add is think of it as it's

00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:13,060
your entire infrastructure openly

00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:16,390
available to you for compute for files

00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:18,970
for block storage for network and you

00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:20,890
can talk to any piece of it and the joy

00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:22,960
for me has been watching as it came from

00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:23,920
a very basic level and the offerings are

00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,210
starting to become more and more

00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:27,790
complete I mean networking networking

00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:28,330
only entered in correcting grizzly or

00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,590
was it

00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:31,630
it's early employ them I think you could

00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:33,820
be impulsive right so it's as we are

00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:35,289
figuring out more and more of the pieces

00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:38,440
that you need to be able to talk to in

00:33:35,289 --> 00:33:39,970
order to orchestrate well and let's be

00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:42,130
really clear orchestration is what you

00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:45,220
care about if you don't know that that's

00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:46,600
something you need to understand so you

00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:48,429
can orchestrate well your entire

00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,169
infrastructure and remove the concern of

00:33:48,429 --> 00:33:54,610
strapping little things together and

00:33:50,169 --> 00:33:56,409
instead say I have 27 services in my in

00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:58,659
my service oriented architecture and I

00:33:56,409 --> 00:34:00,370
need to instantiate a new service over

00:33:58,659 --> 00:34:02,320
here with the usual architecture for it

00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:05,019
please go do that is everything else

00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:07,299
going well okay great right full think

00:34:05,019 --> 00:34:09,010
of being able to integrate all of them

00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:11,139
monitoring all of the deployment and all

00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:12,460
of these things and be working with the

00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:15,460
community people who have the same

00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:17,320
passion around some of these pieces so

00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:19,119
you get these things for free you don't

00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:22,389
care so much about monitoring well

00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:24,879
you're crazy okay but if you don't then

00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:26,560
you go out and you pick up the hub

00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,790
monitoring stuff right and you just put

00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,869
in place you're like I don't care find

00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:33,669
plug it and click look like I'm done

00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:35,200
right if you care passionately he just

00:34:33,669 --> 00:34:36,730
referenced actually there's there's a

00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,050
couple of providers who actually care a

00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:40,000
lot about the queuing system that's

00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:41,889
behind a lot of these solutions and so

00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,070
you pull up the stack out of the box you

00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:46,510
get RabbitMQ they're good folks at cloud

00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:48,820
scaling who decided zero infuse the way

00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:50,790
to go and so that's that's a choice they

00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:53,080
made they had that choice available

00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:55,089
those places where your business

00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:58,210
differentiates on how your stack works

00:34:55,089 --> 00:35:00,609
you have that choice available thank you

00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:03,510
Jim alright so a few of you are

00:35:00,609 --> 00:35:05,980
obviously very large fans of OpenStack

00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:07,270
David you might a fan of competition

00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,260
would you migrate to the middle of the

00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:10,390
room we're going to open up for

00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:12,070
questions we've only got about five to

00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:14,800
ten minutes here I want to give her a

00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:15,820
Roku a chance to talk about OpenStack if

00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,340
you want to

00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:20,020
about why not that if you want to say

00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:23,170
why not open stack why Heroku now's your

00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:26,470
chance um open sex great if you want to

00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:28,930
build amazon.com or am amazon ec2 it's

00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:30,310
it's really low level if you just wanted

00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:31,330
to pull your application and not worry

00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:33,610
about it if you have three or four

00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:35,980
developers and you just want to get push

00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:37,720
and have your application running that's

00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:39,400
basically where we come in we take care

00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,490
of all of that for you like use the

00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,300
tools I built or you can you waste

00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:44,740
orchestrate the building up with Cloud

00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:47,020
Foundry to tell the Pipers deck and

00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:48,970
you'll feel like super hero well I think

00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:51,310
the question two is like yeah you know

00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:55,000
is who open is I think the questioner

00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:58,090
Roku is is why isn't Heroku basically

00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,370
pursuing a multi cloud provider solution

00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:03,010
so that they're not it says so they're

00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:05,320
not susceptible to outages like netbook

00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:07,600
netflix had last Christmas Christmas Eve

00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:09,490
you know so that would be a question I

00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,760
would ask to Heroku there's definitely

00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:14,310
an internal conversation about that

00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,720
what's the other way what's the

00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:18,310
challenge is when you pick one of these

00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,900
things and you think you know yeah i'm

00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:22,120
gonna go with amazon but i want to keep

00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:25,180
my options open they're all suddenly

00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:26,890
different and it's really hard and back

00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:28,510
when we you know and obviously i know

00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:30,970
all of engine arts code and there's all

00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:32,770
these little things in it that you know

00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:35,470
they know you know that they wanted to

00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:37,090
not couple themselves to amazon but they

00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:38,140
did in the subtlest little ways like

00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:40,120
instead of passing around the

00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:45,130
credentials of good they passed around

00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:46,570
80 s access key nato a secret key it's

00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:48,520
like so even if we want it so i have to

00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:50,530
find and remove all of these and there's

00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:52,960
also said of working on that it's just

00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:55,060
it takes a long time and and you'll do

00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,370
it too and as I sort of mentioned my

00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:59,590
talk you know anyone has ever done

00:36:57,370 --> 00:37:01,930
configuration management may have used

00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:03,640
one of the big configuration management

00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:06,970
tools and then went and wrote their own

00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:08,950
orchestration layer around it and as

00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:10,330
well I like you know I talked about

00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:11,710
cloud foundry but that's the Bosch part

00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:13,720
that thing's super interesting is

00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:14,540
because it's one orchestration system

00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,520
that can focus

00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:19,340
all the different things that once

00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:23,090
talked about thank you we have a

00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:25,850
question hi with all the like big rage

00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:27,860
about docker and Linux containers in

00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:29,690
general right now I'd really curious to

00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:31,400
hear your thoughts on on the future of

00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:33,110
those within your respective companies

00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,090
and gentlemen we just have about five

00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:40,040
minutes we need to wrap up okay we got

00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:41,510
one more question over there de laga see

00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,820
her aquiline Cloud Foundry used them as

00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:45,890
the cool part of the product so they

00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:54,290
have a very good future you're awesome

00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:57,050
oh wow give me some tater action the

00:37:54,290 --> 00:38:00,080
ability to turn on a container and have

00:37:57,050 --> 00:38:05,090
a app server running in what ten 15

00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:06,620
seconds is it's kind of nice just a

00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:09,770
little bit i think actually i'm very

00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:14,060
curious how many people here have looked

00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:16,250
at flynn hasn't come out yet i got one

00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:17,900
hand in the back that up I just it's a

00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:20,390
website that says uh if you give us some

00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:22,430
money we might open sources that was so

00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:24,140
so so dr. Nick would like to steal my

00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:25,940
next question which is how many people

00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:29,330
here look at look at what's going on and

00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:32,900
think that we need another iteration in

00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:34,580
the container space what you mean Bianca

00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:37,250
yeah be on docker because I mean it

00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:38,510
really sounds like we're getting look at

00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,860
sorry what's the point well it seems

00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:42,680
like Flynn's trying to become next gen

00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:44,390
of docker no no it'sit's guys gonna use

00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,490
docker Dockers docker is a container

00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:48,080
thing like like wooden so you know I

00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,370
talked to it it gives you containers

00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,960
it's trying to build a pass on top of

00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:54,620
that so it's fair enough for deets I

00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,820
guess your Cloud Foundry okay okay i so

00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:58,580
i will tend as it's kind of like trying

00:38:55,820 --> 00:39:00,410
to make containers not important to you

00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:02,960
right they're just building blocks

00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:04,130
underneath this but we should listen to

00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,120
more questions because i'm busy talk

00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:07,720
more question i can have that

00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:09,430
conversation later but obviously flame

00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,109
I mean all this stuff kya foundry works

00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:14,470
right now not that it's not about to

00:39:11,109 --> 00:39:15,940
ship the same yes sweet the flame a

00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:18,490
doctor is a good solid piece of tech

00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:24,880
yeah go for it you guys talk about

00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:26,560
fractional expertise Netflix would you

00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,940
guys do your talking about scaling

00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,430
technology a lot how are you scaling

00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:33,160
customer service so the smaller shops

00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:35,080
can actually get more than a Twitter

00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,970
feed as to what might be going on with

00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:39,970
their applications when something goes

00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:43,630
wrong amigo commercial which gives you a

00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:48,310
smaller fraction you might say that's

00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:51,910
true Rackspace is roughly a 5,000 person

00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:54,340
company roughly forty percent of the

00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:58,119
people in our organization are dedicated

00:39:54,340 --> 00:40:00,099
to supporting our customers a really

00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:01,480
good chunk of those people are the

00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:06,430
people who are there on the phone if you

00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:08,530
call day or night 24 7 365 so when we

00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:10,960
talk about fanatical support that's

00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:12,369
exactly what we mean you call you get

00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,349
the person frankly you usually get the

00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:17,170
person you talked to last time they know

00:40:14,349 --> 00:40:19,210
you alright thank you gentlemen we've
