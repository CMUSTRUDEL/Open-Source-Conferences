Title: LoneStarRuby Conf 2013 - Why You Should Love The Command Line -

Description: 
	By Alan Skorkin - Why You Should Love The Command-Line And Get Rid of Your Rake Tasks Once and For All

Rake is ubiquitous in our community, it's in just about every project. But why is this so, it is awkward and inflexible (try passing some arguments to rake tasks), and the way we've come to use it almost encourages bad design. Interestingly we've had a better way, to handle the things that we use Rake for, since before Rake even existed - command-line apps. Apps that do one task and do it well, it's the unix philosophy.

The problem is that as far as most of us know, writing a good command-line app in Ruby is not easy. Fiddling with OptionParser to produce a hacky script is no better than Rake, if anything it is worse. But what if we had the technology to build excellent command-line apps simply and easily? Well, to some extent we already do, but most of the tools available don't go far enough and so never become a viable Rake alternative.

In this talk we'll try to figure out what features a command-line framework needs to become your go-to tool instead of Rake (and how close existing tools are to this ideal). We'll cover things like:

What exactly is so bad about Rake
What makes a good command-line interface
Configuring your command-line apps
What are your options for parsing options
Can a command-line framework encourage good code design?
Writing highly testable CLI apps
Etc.
And as an added bonus, while we talk about all this, we'll touch on good and bad code design as well as look at some of the unexpected corners of your app where 'bad' code is hiding.

hi everyone and everybody hear me well

00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:28,860
beautiful all right let's begin okay

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,920
well it's the first things first and

00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:34,440
let's go on a negatory will win tour of

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,379
some random stuff about me where I work

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,230
and where I'm from because you know that

00:00:37,379 --> 00:00:42,239
seems to be the thing to do my name is

00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:45,540
Alice squawking I've known as squawks

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:49,579
around the interwebs I usually look like

00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:52,350
that obviously also look like this I

00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:55,770
like most people if you google my name

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,960
I'll actually come up first but to make

00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,390
things easy I'm school just about

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,000
everywhere so twitter and github and my

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,489
blog is called scoffs com so feel free

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,660
go ahead neo whatever open some issues

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:12,270
on my projects that's fine so I come

00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,520
from Melbourne Australia which as it

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,600
turns out is really really far away from

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,900
here

00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:22,060
it's a pretty sad to say that many this

00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:25,270
conference of travel the longest and the

00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:26,500
bird is to be here which is pretty good

00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,840
because I was one of the conference

00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:32,860
where I traveled about 100 meters to be

00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:36,670
there so I've done both things now so

00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:38,380
with her company called in battle only

00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:42,850
being about three months but they were

00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:44,890
nice enough to send me here and lots of

00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:47,049
companies i think which are way less

00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:49,630
successful but I went way more famous

00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:52,390
than in bathroom so I thought I'd say

00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:56,470
few words since I'm obviously the only

00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:58,149
person here from the company so one of

00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,610
the things we do is marketplaces for

00:01:58,149 --> 00:02:02,020
digital goods so if you ever done any

00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,990
wordpress you would have heard of

00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:07,330
themeforest so that's a lot of things we

00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:10,630
do it's probably on the biggest rails

00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:12,880
signs in the world we get I guess we'll

00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:19,019
be somewhere around the hundred million

00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:22,630
pageviews month mark we also a blogger

00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:24,060
blog network which is where I get to

00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:26,010
play with rounds I'm gonna be stuff

00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:30,220
doesn't get quite as many pages

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:33,040
marketplaces but our traffic is still

00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:34,660
quite muscular we get tens of millions

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:40,480
of page views around which is pretty or

00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:43,900
anything yeah so I'm like I'm running a

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,880
blog and rails I never thought I'd be

00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,720
able to say that when people ask me what

00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:51,070
I was working one but here we are anyway

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,870
in fact when I tell people that their

00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:57,489
loss and going on and like what do you

00:02:52,870 --> 00:03:00,400
actually do seriously it's a complete

00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:02,500
one of the old company but oh and we've

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,380
never taken any outside investment how

00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,630
the companies in Melbourne in Australia

00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:10,090
works from all over the world so I'm

00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:11,650
software developers these days with

00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,290
pretty much infinite choices when it

00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:16,690
comes to work but it's always nice to

00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:20,200
know this another interesting place to

00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:24,030
consider if you are considering as I

00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:27,010
said I come from Australia and obviously

00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,990
since I'm in the US i can very well not

00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:31,090
say few words about Australia so the

00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:35,410
expectation with people from Australia

00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:37,450
is that they'll be too wild animals so

00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:39,430
try to honor the tradition and say

00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:42,520
couple of words about a cool Australian

00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:48,610
animal in this case it's a it's better

00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:50,860
idea so I'm going I'm gonna make a bold

00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:55,600
claim and say this is the best animal in

00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:58,240
Australia here's why so it's small

00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:04,210
impute but as we can be close and it

00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:07,780
really really fast it doesn't strike you

00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:10,780
as much of a sprinter in a look doesn't

00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,630
look like drying out or anything but it

00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:15,640
can actually run pretty pretty quick

00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:20,650
pass the most of us here but this most

00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:23,830
interesting thing I'm not blaming you it

00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:27,580
will literally try to sit on invaders

00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:31,210
and crushing so if you're a purist

00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:34,840
raelia and you see a small wild animal

00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:37,620
and it's moving you your family in big

00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:41,799
trouble and it should run for your wife

00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:45,739
which one do we do because the base

00:04:41,799 --> 00:04:48,199
but it's still a nice thing to know so

00:04:45,739 --> 00:04:53,809
anyway that Brendan stuff let's uh let's

00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:54,919
talk about in movies all right so rabies

00:04:53,809 --> 00:04:57,829
in piqua ters in the Ruby community

00:04:54,919 --> 00:05:00,379
every project beer & milani the compass

00:04:57,829 --> 00:05:04,009
the weber jam is going to have some

00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:06,319
writing in fact today become a project

00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:08,599
come across a project with a great while

00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:11,989
enroute it looks little weird just like

00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:14,749
a purchase without a readme a while ago

00:05:11,989 --> 00:05:16,369
I was writing something right and there

00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:18,889
are times in your life as a software

00:05:16,369 --> 00:05:22,569
developer when the tools just annoying

00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:25,069
you for me this was one of those times

00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:29,119
needless to say I was feeling a little

00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:30,919
bit like this we kept asking myself the

00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:34,489
question that we will ask ourselves

00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:37,489
about every tool we've ever used the

00:05:34,489 --> 00:05:39,499
question is why why did you do it that

00:05:37,489 --> 00:05:42,709
way I mean I would have done it that way

00:05:39,499 --> 00:05:45,679
I would have done them better way so I'm

00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:50,509
like it was when away right and I was me

00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:53,389
thinking why indeed why wait when wait

00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:56,089
isn't particularly nice how does become

00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:57,529
so pervasive in the Ruby community is it

00:05:56,089 --> 00:06:00,589
just a matter of being around long

00:05:57,529 --> 00:06:02,689
enough one hasn't anything clearly

00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:04,789
superior come to won't replace it and

00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:07,879
why it hasn't anyone switch to everyone

00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:12,709
switch to that so this was a start of a

00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:14,569
very long journey for me and I'll try to

00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:17,239
be good sense of the journey of the next

00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:21,319
cylinder itself and I'm sure it will be

00:06:17,239 --> 00:06:23,569
awesome so every good story begins are a

00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:26,749
long time ago in a galaxy far far away

00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:29,019
and as luck would have it this is where

00:06:26,749 --> 00:06:33,079
the ancestor of rake actually comes from

00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:35,360
and I will push for me about night as we

00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:40,280
all know awake is based on night and

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:42,200
make comes from the sea world and

00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:45,700
that's the roci well that wasn't in this

00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:49,250
one and Vegas literally would be make

00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:51,470
and make this extremely curious because

00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:55,700
there are some very many things wrong

00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:58,160
with it but despite this it's used so

00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:01,400
widely that as my admirers won't be

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:08,000
beyond the two of its kind in the sea

00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:09,860
world and once again it's this one so

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,720
we've ever done some see program you may

00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,370
know some of this already but here's

00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,520
just some of the highlights some of the

00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:19,160
shortcomings of Maine to make is a

00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:23,120
programming language but it is no lists

00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:25,040
or hashes just strings it has either

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,440
limited support for conditionals like if

00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,500
statements and in fact it is only very

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,479
limited support for things like loops

00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:37,970
which makes you really really hard to do

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:43,010
useful things with it all variables of

00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:45,110
mobile because I don't know why but as

00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:50,720
we all know global variables already

00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:54,020
awesome and this one is familiar to most

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,630
people so any line specifying Shelton

00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:59,770
will not give you the town and it can't

00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:01,910
be set of spaces it has to be a 10 and

00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:08,140
the only thing that can we say about

00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:10,520
that is this so here's some more

00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:12,590
sometimes might face a significant

00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,890
sometimes they're not colors are the

00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:17,990
same and of course we will be randomness

00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:19,970
in your programming language is really

00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:26,360
really good because it keeps us on our

00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:29,479
toes make is very slow performance and

00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:32,520
in fact it scales it's the pollen scales

00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:37,530
one anyway with the size of the

00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:40,130
user on so polite a project for what the

00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:45,090
projects make will be much much slower

00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:47,790
and then there's this the only real way

00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:50,760
to do it is to execute it over over

00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:53,880
manually until you are sure that more or

00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,830
less works but of course snake is very

00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,920
reliable so sometimes when executed

00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:00,570
don't pay off another reason so you have

00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,000
to do my clean and try again and hold

00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:04,860
the nose work this time so it's a bit of

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,360
a cycle and then of course doesn't do

00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:11,010
anything for spoke first performance

00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:12,740
either ladies on the voice looking

00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:17,820
programming language in the world

00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:19,470
because the West one is this one and

00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,870
then this language here it was

00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:24,570
specifically designed to make riding

00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:27,000
here some provision really read hard I'm

00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:29,940
not sure why but that's that was the

00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,470
idea Nathan your head wasn't designed to

00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,870
make reading mission provision is really

00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:37,440
really hard but sometimes it feels like

00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:41,040
that anyway another clue that is you're

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:47,010
on here for host of other issues but I

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:49,740
will say one movie maker so bad the new

00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:53,610
creative automate help us generate

00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:55,200
Magpies so what we have is make which is

00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,470
the thing that we need to keep together

00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,300
see projects in the next photo make

00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:02,100
which is the theme that we need to put

00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,740
together the thing then we use the crew

00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:07,520
together see project but of course the

00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:10,230
use of the name if the use of the comp

00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:13,260
so we are going to calm which is the

00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:15,030
thing that helps us use the thing that

00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:18,030
you use the two together the thing that

00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:21,960
needs to do the sea produce the together

00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:24,960
has cars and yet somehow we're still

00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:27,570
able to write significant software using

00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,820
these tools they are by proving once and

00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:30,499
for all that software developers

00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:34,819
secretly

00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:38,439
enjoy first I'm exaggerating a little

00:10:34,819 --> 00:10:40,849
bit see developers secretly enjoy pay

00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:46,669
the rest composites have a really high

00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:49,879
pain threshold but that's make sure it

00:10:46,669 --> 00:10:54,319
will learn their lessons surely awake is

00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:56,419
much much nicer well in some ways it is

00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:59,719
but we didn't learn nearly as many

00:10:56,419 --> 00:11:01,729
lessons as I think we did rate is the

00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:03,709
stone of it is our role so it's the move

00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:09,169
into the hood but let's take a closer

00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:12,889
look so officially say what you will

00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:15,199
about make but seeing it something with

00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:17,179
the compile give building the respects

00:11:15,199 --> 00:11:20,799
will be taken before we get the usable

00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:24,169
program in C movie has no such trouble

00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:26,659
we don't need to build believe in e so

00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:29,649
n'rae we have a bill to program which

00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:32,659
that needs no real tool if we summarize

00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:36,169
what we know the break so far we get

00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:40,569
this space in a very popular than ever

00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:43,989
before to the dissolution to trouble

00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:46,669
that's not a very auspicious beginning

00:11:43,989 --> 00:11:49,849
then it almost feels it almost feels

00:11:46,669 --> 00:11:52,729
like we have to find a use for a so we

00:11:49,849 --> 00:11:55,489
did now I thought long and hard about

00:11:52,729 --> 00:11:58,669
the best way to describe who will use

00:11:55,489 --> 00:12:01,209
rate for you know a movie it means my

00:11:58,669 --> 00:12:01,209
best asset

00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:12,870
so that's great so we're scrutinizing

00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:17,010
idea but let's look at the actual

00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:18,600
technology you're so bad about right so

00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:23,130
mine and everybody else is Pepe this

00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:25,200
canal I arguments defining a task to

00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:29,220
take on it to take a Guinness is

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:31,080
extremely forward it looks like this and

00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:35,280
of course passing arguments to records

00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:39,030
even was what these arguments even me in

00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:41,760
which one is which but at least it works

00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:47,640
right well let's screw using it in that

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:52,500
she'll that's not very nice I mean what

00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:55,230
have we done to deserve that and of

00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:59,640
course you have to quoted because the

00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:03,330
top is that's the arguments in the name

00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:06,330
of the task the real solution is most of

00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:09,300
us us is to avoid writing tasks that

00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:11,040
take arguments in the first place you

00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,780
better run planning a special case of

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,090
your task and make with the original

00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:17,850
task a new one and there separately in

00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:20,820
space to make music to understand it in

00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:22,830
your name spaces what's the good

00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,590
convention to name spacing rake tasks oh

00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:28,980
I'm not too sure it's going to do it

00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:31,170
makes sense kind of like a regular be

00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,770
big glasses really except we've been

00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:38,040
thinking and studying 00 design for ages

00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:40,950
there are many different principles with

00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:44,850
rain to good things right is the only

00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:48,780
principle that on where and how do you

00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:50,850
structure your great well anyway maybe

00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:52,890
we'll just name space so fast and put

00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:55,560
them all in one pile and networks but

00:13:52,890 --> 00:14:01,170
we're going to gets too big and you

00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:03,150
structure several files well maybe one

00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:05,250
day special file but what if the name

00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:08,400
space is too big well then how do you

00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:09,990
want to laura's it even more and anyway

00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,150
how they implement the functionality of

00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,720
a rare cars you just write the code

00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,910
inside

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:21,209
ask itself that doesn't seem very much

00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:23,639
well and have your eyes x 11 maybe we

00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:26,129
can push the functionality intro class

00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:29,220
and try to make each task implementation

00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:31,829
of online and that's the reason when I

00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:35,639
solution because it brings back to

00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:37,170
playing old movie o.o design and this is

00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:40,259
why having good design choppers

00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:46,050
fundamental skill but now ray isn't

00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:48,360
really giving us any help what about doc

00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:51,209
you making a rape asks well we would

00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,829
have one liner description so hopefully

00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:57,689
you will really really good at

00:14:52,829 --> 00:15:02,029
expressing yourself this is C and if you

00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:06,470
can get the one-liner illustrators

00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:09,149
because everybody likes surprises

00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:12,149
there's no way to even know that it does

00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:17,790
exist unless you read the code so fun

00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:19,290
times can be had by everyone I'm going

00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:21,240
to go out on a limb and say that ninety

00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:23,970
percent of raped us and they have no

00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,220
space but we love specs in Ruby

00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:27,629
community and cubes and anything helps

00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:33,059
us make sure that absolute actually

00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:35,970
works so what gets it's so cold we run

00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:41,100
some of these things of production make

00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:43,439
you feel a little bit like this but if

00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,980
you think about it for a while you

00:15:43,439 --> 00:15:48,720
realize that it's not that surprising

00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:53,250
it's an example of a typical rape task

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:55,709
which I pulled out of right now I don't

00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:57,540
know about you but I to agonize over

00:15:55,709 --> 00:16:00,959
methods that are longer than a couple of

00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:04,980
lines in my classes but a rape us that

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:09,059
looks like that this is fine in fact

00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:11,220
this one is prevent all right sadly you

00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:13,459
will see these kinds of records all the

00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,459
time

00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:20,550
the problem of ray especially

00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,730
considering how ubiquitous it is is it

00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:27,029
it has no idioms without the use of

00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:29,930
moving in some pretty awesome innovative

00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:32,999
home which are prepared really

00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:36,240
opinionated software has been our Metro

00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:38,579
PD years and see one thing you can get

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,339
significant work done with rails just

00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:43,980
following the conventions but ray is a

00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:47,040
loop in your name if anything in your

00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:51,470
microwave is a monolithic task and test

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,470
it and how to affect that so once again

00:16:52,249 --> 00:16:57,029
the question we asked we should ask

00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:59,939
yourself is as well encourage repair

00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:02,100
design and you know that's up a dozen

00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:05,189
what the way we've been using it is a

00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:07,529
problem new programs come to the Ruby

00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:10,079
this is a code that has been written

00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:12,809
before another welding badly written

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:16,709
great artists are everywhere so the

00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:20,339
cycle of happiness is perpetuated but of

00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:22,439
course rape is not all bad no matter the

00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:25,620
convenience name spacing is a good idea

00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:28,529
and chaining rate tasks is pretty

00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:35,330
awesome and of course rape is a great

00:17:28,529 --> 00:17:35,330
name that's what are like all again soon

00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:42,360
so anyway I think the world should be

00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:45,270
much nicer place with lots more good

00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,919
things and much less bad things and like

00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:48,630
politicians though as a software

00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:52,260
developer act natural with my sleeves

00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:54,000
and do something about my work so let's

00:17:52,260 --> 00:18:00,630
go back to a highly relevant description

00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:02,700
of what right does well it also kind of

00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:05,250
sounds like what we used to Madeline

00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:09,059
apps for random produces fruits and

00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:12,360
stuff so here's a thought what does in

00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:15,510
writing wait tasks we wrote command line

00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:20,960
instead this might make you feel like

00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:25,140
this because you might be thinking this

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:27,000
so crappy script using option pazza

00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,950
that's not even that's a no-go zone

00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,020
right those things have no structure

00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:34,200
whatsoever and once again I'm you're

00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:35,790
right specs for that well we don't want

00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,400
to be doing that what we want is a

00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:40,590
framework that will make riding command

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,840
line X easy and we'll make a command

00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:44,610
line apps awesome just like rails or

00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:48,000
Sinatra like when that's easy and

00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:50,490
awesome surprisingly under the first guy

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,520
who had that board we'll come back to

00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:56,669
that what do we mean when we talk about

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:59,760
command line apps oh come on line that's

00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:02,370
coming to basic flavors there's basic

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,870
command line acts like curl they've lost

00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:07,470
some commands and have options and

00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:10,140
arguments then this mln sweets like it

00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:12,900
which also motions an argument but can

00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:16,470
have some commands as well so what's up

00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:17,880
with the bathroom and apps well they

00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:20,460
work in your community we use the molar

00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:24,270
climber you smack you silly next music

00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:26,130
Amell and apps a lot and of course

00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:27,929
getting documentation about a mile and

00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:29,910
it was really easy we all know to do

00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:33,360
manage matters help and it will shoot it

00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:35,850
shoot it at something useful and of

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,100
course passing options and like rape is

00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:42,900
from the basic functionality so special

00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:45,179
cases are really really easy and it's

00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:47,370
the UNIX way a tool that does one thing

00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:50,460
it does a wireless you can explain and

00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:52,950
when it's this person because we're all

00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:55,100
about to have very short and just like

00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,100
this

00:19:55,380 --> 00:20:01,840
and those are conventional guys who

00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:04,870
invented facial hair but they also

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:12,430
invented units which makes up almost as

00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:14,110
also as this guy there's a bugger we'll

00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:17,410
build awesome commander delicious a

00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:19,090
movie and you recommend you read it if

00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:21,970
you want to crash course in what goes

00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:23,530
into command line at the general in the

00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:25,660
book you also describes a high-level

00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:29,080
what makes a good female in half that's

00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:30,610
a look at that so come online activity

00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,820
need to use that's you know that's

00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:36,190
that's good that's number one it should

00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:37,780
be hope so if we do manage manage how I

00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:41,530
should spit out something useful for us

00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:43,480
understand how it works it took one well

00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:46,000
with others so it's just part of the

00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,800
union's ecosystem should be able to read

00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,420
the records input and output and do all

00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:53,920
those kinds of things and as you just

00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:58,720
work should have sensible defaults both

00:20:53,920 --> 00:21:01,000
options and arguments you should be able

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,180
to configure you form an alliance and

00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,850
figuration should be same nonprofit

00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:09,940
should be easy to distribute easy to

00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:12,280
test and easy to maintain if you think

00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:15,670
about it rank doesn't measure up to well

00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:18,250
against these high-level ideas which is

00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:23,140
great for me because I get to come to

00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:24,790
austin and do this presentation here but

00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:29,590
in general is not so great to the

00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:31,450
commune in any way to create a command

00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:34,690
line framework that could tick all the

00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:38,670
boxes mentioned above we should have a

00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:41,170
perfect investment right right well

00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:42,820
there are already many different command

00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:45,460
line frameworks in the movie world to

00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:47,530
fix the tip most of the bar boxes like I

00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:51,400
said on the first guy who have had that

00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:53,200
idea you were just some of them and most

00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,670
of those framework provided and the sale

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,970
for building from online apps and

00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:58,990
possibly some support for configuration

00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:00,670
this makes em build with those

00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:02,240
frameworks pretty easy to use and right

00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:03,950
it also makes

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,320
general help Texan provide sensible

00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:08,540
defaults and you can distribute your app

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,300
such gems which also makes it pretty

00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:13,010
simple completely maintained so the

00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:18,500
question is why are those frameworks

00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:26,179
still relative Manish and why is written

00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:28,070
is well still Malcolm Allen energem is

00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:31,070
on the only context where we want to

00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:34,160
strip things up we want to be able to

00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:35,870
write apps and suites yes but we also

00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,720
want to be able to recognize scripts for

00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:40,160
evidence as a result we want to

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,230
scripting frameworks to put multiple

00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,000
environments this also means the

00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:45,830
configuration for our extra support

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,440
multiple environments and speaking it

00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:50,450
integration with sometimes on / machine

00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:52,550
configuration then use the configuration

00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:55,850
as well as the project configuration and

00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:57,530
often will be mix all those none of the

00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:00,320
frameworks I mentioned a path have

00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:02,890
support for any of that stuff let's look

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,880
more deeply at the beaches that a

00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:06,800
hypothetical awesome command-line

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,290
framework is to provide in order to make

00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:14,240
us want always use it as a default to

00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:16,420
place array so nice these sellers a good

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:20,090
start but one of the focus on yourself

00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:23,150
sure available syntax is not as we

00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:26,360
wanted to fit into a ruby design not

00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:29,000
subsuming so it would be nicer than a

00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:31,820
DSL then we just SWAT importing the

00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,770
classes we won't move it with a little

00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:36,080
bit extra not something that's written a

00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:39,860
movie but tries very hard to make

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:42,350
something else so here's an example it

00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:44,000
seems reasonable but if you want to

00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:47,360
write specs for the actual functionality

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,240
there's no nice way for me to who came

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:53,059
to reducing existing tools and if it

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:56,030
gets too big about to refactor what do I

00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:56,850
do what guidelines do I follow this is

00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,830
something the flink

00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:02,720
movie but was very hard to look like

00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:05,900
something else on the other hand is this

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:08,640
this looks just like a regular class

00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:10,020
very similar to the previous example but

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,820
if you want to write some specs and

00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:14,700
functionality and execute method you'll

00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:17,280
be very soon and I can easily imagine

00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:19,290
how I I would be able to write something

00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,300
that will meet liberal on it recently

00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:23,310
break apart these classes for a

00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:27,090
factoring purposes and also to compose

00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:29,730
them there's still elements with dsl

00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:35,910
here but is just moving a little bit

00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:39,390
extra unless documentation or all use

00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:41,190
the same something like this so an app

00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:44,070
built with a prima should be able to

00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:45,360
produce this automatically this is

00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:47,370
practically infinitely more

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:53,130
documentation then we would get from

00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:55,020
right then this environment whereas I

00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:57,450
mean why doesn't every framework and

00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:59,250
that's it for this ready you know we do

00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:02,940
it on web programming in this all the

00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:05,940
time so for example at my purse for moi

00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:07,650
I shape here just flick a switch you set

00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:11,460
a configuration option and have the

00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:13,260
ability to do things like this should

00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:18,570
have to do the boilerplate this over and

00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:20,430
over multiple symbols of configuration

00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:22,410
would be really great machine level user

00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:24,390
level project level but then at the

00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:26,820
figuration should also be environment to

00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:28,770
where for example if your configurations

00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:31,980
in JSON format you want something like

00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:33,600
this or alternatively to have break

00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:36,450
things up into separate files for

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,880
environment is like well does and the

00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:40,170
way they have no sleep later they talk

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,270
about the figuration files will be

00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:43,770
environment to where is another teacher

00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:45,930
and you should just be able to switch

00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:50,480
one without having to add a whole bunch

00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:50,480
of boilerplate code the supporter of

00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,460
course I want to be able to build simple

00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:56,340
command-line absent

00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:59,800
command-line apps that's a given but

00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:01,480
also on validation for days my options

00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,190
and for my arguments a lot of the

00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:05,890
frameworks out there provide option

00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:07,660
validation but argument validations it's

00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:12,010
still use a real quick which dylan

00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:14,770
tavella dated so why not sometimes

00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:18,700
things like auction conflicts required

00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:21,210
options a very useful unless this one

00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:25,060
option plaza is just not good enough

00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:26,860
it's too verbose you can test for the

00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:30,760
same of the same option multiple times

00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:32,380
like you wouldn't go for example and

00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,750
this is another problem with most of the

00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:38,020
existing command line frameworks they

00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:40,060
persist in wrapping and I sadly sell on

00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:41,800
top of motion passed but let's just stop

00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:44,340
the screaming the issue we need the

00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:46,630
nicer option pardon on getting around it

00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:50,250
then there are elements that will

00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:53,020
support us in creating good design so

00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:54,700
separation concerns we should be doing

00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:58,810
this instinctively so now why don't we

00:26:54,700 --> 00:27:00,970
doing it already sensible way to

00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:02,230
structure your you know a pyramid so

00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:04,720
first awesome like I mentioned before

00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:07,300
morels gives us a structure for our

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,400
application so a command-line primer to

00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:13,000
give us a similar or different structure

00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:19,120
for common applications but it should be

00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:20,710
that it should be pin it we want to

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,890
write we want to make writing specs

00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:26,050
rockin online extremely easy we don't

00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:32,230
want it to be hard because then we

00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:34,120
shouldn't do it writing on watching as

00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:38,020
part of a t-cell that's just not good

00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:40,660
nough should encourage module design

00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:42,160
rather than one with the design in fact

00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:46,570
you should want to encourage much of the

00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:49,560
design and it all this one or not you

00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:49,560
just wait with us know

00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:56,220
it should come events over the book

00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:58,740
different or at least with things in the

00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:02,070
paternity idioms overtime aspect is a

00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:04,530
really good example of this so this tech

00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:07,920
is full of stuff that has become if you

00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:09,570
make our step over time it smoothly the

00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:12,600
thing about what we're going through

00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:18,600
well design app built using up a plague

00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:20,970
of Raymond it's really nice you don't

00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:24,590
have to wait for you command line app to

00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:27,810
actually start up before we do stuff

00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:29,580
this is really hard because if you're

00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:31,080
writing a script for a rails app for

00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:33,990
example you might want to load the rails

00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:36,840
environment and we know will know how

00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:38,460
fast that is but this is something to

00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:42,780
strive towards we want to be as far as

00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:46,500
it possibly can be initialize the

00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:48,330
support right has it here build the

00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:52,890
significance of natural app you've

00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:54,900
probably built it it's in useful it's a

00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:56,820
useful thing because even if you run

00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:59,370
into my line that we must still musing

00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:01,320
other gems we might you know we might

00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:03,300
when you straight up any one 1 i'm going

00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:05,220
to pass an API key from the command line

00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,930
and then we're going to use it api key

00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:09,690
to configure our food again and

00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:16,110
initialize if a pub is a perfect concept

00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:18,210
doing that we want to be able to we want

00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:21,450
that rats will have more a book or less

00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:23,330
a food is needed and then of course the

00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:25,980
framework itself should we will design

00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:29,900
so people can come and read it and they

00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:32,970
can contribute we always fail with this

00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:35,940
with the temptation examples because

00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:38,520
it's really hard and then the last thing

00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:42,360
we want is awesome name that starts with

00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:44,510
AA because it's Ruby thing I vote for

00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,510
this

00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:50,740
because when a Korean isn't used by

00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:53,280
anything and that's pretty hard to find

00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:57,010
and if you say the full name out loud

00:29:53,280 --> 00:30:00,610
make you sound like this which is very

00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:03,550
fun for everybody else listen we're

00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:05,290
features but when it is familiar even

00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:07,780
bigger this and if a framework as it can

00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:10,540
be it means to a lot of stuff out of the

00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:13,000
box more important there shouldn't be

00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:14,290
too many situations where you just kind

00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,870
of do something using a framework

00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:19,560
because great is so unappealing ated you

00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:22,090
can always cook it in one way or another

00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:24,130
we want people the first thing is you

00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:26,260
kramer to go laughs just like the first

00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:27,790
time that this is a great blog

00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:29,380
presentation that may have changed it

00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:32,560
because that would that's what gives a

00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:34,330
project real next and then thick there's

00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:37,660
already confusion between where you can

00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:39,370
command line is where we are waiting to

00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:41,380
be my grave of everyone's generate

00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,580
migration what is rings direct

00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:44,680
aggression well adjust the command line

00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:49,390
it what percentage is a landline sweet

00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:52,390
so why not instead have this more than

00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:55,810
that if i have a rails app corfu i want

00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:57,880
to be able to do this so food generate

00:30:55,810 --> 00:31:00,070
regression going to do my break and put

00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:03,160
anything else i can take off and that

00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:05,920
will be very very nice so what kind of

00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:10,510
developer would I be if all it did was

00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:12,220
your eyes about this stuff some of the

00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:14,320
Muslims and I kind of plan some of my

00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:16,630
thoughts into reality of course at the

00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:20,380
time my thoughts requires work on the

00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:21,730
being a but we'll come back to that so

00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:25,270
I'm going to command line we are going

00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:33,550
to call the s4 which as it turns out is

00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:35,790
a really unfortunate name you can

00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:40,420
imagine hands up in the best bang a

00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:44,220
great way the only persons name in the

00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:44,220
world because they have gems like this

00:31:45,090 --> 00:32:04,230
book on where three is the rails three

00:31:48,940 --> 00:32:04,230
way so obviously be couple in a row

00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:14,779
makes me feel less depressed about my

00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:16,639
own human choices come ova 1 so as far

00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:19,099
as I mentioned my first one quite as

00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:21,229
advanced as they are now when I filled

00:32:19,099 --> 00:32:22,999
it so unfortunately escort ended up with

00:32:21,229 --> 00:32:24,950
most the same issues that we talked

00:32:22,999 --> 00:32:28,159
about about it hits some of the notes

00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:30,889
for computer uses others luckily it was

00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:34,009
just well now that I've been able to use

00:32:30,889 --> 00:32:36,979
it a lot remain different apps across

00:32:34,009 --> 00:32:38,419
two jobs now which is how rather than I

00:32:36,979 --> 00:32:42,079
wish list of what a great room and I

00:32:38,419 --> 00:32:43,879
premium should be may be making more

00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:47,419
vespa into something nice so one day but

00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:51,409
right now ray is to ace but he something

00:32:47,419 --> 00:32:53,719
it's firm using your own gems you get to

00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:55,820
see us how other people use it how the

00:32:53,719 --> 00:32:59,809
video documentation is and which

00:32:55,820 --> 00:33:03,159
features were less than awesome firstly

00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:03,159
its will be like this

00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:09,460
the whole boy and one of my friends said

00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:11,830
it would be great if escort had like a

00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:16,289
really simple example so people could

00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:16,289
get the gist of how it works at a glance

00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:26,350
and I was followed because right there

00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:27,760
is that ok another time that have some

00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:30,429
major confusion about how I store

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:35,279
configuration was and once again I was I

00:33:30,429 --> 00:33:35,279
was like look what you prefer me because

00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:42,789
the places I mean all your daughter's go

00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:47,130
down I spent hours reading the

00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:49,779
documentation why won't anybody read it

00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:54,789
what's the best eating right there you

00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:57,159
can just ask me the police doesn't

00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:59,500
matter what you think what matters is

00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:01,870
how other people use it even if you

00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:04,390
think the things are are obvious if

00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:06,700
people can't or won't find it that's

00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:08,919
really valuable feedback and each a

00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,839
feedback you get from having your users

00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:12,310
right there have to be amazing which is

00:34:10,839 --> 00:34:14,260
how is able to compile the list of

00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:16,089
features a command line frame of reading

00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:18,879
needs before it can be embraced by all

00:34:16,089 --> 00:34:20,409
and while I'm on the subject here a few

00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:23,409
thoughts about open source and the

00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:26,020
people would do it if you ever meet

00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:28,720
somebody with those open source even if

00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:31,599
you actually ate what they do shake

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:34,119
their hand and say thanks because open

00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:37,810
to such Brady wait Han that takes up a

00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:39,730
lot of time and they said that lots and

00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:43,810
lots of open source code is really

00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:47,139
really crap because of christmas is

00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:49,450
going on it takes a lot of time so you

00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:51,550
can choose between called the worlds and

00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:56,460
cool that's nice is it unhappy in you

00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:58,720
and also the pigmentation is very boring

00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:02,410
but it's a good anyway because otherwise

00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:04,320
no one will ever use approach so I guess

00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:06,849
not the turn of just am a lesson here

00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,770
obviously I don't expect anybody or

00:35:06,849 --> 00:35:10,180
everybody to stop using rage tomorrow

00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:12,400
but hopefully

00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:14,710
and we try to rape us now it will make

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,950
you think of it because Greg change

00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:20,980
begins with a single step recovery

00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:23,589
single participation in this case so

00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:27,130
consider consider writing something

00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:32,800
online apps they're easy and fun and

00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:37,869
very very mixi maybe try escort because

00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:40,780
I'm really really nice but if you don't

00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:45,069
try that and you really love right

00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:48,760
syntax maybe you can try for because I

00:35:45,069 --> 00:35:50,589
was living with this guy and of course

00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:54,030
this is the small cute animal and cut by

00:35:50,589 --> 00:35:58,140
a career oh there's no audible thumbs

00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:58,140
what I mean is already with this guy

00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:03,099
alternately be trusted when you lean

00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:06,099
because it was written by the guy who

00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:08,050
wrote this book so when people ask you

00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:10,540
where you can say i'm using the tool

00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:13,270
written by a guy who literally wrote the

00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:16,660
book on command line apps and that's

00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:18,400
kind of cool with it mainly I think it's

00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:20,380
one of ours question established way

00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,240
just like a language needs to keep

00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:24,430
evolving moving forward so does the

00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,920
community and the ecosystem we have

00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:28,690
surpassed rate and we need to take the

00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:31,930
next step because if you think about it

00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:34,540
at one point this line at four and he

00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:36,970
stood might be available to go over it

00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:38,500
quick or or it might have been what

00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:43,180
development should be much easier than

00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:44,829
it is I'll await we were great and we

00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:46,480
took a step forward as a community and

00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:48,970
that whole software world took a step

00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:51,700
forward and even before that this guy

00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:58,050
had a thought and he stole it might have

00:36:51,700 --> 00:37:01,200
been what a firm would be less crap

00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:03,540
under living which was involved awesome

00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:06,330
because those things had happened we

00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:11,810
wouldn't be here right now and that will

00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:11,810
make me feel like this that's why

00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,220
