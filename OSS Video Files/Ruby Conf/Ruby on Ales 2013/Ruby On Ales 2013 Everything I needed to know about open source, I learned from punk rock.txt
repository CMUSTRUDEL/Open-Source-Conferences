Description: 
	By Shane Becker

It was the summer of 1993. I skipped out on the second game in a baseball double header to go to Lollapalooza with my cool older cousin. It was the first concert of my choosing (previously Hall & Oates, then The Grateful Dead). That day changed the course of my life.

I saw Rage Against the Machine which led to Inside Out which led to Revelation Records which led to Youth of Today, Bold and Gorilla Biscuits. Through those bands I'd learn about straightedge and veganism. I would discover a whole world of diy subcultures.

We made our own zines before there were blogs as a way to communicate across great time and distance. We formed our own bands to perform the soundtrack to our lives and ideals. We organized venues for our bands and friends' bands to play. We booked tours across timezones and oceans to see the world and meet new people.

We built our own networks and economies, in both gifts and exchanges. We created an aesthetic that was ours, a tribal identity. We created systems to record our story. We defined our lives on our terms.

Demo tapes were our Minimum Viable Product. Shows and tours were our meetups. Protests and convergences were our conferences. Cover songs were our permissive licenses. DIY was our flat organization. We didn't ask permission or forgiveness. We built, scammed or stole everything we could.

Punk rock is made of people. Open source is people. That we make music or software is just an artifact of the ideals we hold dear. All of these things I did when I was a kid in basements and tour vans, I'm doing again now on the internet and in office buildings.

What I didn't realize then, was that all of that was perfect training for the world of open source software.

punk rocker open source sorry organizers

00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:44,190
namely that there's exactly two ways to

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,290

for a high level check boxes I can

00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:47,850
pigeonhole describe me and like an

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:50,940
overly reductive away so of course I'm

00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:53,850
vegan which means no animals I'm

00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,800
straight edge with no drugs I'm going to

00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:58,620
atheist which means though gods and I'm

00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,510
an anarchist which means oh there we go

00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:06,320
I'm an anarchist which means no

00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:10,380
bastard Sarah may be in the room so

00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:12,660
we'll talk about anarchism or later so

00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:15,090
this is this is the joke that Sarah

00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:19,440
should have made how many air kiss does

00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:21,600
it take to change a light bulb okay so

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:27,660
for those things you didn't see it none

00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:30,050
it can't be changed unless he smashed so

00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:33,180
i live at like oh he said at a farmhouse

00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:36,420
in the neighborhood called Hollywood in

00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:39,450
the city called Los Angeles which that's

00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:41,489
a long full property it has a big name

00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,989
to match the bigness of the city and all

00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:47,540
that white stuff falling from the sky

00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:49,920
outside is one of the top reasons why

00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:52,320
that's actually how big la is you could

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,690
fit eight other US cities inside of its

00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,570
surface area i live in the Minneapolis

00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:58,950
that way so keep that in mind he then my

00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,040
next time you ask me for an airport

00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,040
pickup

00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:07,629
you can find the farmhouse online at

00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:10,150
barn house li and on twitter i was for

00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:13,150
mouse like Kobe said I put on the

00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:15,879
world's best backyard storytelling

00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:19,780
conference I was probably what every

00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:21,430
twice a year the next one is our

00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:23,520
non-stop for like you said we have a

00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:27,040
thing for each one the next one is

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,860
future it's on a fourth you should come

to it the last one the final show your

00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,870
last chance to come to it is our most

00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:37,270
common 5 with the theme collapse

00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:39,760
November cited and my work for a company

00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:43,389

00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:47,710
Oregon og-pog way I am a mr. manager of

00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:49,720
a small software TV and some of which

00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:54,760
are here today where are my speakers

00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:57,400
over here okay so look here's some of my

00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,380
team is here today all of which are

00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:03,460
awesome there's an empty square right

00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:06,070
here week and we're working on new

00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:09,190

me by their next time who here is not

working my way anyone employed on

00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:25,570
purpose so that that's the recurrent

00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:28,000
trend I see Ruby lenders were the bubble

00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:30,490
inside this bubble I haven't met any

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,450
unemployed rubios I don't want the

00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:37,030
unemployed fully ready I'm just not a

00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:40,030
tech talk it's more like my quit your

00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:41,860
job seriously talking less like my your

00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:44,830
slide sub both of those are my

00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:47,590
conference and more than anything it's

00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:49,630
it's my personal narrative there's not a

00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:52,210
lot of like you shoulds in here or like

00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:55,000
lessons to take away from you probably

00:05:52,210 --> 00:06:02,169
have a similar story or sort of an alias

00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:05,000
story I mean the TLDR is that I grew up

00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:08,660
through us or DIY punk rock

00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,850
and through that experience I've been

00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:13,250
able to observe these life lessons that

00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,810
I've learned in and I'm now applying to

00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:18,110
my life and my involvement in

00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:19,850
open-source culture okay that's right

00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:23,120
like you did it grow up the same with me

00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:24,860
and probably too late to go be a 15 year

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,900
old punk rocker in the Midwest and the

00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:31,370
90s but if you're you use open source if

00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:34,160
you participate in arc open source

00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:37,370
culture there's probably something in

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:42,020
your past that is the same as growing up

00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:45,050
hunk was for me maybe you were just a

00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:47,150
dumb jock with not a care in the world

00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,280
until Coach Taylor taught you that was

00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:53,120
clear eyes and a full heart you can't

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:55,730
lose right maybe your aunt Joyce would

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,340
read Emma Goldman guy debord to you and

00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:02,060
your visit certain summer holidays and

00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:03,860
tell you that you should fight foul and

00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:07,370
faster my friend the old world is behind

00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:09,710
you maybe the old man Thomas down the

00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,970
block from you growing up as a kid tell

00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,919
you how to build stuff in his garage

00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:15,950
workshop and have six names instead of

00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:19,910
throwing whatever it was for you that's

00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:22,220
awesome got here and this is my story

00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:25,640
right this is not your site your story

00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:31,340
is surely different which is different

00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:33,530
from his story and her sorry how we got

00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:37,040
here is not the important event you know

00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:39,320
that we got here is thing that not

00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:44,330
everything so congratulations ops we all

00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:48,140
got some awesome place great then we're

00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:50,979
going to drink beer number one from each

00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,979
day is coconut water

00:07:53,500 --> 00:08:00,520
which of course I don't drink but I hear

00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:03,550
this is great hang over here they're not

00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,430
certain that here though so the whole

00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:07,690
premise of this talk for me was about

00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:11,410
they're looking for patterns in my life

00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:13,920
and Lena marks that influenced who i am

00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:19,350
now or set me on this path where I know

00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:22,150
and you know of course there's you know

00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:23,740
we are who we are because the entirety

00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:25,570
of our lives it's not just this one

00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:35,460
thing it's all of the good and all the

00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:38,020
bad and so I've compiled a list of

00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:40,090
examples are like you know things that

00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,130
were important in my life that taught me

00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:44,320
life lessons that I think are important

00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:48,370
and true that also taught me like

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:52,450
terrible atrocity and hatred things that

00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:55,360
I'll have to unlearn and resist later so

00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:57,340
for example my dad talking about science

00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,850
fiction just totally awesome comic books

00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:03,310
baseball and I got my first computer

00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:07,060
Commodore 64 see but he also taught me

00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:11,920
about optimism alcoholism and you know

00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:15,400
anger and abuse versus and he taught me

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,720
how to be a terrible parent and he

00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,310
taught me about baseball and of course

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,130
baseball itself talking about teamwork

00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:23,620
and the importance of the blank physical

00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:25,690
exercise mental hustle taught me about

00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:29,920
statistics long before a math class

00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:31,390
everybody and Tommy like I had the crack

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,339
of the bat there's so many calculations

00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:36,280
to me I'm talking about quick thinking

00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:37,960
and I learned more from baseball about

00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,930
American culture and history that I did

00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,130
you know any history textbook it go

00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:46,390
watch Ken Burns it's baseball

00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:49,570
documentary on PBS is amazing but like

00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:51,520
all you know sort of like organized

00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:53,650
youth sports that have the potential to

00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,740
teaching this like unreasonable amount

00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:58,300
of competition and I have this short

00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:01,120
temper I would go from zero it's like

00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,400
Hulk smash in no time flat like a bad

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:07,200
call or just like sent me

00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:10,080
and so Tommy aggression Tommy temper

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,280
humming this competition where the kids

00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,110
on the other team we're just kids I was

00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:16,470
playing a game they're the enemy I have

00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:18,240
tops like heat and and when he was

00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:21,570
everything losing it was the end of the

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,180
world so those aren't great life lessons

00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:26,370
I read a lot of accident I read a lot of

00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:30,000
an accident inspiron way more than any

00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:32,880
is like quote unquote books when I was a

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,100
kid and these comics taught me about

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,740
like an ethical framework about you know

00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:42,060
having it like a code you live your life

00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:44,430
by talking about honor and loyalty and a

00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,660
spider-man never gives up even against

00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:49,070
all odds though and he always has

00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:51,600
terrible odds just never gives up and

00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:53,220
the excellent especially the 70s or

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,980
reboot of it was the most multicultural

00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:58,530
book but the most multicultural thing in

00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,600
my life I lived in a pretty look like

00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:05,490
this room like a pretty like white bread

00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:07,590
world re i lived in the midwest like

00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,330
there were some few black kids on

00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:12,150
baseball team but i've never seen anyone

00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:15,540
different so the excellent showing you

00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:17,160
different humans and communities but of

00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,780
course like Peter Parker has its

00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,060
horrible guilt complex because he let

00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:24,780
the crook that killed Uncle Ben go and

00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:28,440
I've sort of absorbed a fair bit of that

00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:31,560
guilt complex and you know no one really

00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,360
dies in health books and I think growing

00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,600
up with that has skewed my relationship

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,360
to death real life and you know just

00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:42,720
this sort of like I fetishization of

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,550
things collecting comic books and I

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,800
became this hyper consumer I had to have

00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,180
every issue of every title i read I

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,540
don't like you to read because I'd

00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:53,070
speculated that they can be valuable I

00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,420
went to Catholic school and you can

00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,890
imagine the baggage from that but I also

00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:58,440
taught me surprising like really good

00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:00,390
map I love Catholic school with public

00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,700
school and jeer hi and I was like come

00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:04,830
here to Heather what I never knew that

00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,720
we were sort of accelerated really good

00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:09,300
politics I care about the difference

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,250
between further and farther viewer less

00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:14,310
because I'm

00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:16,680
school violence classes and taught me

00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:18,930
the ease and efficiency of having a

00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:22,410
uniform you wear the same thing every

00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:25,370
day now you can imagine how becoming a

00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:28,710
lot more guilt and sexual repression and

00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:31,280
homophobia and sort of further

00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:34,620
acculturated expected gender roles eight

00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:36,120
and then we move to the suburbs and the

00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,160
suburbs actually showed me real safety

00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:42,090
with that safety I feel like to explore

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,380
my little sliver of the world and with

00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:46,140
that exploration we started playing

00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:51,060
night games nothing is more funner

00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:53,700
funner oh then like flashlights time or

00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:55,170
like capture the flag at night we're

00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,960
just running my neighborhood people's

00:12:55,170 --> 00:13:00,380
backyards general offensive glass look I

00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,820
think that was really formative for me

00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,980
of course the suburbs like I knew where

00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,270
everyone's bathroom was in the six block

00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,130
radius because we all have the same

00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:09,420
floor plan and I was a paper boy it was

00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:11,550
holding people inviting me into like

00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:13,380
regular check a new world is was

00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:15,450
because it was the same house at 12

00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,220
doing and I saw for the first time this

00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:19,440
significantly you know I grew up in

00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:22,380
Indianapolis or working poor working

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,000
class and everyone around me was too and

00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,470
I moved to the suburbs and people

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,080
suddenly a million-dollar homes and

00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:29,790
they're also like we were at UH me like

00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,620
so at first saw this huge closet

00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:36,510
classified between the really rich the

00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:38,700
really bored and with that lodging

00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:41,040
united's Terry it's all my peers like

00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:43,740
turn to the drugs in danger just

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,860
yearning to get how this place and that

00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:49,470
board over that yearning and depression

00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:54,330
led me to experience for the first time

00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:57,890
like suicide well mine but I knew there

00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:57,890
were two in one week nice

00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:02,630
later in high school I met this man

00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:07,459
David Crocker he worked at eli lilly

00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:09,889
it's huge pharmaceutical corporation and

00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:12,560
he showed me for the first time who

00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:14,360
knows nobody knows SGI so he showed me

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,060
it was Silicon Graphics they were a

00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,740
high-end units workstations that cost

00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:20,329
twenty thousand dollars on your desk you

00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,760
can do things that we can now be our

00:14:20,329 --> 00:14:26,240
focus course but I saw like a real

00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:29,060
computer workhorse and technically it

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,680
was Eric's son's flavor of human so I

00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:35,300
saw the command line sound like cels and

00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:38,720
he showed me 3d modeling his job was

00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:40,790
like model molecules for drugs using

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,060
areas away from and in that moment I

00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:46,459
decided I wanted to go work for Pixar I

00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:49,459
did before summer it was a significant

00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:50,870
moment and more more important than than

00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:54,320
anything else he did he showed me the

00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:58,570
web it was mosaic one or two there were

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,570
hundreds of websites tons of servers

00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:02,779
most of them were like text documents

00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:04,750
not terribly interesting but I did seem

00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:11,120
to NASA side the before and after the

00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:13,070
Hubble Space Telescope update looking at

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,769
those kind of like that that jobs demo

00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:17,540
that he saw your heart I saw a bunch of

00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:20,329
things and whether it's a later that I

00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:22,370
realized the significance of Muslim that

00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:27,320
night I walked away oh my god 3d model

00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:29,029
of course I would of course I only saw

00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,510
those things in the context of this

00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:35,149
multinational corporation and I was in

00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:37,459
the business of big pharmaceutical

00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:39,920
 and he worked in this massive

00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:43,190
sea of pupils and I knew even then I

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,019
knew that was it for me the notes like I

00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:46,850
ever at all these these things that I

00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:50,050
think are good and portent I also

00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:50,050
learned the health of

00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:04,810
okay when I was really digging into this

00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:06,610
Hawk I sifted through like decades of

00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:09,490
the emotional baggage like failures and

00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:11,290
fuck-ups and the lesson for me was

00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:14,260
basically I learned a lot of things from

00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:16,960
a lot of things but nothing taught me

00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:24,310
more about me in the world around me my

00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:34,810
role in it then when i discovered the

00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:37,030
otherwise secret cineworld punk rock so

00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:38,560
just once like you've got some image in

00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:40,990
your brain with a say punk rock and I

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,600
don't want to focus on like particulars

00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:46,270
rights but like a quick crash course on

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,220
it like any sub cultural identity we

00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:50,170
have a kind of aesthetic so it's going

00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:52,810
to come uniform kind of it sound or

00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:54,190
whatever it wasn't about that so

00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:56,320
whatever you're thinking about how is

00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:58,390
look for those 15 doesn't matter that's

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,750
not the point and of course there were

00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:04,090
music's right I think a lot of music

00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:08,860
could be an is no prob I someone has the

00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:13,810
sort of expected aesthetics if you're at

00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:16,000
all like the soundtrack to punk rock or

00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:18,490
something some bands some music just

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,230
sort of it's more like the ethos and to

00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:25,179
me that's still punk yeah I remember

00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:28,120
sophomore year of high school we got

00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:31,030
that first mixtape actually okay liver

00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:32,770
sound reason I got it from a dude who

00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:34,450
got a copy of it from David borders who

00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:37,270
got copy of it from shopping Henson and

00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:39,790
animals and after like generations are

00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:41,710
like magnetic analog degradation but the

00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:44,799
patron I heard famous for the first time

00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:48,130
like Green Day and the offspring and

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:54,760
rancid and operation ivy and inside out

00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:57,100
in vanilla visits anyway the things that

00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:59,740
made that music sort of like terrible

00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:02,169
two levels made it amazing to us I like

00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:04,570
this was something the case I didn't did

00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:06,010
we we had something else at work you

00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:07,960
know there was a gruff vocals and was

00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:10,059
loud and there was like simple song

00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,160
structures I didn't appeal to like the

00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:14,620
rest of the world but had killed us the

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,780
message was clear I was loud and clear

00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:19,450
that you can make this kind of music I

00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:22,000
you can do this my friend is an identity

00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:24,610
and we formed Biggins and your own

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,320
sunshine I would experience that field

00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:29,049
again the person her got lives I

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,630
wouldn't ever actually really like a for

00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:33,130
a hardcore like Linux desktop user but

00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:36,309
when I learned about like this idea of

00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:37,660
different source and that you can change

00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:38,950
your operating system that you do

00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:41,799
whatever you want your computer i was

00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:44,919
like oh my god I could do this I'm

00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:46,900
allowed to do this I freely the same way

00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:49,480
that person makes a bit like you can

00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:51,370
make this music those last two minutes

00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,720
inside on the gorilla biscuits they're

00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:55,480
significant because they expose me to

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,100
this world particle so hardcore punk

00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:01,600
rock which it sort of louder and faster

00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:03,100
shorter and what what punk rock did to

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,440
heavy metal just sort of stripping it

00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:08,620
down of all the so hardcore get

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,860
again punk rock choking it down to just

00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:13,570
like that minimal set it sort of like a

00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:18,010
program that does one thing it does it

00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:20,809
really well and in a sort of framework

00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:22,940
of hardcore at items explode

00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:24,080
sort of radical politics right I learned

00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,759
that there are other people like me that

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,309
are straight edge and they learn about

00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:32,960
veganism cumbia and I look back now I

00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:35,929
see that in that moment I I got it I

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,429
didn't like I found like a try but a

00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:42,710
place to belong and of course usually

00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:46,340
and so fast work of leaders and I'm

00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:48,590
standing here on stage talking to you

00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:50,269
all too much fried different tribe but

00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:52,509
you know still they trotted in a place

00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:52,509
where

00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:08,550
so it's like peak oil and the collapse

00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:10,560
of every Empire has ever existed you

00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:13,380
can't really know that moment that

00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:15,840
history is happening until it's in the

00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,310
rear of year when you're in the poppy

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,280
field you can't tell that you're hired

00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:23,010
move you and the stuff that was

00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:24,390
happening to me then I could notice that

00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,860
was happy but I didn't know the

00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,870
significant moments like I see them now

00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,700
I've always been a bit of a black sheet

00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:32,790
so i used to be the sort of token bird

00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:35,190
just like a sea of the punks and i'm

00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:38,130
sure like the token pumpkin and a gaggle

00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:41,010
of nerves when i moved up to Seattle and

00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:44,870
fell no see how are being through how

00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:44,870
the new tried with my roles are reversed

00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:57,929
so and everything i do now i see sort of

00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:59,850
vestiges of what we did then and that is

00:20:57,929 --> 00:21:02,610
not this isn't to say like a weird

00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:05,370
there's a twitter before twitter just I

00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:07,110
learned something and I would now that I

00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:09,360
decided oh I should apply punk rock

00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:12,980
ethics it is I it's observed that my

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:16,799
life is removing enacting these things

00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:18,630
like we before there are blogs even sort

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,670
of before the web but definitely before

00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:23,970
their vlogs we made zine we photocopied

00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:27,000
easily publications our own to cook to

00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:29,940
communicate across great time and

00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:35,820
distance there are sort of like carrier

00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:38,040
pigeons two other kids like we form

00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:45,450
bands to write the soundtrack to our

00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:47,040
lives and you know we make venues so we

00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:49,860
had these bands we wanted to play shows

00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,900
and the first off there wasn't CBGB's

00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:53,910
everywhere at CBGB's not everyone can

00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:56,910
play huh there's not a tiny problem and

00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:58,710
so we made things around you know punk

00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:01,590
rock taught us the importance of having

00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:03,720
a place that was ours and punk rock

00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:05,250
taught us that we defined that states

00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,690
that experience at least in the time

00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:10,140
that we were there like like this right

00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:12,750
here this weekend this place is really

00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:16,200
uh nails next weekend won't be we need

00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:18,720
to find that together you know we book

00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,580
tours and we had these bands we played

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,860
in our towns and then our sort of

00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:25,200
regions and the country new book tours

00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:27,990
across oceans and time zone to meet new

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:32,760
people travel the world but who here is

00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:34,410
travel out of town for this thing like

00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:37,490
who here has traveled to a conference

00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:37,490
just for the people

00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:46,970
we're doing the same thing just software

00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:50,030
is a music we built our networks of you

00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:52,760
know economies of gifts and changes I

00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:55,450
learn more about economics from punk

00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:57,590
rock that are ever dated in high school

00:22:55,450 --> 00:23:01,940
punk rock also taught me the value of

00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:12,460
three value of giving things away we

00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:12,460
defined our own cheapest totally busted

00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:23,120
looks like a new professors so we need

00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:25,130
to find our own aesthetic like we have a

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:28,370
sort of tribal identity when we were

00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:30,590
like patches on a backpack or

00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:33,350
instructions on our t-shirts and beta

00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:35,120
hoodies it was a sort of flag we flew at

00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:37,850
each other you know so in coffee shops

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:40,430
and bus stations we knew we weren't like

00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:42,740
the way to meet you know friends and

00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:49,610
lovers and future co-conspirators and

00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:52,340
co-defendants we made no we pour a band

00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:53,960
and we are off someone's sport rack or

00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:56,180
just a boom box with the record button

00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:58,850
and a hole Mike and we recorded our

00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:00,830
demo tapes and like bedrooms and attics

00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:03,380
and basements that's sort of the like

00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:06,320
ultimate MVP ultimate Minimum Viable

00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:07,580
Product right you do practice for a week

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,440
you think you could press the record

00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:13,220
button and share with friends to get

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:16,400
shows and getting those shows two weeks

00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:17,870
after you learned three of your own

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,760
songs and would cover something to go

00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:21,710
play a show in someone's basement that's

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:26,750
iterating good while getting real

00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:28,640
feedback like we created systems to

00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:32,450
record our story all right so we made

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:34,550
record labels and book publishers have

00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:36,560
two shops and vegan bakery because this

00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:39,170
was our culture our story we had we had

00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,670
to capture punk rock taught us that no

00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:41,680
one else is going to do this for us we

00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:45,070
have to define

00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:47,410
we could the punk rock gave me the

00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:49,420
confidence to stand up here today gave

00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:51,280
me the confidence to not be afraid of

00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:55,330
confrontation or authority or

00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:58,840
embarrassment about not me to pray like

00:24:55,330 --> 00:25:00,580
heartbreak headache punk rock gave me

00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,830
the confidence to say up here stand up

00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:06,540
here and say that capitalism is indeed

00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:06,540
organized crime world victims

00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,290
unfortunately punk rock tell me some

00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:14,260
lessons that I wish I didn't have to

00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:17,950
know anymore but sadly I do Pell Grant

00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:19,840
taught me that five out of 18 female

00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:23,460
speakers is not good enough that we can

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:27,070
do better I know we have to be better

00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:29,500
and so you know I found myself and sort

00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:32,950
of different culture different community

00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:35,530
replaying same things I said like you

00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:37,840
know I was sort of ultimate immersion in

00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:45,370
flat organization why organizations all

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:46,960
the rage right now army but you know we

00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:50,530
didn't have bosses and we did Boston

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:53,020
even ourselves we did things are you

00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:55,810
know we did it yourself you say that in

00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:59,290
first person we subscribes to the

00:25:55,810 --> 00:26:00,820
do-it-yourself ethics because that's all

00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:03,160
we could you there was no other way and

00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:08,860
we had no bosses we had no employees we

00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:11,490
were we were flat and by the way um

00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:13,960
Steve Clapton or even the steep climbing

00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:15,940
he and I have flirted with the idea of

00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,440
doing a sort of like anarchists training

00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,450
for organizations that won't be

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,780
flattered if you're interested in that

00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:24,280
idea with hi Russ get at me or him you

00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:28,600
Steve cloud Nick on Twitter and future I

00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:32,760
didn't need the clicker I started a

00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:34,860
t-shirt company with focus nuin okay see

00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:37,230
all right

00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:40,160
and this was just a few years ago when i

00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:44,640
was in scale and because of our ceramic

00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:46,860
upbringing through this DIY ethics that

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,900
we design the shirts we printed them in

00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:51,120
my living room we made the website we

00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:54,630
sold them ship them it was truly do it

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,799
yourself you did all when i worked at

00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:58,830
Engine Yard is there open source

00:26:55,799 --> 00:27:00,410
cheerleader I made someone order robinia

00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:02,640
shirt today it's all couple you fit

00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:05,100
those romania shirts you know i designed

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,370
those and have effective I probably ship

00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:10,559
them to you I'm not written you a hand

00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:13,710
and written like personal note or a love

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,900
letter it's just like all the scenes and

00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:18,299
records that we should love sort of

00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:20,730
doing the same things of course you know

00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:23,280
twice er I'd by 150 people in my

00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:25,559
backyard to tell stories together and

00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:27,360
eat being a food & party together and a

00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:29,669
farmhouse come to the cops showed up

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,040
three times because of the practice I

00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:33,570
had you know fighting the cops and

00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,880
standing her ground like I had the

00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:37,740
wherewithal the know you can shout out

00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,870
are hard you can go directly

00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:43,830
yourself we sent them packing three

00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:45,540
times and what all of the open source

00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:47,970
software that i write you not a part of

00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:50,220
jeep i are not a part of like some

00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:52,260
bigger group you know when I have total

00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,540
agency over the license I always use

00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:56,280
public to me I think the public domain

00:27:54,540 --> 00:28:00,660
is wildly important i think it's been

00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:03,120
eroded over the past couple decades and

00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:06,630
my license is short enough that it fits

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:10,470
on slide for the sake of posterity i'll

00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:12,179
read it public domain your heart is as

00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:13,950
free as the air you breathe the ground

00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:20,130
you stand on is liberated territory i

00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:22,230
believe that but more than anything i'll

00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:24,960
try talking about hampton inn or the

00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:29,750
beginning when I said Amy change smash

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,750
one back to that later so now this later

00:28:33,009 --> 00:28:40,249
so you know punk rock taught us that

00:28:37,809 --> 00:28:43,940
there were two boxes there were no gods

00:28:40,249 --> 00:28:45,489
there were no massive that authority

00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:48,169
only less power when you give it to them

00:28:45,489 --> 00:28:50,779
we didn't ask for forgiveness or

00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:52,369
permission we built everything ourselves

00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:56,869
and what we couldn't build ourselves we

00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:59,239
stolen stand and of course there's lots

00:28:56,869 --> 00:29:02,419
of flavors of anarchists or anarchism

00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:04,479
there's rhetoric as green anarchists and

00:29:02,419 --> 00:29:06,979
pink Gannicus and there's

00:29:04,479 --> 00:29:09,799
anarcho-syndicalist with an aerco cynic

00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:12,909
listener some days I'm a good bit of a

00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:17,599
bit classic he also liked this communist

00:29:12,909 --> 00:29:19,789
hate but not for the reason that

00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:21,289
America hates hummus then we stopped

00:29:19,789 --> 00:29:24,649
they always have us anarchists in the

00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:28,269
 back and you know there's

00:29:24,649 --> 00:29:31,549
insurrectionists anarchist whose whole

00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:36,679
further analysis of the world is attack

00:29:31,549 --> 00:29:40,579
exclamation but I would say that I am an

00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:44,419
anarchist about negative when we're

00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:45,950
organizing and factories in place when

00:29:44,419 --> 00:29:48,409
we're defending forest on the green air

00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:51,979
kiss when we're fighting for gender

00:29:48,409 --> 00:29:54,320
equality looking Cantor's I simply

00:29:51,979 --> 00:29:57,200
believe that no one knows how to live

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:59,869
your life better than you and that's

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,690
what a bumper sticker but that's the

00:29:59,869 --> 00:30:04,909
sort of cord we we've all broken long

00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:07,249
knowingly consciously I mean like oops I

00:30:04,909 --> 00:30:10,309
didn't know they couldn't whatever in

00:30:07,249 --> 00:30:12,039
this state we've all who's there the

00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:14,599
faster than speed limit on purpose right

00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:16,940
so you've chosen to break the law you

00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:19,579
you've admitted yourself that I know

00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:23,029
better than the manor on how fast I can

00:30:19,579 --> 00:30:25,909
drive so if one law is questionable what

00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:28,669
about is the whole idea of all like

00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:31,719
we've all use our cell phones in movie

00:30:28,669 --> 00:30:31,719
theaters and airplanes

00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:45,910
my favorite rule that we all break

00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:48,070
losing a great procession losing like a

00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:50,860
chocolate-covered pretzels I didn't know

00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:53,080
the Balkans I'm an awesome chocolate

00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:54,760
covered pretzels right but that that is

00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:57,460
breaking the rules right that's you

00:30:54,760 --> 00:31:00,820
deciding that you know better that is

00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:04,060
anarchy but in turkey isn't just

00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:06,250
smashing the windows on multi national

00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:08,620
banks and fighting tops in the streets

00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:13,030
of cobblestone I mean it's that too it's

00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:14,430
not just that everyone always says I'm

00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:17,740
all your neighbor because you like

00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:22,360
setting things on fire bojana some

00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:24,640
things need to be set on fire not for

00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:26,400
the record I'm not an arsonist ever said

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:30,870
anything of the buyer outside like

00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:33,400
teenage sort of pyromania looks like a

00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:35,170
landmine factory there's no sustainable

00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:38,110
way to make way of life that into

00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:40,330
virtual ground but anarchy is

00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:43,450
three Association having the freedom to

00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:47,230
you know meet with the people that you

00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:53,050
want without persecution anarchy is non

00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:54,940
hierarchical structures in Turkey of

00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:58,840
self-organization some of these a

00:31:54,940 --> 00:32:01,150
proverb resonating in Turkey is mutual

00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:04,960
aid and anarchy as a gift economy as

00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:06,670
they well done to burning man so the

00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:11,110
gift economy not burning here that isn't

00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:14,580
this a court in a family of course in

00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:17,110
Turkey is a world without borders the

00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:20,440
government's our failures nation states

00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:24,070
are certainly a border between I am in

00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:25,780
Indiana and Ohio it's totally untrue

00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:29,620
sometimes there is a river even though

00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:31,390
it's not mature so for example flat

00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:33,220
organization talk about this a little

00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:37,000
bit that's all the way to look at it

00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:39,130
it's an Turkish there are no bosses and

00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,630
no gods no masters and there's no

00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:42,630
hierarchy in our organizations

00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:52,920
talking's hard the weld the web it's out

00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:55,680
there there's the web routes around

00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:59,250
censorship the web dissolves every

00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:01,380
clothes Empire there's no one on the web

00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:05,520
telling you that you can't do whatever

00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:07,350
the you want from the way and you

00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,930
know networks networks themselves are

00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:12,690
non hierarchical there's no top there's

00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:17,340
no center networks are sort of intrinsic

00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:20,580
to everything we do a free association I

00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:23,250
think we embody that action or that idea

00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:28,290
in a particular action almost every day

00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:29,490
in our lives when we for Kirko bit if

00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:33,450
you decide you don't like the direction

00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:36,000
of a code basic God people you can The

00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:38,360
Doors right there but the fork enables

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:44,370
you to do that without the sort of

00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:46,320
social lock in the fork is not a

00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:49,700
four-letter word anymore but fork is

00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:53,070
also this for enabler free association I

00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:56,580
mean open source itself is Erica right

00:33:53,070 --> 00:34:00,120
so when we want when we live it when we

00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:03,000
write poetry we are poets when we sell

00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:05,310
both your sailors when we buy it in the

00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,120
street you're buying tips when we

00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:10,350
participate in handy and are anarchists

00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:14,100
regardless of whatever we think our

00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:18,149
politics our everyone who participates

00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:20,429
in users or writes contributes to open

00:34:18,149 --> 00:34:26,970
source is an anarchist at least in those

00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:28,679
moments there in interviews so of course

00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:31,260
punk rock is just made of the people

00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:35,550
right and open source is just people too

00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:37,020
and that we make music or we make

00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:40,740
software and we share it with the world

00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:45,419
just an artifact the ideals we hold dear

00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:47,909
kind of world that we want to make so I

00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:50,010
know your time and attention you meant

00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:51,079
that sleeping the tension is more

00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:53,299
precious than any other

00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:56,739
commodity I appreciate greatly that you

00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:56,739
