all right this parts not quite as easy

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:22,029
so the we had another presenter who is

00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:26,529
scheduled to speak at ruby on ELLs this

00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:31,149
year a guy named David writer he was at

00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:32,739
the conference last year and this is on

00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:36,190
the second day last year we ended up

00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:37,390
having a panel where we talked about a

00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:39,700
bunch of different stuff and then it

00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:42,070
kind of devolved a little bit and then

00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,530
it ended up becoming a discussion about

00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:45,760
open source software so how many of

00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,190
those how many of you were here last

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:52,240
year sorry I'm doing exactly what you

00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:54,730
asked him not to okay so during the

00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,980
panel last year near the end there was a

00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:59,260
guy sitting over here on the couch who

00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,660
kept asking me what if your company

00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:05,320
won't let you do open source software

00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:08,560
development and I said well if you can't

00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:10,180
convince your company to change if you

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,479
can't change your company then you need

00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,979
to change your company and we actually

00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:19,270
went back and forth on that three or

00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:21,579
four times does anybody remember that so

00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:24,189
that was kind of this start that was my

00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:29,950
introduction to David writer so we

00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:32,619
talked a bit after the after the panel

00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:36,490
we talked for a little bit planted that

00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:39,090
seed some more and I guess I had to give

00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:41,049
you the the end story here as to why

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,939
we're talking about this in the first

00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:46,420
place so David submitted a proposal to

00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:50,770
Ruby our nails we selected his proposal

00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:52,179
to hit be selected his talk and we were

00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,560
I'd talked to him a little bit and

00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:56,170
wanted him to talk a little bit about

00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,299
the fact that he had gone from coming

00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:00,399
out to Rubio nails then going to

00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:02,319
Mountain West Ruby comp and at the time

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,670
he was working in st. George Utah for a

00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:11,110
software company down there and then he

00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:13,240
ended up quitting moving to bend so that

00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:16,840
he could do more open source software

00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,770
etc and really follow his passion so I

00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,900
wanted to have him come and present

00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:24,579
about on this unfortunately on I don't

00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,420
actually know the exact date it was the

00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:28,450
monday app

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:30,400
Super Bowl about 2 a.m. he was at the

00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:34,450
wrong persons house and was shot and

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,880
murdered so this is kind of a memorial

00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:41,470
for those of us who knew him whether it

00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:43,030
was just through the conference or for

00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:46,090
those who actually worked with him day

00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:47,319
in and day out at chief g5 and those of

00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,910
us who just knew him through the tech

00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:52,420
community here and Bend after he got

00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:54,459
here so that that's kind of what we're

00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:59,650
talking about at the moment so that

00:02:54,459 --> 00:03:01,720
that's the end story there is a fun set

00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,730
up form at chase bank if anybody

00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,670
interested in donating you can simply go

00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:09,250
in tell them you'd like to donate the

00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:10,930
David writer fund and do so he left

00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:15,549
behind his wife and a two year old

00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:18,190
daughter or two year old son anyway he

00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:19,330
was an active part of the community I'm

00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,640
going to let a couple of his co-workers

00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:27,549
from g5 talk for just a couple more

00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:28,780
minutes about his passion and what he

00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:31,150
meant and then we're going to shift into

00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,940
the lightning talks and it will raise

00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:39,040
the note or the tone up a few notches

00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:41,739
thanks everybody my name is a Chris

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,260
stringer so I work at g 5 i'm a ruby

00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:45,700
engineer there I don't want to take up

00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,530
too much of anybody's time and it most

00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,930
of you didn't know David rider and I

00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:52,450
don't want to spend a lot of time on sat

00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,680
topic and you know this is great happy

00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:57,880
conference everybody's having a good

00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:00,010
time I wanted to just talk a little bit

00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,840
more about about a few things about

00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:04,239
David and I think send a message more in

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:08,019
a general level to the Ruby community

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:10,390
and just kind of people day-to-day sort

00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:14,109
of thing so to follow up on what Kobe

00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:15,989
said David rider was here last year you

00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:18,220
guys might remember him as the guy who

00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:20,470
like Kobe said asked about open source

00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,180
he was also the guy walking around in a

00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,889
bathing suit and flip flops for the

00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,570
whole time if that rings any bells with

00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,889
anybody but I remember seeing him the

00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:29,639
first day and being like who was that

00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:34,690
guy because it was wasn't that warm out

00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:37,419
his character so I actually went to

00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,630
Mountain West Ruby calm in Salt Lake

00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:43,670
City Utah

00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:45,380
and Kobe was there and knew that we were

00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,520
looking for a new engineers of g5 it was

00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:49,490
nice enough to make an introduction

00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,160
between David and I so and that was my

00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:53,450
first time really talking to David and

00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,850
took him out to lunch and kind of gave

00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:57,950
him the pitch to come to g5 great

00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:00,020
company we support open sores you know

00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,790
you should really think about moving the

00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:06,110
band and nothing led to another and he

00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:08,660
did so that was great and you know I got

00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,400
to know him pretty well both inside and

00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,530
outside of work passionate guy

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,770
repression about Ruby passionate about

00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:18,470
music and being outdoors and family and

00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:21,200
all these things so that's all great and

00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:22,490
it most do you don't know David so I

00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,600
won't talk about that stuff anymore but

00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:28,130
I think for me I just wanted to convey

00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:32,750
to everybody you know where community

00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:34,850
we're all Ruby people and this was

00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:37,610
really real for me because you know I've

00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:39,830
had family members pass away and such

00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:43,250
but this was the guy i SAT 20 feet from

00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:46,790
and you know I still see his code every

00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:48,080
day and it was hit close to home for

00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:50,720
everybody on our team we don't were not

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,670
that big of a company you know I think

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:58,010
we have 15 or 20 people total and

00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:59,240
engineering and I don't know it was for

00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,420
me I guess I guess what I really wanted

00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:05,110
to say is you know you never know what's

00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:07,550
going to happen happens and

00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:09,770
you know we lost one of our own

00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:13,070
passionate guy in the community and I

00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:15,260
guess treat every day like it's your

00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:17,750
last because um it was yeah it's

00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:21,850
terrible to see David go and we all miss

00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,850
him a ton that's it thanks

00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:35,139
so on the other chris i'm chris gray

00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:36,340
bell on the CTO at g5 and it's my first

00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:37,780
time actually talking at a ruby

00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:42,160
conference I've been about six or seven

00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:44,520
of them so pardon my nervousness it's

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:48,160
one of my favorite pictures of David he

00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,780
embodied a lot of things but you see

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,320
about him you know he's a family man

00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:56,889
he's got a two-year-old son now and he

00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:58,630
loved being outside so I thought what I

00:06:56,889 --> 00:07:00,780
would do and I just sort of do this at

00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:04,419
lunch so this is completely impromptu is

00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:07,090
sort of tell a little story about myself

00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:10,090
and what David meant to me and use it in

00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:12,940
a lightning format talk so this is

00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:16,300
something i did recently this is a me in

00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:19,060
december of this year i have a coach and

00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:23,260
she does this thing with me it's called

00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:25,780
a wheel life and what I do is I put out

00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:27,760
it's like a trivial pursuit pie and I

00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:36,460
put the things that are important to me

00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:40,000
on each sorry wedge of the pie and you

00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:43,900
know back in December my friends were

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:48,940
pretty low I wasn't having a lot of fun

00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:53,470
I was a lot of personal growth because i

00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:56,110
was working with my coach i was making

00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:59,500
good money at my job i was happy with my

00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:01,240
job but actually the money was a little

00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:06,160
bit lower because i was paying for the

00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:08,169
coach but for those of you have ever had

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,220
to pay a therapist or anybody you know

00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:15,460
what I'm talking about but I wasn't

00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:17,710
doing a great job with my wife and you

00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,210
know this is a really interesting thing

00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:22,330
that you can apply to your own life and

00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:25,030
say well shoot um maybe something's

00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:26,860
wrong with this and what do i do to kind

00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:30,250
of round myself out a little bit right

00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:32,860
so I looked at that wheel and I actually

00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:35,229
looked at it for a long time and I

00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,430
wanted to thank jounin because I was

00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:38,950
sort of in this state of learned

00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:42,270
helplessness I was sort of i fell

00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:48,010
like I wasn't going to be able to change

00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:50,050
that and you know I sort of went through

00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:52,930
the five stages of grief that Carrie was

00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:55,150
talking about earlier today and you know

00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:58,150
first I was like glass really can't be

00:08:55,150 --> 00:09:02,050
happening and then I went to the stage

00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:05,280
of why the did this happen and

00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:07,930
finally I said well you know this sucks

00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:12,010
and I was in that state for a long time

00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:13,810
and then finally about two or three

00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:17,790
weeks ago I was like you know what I

00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:22,300
need to make a change so I did and I

00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:26,260
hope you all do too this is a picture me

00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:28,600
I got a text from my wife earlier today

00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:31,540
with a lovely picture my kids this was

00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,220
my response and the one of the first

00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:36,460
things I did was I I stopped taking

00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:40,810
myself so seriously and I think we can

00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:44,650
all learn that lesson and so I figured I

00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:47,110
draw on my own wheel life today I used

00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,760
this beautiful sticker if you don't want

00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:51,250
to put it on your laptop you can use it

00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:56,350
for your own wheel life it makes for a

00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:59,340
nice little disc um hey and you can see

00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:02,650
you know I'm not perfect yet but I've

00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:04,240
rounded out a lot of the edges one of

00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:07,390
the first things I did was take last

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,190
week and go to Florida and so my family

00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:12,160
wheel is a hell of a lot better than it

00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:14,410
was a long time ago and I actually got

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:18,220
to hang out with my wife on a date in

00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:19,870
Florida and you know the money will is

00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:24,310
actually a little bit higher because I

00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:28,120
fired the coach and also the markets

00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:30,040
been doing well but I I feel really good

00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,320
about the progress that I'm taking and

00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:35,200
so I guess the thing I really wanted to

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,180
sort of impart on everyone is you know

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,510
take some time to look at your own life

00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:43,270
look at your own wheel and make sure

00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:47,900
that you're taking care of the things

00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:49,960
that matter most to you so thank you

00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,960
