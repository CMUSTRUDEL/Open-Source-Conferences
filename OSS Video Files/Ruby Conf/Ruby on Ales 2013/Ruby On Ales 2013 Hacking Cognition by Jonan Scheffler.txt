Title: Ruby On Ales 2013 Hacking Cognition by Jonan Scheffler
Publication date: 2020-01-28
Playlist: Ruby on Ales 2013
Description: 
	We are fortunate as software developers to spend our lives learning. Our careers require us to keep pace with an industry that innovates like few others and we adapt ourselves to constant change. Given the amount of time we dedicate to learning it is surprising that we don't make a greater effort to improve our cognitive ability itself. Cognitive function can be improved with some simple techniques that apply broadly in our profession, and it only makes sense that we should expend at least as much effort improving our ability to learn as we do actually learning.

This presentation will offer you some immediately actionable steps to improve your cognitive ability and be more efficient with your programming studies. You'll learn techniques mnemonists use to memorize random pages of binary digits, how your brain physically changes as you learn something new and how simple changes in your daily routine can have a deep impact on your work.

We spend hours refactoring our code and preparing for roflscale, why not spend some time optimizing our brains?

I'm going to talk to you today about

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,919
hacking cognition literally how to

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:28,710
overclock your brain more literally than

00:00:25,919 --> 00:00:32,519
some of you would like I I presume but

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,860
as Kobe said my name is jounin jounin I

00:00:32,519 --> 00:00:36,600
tend to linger on that last n a little

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,540
bit because I'm frequently called Jonah

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,790
like Jonah in the whale also Jonas like

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,320
my name is Jonas the weezer song neither

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:47,399
of those are in fact accurate my name is

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:49,140
jounin think Conan but with a J this

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,470
image here is courtesy of one Josh

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:56,369
Sullivan good friend of mine so in

00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:57,689
talking about in cognition there are a

00:00:56,369 --> 00:00:59,460
couple of basics I want to cover first

00:00:57,689 --> 00:01:01,320
these are pretty simple things that

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,059
you've all heard before like the goal

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,100
today is for you to have some actionable

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:08,009
steps that will help you improve your

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,960
clarity of thought your ability to think

00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:11,159
and it's not a small thing to set out to

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,200
do but I think that we can all agree

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,850
that it's software engineers it's a

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,680
pretty important thing right if you can

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,360
make a one percent improvement in your

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,860
overall cognitive ability it's one

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,509
percent on every bit of code you will

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,930
ever write again so that's certainly

00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:26,940
worth your time I think so sleep

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,190
exercise in each who's been told to do

00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,860
those things before liked by everyone

00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:33,720
they've ever met maybe their mother yes

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,790
it it's true these are things that are

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,909
important but nobody really has a clear

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:41,729
picture of why specifically for brains

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:44,100
it matters sleep obviously helps us

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:45,840
recharge it helps us remember while you

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,479
sleep you replay the things that

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,890
happened during your fence of your day

00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:51,180
our process is in and travel through

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,180
your brain in various ways that will go

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,950
into in a little bit and as you sleep

00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,690
you replay those things literally you

00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,130
can watch the inputs replay as if you

00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,540
were watching it again live over and

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,460
over again and that's where your

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,350
memories come from they reinforce those

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,909
chemical and physical changes that are

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:09,780
happening in your brain to build memory

00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:12,450
and to learn so Simon Says sleep you

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:15,000
need eight hours you need eight hours of

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,739
sleep but I'm a special snowflake I can

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,599
sleep for five hours and still program

00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:21,209
you're wrong you are a special snowflake

00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:24,000
to me but when it comes to sleep you

00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:25,379
need eight hours this is a little bit

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,450
more for younger people and sometimes

00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:30,060
older people can manage eight hours aim

00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:32,849
for eight hours of sleep every night you

00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,960
have a cumulative sleep you go up when

00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:35,730
you get less than eight hours

00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,370
you get seven hours of sleep for five

00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:40,290
days in a row your cognitive ability is

00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,420
significantly impacted in fact they took

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,620
a teenager young woman who was at the

00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,570
head of her class she was an honor roll

00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,280
student and they put her into a six-week

00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,780
sleep deprivation study where rather

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,910
than her normal eight hours of sleep she

00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,140
got seven hours every day for six weeks

00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,510
and on the weekend they let her make up

00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,980
five hours so she lost five hours during

00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,150
the week and on the weekend she got to

00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,100
sleep in extra five hours between

00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,720
Saturday and Sunday and she felt the

00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:03,240
bottom of her nan sleep-deprived peers

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,600
by the end of the six weeks so if you

00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:08,700
think that you're able to sleep seven or

00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,470
six or five hours a night and still

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,200
function at peak capacity you're

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:15,510
entirely wrong so this Simon Says sleep

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,710
of the study that I am referencing here

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,300
is one where they showed people does

00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:20,190
anyone know what Simon Says the game was

00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,200
like the little light thing and you push

00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:25,050
the lights right remember the pattern so

00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,760
there was a study where they took people

00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,440
who had been sleep deprived their

00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,480
students and so they were working like

00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,610
these 16 hour days they're barely

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,010
getting there seven hours of sleep and

00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,180
they gave them a series of colored

00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,010
lights that they had to remember it was

00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,930
only three or four lights split the

00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,070
group into two double-blind study we've

00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,990
got sleep deprived and not sleep

00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,460
deprived show them the three or four

00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,200
lights and the very interesting thing is

00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,820
that sleep deprived people performed

00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,120
very quickly as compared to their peers

00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:53,010
they went much faster positive impact to

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,280
sleep deprivation right except that they

00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:57,840
were wrong they were wrong about the

00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,190
lights and one hundred percent convinced

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,070
that they were doing it better than

00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,690
everyone else so think about that but

00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:06,440
next time you think you can sleep for

00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:09,540
five hours and be a better programmer so

00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:12,570
exercise this is a woman named Sabrina

00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:16,620
Segal she got her PhD from UC Irvine

00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:18,840
where she did a study on exercise for

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,210
six minutes that's all just give give me

00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,350
six minutes of exercise after something

00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:23,700
and you will be more likely to remember

00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,830
it that's all it takes to improve your

00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:29,130
cognitive function to improve the

00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:30,900
ability to learn new things d it

00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:33,300
actually amplifies the primacy effect

00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,400
which is things that you learn in the

00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,540
beginning of a presentation so I'm going

00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,370
to go back into that later but basically

00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,870
beginning and end of something are much

00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,280
more memorable to you all the stuff in

00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,990
between basically where we're getting

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,250
from now on in my presentation will be

00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:47,790
forgotten some exercise for six minutes

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,290
with

00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,730
increase your primacy effect and allow

00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,010
you to remember things more effectively

00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:55,410
and another interesting note about

00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:59,220
exercise is that this doesn't have to be

00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:01,380
a monumental task right I feel like a

00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,750
lot of developers I know tend to address

00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,370
things full bore so we're going to pick

00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,990
up a new hobby and we're going to spend

00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,490
five hundred dollars on that hobby today

00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,810
on amazon and then that's all we're

00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:12,210
going to do for three weeks and then

00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,770
we'll get a new hobby right some people

00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,610
would like that anyway so exercise when

00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:16,860
you think oh I'm going to start

00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,870
exercising I'm gonna start jogging five

00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,970
miles a day I'm an exercise for three

00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:22,500
hours wake up at 6am right is this

00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:25,680
monumental task and it's a huge burden

00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,180
ever come but in reality you only need a

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,010
little bit of exercise every day if you

00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,680
follow the prescribed 30 minutes a day

00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:33,840
three days a week you'll be fine in fact

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,460
improvements between that and between

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,010
people who moderately exercise three

00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:40,110
days a week and people who exercise

00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:41,730
intensely six days a week is only

00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,680
negligible as far as cognitive ability

00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:45,180
is concerned obviously if you're a

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,950
marathon runner and you run marathons

00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,140
every day for six days that's awesome

00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:51,180
you're going to be much healthier than I

00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:54,980
am in my 30 minute walks but for

00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:57,210
cognitive ability the the equivalent of

00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,040
games will be seen with that amount of

00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,600
exercise so you don't really need a huge

00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,310
amount of exercise don't consider this

00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,020
to be a giant project just get up in the

00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:05,670
morning and go for a walk 30 minutes and

00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,980
six minutes after you're trying to

00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:11,040
memorize something so finally eat

00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:12,630
healthy foods this is a picture of your

00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,580
dentate gyrus actually this is your

00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:17,010
hippocampus but the dentate gyrus is

00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:21,800
inside there the DG one in the middle

00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:24,480
and there was a recent study that showed

00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,730
effectively that long-term spikes in

00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,170
blood sugar affect the functioning of

00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:29,760
the dentate gyrus and this is one of the

00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:32,640
few places in the brain where

00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,470
neurogenesis happens in adults so when

00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,710
your children there are a lot of key

00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:38,520
differences in your brain there's a

00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:41,280
molecular switch it turns out that

00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,230
changes a lot of people fertile language

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,270
acquisition machine maybe children can

00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,170
learn language really easily and part of

00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:49,020
why they can do that is that their

00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:50,370
brains are more plus through their their

00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,600
neural plasticity is higher they're more

00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:53,190
likely to be able to change their brains

00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,980
and to learn and there's a switch that

00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:57,740
turns off recently some MIT researchers

00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:00,900
turned it back on which is fascinating

00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,790
but for another talk so the dentate

00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:05,670
gyrus

00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:08,640
in the elderly population is negatively

00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:10,260
impacted by long-term sugar spikes so if

00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,120
you eat sweet foods or foods that are

00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:17,010
high in carbohydrates those will spike

00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:18,510
your those will spike your blood sugar

00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,980
level right and your body will have an

00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,870
insulin response and so your blood sugar

00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,980
goes like this up high insulin comes

00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,540
into your bloodstream and pulls the

00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,190
glucose out of your bloodstream and puts

00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,200
it into your cells and you get that kind

00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:30,870
of after sugar lull right and you go

00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:33,360
back and forth and back and forth so the

00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:35,370
idea is to eat foods that feed you that

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,630
glucose over a long period of time and

00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:39,210
those are foods that are low in

00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:40,650
carbohydrates protein vegetables things

00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:42,300
that are difficult to digest basically

00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:44,820
it'll slow the absorption of that

00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:49,230
glucose in your blood stream so the is

00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:51,390
having a low glycemic load so with quad

00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:53,460
cinema cloud and glycemic index lower

00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,690
numbers are better on this screen here

00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,100
you're not expected to see what's a

00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:58,170
little chart there I know some of your

00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,700
trying to squint and see but this is a

00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:01,410
chart comparing glycemic index device

00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,120
emits loads I've blown up the important

00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,440
part glycemic index is not what you

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,960
actually want to use on the right side

00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:09,120
if you use glycemic index then you could

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,230
eat your weight in Wonder Bread and it

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,910
would be the same as eating watermelon

00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:13,440
for an equivalent amount which is not

00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:16,160
the case actually watermelon is much

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,720
better for you than Wonder Bread and

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,280
glycemic load reflects that so the way

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,110
that they calculate glycemic load is to

00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,110
multiply the vice emic index by the

00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:27,690
amount of carbohydrates and 100 grams so

00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:29,490
watermelon for each hundred gram serving

00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:32,040
approximately a serving size 100 grams

00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:33,480
has much fewer carbohydrates than wonder

00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,590
brent so you're going to be better off

00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,210
you're going to absorb that glucose into

00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,710
your system a little bit slower now

00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,820
watermelon is not a great example of

00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:40,230
something you want to eat when you want

00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,940
some long-term brain power right stick

00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:43,680
to something that's protein or vegetable

00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,920
based nuts things that will give you a

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:50,160
sustained blusas glucose dispensed in

00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:52,440
your into your brain so those three

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,850
things are the best that you can do to

00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,470
improve your cognition you'll see more

00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,670
gains in sleeping exercising and eating

00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,320
properly than all the rest of this

00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:00,120
presentation combined so if you don't

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,950
have those things in line it may not be

00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,400
worth it to try some of my more radical

00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:07,200
recommendations as we move on

00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:10,320
neuroscience how does it work anyone

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:13,410
yeah not me so much this is a disclaimer

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,630
on the left our neuro scientists on the

00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:19,350
right is me and in the middle is drawn

00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:20,820
liar me I don't really know neuroscience

00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,620
I don't have a degree in neuroscience

00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,110
I'm a guy who sometimes spends his free

00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,570
time reading neuroscience studies on the

00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,550
internet where everything is true by the

00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,790
way but the studies are generally pretty

00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:34,710
well sourced I'm careful about that so

00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:35,970
well I I think that as a hobby it's a

00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:38,190
lot of fun to learn about these things

00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:41,610
please take all of this with a heavy

00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:43,350
dose of salt so the the first bit that I

00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:44,700
want to explain just a little bit about

00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,100
how your brain functions is that this is

00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,320
your thalamus the bid on the left is

00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,700
actually a large section of brain but

00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,440
the stick is pointing to the Salamis

00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,580
down there in the center and your

00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,500
thalamus sits in the center of your

00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,270
brain and is wrapped by your limbic

00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,120
system the hippocampus and the amygdala

00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:02,220
and your olfactory bulbs on our all

00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,510
underneath your cortex right that sits

00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,680
there so that's the core of your brain

00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:07,920
that the one that joins the two

00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,180
hemispheres down at the bottom so the

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,920
thalamus is the router for your senses

00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,480
effectively we know that when you see

00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,510
something or you hear something when you

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,920
touch something that signal is encoded

00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,990
literally into an electrical signal

00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,610
right that looks something like binary

00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,350
they're able to like recreate these

00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:25,350
signals now actually for the optical

00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:27,180
nerve you can generate an algorithm that

00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:28,080
describes what a baby's face looks like

00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,960
there's a woman who's doing some

00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,160
fascinating Sciences I talked about it

00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:34,650
but those that that information comes

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,840
into the thalamus and it's sent back out

00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:38,400
to your brain for processing right so it

00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,740
comes into the router goes back out to

00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:43,980
the brain comes back to the thalamus and

00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:45,030
then takes another action right so the

00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,010
important thing to remember there is

00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:49,800
that that's a loop that the thalamus is

00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:51,990
a key part of switching location for

00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,670
your brain without it you're going to

00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:56,070
have some very serious cognitive

00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:57,870
impairment but that learning happens

00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:00,240
throughout that entire process learning

00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:02,880
doesn't just happen in the brain in one

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,650
specific location we do know that you

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,060
can create a memory artificially in a

00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,500
single cell and then destroy that cell

00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:11,090
and delete the memory they've done that

00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:13,110
with mice but we also know that changes

00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:14,700
cognitively happen throughout the brain

00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,920
as you're learning so all the way along

00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,780
the inputs it's it's as if in your

00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,130
computer your hard drive was not where

00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,450
you stored your data but you also sorted

00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,770
in your keyboard and in the cable to

00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,900
your keyboard and in your USB mouse

00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:26,130
right all these locations are

00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,720
responsible for learning throughout your

00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:29,230
brain it's an integrated system

00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,770
unsurprisingly

00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:34,300
up the hippocampus here is the top part

00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:35,770
of your living limbic system you've got

00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,590
these two halves of the hippocampus that

00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:40,150
run down around your Paleo mammalian

00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:44,350
brain this is the lizard brain people

00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:46,870
refer to responsible for emotion and the

00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:49,630
hippocampus specifically plays a role in

00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:51,010
short-term memory the conversion of

00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,600
short-term to long-term memory that was

00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,490
exposed by a patient called HM has

00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,970
anybody ever heard of this guy the HM

00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:59,680
patient yes he HM is his initials

00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:01,900
honestly I don't remember his full name

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,990
now which is an injustice for man but he

00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:07,630
had a surgery to relieve him of

00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:09,790
epileptic seizures and part of that was

00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:11,140
destroying his hippocampus so we used to

00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:13,780
just kind of muck about with this brain

00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:15,460
science stuff right and during amateur

00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:18,370
hour HM had his head camp campus

00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:20,590
destroyed and so he was forever unable

00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:22,120
to learn for the rest of his life he

00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:23,770
could not transfer anything from

00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,640
short-term into long-term memory you

00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:27,100
remembered everything that had happened

00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,080
up until his surgery he could recount

00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,910
events from his childhood perfectly

00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,140
clearly but if you introduce yourself

00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,550
you'd introduce yourself a couple

00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,780
minutes later he couldn't safely go for

00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:37,570
a walk because he wouldn't remember

00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:39,610
where he lived or where he was right but

00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:41,350
Berkeley am a cool person carried on a

00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,210
relatively normal life for someone with

00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:45,120
such a debilitating condition so that's

00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:47,170
a role that the hippocampus plays

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,580
interesting note when I was talking

00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:52,360
about which senses go through the

00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:53,650
thalamus earlier i skipped smell your

00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,720
sense of smell does not go through your

00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:57,640
thalamus strangely your olfactory bulbs

00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,110
connect directly to your hippocampus and

00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,510
travel down to your amygdala your

00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:03,850
emotion Center and so there have been

00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:06,130
some studies around this but the working

00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:08,530
theory is that olfactory memories are

00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:10,330
created in very distinct ways there's a

00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:11,920
reason why sometimes you'll be walking

00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:14,080
down the street and smell apple pie and

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,760
picture perfectly yourself standing on

00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,910
your grandmother's porch right with that

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,220
pie in the window your ability to recall

00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:23,260
based on smell is not connected to

00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:25,600
typical routing mechanisms within your

00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:28,030
brain so if you want to remember

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,440
something it's not a terrible idea to

00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:31,180
influence the smells that around you

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,610
right if you're going to study something

00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:36,000
for some granted test anyone who wants

00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:37,990
to take the SATs for fun again someday

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,310
study with a little bottle of rose oil

00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,570
or something see if you can recreate

00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:42,070
those sense I think that you would be

00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,160
surprised how much it benefits you and

00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:45,649
there are a lot of simple tests you

00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,690
due to test your cognitive ability at

00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:48,529
home with like lists of random words we

00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:52,190
could write a random word generator

00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:53,690
right using the faker gem and just show

00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,889
ourselves a list of word in words and

00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:57,019
try to remember them and test whether

00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:58,129
we're able to remember them or not but I

00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:00,439
encourage you to do that kind of stuff

00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:01,670
science is not for laboratories right

00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:03,560
sciences for the people get out there

00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:07,399
and goof around with yourself experiment

00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:09,199
a little bit so notice the olfactory

00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:10,850
sense is fascinating to me because it

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:14,180
just skips the whole writing system

00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:15,800
entirely but I've talked a little bit

00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,019
about how we learn in neural plasticity

00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:20,300
I want to get into some specifics now

00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:22,759
but when you when you learn the

00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,230
important part is that the inputs act as

00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:26,449
places where we're learning can happen

00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:28,329
the processing centers of your brain

00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:31,160
right your dorsolateral prefrontal

00:14:28,329 --> 00:14:32,360
cortex your executive functions all of

00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,310
these places or places where learning

00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,569
can happen in your brain now

00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,860
neurogenesis neurogenesis is restricted

00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:38,870
to subsys if a' Kariya's in adults

00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,579
that's true mostly in hippocampal

00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:42,050
regions and in the limbic system that's

00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:43,189
where you create new neurons in your

00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,689
body and used to be we didn't think that

00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:46,730
was possible we thought that the brain

00:14:44,689 --> 00:14:48,110
was a static unchanging device that

00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:49,880
somehow wrote things down magnetically

00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:52,910
like a hard drive or something terrible

00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:54,920
way to store stuff but we know a little

00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,029
bit more about it now so there's a study

00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,589
called the persistence of long-term

00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:59,149
memory a molecular approach to

00:14:57,589 --> 00:15:01,130
self-sustaining changes in learning

00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:04,759
induced synaptic growth the very long

00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:08,089
name but the idea is that this gentleman

00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:10,550
named kendall Eric Kendall shocked some

00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:12,680
California sea slugs who are kind of

00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:14,360
cute I think but unfortunately have very

00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,829
simple brains so they're great for

00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,740
shocking and then cutting apart and

00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:20,029
analyzing yeah for little sea slug he

00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:25,160
just wants to be pink and float in the

00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:28,910
ocean so the the study that mr. Kendall

00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:30,559
did was to take these these cells out of

00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:32,839
the sea slug and they're really popular

00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:35,300
because they they do learn you can shock

00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:37,939
the tail of a sea slug and it'll have a

00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:40,370
gill retraction response and over time

00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:42,110
that response will last longer so if I

00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:44,959
shock a slug for the first time full the

00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:46,160
slug once it's the slugs fault and then

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,319
twice not going to fool me twice

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,070
something like that Bush said it right I

00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:54,600
don't remember

00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:55,680
uh so the longer that the the slug

00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,670
receives these shocks are the more

00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,050
frequently the better they are

00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,670
retracting their gills for longer

00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:01,320
periods of time so you can train them to

00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:02,460
keep those gills retracted and they

00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,410
think they're protecting themselves from

00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,970
the electric shock which really they

00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:09,690
can't escape isn't it wonderful and

00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:11,730
cruel so that they they keep that Gil

00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:14,160
response longer sometimes days or weeks

00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:16,920
even so that's how they test memory and

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,570
sea slugs and you're actually able to

00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,480
rip apart the sea slugs and take

00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:25,590
individual neurons into a bath of

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:27,540
serotonin and specifically doses of

00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:30,960
serotonin one and a half hours apart

00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:34,470
five times right and they found that

00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,970
firing these neurons five times one and

00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:38,400
a half hours apart was the more

00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:40,560
effective way to a noose induced

00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,120
synaptic growth so synaptic varicosities

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,280
are those little Bowl be bits and the

00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,410
picture on the right they grow and they

00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,080
engage two different things happen when

00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:50,760
you learn something on a cellular level

00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:52,230
you don't generate new neurons in every

00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,820
part of your brain right just that the

00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:56,280
limbic system generates new neurons but

00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:59,520
the synapses on those neurons will

00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:01,440
change so you'll develop new synaptic

00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,420
varicosities some of them that were

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,550
dormant before that lacked the chemicals

00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:07,380
to be effective neurotransmitters will

00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:11,010
become active again and you can even

00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:12,570
grow new ones so I want to step back a

00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:14,850
second to the part I said about doing it

00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:17,130
five times that's kind of interesting

00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:19,140
right that we don't just apply serotonin

00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:21,540
we don't just fire this this neuron and

00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,490
see an immediate change right we see a

00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,530
little bit of a change but if we do it

00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:27,660
five times an hour and a half apart with

00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:29,970
a spaced repetition we see a

00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:34,290
significantly improved response from

00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:35,160
those synaptic varicosities so remember

00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:37,580
that we're going to come back to that

00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,570
spaced repetition in a little bit here

00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:41,910
primacy and recency I mentioned this

00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:43,800
earlier a little bit remember this is

00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:44,670
the part of the come the conversation

00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,280
we're having that you're going to forget

00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:48,660
the middle part right human beings are

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,220
remarkably good at remembering the

00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,420
beginning and the end of things that

00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,640
they're shown so if I give you a list of

00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:55,500
21 words you will be much better at

00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,300
remembering the first three and the last

00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,590
three then you are any of the ones in

00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:02,130
between in fact this is a graph of that

00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:03,840
I've given a 30-30 word list people will

00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:07,080
remember sixty percent or

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,720
55 will say percent of those words from

00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,669
the first five words and then we climb

00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,980
back up again for the last five given a

00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:15,000
list of 30 or 40 words so the beginning

00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:18,029
of that is called the primacy effect

00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,679
last is the recency effect it's just the

00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:21,570
way the human minds work things that are

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:25,799
novel right or things that are recent

00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:27,150
are more memorable to us right so really

00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:30,000
interesting thing is that they did a

00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:30,960
study to try and amplify the primacy

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,460
effect so one thing we know that

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,900
amplifies the primacy effect is exercise

00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,220
right six minutes of exercise after you

00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,899
try and learn something they put people

00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,190
on a stationary bike for six minutes

00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:41,399
right barely enough time to work up a

00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:42,720
sweat probably not and they amplified

00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:44,130
that primacy effect they were able to

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,210
remember a higher percentage of things

00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:47,789
that they learned at the beginning of

00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:49,470
their word list another thing that helps

00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:52,169
is epinephrine has anyone ever used an

00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:53,399
EpiPen anyone who's allergic to peanuts

00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:55,470
has an EpiPen in their pocket right now

00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:57,720
these are epi pens this will give you a

00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:58,919
large dose of epinephrine probably more

00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,450
than you need for this purpose but if

00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:03,779
there's ever something you really need

00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:07,260
to remember right epinephrine to the

00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:09,779
brain all right so the the study that

00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:11,309
they did with this was a word list

00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:14,250
memorization study where they gave him

00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:16,350
that 21 word list and they were able to

00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:18,179
amplify the primacy effect using an

00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:19,500
epinephrine injection but not the

00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:22,620
recency effect the reasons the effect

00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:24,000
was untouched strangely so more recent

00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,710
information is not as affected as

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,090
information that you learned just a

00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:28,200
short while ago remember think about

00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:30,299
this in terms of how long it takes

00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,470
someone to read a list of 21 words and

00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:34,049
memorize them right we might give you

00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:35,909
five minutes to complete the task so not

00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:37,230
a long time in the past but if you have

00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:38,669
a stress response that's what these

00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:41,580
epinephrine and cortisol are stress

00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:43,230
hormones right they will increase your

00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:45,059
memory consolidation that same process

00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:47,220
that happens when you sleep happens much

00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:48,840
more quickly but only for information

00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,789
you learned a short while ago so things

00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,830
that are happening immediately may be

00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:55,380
forgotten for example if you see a bear

00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:57,090
right in the woods your body releases

00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,679
that fight-or-flight response you

00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:00,240
remember the look of that Baron those

00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:01,919
berries that you were eating off of his

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,610
bushes or that baby bear you were

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,289
playing with like a dummy right so this

00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:09,510
will help you remember not to play with

00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:11,610
baby bears or eat bears berry bushes in

00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:13,169
the woods but it won't so much remember

00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,730
what is happening while you were

00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:15,840
escaping from the bear hopefully right

00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,250
because it's less important for your

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,200
survival if you look back

00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:21,030
from an evolutionary perspective this

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,200
makes sense right things that we need to

00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,730
remember are the time that we ate those

00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,470
berries and then the bear almost data's

00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:27,440
not the time like everything was fine

00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:32,460
and we had some delicious berries right

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:34,770
so another interesting loop that can

00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:36,210
happen with this dis reinforcement right

00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:37,470
these space repetitions learned

00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:40,260
helplessness has anyone ever heard that

00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:43,740
term pretty common term there were some

00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:46,080
really interesting studies done again

00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:48,990
pretty cruel as neuroscience is known to

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,670
be learned helplessness is a real thing

00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:52,140
that happens to real people it has

00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:55,110
symptoms similar to chronic clinical

00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:57,330
depression the idea is that you are

00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:58,830
continuously affected by your reality

00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:01,530
rather than affecting your reality and

00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:04,110
after time you give up on the ability to

00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:06,270
change your reality so they took dogs

00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:08,700
and they put them in cages with electric

00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:09,990
plates on the bottom terrible with this

00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,960
cute picture of a pug here to describe

00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:14,220
this study but they it was a cruel study

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,840
they put these dogs in these cages and

00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,040
they shocked the plates of the bottom of

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,080
the cage at random the dog didn't know

00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,550
how the charges were coming they knew it

00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,100
hurts they couldn't stop it right

00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:25,410
getting shocked in these little cages

00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,550
and after a while they just give up and

00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,990
accept their faith this is my new

00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:30,120
reality I receive regular electric

00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:32,280
shocks I'm in pain all the time that's

00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,380
my life now and so even when they opened

00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:36,390
the cages and gave them an easy avenue

00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,500
of escape half the cages removed dog

00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:40,530
still just sits there on the plate

00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,970
that's what their life is like so there

00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:44,580
are a lot of people who live their lives

00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:45,990
like this everyday like here in America

00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,270
gives you some compassion for people who

00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:50,910
grew up in less favorable circumstances

00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:52,740
maybe then some of us did but learned

00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:54,840
helplessness a real thing and it comes

00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:56,480
from that same reinforcement cycle the

00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:59,700
brain can fight back against us as well

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,920
so remember that positive change happens

00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,450
the same way right if you speak

00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,920
positively you to yourself and when you

00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:06,150
typo something in your code don't call

00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,460
yourself the biggest idiot that ever

00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:10,200
lived your brain is listening even if

00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:13,590
you think that you're just joking you'll

00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:15,030
learn these things so signal more often

00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:17,220
to effect change the more that you can

00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:19,650
repeat that input right in a way this is

00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:21,060
not news that you memorize things by

00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:22,860
repetition right this is the way we've

00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,510
been doing it for a long time but

00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,800
specifically spaced repetition you want

00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:29,250
to learn just as you're about to forget

00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:30,750
what you just learned and I think the

00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,760
study was done at MIT where they came up

00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:34,290
with this

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,640
algorithm to define those those spaces

00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:37,530
there's a site called memorize that

00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,960
helps you teach or help you learn

00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:41,730
language that uses this technique where

00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,840
they will show you something and things

00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:44,010
that you get wrong they will show you

00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,690
again just before you would have

00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,980
forgotten that you had learned them

00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:48,420
right you learn the new thing and they

00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,730
show just the right amount of time later

00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:52,230
and they're amplifying this spaced

00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:55,590
repetition effect so this is an app that

00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:57,990
i found that i used to memorize some

00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:59,670
things that a POW deck that i'm going to

00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:01,530
talk about here in a moment but hunkies

00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:03,240
a great little app could use some open

00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:05,550
source contributions I'm not sure it's

00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,750
not written in Ruby I don't even know

00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,310
what it's written in but if any of you

00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,270
use that language you should fix this

00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:12,720
app because it could use some

00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:13,950
improvement so the stuff that I was

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,990
memorizing I got from a book called

00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:18,570
moonwalking with Einstein by Joshua fair

00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:22,490
for has anyone read this book yeah

00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:25,890
fantastic book definitely read this book

00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:28,170
so Joshua was a journalist and he was

00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:30,960
writing an article on the the national

00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:33,000
memory championship so he worked with a

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,320
man named I'd cook who was a memory

00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,840
champion there are people who do this

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,580
full-time whose study to memorize things

00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,750
and they go and they have competitions

00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:42,750
and they sit down and they'll memorize

00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:45,000
decks of cards a dozen at a time shuffle

00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:47,100
them memorize the order of them in 20

00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,030
minutes and then recount them for fun

00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:52,710
and profit right so given that what we

00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:54,180
know about repetition and how repetition

00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:58,100
reinforces learning and teaches your

00:23:54,180 --> 00:24:00,120
brain to learn more effectively right

00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:02,970
these are some techniques that I think

00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,410
are worth addressing so Josh in this

00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:05,550
book moonwalking with Einstein he

00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:07,380
addresses a couple things one of those

00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:08,910
is synesthesia they would her that

00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:13,200
synesthesia is a pretty common term for

00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:14,640
people who see or like an emotion will

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,860
have a color right the crossing of

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,080
senses maybe you hear something you

00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,970
taste it at the same time right the

00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,070
assumption was that this was something

00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:24,510
unique to people that there were certain

00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:26,790
human beings who were born with

00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:28,350
synesthesia and they were a gift to us

00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:30,900
but the reality is that we're capable of

00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:34,230
this people can learn this synesthesia

00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:35,700
you can teach yourself by creating these

00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:38,420
creative mental models you've got to use

00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:40,710
your open mode a little bit right to

00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:42,630
create your own synesthesia you can

00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:44,160
simulate that effect if you assign

00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:44,970
tastes and thoughts and smells or

00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,620
imagine more

00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:47,580
something that you otherwise would not

00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:50,179
have been able to so one of the

00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:52,860
techniques that they use to do that is

00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:56,100
memory training technique called pal the

00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:59,190
person action object and so Pao decks

00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:00,360
are essentially a list of images that

00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:03,570
you come up with that you create for

00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:06,590
yourself where you assign each to number

00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:10,020
combination zero zero through 99 with a

00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:13,230
image of a person and an action and an

00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:16,470
object for example from my deck 02

00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:17,669
because it looks like 0 Z to me reminds

00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:19,830
me of Ozzie biting the head off of

00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:20,940
Kermit right or rather just biting

00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:22,500
biting the head off is a little too

00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,780
specific for a person action object deck

00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,520
but oz you biting the head off of Kermit

00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,630
this is an actual image that i found on

00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,220
the internet and is very easy to

00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:30,450
memorize if you've got a little Anki web

00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,159
program on your phone you can just look

00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:34,710
through your flashcards and teach

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:38,610
yourself to associate these images with

00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:42,450
these numbers right so again 02 from old

00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:44,280
lead speak days 0 z as in Ozzie biting

00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:47,220
the head off of Kermit I've got another

00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:49,440
one here I want to show you this is our

00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:51,539
good friend lela star vaults giving the

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,840
finger to infinity nvidia he was joking

00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:56,190
about Nvidia's driver support for linux

00:25:53,840 --> 00:26:00,210
he doesn't really hate them that much he

00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:02,070
looks really mad but the 05 looks like

00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:03,990
OS so how about an open-source guy who

00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:06,330
also wrote an operating system oh my

00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:09,690
gosh write amazing connections in my

00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:11,909
brand so then we have iced tea playing

00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:13,530
pinball in a kangaroo costume who knew

00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:15,539
that I Steve was in a kangaroo costume

00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:18,809
ever anyone seen that movie yes tank

00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:20,100
girl awesome alright so the few of us

00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:22,380
who knew so again to review here we've

00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:25,169
got 0 to 0 Z Ozzy biting the head off of

00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:27,600
Kermit noticed torvalds giving nvidia

00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:29,490
the finger that's 05 here and then we

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,980
have ice tea playing pinball in a

00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:33,360
kangaroo costume right so now if I were

00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,360
to ask you to remember this six digit

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,620
number this is about the limit of what

00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,490
humans can remember six or seven digits

00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,470
that we can hold in our short-term

00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:41,669
memory register right that's why phone

00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:45,090
numbers are shaped the way they are

00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:46,620
right so I ask you to memorize this and

00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:48,179
it's possible that you'll just remember

00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,890
this straightaway right but if I gave

00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:52,020
you four or five or ten of these in

00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:54,210
series it's much more difficult so the

00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:57,090
point of a person action object act is

00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:58,530
to be able to memorize this number with

00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:01,620
a single image right

00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:05,850
so if we take 06 which is iced tea right

00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:10,050
and we take 05 which is of giving the

00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:12,360
finger right and 022 Kermit we have iced

00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:15,990
tea flipping off garments right man he

00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:17,160
is angry at caramel so 06 05 02 becomes

00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:19,950
slipping off Kermit and suddenly we have

00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,720
one image images are much better for us

00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:25,290
to remember as human beings remember

00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,850
that written word and numerals are

00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:28,980
relatively recent innovations in the

00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:30,900
evolution of humankind when you are

00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,790
looking at a number or a letter you're

00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,560
memorizing that number or letter as a

00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:38,100
pictograph right reading is relatively

00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:39,630
slow we didn't recently until recently

00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,490
understand why it took us so long to

00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:43,560
read write that it's a really processing

00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:45,480
intensive thing that your whole life you

00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,400
will never get over a certain number of

00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,870
words per minute in reading no matter

00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,640
how much you read people read their

00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:52,350
whole lives right this is pretty common

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,790
you'd think that we would have some way

00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:55,470
to push past that upper bound but this

00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:57,300
is part of why that our brains are not

00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:58,620
designed to process this they're

00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,910
designed to process pictures of bears

00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,320
that are chasing us away from bear

00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:04,140
babies in the woods right by the bear

00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,970
bush so I ste flipping off Kermit is a

00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,380
single image and now if I were to give

00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:10,650
you five more of these then you've got

00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:12,210
six images and a lot more numbers right

00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:14,520
you've got 30 numbers you can memorize a

00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:17,250
30 number string if you can keep six

00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,660
pictures in your head and especially if

00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:21,060
those pictures are unique and unusual

00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:23,490
like ice-t flipping off Kermit becomes a

00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:26,460
lot easier so the way that they do this

00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:28,050
in practice in a memory championship is

00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,640
you have a memory palace you choose a

00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:31,170
place that's especially memorable to you

00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,360
a lot of people use their original home

00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:35,130
where they grew up maybe something

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,800
that's more recent your first company

00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:39,450
where you got a job some physical space

00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,040
where you're able to walk the layout in

00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:43,830
your mind you'd be surprised how easily

00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:46,440
that you can do this and then you'll

00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:49,350
place those images in loci around that

00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:51,540
space so I could walk into the living

00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:53,700
room of my first home where I grew up

00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:55,530
back in boulder colorado and I could see

00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,180
ice-t flipping off Kermit and in fact

00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:58,680
six other images easily held in that

00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:00,480
loci it's quite common to hold six at a

00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,800
place right and then I can move into the

00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,930
kitchen and I have another six images

00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:06,630
and pretty soon I'm memories memorizing

00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:08,370
pages of binary digits right or entire

00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:10,230
decks of cards in a very short period of

00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:11,789
time Josh before actually won the USA

00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:14,609
memory championships in one year

00:29:11,789 --> 00:29:16,289
he taught himself to do this too he

00:29:14,609 --> 00:29:19,259
taught himself a person action object

00:29:16,289 --> 00:29:20,700
system and in studying how to do this he

00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:21,989
became fascinated with it and went back

00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:25,529
to win the championship the next year

00:29:21,989 --> 00:29:26,820
for memorizing decks of cards so let's

00:29:25,529 --> 00:29:29,519
say that iced tea flipping off Carmen

00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:31,019
isn't quite your thing there are some

00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,029
alternatives that I'm going to talk

00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:35,549
about again this is getting more into

00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:37,259
the brain hacking territory this is

00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:39,029
transcranial direct current stimulation

00:29:37,259 --> 00:29:41,820
or brain zapping has anyone ever heard

00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:43,710
of this yeah so you're actually applying

00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:45,960
an electrical stimulus to your brain

00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:50,399
directly sound safe for everybody yeah

00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:52,109
good idea right so the electrodes excite

00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:56,489
and suppress brain activity in that

00:29:52,109 --> 00:29:57,659
region you increase the excitability of

00:29:56,489 --> 00:30:00,840
your neurons they call it neuronal

00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:02,279
excitability but you make those that

00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,720
specific patch of neurons where you

00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:07,080
apply the anode right the positive

00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,879
charge you make that specific patch of

00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:12,239
neurons more active they're more

00:30:08,879 --> 00:30:14,369
excitable they fire louder on an fMRI

00:30:12,239 --> 00:30:17,159
scan right when you look at a functional

00:30:14,369 --> 00:30:20,249
magnetic-resonance image of a brain that

00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:22,379
has just been receiving tDCS then you

00:30:20,249 --> 00:30:24,809
see a brighter spot than you would if

00:30:22,379 --> 00:30:27,919
they had been receiving the cathode side

00:30:24,809 --> 00:30:31,139
which suppresses so a node will increase

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:34,139
your excitability of those neurons and

00:30:31,139 --> 00:30:36,419
the cathode side will decrease right so

00:30:34,139 --> 00:30:39,119
popular place to apply this technology

00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:42,320
this is not a a small thing right teeth

00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:44,220
to dcs was used for a long time but

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,419
probably in the 70s we've started

00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,039
experimenting with it i mean they did

00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:48,419
this in the 30s and like that but we

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,099
just barely knew what electricity was it

00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:52,529
was very dangerous right in some cases

00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:55,409
they heard people but more recently

00:30:52,529 --> 00:30:57,049
we've been using this to impact the

00:30:55,409 --> 00:30:59,749
ability to learn and do increase

00:30:57,049 --> 00:31:04,049
reuptake especially the primacy effect

00:30:59,749 --> 00:31:05,279
in all sorts of arenas the Air Force and

00:31:04,049 --> 00:31:07,649
the Department of Defense use this to

00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:09,659
teach people Air Force pilots who fly

00:31:07,649 --> 00:31:11,489
drones will use this to learn two and a

00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:13,379
half times faster than their peers so

00:31:11,489 --> 00:31:15,149
this is not small science like yes it's

00:31:13,379 --> 00:31:16,619
dangerous it's a little bit fringe I

00:31:15,149 --> 00:31:19,200
don't really recommend you goof around

00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:21,509
with it but there is some real sector

00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,009
backup this so the dorsolateral

00:31:21,509 --> 00:31:24,749
prefrontal cortex I want to talk about

00:31:23,009 --> 00:31:25,650
for a little bit real common place where

00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:27,540
people apply the

00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:28,950
stimulus this is the part of your brain

00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:31,920
that's responsible for executive

00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:35,520
functions so working memory problem

00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:36,930
solving attention this is the bit of

00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,460
your brain that is managing all the

00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:40,560
other processes right this is where you

00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:42,330
make a decision so in the front of your

00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,440
brain here your dorsal lateral if you

00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:45,330
just take your fingers on your

00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,980
cheekbones and run up right here these

00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:48,780
two points on your brain roughly or

00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,710
where those executive functions come

00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,970
from there are a lot of other

00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:53,070
interesting things that happen in the

00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:54,930
brain right and it's not that exact but

00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:56,730
they know that you can increase the

00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:58,680
executive functions by applying an

00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:59,460
annual anode stimulus to one of the

00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:03,210
other side of the dorsolateral

00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:04,770
prefrontal cortex so here's what a nodal

00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:06,870
stimulation and neuronal excitability

00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:08,910
looks like in your motor cortex on the

00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:10,560
side of your brain this is the left side

00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:12,120
of your brain here they apply to Nana

00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:14,550
little stimulation to the center of the

00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:18,060
brain right about here on the side of

00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:19,890
the temple and these are fmr eyes from

00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:21,540
before and after you can see on the

00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:23,400
right side up top this is someone who

00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:25,770
received stimulus from transcranial

00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:27,450
direct current stimulation and below is

00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:29,430
someone who did not so they actually

00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:31,800
lost some cognitive ability as it turns

00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:33,540
out that's the sham group and so there

00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,820
has been some question about the

00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:37,020
effectiveness of sham electrodes in

00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:39,600
these studies and whether or not we're

00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:40,740
getting false data so there have been

00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,790
some adjustments recently and how the

00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,080
shams are done but basically what they

00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:45,450
do is they shock you for only a little

00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:47,520
bit so you get the current because you

00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:49,710
feel it still you're going to know as a

00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,880
patient that feeling of electricity

00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:52,200
running into your head you can

00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,940
definitely feel it frequently people

00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,890
will get a phosphine like a white

00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:57,450
electric flash in your vision when your

00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,620
optic nerve adjusts to processing new

00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:00,450
electrical input that comes from nowhere

00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:02,520
and learns to cut out the noise pretty

00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:04,110
quickly which is fascinating that our

00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,610
nerve can do that right like if you wear

00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:07,620
those glasses the prison glasses that

00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:08,520
flip your entire world upside down long

00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,620
enough that your brain will start

00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:12,150
processing things the right way again

00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:15,210
and then you'll take them off and just

00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:19,200
be ruined right you do go back to normal

00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:20,580
eventually but the a nodal stimulation

00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,720
and neuronal excitability that's what

00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,670
the whole point of this right that's

00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:26,310
tDCS so it does have an effect a

00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:28,560
measurable effect it's quite impressive

00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:30,000
really so there are some people on the

00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:34,350
internet who are into do-it-yourself

00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:37,760
tDCS this is a terrible idea do not do

00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:39,600
this ever seriously really bad idea

00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,309
applying an electrical current

00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:45,179
directly to your brain right seriously

00:33:41,309 --> 00:33:47,990
do not do this all right so I actually

00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:50,700
brought my device here that I made with

00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:52,559
the help of my my good friend Michael

00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,539
Buffington who also works a livingsocial

00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:56,429
he has better soldering skills than I do

00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:57,900
so this is the device that we made a

00:33:56,429 --> 00:34:01,280
couple of battery packs I've got eight

00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:03,990
double-a batteries in here this has five

00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:05,460
470 ohm resistors in a row I'll show its

00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:07,740
people who want to look at it nobody can

00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,359
try it no I don't want anyone to

00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:12,450
accidentally lobotomize themselves on my

00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:15,750
dime but um it's very safe really the

00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:18,300
output of this is it's going to be fine

00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:20,010
don't worry about it um this little

00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,419
green light here will come on when I

00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:26,760
complete a circuit through my brain in

00:34:21,419 --> 00:34:28,230
just a moment so now the thing with this

00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,639
is that the placement of the electrodes

00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:31,950
matters right so I had to make my own

00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:33,570
electrodes amazon don't ever order thing

00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:34,740
on amazon that's not prime because they

00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:36,929
don't ship when they say they will a

00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:38,760
bunch of liars but I've soaked these

00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:41,010
sponges that I made myself you want a

00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,690
large space for your a note in your

00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:46,109
cathode again don't do this seriously

00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:47,280
bad idea soak it in saline solution as

00:34:46,109 --> 00:34:48,750
much salt as you can dissolve in the

00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,460
water so if that sponge that will

00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:52,169
conduct electricity real well and be

00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:54,710
really careful that it doesn't drip like

00:34:52,169 --> 00:34:57,570
into your eye so that you zap your

00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:58,920
cornea off or something so you want to

00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:00,480
get this sponge right here on your head

00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:03,150
right and I'm actually going to plug my

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,310
leads into these first so this here is

00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:07,380
my little copper plate I did the solder

00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:09,330
on the copper plates that was the one

00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,800
contribution I had for soldering so I

00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:12,540
plugged my little copper plate into the

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,609
back of the sponge here and I've got my

00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:16,230
anode right here on my dorsal lateral

00:35:14,609 --> 00:35:19,890
prefrontal cortex right here right and

00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:21,180
in a minute if I have a seizure or die

00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:22,410
or something my wife's here in the

00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:24,030
fourth row you guys should go comfort

00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:29,520
her she's a nice lady she doesn't

00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:31,650
deserve this but so this is the cathode

00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,260
side here and I'm going to put this one

00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:37,440
in here and I'm going to put this on the

00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:40,410
side of my head right over here okay um

00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,990
it's it's not super precise as it turns

00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:44,970
out if you because the sponge is so

00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:46,230
large the idea is to distribute the

00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:48,359
current to fuse the current over a large

00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:50,160
area so you don't want to use like

00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:52,800
pinpoints because it will burn your skin

00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,520
kind of a lot well I mean it's it's not

00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,840
a lot

00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,270
I'm not going to cut a hole in your head

00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:59,130
or anything but it hurts right yeah yeah

00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:00,630
yeah you wanted you want to defuse the

00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:01,920
current as much as possible so you'll

00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:03,600
see a little bit this I might have a

00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:08,010
little bit of a red sponge shaped mark

00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:10,220
on my skull so what I'm going to apply

00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:12,000
to my brain here is 2 milli amps of

00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:14,160
electrical current and it's got a

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,470
voltage regulator on here to make sure

00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,790
that it's always pushing 2 milliamps

00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:19,380
through my brain so the voltage will go

00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:21,000
up and down to ensure that the current

00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:22,950
traveling through my brain no matter

00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
what the resistance of my brain is some

00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:26,180
people's brains have higher resistance

00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,820
than others they're a little bit thicker

00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:31,560
so when I turn this on let's see where

00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,910
did I get my switches this is really

00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,250
carefully planned this whole thing

00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:37,290
nothing possibly could go wrong okay I

00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:39,200
just saw a flash of light come across

00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:41,850
can't even see the green light on yeah

00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,920
so I saw a flash of light come across my

00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:45,510
field of vision it's like a free

00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,670
fireworks display right it's practically

00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:50,480
drugs without any negative health of

00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:54,000
benefit their effects that we know about

00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:55,830
yeah it's totally working I am wasted

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,540
I'm like that guy from limitless right

00:36:55,830 --> 00:37:02,430
now I can feel the clear pill in my

00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:04,620
blood so the idea is that I am exciting

00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:06,450
of neurons in this portion of my brain

00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:09,240
right my dorsolateral prefrontal cortex

00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:10,560
is more excitable now and if I were to

00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,850
do this for about 20 minutes or 30

00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,670
minutes which is how long they normally

00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:15,930
do this then I could begin learning

00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:17,790
immediately because I'm obviously

00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:20,190
stimming and excited about it right then

00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:21,480
but the effects can last an hour and

00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:23,490
they think that if you train regularly

00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,830
you can increase that affect the

00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:28,470
duration of that effect over time you

00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:30,900
can learn to learn for an extended

00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:33,330
period we're excited frontal cortex so

00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:35,910
the two side effects of this one like I

00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:37,110
said redness under the electrode zone

00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:38,880
that's why you want to use a nice big

00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:40,860
sponge if you do this in seriously

00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,900
terrible terrible idea don't do this

00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:46,410
especially going tell anybody I told you

00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:48,360
about it the other side effect is that

00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:49,410
phosphine which is really kind of scared

00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,480
when you first see it but after a while

00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:55,650
it's fun it's like oh hello phosphine I

00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:57,570
remember you right so there's one last

00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:59,190
side effect that I want to dress is me

00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:02,160
testing my device with the thumbs up

00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:04,890
here final side effects

00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,960
yeah tDCS causes crazy I a little bit so

00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:08,580
watch out for that if you get the crazy

00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,640
I don't come a-knockin it wasn't my

00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:13,170
fault I told you not to do it so thank

00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,880
you very much room in my talk I want to

00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:15,960
ask anyone if they remember that number

00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,440
that i asked you to remember the six

00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,940
digit that's kind of a lot of people oh

00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,190
that was totally easy I already learned

00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:25,680
that all right yeah because of iced tea

00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:29,010

Jonah i am lee pot on twitter if you

00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,460
guys want to talk about brain hacking

00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:37,460
let me know anytime i'm always down

00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:37,460
