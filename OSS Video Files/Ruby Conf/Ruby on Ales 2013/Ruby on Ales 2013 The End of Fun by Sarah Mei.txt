Title: Ruby on Ales 2013 The End of Fun by Sarah Mei
Publication date: 2020-01-28
Playlist: Ruby on Ales 2013
Description: 
	I hate to break it to you, guys, but Ruby is almost old enough to drink. What started out as a small community full of fun, silliness, and connection has been growing. Our small codebases are now large. Our small *companies* are now large. And the large companies have finally figured out that they want in, too.

So maybe it's time to start tackling Real Problems and Real Solutions in the world of Real Innovation. Maybe it's time for the community to grow up, stop playing around, and get Seriousâ„¢.

But...that's not who we are. Our community thrives on creativity, play, and luck. And those things aren't just a weird perk like not having to wear shoes in the office - creativity, play, and luck, when present, actually produce better software. As we grow our projects and our teams and invade the corporate cube farm, there are some things we can lay aside, and there are others we must hold on to as if our very identity depended on them.

Because it does.

you

00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:28,250
good morning how many people have

00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:32,680
visited the bar already thank you you're

00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:34,940
my people I am really happy to be here

00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,199
my name is Sara Mae and I'm a ruby

00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,540
developer at pivotal labs in san

00:00:36,199 --> 00:00:40,100
francisco and i have wanted to come to

00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,530
this conference since it got started a

00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,019
few years ago and this year thanks to

00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,940
kobe i finally made it and my job today

00:00:45,019 --> 00:00:50,600
is to ensure that you have absolutely no

00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:55,129
fun at this conference just so we're

00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,360
clear so let me start out by asking how

00:00:55,129 --> 00:00:59,420
many people have fun when they're

00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:01,160
writing in there Ruby code okay thank

00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,210
you I was really afraid that it was

00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:08,200
going to be one of these like everyone's

00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:12,710
asleep kind of mornings um I do too I

00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:14,570
love Ruby and and part of what i love

00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:17,030
about is the language itself right the

00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:22,640
the Ruby language itself is amazing and

00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:24,140
it's now 20 years old which rubies from

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,470
Japan of course in the legal drinking

00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:30,229
age in Japan is 20 so you should

00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:33,290
congratulate the Ruby team because their

00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:35,390
language can finally have a beer but

00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:39,200
what I love about Ruby maybe even more

00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:42,020
than the language itself is that I love

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,470
the community around Ruby and I love

00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:46,790
hanging out with you guys and I've been

00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,430
in a lot of developer communities over

00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:51,439
my career and I've never been in one

00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:54,290
where people were more creative or more

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:57,829
fun or more social had so many other

00:01:54,290 --> 00:02:01,460
interests besides code or so many

00:01:57,829 --> 00:02:04,520
interesting projects to work on but my

00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:09,350
friends we have a problem our problem

00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:12,049
looks like this wild success ruby has

00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:15,320
been amazingly successful we've gone

00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:18,829
from a fringe hobbyist language to

00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:21,380
almost maybe even a mainstream language

00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:24,680
in a couple of years just a couple of

00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:29,110
years and a lot of things that used to

00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,110
be small have gotten bigger

00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,689
symptom number one in the last year

00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:38,420
we've started seeing a lot of conference

00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:40,280
talks and blogs and even books start to

00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:44,299
show up all around the theme of what

00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:46,040
happens when your rails app grows up so

00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:47,360
we've been talking about rails engines

00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,650
we've been talking about software

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,760
architecture we've been talking about

00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:53,959
object design and these things are

00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,459
important they're not important in a

00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:58,579
small code base they're important in a

00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:59,989
big code base and even even dhh his

00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:01,400
message she hates over design he's

00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:02,659
engaging on these things right he's

00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,700
engaging on the question because it's

00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:06,500
important because we're all hitting a

00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:11,629
lot of these growing pains at the same

00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:16,040
time symptom number two remember when

00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:18,829
Twitter was 12 people that was a long

00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,599
time ago they're not the only one right

00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:23,359
lots of companies that use Ruby have a

00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:26,480
ruby product sell Ruby services have

00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:29,299
gotten a lot bigger they've grown

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,590
they've IPO they've been acquired as

00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:31,940
rubios we're working not only with

00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:35,000
larger code bases we're working on

00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,139
larger teams and you can see that in the

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,169
way that we started discussing things

00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:40,280
like remote work for example our small

00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:42,829
companies have grown up into big

00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,769
companies and finally symptom number

00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:48,410
three the really really big companies

00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:51,019
have started figuring out that this is

00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:52,790
something they want a part of I've

00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:56,419
talked to people at conferences from HP

00:03:52,790 --> 00:04:01,840
IBM GE and all of these companies are

00:03:56,419 --> 00:04:03,980
adding ruby into their portfolio and

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,690
I've talked to a lot of people at

00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:07,669
different types of companies doing

00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:09,560
different types of things with Ruby but

00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:11,480
I've heard a lot of the same story over

00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,459
the last year and it's something its

00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,400
variations on a theme but the basic idea

00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:17,840
is there's a developer they want to

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,120
build something cool they want to have

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,470
fun so they go to work at a little

00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,010
company with a couple of the people

00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:29,020
building a product and now that little

00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:31,520
company seems to keep getting bigger and

00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:33,650
they're now they're a big company and

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,260
they have a big code base and they're

00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:38,840
afraid they're afraid what they're

00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:41,479
afraid of is becoming capital be big

00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,229
right they're afraid of this

00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:44,940
they're afraid that their company's

00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:47,520
growth is going to suck all the fun out

00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:52,530
of their job and out of programming for

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:56,460
them now having worked for a big company

00:04:52,530 --> 00:05:02,099
myself I know that this is a legitimate

00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:03,599
fear but with the influx of people into

00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:05,840
our community who already work at big

00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:08,759
companies and with more of us becoming

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,199
whether we want to or not working at big

00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,509
companies I've started to see some

00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:14,099
interesting some interesting things that

00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:15,990
I would characterize this fear mongering

00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:17,250
here's what it looks like these days so

00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:19,470
there'll be a blog post will probably

00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,840
make it to the top hacker news and it'll

00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:23,430
say there's two sides as a developer you

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,819
are on one side or you were on the other

00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:29,580
if you are an established company person

00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:31,909
what you like is process you're very

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,889
focused you know what you're building

00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:36,120
you are determined your unwavering and

00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:38,819
then the other side would say that

00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,319
you're a little bit tunnel vision II if

00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:45,539
you're on the other side if you're a

00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:48,810
startup person you're creative you have

00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:49,800
a lot of ideas you value disruption but

00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:53,150
the other side will say that you're a

00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,900
little bit immature in these categories

00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:56,520
I've seen them in lots of different

00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,690
places with lots of different people

00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,870
talking about them and they have

00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:03,330
different headers if you're talking to

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:05,310
Paul Graham who founded y combinator

00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:07,440
which is a VC in Silicon Valley oh that

00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,900
funds small groups of 20-somethings in

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:14,909
their garages then your headers look

00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:19,770
like this and recently in our community

00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:21,840
I've seen this and no matter who's

00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,130
talking about it though it's really

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,599
clear what they mean what they mean is

00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:26,250
that you as an individual developer at

00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:29,159
any given time in your life are in one

00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:31,800
of these categories or the other you may

00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:32,940
move between categories right I mean

00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,849
Paul Graham thinks it happens

00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,870
automatically when you turn 30 so but

00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:41,099
the assumption here is that these are

00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:42,599
different types of people and some folks

00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:44,430
will even go so far as to assert that

00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:46,110
you need both types of people in your

00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,360
company in order to balance stability

00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:51,120
and growth as you get bigger we'll come

00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,919
back to that idea later but right now I

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,129
want to I want to drop something to this

00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:58,869
conversation we haven't had before

00:06:54,129 --> 00:07:00,550
I want to talk science these

00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:04,059
categorizations that people make are

00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:06,389
based on one person's generalizing from

00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:08,649
their experience and that can be useful

00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:11,169
but I'd like to remind you of something

00:07:08,649 --> 00:07:15,669
which is that a collection of anecdotes

00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:17,469
does not add up to conclusive data so

00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:20,639
what I want to do is look at some data

00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:24,069
and I want to start with creativity

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,659
because if you look at these lists the

00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:27,729
generalization here is that the stable

00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:29,679
side is boring and uncreate evanda

00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:31,509
volatile side is fun and creative right

00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:33,969
and all of these other properties flow

00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:35,499
from those initial judgments so I want

00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:38,439
to look at the science around creativity

00:07:35,499 --> 00:07:44,709
for a moment who is creative and how do

00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:45,669
you do it in the 1970s psychologist at

00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:47,919
Berkeley did some really fascinating

00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:50,349
work on the qualities of creative people

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,899
they took two groups people identified

00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:54,279
by their peers as creative and people

00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:56,739
identified by their peers as not

00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:58,389
creative and they looked for

00:07:56,739 --> 00:08:00,009
statistically significant differences

00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:02,579
between these people and here are some

00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:04,899
things that completely do not matter

00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:07,029
intelligence is kind of an interesting

00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:10,809
one smart people are no more likely to

00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:12,279
be creative than less smart people young

00:08:10,809 --> 00:08:14,889
people no more likely to be creative

00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:16,589
than older people women no more likely

00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:18,339
to be creative than men

00:08:16,589 --> 00:08:22,719
african-americans no more likely to be

00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:23,860
creative than European Americans and in

00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:25,869
essence what they found is that there

00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:28,089
are no statistically significant innate

00:08:25,869 --> 00:08:31,329
differences between people who are

00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:34,000
creative and people who aren't but what

00:08:31,329 --> 00:08:40,060
they did find we're differences in

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:42,459
behavior and inhabits and what that

00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:44,350
tells us is that creativity is not a

00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:48,250
quality that a person has or doesn't

00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:51,100
have its a mode of operating it's a way

00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:54,130
of thinking I'll come back in a moment

00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,300
to what those habits actually are but I

00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,910
think at this point it might help to

00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,380
define creativity as scientists think

00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:02,220
about it I think we all have an

00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:04,540
intuitive feeling for what it is a

00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:07,470
scientist distinguish between two modes

00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:10,110
of thinking that human beings engage in

00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:12,810
and those are closed mode and open mode

00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:14,310
when you're in closed mode you are

00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,860
getting very specific things done

00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:19,080
psychologists call this being executive

00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:21,420
your goals are very specific and you're

00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:24,770
typically very focused on them then in

00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:26,880
the open mode you may have general goals

00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:28,770
but what you're doing is typically not

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,840
very focused and you're open to chance

00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:35,550
and unusual connections in your thinking

00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:38,130
and it's in the open mode where creative

00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:40,260
thought can occur so the first part of

00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,760
being a creative person just means

00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:46,620
knowing how to switch yourself between

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,640
these modes deliberately so what I

00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,680
thought was interesting about these

00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:54,390
lists they look kind of familiar right

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,460
they look a lot like these

00:09:54,390 --> 00:10:00,930
categorizations we've been doing in our

00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:02,880
community right and it turns out that

00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:05,610
folks who want to put people in one or

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,460
one of these two categories have

00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:10,950
actually hit upon a real dichotomy right

00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:13,890
but instead of different types of people

00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:16,770
these are really just different modes of

00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:18,750
thought and their critical error isn't

00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:24,890
saying that a person individual is one

00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:27,390
or the other because we are all both and

00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:31,320
I'd like to just enjoy that Zen for a

00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:37,200
moment we are all the amazing qualities

00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:38,580
of human brains it's amazing so when

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,530
people say that you need both of these

00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,510
to balance against each other in a

00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:44,580
company that's actually true because we

00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:45,780
need both of these modes of thought when

00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,880
we're doing software development and

00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:50,370
each of us needs to be able to do both

00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,960
and a technical leader shouldn't be

00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:54,000
trying to hire these archetypes and play

00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:56,100
them off each other a technical leaders

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,920
goal should be allowed there should be

00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:01,890
to allow their people to do both of

00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,880
these things at the right time so I

00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,740
think at this point though it's still

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,850
fair to ask like what is being creative

00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,300
really have to do with software

00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:10,910
development isn't what we do computer

00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:15,500
science

00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:22,280
that's what it says on my degree some

00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:23,720
people think of it as typing I mean what

00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:26,300
does it have to do with art or poetry or

00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,790
music or humor or dance right those

00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:34,280
things are creative isn't what we do

00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:37,970
kind of mechanical comparison let me

00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:39,200
take for example the classic test-driven

00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:41,360
development cycle first you write a

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,760
failing test then you write the code

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,410
that makes it pass then you refactor the

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,480
code try it make it better right and in

00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:52,850
practice the cycle looks a little bit

00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:54,500
more like this you write some code you

00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,820
write a test you write some code write

00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,460
another test to write some code write

00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:01,190
another test resin code then you get

00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:03,140
some sort of vaguely standalone portion

00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:06,350
of the feature done and then you

00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:09,500
refactor so just to give you a concrete

00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:11,510
example of what this looks like think

00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,730
about adding a method to rails model

00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:15,290
give a model for a bus and you need a

00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:17,660
method that tells you how many ipads the

00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:20,240
passengers on your bus are carrying so

00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:22,670
you write a model spec that fails then

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,280
you write the method model spec goes

00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:28,640
green then you realize the story was

00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:30,770
actually asking for registered iPads so

00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:34,120
you go back to the test you add another

00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:36,110
line to the spec which goes red again

00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:45,770
then you implement it in the model

00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:47,720
everything's green and then you realize

00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:50,990
it maybe maybe all this stuff doesn't

00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:54,140
belong in the model and at this point at

00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:55,700
this point you have thousands of options

00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,290
for what you could do with this code

00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:00,320
right you could leave it where it is it

00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:01,760
works tester green you could extract

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,520
parts of it leave parts of it in the

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,010
model you could you could reimagine your

00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,510
domain model I mean you could rewrite

00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:11,630
the whole thing in nodejs right you got

00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:12,890
lots of options but before we talk about

00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,210
these options I want to consider for a

00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,650
moment what's different about these two

00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,330
phases of the cycle right first you're

00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:20,590
doing the red green red green red green

00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:24,640
and then you refactor what's different

00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:26,320
so the first thing is that the words

00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,640
that we say are different when we're

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,070
talking about code during these two

00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,360
different phases so if you're pairing is

00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,800
the words you say out loud I suppose if

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,530
you don't pair these as you're like

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,350
internal monologue or maybe this is what

00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:39,880
you tell your dog I don't know um but we

00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,170
go from you know when we're when we're

00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,790
writing the code and we're writing the

00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,800
tests we're discussing the nuts and

00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:46,060
bolts the functionality right I think

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,160
we're missing an end here maybe that

00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:51,310
context is need to be there maybe we

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,330
could in line that variable and when we

00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:54,370
start refactoring we start discussing

00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:56,470
larger concerns we back up a little bit

00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,790
Oh spent that started out with a name

00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,930
that made sense and now it's not quite

00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:02,010
right maybe it doesn't belong in this

00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:04,090
class anymore maybe we could rename it

00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:05,680
so the second thing that changes is that

00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:07,300
the keys that we use on the keyboard

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,280
kind of change right you're entering you

00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,320
go from entering code and entering logic

00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,810
and thinking about the logic to sort of

00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:16,330
moving stuff around right your cut and

00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:17,590
paste I'm giving us the benefit that out

00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:21,820
that we're not cutting and pasting in

00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:24,100
the top part of that section don't let

00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:26,650
me down on that one okay and the third

00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,730
thing that changes is our posture so

00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,890
when you're doing the red green red

00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:31,240
green you're you're getting close to the

00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:34,510
screen your hands are on the keyboard

00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,740
you're looking at the code but when you

00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:38,880
refactor you take your hands off the

00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:42,790
keyboard you kind of sit back and you

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:46,060
look at the code without trying to

00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:47,350
change it right away and of course

00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,970
fundamentally what's happening is that

00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:54,910
we're thinking differently about the

00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:57,670
code in these two modes and how so how

00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:59,440
we're thinking has changed and so when

00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:01,510
you're in the red green red green phase

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,450
you're in you're operating in closed

00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:05,680
mode you're executing and when you're in

00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,900
the refactor mode you're moving into

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,770
open mode and so red green refactor is

00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:13,600
actually a structured way of moving us

00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:16,300
between the closed and open modes when

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,120
we're writing code it's a habit that we

00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:23,980
have that gives us room to think

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:26,350
creatively every time we write code but

00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:28,690
it is kind of a funny habit is it

00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:31,140
creative I think it's still a valid

00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:31,140
question

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:39,189
this lady is an American dancer and

00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:41,139
choreographer named Twyla Tharp she is

00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:42,939
currently 71 years old and she is still

00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:46,060
considered one of the most creative

00:15:42,939 --> 00:15:48,519
forces in contemporary dance and she

00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:52,269
wrote a fantastic book called the

00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:53,800
creative habit in which she details how

00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:58,240
it is that she comes up with a new dance

00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:00,160
and what she does is in the morning she

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,939
dances her standard routines and moves

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:06,100
for several hours and she's moving her

00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:08,860
body in very familiar ways she's been

00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:11,410
doing for 30 or 40 years she's executing

00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:14,199
she's comfortable and then in the

00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:17,350
afternoon she works on coming up with

00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:18,550
new movements and the movement she does

00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:20,649
in the morning serves as the raw

00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:22,300
material and gives her the base that she

00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:24,939
can then use to refactor into something

00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:28,509
completely new in the afternoon and her

00:16:24,939 --> 00:16:30,220
process is designed to move her

00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:32,230
deliberately between the closed boat in

00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,399
the open mode closed mode being in the

00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:35,949
morning in the open mode in the

00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:39,759
afternoon and she needs both of those to

00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:42,309
come up with a new dance because if all

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:45,370
you do is execute you'll never come up

00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:49,209
with something new and if all you do is

00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:52,529
refactor you'll never finish anything so

00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:55,230
you need both to write great software oh

00:16:52,529 --> 00:17:01,930
wait we're not talking about software

00:16:55,230 --> 00:17:03,519
talking about dance so the creative

00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:05,049
process actually does look the same

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,329
across disciplines I think those of us

00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:08,860
who aren't professional artists tend to

00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:10,299
romanticize it a bit and we think of it

00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:12,669
as going into a cave and coming out with

00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:14,020
the work of genius but really what it's

00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:18,220
about is if you execute and then you

00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:21,789
rethink and red green refactor gives us

00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:23,530
that time to be in the open mode so the

00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:25,809
question that you get after that right

00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:29,230
is how do you proceed once you're there

00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:30,669
once you're in that mode because once

00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:32,620
you're in that open mode everything is

00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:35,050
possible

00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,850
and figuring out the best option is is

00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:39,309
usually a matter of shifting your

00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:41,320
context somehow considering the code you

00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:44,500
wrote in a larger context right and that

00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,730
shift is the germ of creativity no

00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,160
matter what type of creativity we're

00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:50,130
talking about right painting and comedy

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,690
and poetry and all these creative works

00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:54,250
get their power from showing the viewer

00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:59,200
context they hadn't noticed before I

00:17:54,250 --> 00:18:00,760
wanna give you another example humor how

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,390
many folk singers does it take to change

00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:06,370
a light bulb answer 51 to change the

00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:10,270
bulb and four to sing about how much

00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:12,130
better the old one was how many

00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:14,530
anarchists does it take to change a

00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:18,960
light bulb answer none because everyone

00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:22,870
knows they never change anything and

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,160
finally how many enterprise developers

00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:26,950
does it take to change a lightbulb

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:32,800
answer we're not going to change it we

00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:34,030
think it works it's the shift in contact

00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,650
straight between the setup and the

00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,720
punchline that gives jokes their power

00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:39,580
and makes them funny so once you get

00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,590
into this creative mode that's step one

00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:44,980
but then you need to be able to make

00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:47,050
that context switch once you're there if

00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:49,480
I were a management consultant which I'm

00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:50,740
not I'd call it thinking outside the box

00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,840
and then you have to shoot me I guess

00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:56,309
but really so it's just contact shifting

00:18:52,840 --> 00:19:02,170
that allows you to see a an unintuitive

00:18:56,309 --> 00:19:04,480
solution to the problem at hand one

00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:05,830
thing that I've noticed though is that

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,809
different developers have different

00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:10,059
levels of skill with that part of the

00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:11,679
process I've been pair programming

00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:14,380
full-time for about three years I

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,510
counted it up I think I've paired with

00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:19,570
about 150 different people over that

00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:21,270
time and some of them when we're sitting

00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:23,140
there and we're looking at a refactoring

00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:26,080
always seem to come up with a pretty

00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:27,340
decent solution sometimes it takes a

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,020
while but they always come up with

00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:32,530
something and a lot of times what

00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:34,990
happens is that they have seen a piece

00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:37,720
of code recently that is similar to what

00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:39,340
we're trying to do and a lot of times it

00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,780
feels like luck you know it feels like

00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,700
they just happen to be in the codebase

00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,170
the other day and they happen to see

00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,380
this other thing that we could reuse

00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:47,910
this happens a lot in big project

00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:51,570
especially when a lot of code and no one

00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:52,560
person knows all of it and they happen

00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:55,530
to be looking at something in a

00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,910
completely different folder and I was

00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,680
thinking about this and I ran across

00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:01,170
some more science I'm going to go back

00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,610
to this picture I love this picture and

00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:04,560
I ran across a really interesting paper

00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:06,420
that talked about what's different

00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,850
between people who consider themselves

00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:13,860
to be lucky and people who consider

00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:16,230
themselves to be unlucky so the first

00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:18,180
thing I looked at is whether people who

00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:21,330
think they are lucky are in fact more

00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:24,120
lucky and what they did was they took

00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:26,400
people who self-selected as lucky

00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,960
yourself selected as unlucky and they

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,790
gave them a section of the newspaper and

00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,310
they said go through this newspaper

00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:35,670
count the number of photos and bring the

00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:37,530
number back to the researcher and on the

00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:39,600
second page of the paper was a half page

00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:43,170
advertisement with no photos and big

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:49,320
text and the text said stop there are 36

00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:51,860
photos go tell the researcher and people

00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:54,620
who considered themselves to be lucky

00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:57,420
consistently found that and noticed it

00:20:54,620 --> 00:21:00,570
more often than people who consider

00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:06,360
themselves to be unlucky which is kind

00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:07,740
of an interesting thing so once they had

00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,410
established that like there actually is

00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,820
a difference between people who think

00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:13,170
they are lucky and people who think they

00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,340
are unlucky they look started to try and

00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:17,450
figure out what that difference was

00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:19,710
similar to this creativity research and

00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:22,200
just as with the creativity research

00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:23,550
what they found was absolutely no innate

00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,780
differences between these groups of

00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:30,630
people at all but once again there are

00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:33,630
differences in behavior it turns out

00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:39,050
that people who are lucky deliberately

00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:42,480
seek novelty in all parts of their lives

00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:44,040
so for example given the choice of two

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,060
paths to walk they will always pick the

00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:49,650
one that they haven't gone down before

00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:52,350
presented with a menu they will choose

00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:54,760
the dish they haven't had before

00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:58,780
these are little things but by doing

00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:59,860
these little things they are exposing

00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:03,310
themselves and things that are outside

00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:04,690
of their comfort zone and in doing so

00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:06,370
they are changing the mode in which

00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:08,530
their brain is working and they are

00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:11,170
making their they're changing the mode

00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:12,250
of their thinking to be more open and it

00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:15,580
means they notice things I wouldn't

00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:16,810
normally notice and the end result is

00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:19,540
that they're able to see more of those

00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:24,340
contacts shifts and it makes them

00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:25,600
unusually effective problem solvers so

00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:32,110
it turns out that lucky is just another

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:40,810
word for I guess reads a lot of random

00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:42,820
crap um so so coming back to our list of

00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:44,380
properties there's a lot of red greenery

00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:46,510
factors one of the habits we have it

00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:49,030
allows us to give us this space that

00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:52,210
gives us this space to be creative but

00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:56,190
it's not the only thing that we have for

00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:59,680
example the process we do at pivotal a

00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:01,170
typical day as a developer I'll me and

00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,430
my pair will take the top story off the

00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:05,140
tracker backlog which presumably is the

00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:07,630
most important thing and we'll do it

00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:10,600
will write green refactor the heck out

00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:12,190
of it will finish it and then we will go

00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,530
take the next story off the top the

00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:16,660
backlog and we'll do that and that's

00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:18,700
what we do pretty much all the time and

00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:23,410
it feels awesome it feels amazing to get

00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:24,940
so much stuff done but once a week we

00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:28,120
also do something else would you a

00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:32,170
retrospective which is a one-hour

00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:33,520
meeting where we talk about our process

00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:35,070
and we talk about what's working and

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,480
what's not working with the process and

00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:39,130
it's our chance to think about how the

00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,220
process is working and how we'd like to

00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:44,140
change it and I don't think I could do

00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:48,610
the process without the retrospectives

00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:50,740
because at well developers at pivotal

00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:53,500
call this particular part of the process

00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:57,700
the story meal because we're turning

00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:59,860
through stories and it's a very it's a

00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:01,750
very executive it's a very closed it's

00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:04,180
very you just getting done all the

00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:05,620
time but retros are the open mode this

00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:08,170
sort of balances the store

00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:09,850
mills closed mode and doing those retros

00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:11,500
weekly is a structured way of

00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:14,290
introducing creative thinking into our

00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:16,000
process just like the refactor stage is

00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:20,790
a structured way of introducing creative

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:23,020
thinking into our code so ultimately

00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:25,690
what it comes down to is that process

00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:29,050
when it's done right enables us to be

00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:30,730
creative and being creative is what

00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:32,890
enables us to build great software and

00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:36,610
the goal of the process should be to

00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:38,230
give us that space and to teach us the

00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:39,880
habits of creative people if that's not

00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:43,480
what yours feels like should think about

00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:46,270
refactoring it in that direction and if

00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:48,610
you're at a company that's growing or is

00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:49,870
already big and you need to start adding

00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:54,010
more structure to your development

00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:55,330
process it's it's a difficult thing

00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:56,140
right and you need to be careful you

00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:58,120
need to be careful that you're not

00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:59,290
squeezing all the fun and creativity out

00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,059
of your development you can make sure

00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:03,790
that your process gives your developers

00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:04,929
this space to think creatively because

00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:09,160
that's what makes it possible to write

00:25:04,929 --> 00:25:10,840
great software and finally it's the

00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,610
process will give you that time but it's

00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,230
your job to introduce enough novelty

00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:16,690
into your life to take advantage of that

00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:17,950
time once you have it and you don't even

00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:19,510
need to spend a hundred twenty thousand

00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:22,360
dollars on art school it's pretty

00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:25,510
awesome here are some things you can do

00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:29,410
when you're working to make you more

00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:30,970
open and the first thing is to look at

00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:32,110
parts of your code base beyond what's

00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:33,880
immediately in front of you know it's

00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:35,170
gonna be a little stuff right you see a

00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,940
method being used you don't know how

00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:38,740
it's implemented go look at it and

00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:41,500
spilling through parts of the code you

00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:43,510
haven't seen in a while fill your mind

00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:46,390
with this raw material of this creative

00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:47,920
thought and the second thing is to try

00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:51,940
and vary what you do as much as possible

00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,870
and consulting work agrees with me

00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:56,010
because I have a very short attention

00:25:52,870 --> 00:26:00,460
span as switch projects every few months

00:25:56,010 --> 00:26:03,130
but if you can't do that it's you can

00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:04,840
still do things like try looking at some

00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:06,520
JavaScript if your back-end developer or

00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,530
try looking at some sequel optimization

00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:10,360
if you usually do javascript my room for

00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:14,350
this is that once you start feeling

00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:16,150
comfortable it's time to move on and the

00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:17,980
third thing you can do is seek out teams

00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:19,020
that have people on them who don't look

00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:22,110
like you

00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:23,490
and this is an interesting hack there's

00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:26,550
been some research that tells us if you

00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:28,410
have to problem solving teams and what

00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:31,470
they do require some creative thought

00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:33,990
and one team is better qualified on

00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:35,870
paper but they all look the same and the

00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:39,270
other team is less qualified on paper

00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:41,700
but they look different meaning they

00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:43,950
have differences in height or race or

00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:46,980
gender ability and things like that then

00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:51,210
the less qualified team consistently

00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:53,400
does better and the theory there is that

00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:55,890
when you are communicating with people

00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:59,040
that don't look like you that don't have

00:26:55,890 --> 00:27:00,390
exactly your communication style it's

00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,580
another way it's another source of

00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:04,770
novelty it's another way of picking your

00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:06,060
brain into this quasi creative mode that

00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:11,910
will allow you to make the connections

00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:14,280
you need to make and so I have a couple

00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:15,420
of other suggestions some the which

00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:18,570
you'll have to indulge me since I'm the

00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:20,700
first talk of the day and of things you

00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:25,110
can do to introduce more novelty into

00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:26,430
your life right now I'm guilty of this I

00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:29,280
come to a conference I hang out with all

00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:30,510
the pivots who are there try talking to

00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:33,090
someone who's in a different companies

00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:34,050
swag pretty awesome let them tell you

00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:35,370
what they do let them tell you about

00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:39,030
their problems and their code base and

00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:39,870
what they're working on I guarantee

00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:41,880
you're going to hear a lot of

00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:42,990
interesting tech stuff today and eighty

00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,070
percent of it you're going to go yeah

00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:46,440
that's kind of cool but there's

00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:51,390
absolutely no application of that in my

00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:52,710
work oh well but you try it anyway even

00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:56,580
if it's just a little project download

00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:58,890
it and give it a try this is one of the

00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:00,000
things I love about conferences I meet

00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:03,150
all these people that I only know on

00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:07,560
Twitter it's really fun to make the

00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:12,030
virtual world real and finally since

00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:13,530
this is a since this is Ruby on ales try

00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:15,030
beer you don't usually like I don't

00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:21,020
usually like IPAs but I figure I can

00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:21,020
give it a shot right and finally I

00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:26,670
please have fun that's what this is

00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:28,170
about writing code should be fun and you

00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:30,000
can make it fun even in a corporate

00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:32,260
setting even in start-up setting you can

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,750
make it fun and creative

00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:36,070
no matter where you're working as long

00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:37,740
as you make sure that you've got the

00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:41,110
right structure to give you that space

00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:43,830
so thank you very much and I hope you

00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,830
enjoy the rest of the conference

00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,220
