	00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,710
you

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:31,619
Thanks I'm also a little bit banged up

00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:35,530
after that sorry about that um anyway I

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:37,239
I've run into this case a lot where you

00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:41,410
run you're working on one test you run

00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:43,570
it and end it and it's fine and then you

00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:48,640
run the the same thing in your test

00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:56,229
suite and for whatever reason it's not

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:59,530
fine like taking longer than I'd hoped

00:00:56,229 --> 00:01:01,479
there it is and and this is the same

00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:03,100
test and it but it runs fine on its own

00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:05,170
and you don't know why there's probably

00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,520
some leaky test it's not doing its tear

00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,200
down properly it's leaving over some

00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,080
state and its mucking up tests

00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:14,680
downstream so I was using a script for a

00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:18,159
while that did an operation inspired by

00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:20,259
git bisect to go and bisect the files of

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,240
your test suite and keep cutting it down

00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:26,710
until it found the one test with the

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,510
leaky tear down and and I decided at the

00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:31,840
encouragement of some co-workers to turn

00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:34,150
this into a rake task and and then you

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,680
can run this rake task and this will

00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:38,140
take a minute I'll blather while it's

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,120
going on it'll it you know cuts it in

00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,320
half seas if that makes it fail cuts and

00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,730
the other half keeps narrowing it down

00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:52,390
until it finds the one test that it

00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:55,900
fails with their it's failing while this

00:01:52,390 --> 00:02:00,520
is going on I'm the guy who broke the 19

00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:02,170
production deploy at New Relic I'm also

00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:08,590
the guy who fixed it so at least I

00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:12,580
cleaned up my mess this is not a rails

00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:15,819
app that's out so fast this is this is

00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:20,730
the the Ruby agent I work on that at New

00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:20,730
Relic so

00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:28,760
well it was it was it was the agent it

00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:30,560
was the agent which broke the deploy so

00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,050
I had to go and fix that real quick so

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:38,000
here it is it narrowed it down there's

00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:39,560
this one test this one New Relic agent

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,959
test which is breaking that other like

00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,750
version tests version number of tests

00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:47,840
that we're trying to do and if we look I

00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:50,150
cheated for purposes of this test this

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,730
is the one that we want not to fail so

00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,079
you know fela fail and then upstream

00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,590
there's this version test that just says

00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:59,090
failed the true so but the the moral of

00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:01,040
the story is that this will show up if

00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,049
you don't do your tear downs properly

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,299
and or your setups properly depending on

00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:07,370
which side you want to cut it on and

00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:11,360
hopefully this will this allow you can

00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:16,660
use this and my mouse is not going to

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:19,400
work thanks also my text resizing anyway

00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:22,160
it's gem it's on github you can use it

00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:28,690
it's very new so tell me if it doesn't

00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:30,829
work thanks next okay I'm Rob head and I

00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:33,200
worked for pivotal apps for two years

00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:34,880
and now we're starting a new lab here

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,069
and Oregon called zeal that's who I am

00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:41,859
anyway I'm from Ashland and that means

00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:44,329
I'm going to talk about deeper

00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:48,139
enlightenment of agile and how it

00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:51,400
applies to mysticism so this talk is

00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:55,069
called Ruby and roomy or why agile works

00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,139
okay so sit be still and listen because

00:03:55,069 --> 00:04:01,810
you were drunk and we're at the edge of

00:03:57,139 --> 00:04:04,780
the roof for real that's a real quote

00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:08,750
okay this is my first rails project woo

00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:11,209
2006 look at that design work alright so

00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:14,989
this woman teaches people how to not be

00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:16,190
terrible people for a living and she has

00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:17,989
a business called virtue straining

00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,489
inspiring and powering and transforming

00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:20,419
people to achieve their potential okay

00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:23,630
that's cool so it got me to thinking

00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:26,539
about these issues virtues right things

00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:28,099
like courage or patience respect service

00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:32,240
humility these sorts of things right and

00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:34,400
I got to thinking maybe philosophy and

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,360
mysticism and even religion maybe it's

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,330
not about

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,490
invisible friends and and feeling

00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:42,800
superior maybe it's really about maybe

00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:45,669
trying to develop my character and that

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,639
sort of thing and so there's this guy

00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:52,430
that was a mystic poet in the 13th

00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:54,680
century he was Afghani and Persian his

00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:57,560
name was roomy anybody read any roomie

00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,389
whoo all right okay so here's the

00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,669
mystical poet and he had the sweetest

00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:05,389
headgear that I've ever seen ever teen

00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:06,650
it's really amazing um so this is what

00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:08,389
he said about courage which is one of

00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:10,789
the virtues that I was reflecting on he

00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:13,009
said start a huge foolish project like

00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:16,639
Noah it makes absolutely no difference

00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:18,560
what people think of you cool I like

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,360
that I I have a tendency to do stupid

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,270
things that people think are ridiculous

00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,469
so I got to thinking about you know who

00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:27,020
else has done these things so speaking

00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:28,520
of foolish projects mats you know

00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,289
decided there weren't enough programming

00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,590
languages in the world so he created

00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:34,610
ruby and but he didn't do it just for

00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:36,860
the sake of doing it he did it because

00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:39,050
he had this virtue in mind he said for

00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:42,139
me the purpose of life is partly to have

00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:43,310
joy programmers can also often feel joy

00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:45,589
when they can concentrate on the

00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:48,370
creative side of programming so Ruby is

00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:51,589
designed to make programmers happy matts

00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:53,479
love this guy I really truly love this

00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:55,039
guy I got to actually met him for the

00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:57,020
first time last week I got this sort of

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,150
smile at him and sort of you know you

00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,860
know bow a little bit he was he was

00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:03,469
getting swag from Sarah Sarah in here

00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,839
and he was you know he just got his

00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:07,639
pivotal shirt and hat from the swag

00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:09,490
closet and he was super happy about that

00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:12,560
which I thought was really amusing

00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:16,339
anyway other foolish projects ridiculous

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:19,009
right I mean some punk kid is going to

00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:20,810
is going to beat like dotnet be built by

00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:23,060
the you know the most powerful company

00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,259
in the world but he did so it got me

00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,370
thinking you know it's just not the

00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,509
first time that we've started thinking

00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:30,800
about what are the virtues that make

00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:32,180
coding work so Larry uh wall had these

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,860
had this amusing talk where we talked

00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,689
about laziness impatience and hubris but

00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:38,870
that's not really we're talking about

00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:40,550
here let's talk a July agile is about

00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:42,740
these larger and larger iterations these

00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:44,680
larger larger cycles of action and

00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,940
reflection right it happens on the

00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,070
minute level on the daily level on the

00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,990
iteration level that sort of thing

00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:52,970
and it has to do with all of these I'm

00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:55,250
getting phone call Wow okay so it has to

00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:57,470
do with all these virtues that that are

00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:00,020
required so I learned this from rob me

00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:03,530
anybody taken the rpi which is the Rob's

00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,760
programming interview okay so it turns

00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:06,620
out there's this there's this

00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,730
methodology he uses he in 45 minutes he

00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,680
knows whether he wants to hire you or

00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:13,940
not but the first thing he's looking for

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,280
is anyone anyone guess empathy why

00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:18,560
because I have to sit next to you all

00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,560
day long and if I'm a jerk or you're a

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,420
jerk it sucks okay so we have to develop

00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,310
our character to become better pair

00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:27,710
programmers okay so it's sort of nice

00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:30,920
flexibility these sort of things okay

00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:34,310
cool um boom it works it really does

00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:38,300
trust me if you haven't done it okay we

00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:40,850
complete each other we really do um okay

00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:44,360
so why does test-driven development work

00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:50,600
for these things okay I'll just jump to

00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:54,350
the end truth tell the truth okay so why

00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:55,580
do these things work right so look at

00:07:54,350 --> 00:08:06,140
these worlds spinnin out of nothingness

00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:08,810
that is within your power dude okay so I

00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:14,140
want to tell you all about a gem that I

00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:18,470
released this afternoon called dude and

00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:20,990
dude came up in a pairing prep session

00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:24,140
that Carrie and I had where we hid an

00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:25,730
exception and we made fun of each other

00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:31,130
and we started making big lebowski

00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:33,229
references and so I said let's do

00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:35,770
something fun with it because Ruby

00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:35,770
should be fun

00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:49,090
so I asked Twitter hey someone make a

00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:51,160
gem called Lebowski that monkey patches

00:08:49,090 --> 00:09:00,160
error message frequently appending dude

00:08:51,160 --> 00:09:02,860
to your errors but like I gave it a week

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:06,070
and no one did it so I did it my own

00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:07,630
damn self uh it's not that hard this is

00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:16,840
like eight lines of code and it's

00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:20,320
basically with 2s dude but I had

00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:23,440
problems so I was loading the code in

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,480
IRB like I would load the file itself

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,240
and that would work and then I would

00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:35,050
load the gem and I would just get comma

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:40,320
dude I don't like I was like what

00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:40,320
happened to that message I I have the

00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:48,880
and so I wrote up a nice little

00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:54,010
description see if you can swap the air

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:57,910
it's pretty easy so I've put up a nice

00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:59,140
little issue description i cc'd abdi cuz

00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:02,040
i'm like that guy's smart about

00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:16,350
exceptions maybe he'll figure it out

00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:18,910
here's the pro tip so what's next oh go

00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:21,600
yeah you're right that's that's a good

00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,600
valid point

00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:27,370
um so I want to be able to grow this gem

00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:28,870
so it just doesn't append do to

00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,820
everything because that's kind of boring

00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:35,440
and I think our error messages should be

00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:39,190
fun so if you've got an idea of how you

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:44,980
could override say an ill air so that it

00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:46,900
was funny or throw in a few random

00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,820
ization so it's not always the same

00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,890
error message but it tells you what's

00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:56,170
wrong then maybe you'll read your error

00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:58,830
messages and not like screw up for kit

00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:05,140
make a poll request use it in your repos

00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:08,020
thanks up here like the new pope I know

00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:10,960
how it feels now um is there a new pope

00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:14,140
yet anybody no I don't think so all

00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:16,530
right five minutes thank you so this is

00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:19,210
uh this is sort of a work in progress

00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:21,870
you don't need to plug in because there

00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:24,400
is no slides currently this is my slide

00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:26,640
and I have four minutes 43 seconds so

00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:30,520
I'm going to go as quick as I can uh-huh

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,140
so don't be a poser is related to do you

00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:36,130
have any designers in the house as well

00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:38,230
yeah yeah now keep your hand up if you

00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:41,320
are like a designer that lobs PSD files

00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:44,740
over the fence awesome see that like

00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:47,680
it's 2013 so why are so many web

00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:50,470
designers still a lot like think their

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:54,840
web designers if they're lobbing PSD's

00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:58,150
over the fence delivering static images

00:11:54,840 --> 00:12:01,110
starts with a false assumptions about

00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:04,090
the relative cost of potential solutions

00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:07,590
fails so fully understand or clearly

00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:10,870
communicate the user experience that

00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:14,890
developers need to ultimately implement

00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:18,640
so how many people have received a

00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:21,310
design or and a spec or user stories

00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:24,670
that are out of alignment is that happen

00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:27,790
to anybody yeah it happens quite often

00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:30,490
and I kind of used to be that guy that

00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:33,670
was like you know a print designer that

00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:35,080
thought hey yeah I like the internet and

00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:38,260
I use a lot

00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:43,000
apps i understand apps so i can design

00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:44,500
for the web and that that that's

00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,960
something that I guess we're sort of

00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:49,260
growing out of but it is still around a

00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:53,110
lot it's amazing to me how many of

00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:55,150
consultancies have in how still receive

00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:57,010
like PSD files and think that that's

00:12:55,150 --> 00:13:00,850
like and they have to work with that and

00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:02,740
develop from that so often times you

00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:05,230
know ran into functionality scoping

00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:07,210
issues and you know just like oh here's

00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,860
a cool button it's going to do this and

00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:12,010
all of a sudden you just double the

00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:16,380
scope of the project so those are things

00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:19,540
that working with developers and

00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:22,210
basically at some point at two minutes

00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:24,070
and 47 seconds okay good at some point

00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:25,780
out of the desire to better understand

00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:29,190
the medium and better communicate the

00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:32,110
design intention I learned HTML CSS

00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:34,960
basic JavaScript to create a side

00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:36,550
project to to learn these skills and my

00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,400
eyes were like open to the power of

00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:44,280
working in the medium during the design

00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:48,340
process and then I had the fortune of

00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:50,500
designing for apps and creating working

00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:52,810
prototypes which I then hand it off to

00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:55,780
devs and they were just like wow this is

00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:58,450
so cool like I don't have to you know do

00:13:55,780 --> 00:14:00,970
this part of it and it communicates so

00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:02,920
clearly what the intention of the design

00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:06,460
is and the functionality and you know

00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:10,410
the the the states of the design which

00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:13,440
was huge and and again my you know my

00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:20,350
eyes were opened again so I had the

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:21,640
opportunity to see mm-hmm I mean so at

00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,800
that point there there was still a ton

00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,390
of like refactoring that need to be done

00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,790
with the code because it was you know

00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:29,590
like designer code which how many

00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:31,270
grumbling devs are in here that are like

00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:34,690
designers don't touch my code base or

00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:36,730
you know stay out like right cuz yeah I

00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:40,150
see a couple of guys like what is it

00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:44,640
where's this guy going this is lame but

00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:47,980
I started pairing with devs on

00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,180
developing functionality and what came

00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,310
of that again it was like this

00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:56,620
awesome I opening experience for both

00:14:51,310 --> 00:15:01,270
myself and the dev that you know today

00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:04,630
we basically I had this experience built

00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:06,460
out a new feature and you know I dabbled

00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:08,980
in low-level programming stuff before

00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:11,770
but I never really took it too seriously

00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:14,590
because I was a designer and designers

00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:17,170
are just like you know devs or like

00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:19,000
don't screw up my design it's beautiful

00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:22,570
it's amazing and you're the guy that can

00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,120
jack it up so it goes both ways but this

00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:28,570
like mutual understanding happened and

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:31,360
out of that like I learned how to take

00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:33,670
and write in ER be file with some real

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,380
basic logic so you know now I can like

00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:37,090
loop through in iterate and you know

00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:40,780
like that was really a cool thing and

00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:43,810
after time and a lot of interest I was

00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:45,610
like writing committable code and in you

00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:48,070
know mostly views and some controller

00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:51,340
work but contributing at a deeper level

00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:54,160
18 seconds anyways today we have

00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:57,180
response responsive grids iterative

00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:01,930
iterative design all these things that

00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:05,650
no longer the old-school methods no

00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:07,150
longer pertain so I've got more if

00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:09,550
anyone's interested I'd love to like

00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:13,440
have a beer and talk about this so I

00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:13,440
won't take any more time thank you

00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:21,460
hi I'm Shane I'm speaking first tomorrow

00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:31,260
so if you are not totally hungover I'll

00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:35,530
see you then so who knows of Rubinius

00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:38,470
okay so Rubinius is great now available

00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:40,870
for use on Heroku thanks to some work by

00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:43,090
some Terrance Lee and some andre arco on

00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:46,270
bundler so in your gym file you can

00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:50,350
specify which version of Ruby you want

00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:53,830
to use and which implementation so I had

00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:54,880
some slides but I could simple enough I

00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:57,400
could just tell it to you and you could

00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:00,490
type it into your your text editor so

00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:02,980
you know on one line you say Ruby and

00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:05,470
then space and a quote and you say a

00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:07,750
version number so 180 7 193 pretty

00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:20,949
simple you could specify your your

00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:23,439
version suspense as another I guess

00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:25,329
argument there here we go there you go

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:30,940
that's how you specify that you want to

00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:33,370
use Rubinius version to the release

00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:35,590
candidate or whatever and that you want

00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:38,020
to run it in 19 mode so i think that is

00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:40,210
currently a 18 mode Ruben es bundler

00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:43,270
Roku bug but if you want to run your

00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:44,950
code in 19 mode on roku using Rubinius

00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:47,230
that's all you got to do and then when

00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:50,850
you push up to Heroku it will discover

00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:59,610
it switch Ruby's so you should do that

00:17:50,850 --> 00:18:03,370
thank you sweet all right five minutes

00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:05,500
yeah figured since I'm at ruby on ales I

00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:06,850
should you know they said I should put

00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,530
this up as a talk as I was giving this

00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:10,660
advice last year two people going out to

00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:13,000
drinking it's like here's some cool tips

00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:15,880
when you go to a bar like what you can

00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,380
do to have a better bar experience so a

00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,140
little background about why this talk is

00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:23,320
up here i'm a third-generation bar owner

00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:25,360
almost my family owns set of bars in

00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,610
Chicago I would technically be the third

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,230
generation if it kind of survives

00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:30,520
as a divorce and all that crap going on

00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:32,950
right now so who knows that that's going

00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,960
to last but you know I also didn't want

00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:37,570
to do the whole bar industry thing I

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,429
grew up in it I know it I kind of knew

00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:42,730
how to tap a keg when I was ten it's a

00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:44,470
life skill right but you know I didn't

00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,790
want to do that I was into this whole

00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:48,130
programming thing they said go get a

00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:51,190
real job so I did I went and got back

00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:52,720
into programming again so I figured from

00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:54,340
that all that experience that I know I

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,990
can impart some cool tips for you guys

00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:58,900
since we're going to go off drinking at

00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:02,500
eight o'clock so in my perfect role with

00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:05,919
a hot bartender yes Tom Cruise before I

00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:07,510
went crazy in a bar when you walk in

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,980
you're going to see a setup very similar

00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:11,620
to this a lot of bars are laid out this

00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:15,040
way there's a whole lot of marketing

00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:17,410
going on so specifically those bottles

00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,360
that you can see are the call level

00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:20,980
drinks is in like I'm calling out a

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,200
label of something I want to drink

00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,940
therefore it's usually more expensive so

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,980
if you're saying like I want this

00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:29,200
particular kind of gin or whiskey as a

00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:31,270
lot of whiskey drinkers out here bet if

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,070
you say I just want a gin or whiskey

00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:35,320
it's going to come from this section

00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:36,700
called the well much cheaper it's

00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,350
whatever the house has it could be the

00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,330
cheapest will that's probably tastes

00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:41,440
like motor oil or something like that be

00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,760
careful with that so if you want

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,950
something really nice make sure you call

00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:47,710
it out by name are there starbucks

00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:49,780
aficionados in the audience I'll admit

00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:52,390
that I am one but when you're at a bar

00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:54,520
it's the same thing there's a short or

00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:56,679
tall glass depending on what size you

00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:59,320
want short can also be called a rocks or

00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:01,059
highball glass tall can also be called

00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,370
it Collins or pint glass some people

00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:05,080
call pint glass a double tall it looks a

00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:07,570
bit like this that's a rocks glass right

00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,770
there much smaller if you don't want to

00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:11,500
drink that much if you want to try

00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:13,570
something out this is my favorite a up

00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:17,020
or martini glass it's also my handled

00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:19,540
martini soft so looks like that most

00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:21,340
margaritas and cosmopolitan stuff like

00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,870
that I'll come like that and then I'm

00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:25,690
sure there's a few whiskey drinkers that

00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:29,530
know this one I want it neat in a short

00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:30,730
glass nothing touches it no ice I just

00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:32,250
want it in a small glass like that

00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:35,890
that's also called a highball glass

00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:38,050
really really small glass but this is

00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:40,450
Ruby a nail so how about pouring beer do

00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:41,389
you guys know to pour beer raise your

00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:44,809
hands homebrew

00:20:41,389 --> 00:20:47,450
here all right so well let's review then

00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:49,429
all right so you start off with your

00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:51,079
clean glass you did wash out the inside

00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:53,509
of it right so you don't kill the suds

00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:55,309
with any leftover soap so you start off

00:20:53,509 --> 00:20:56,749
at a 45-degree angle and you want to aim

00:20:55,309 --> 00:20:58,459
for the bottom third of the glass

00:20:56,749 --> 00:21:00,139
because you don't want to churn the beer

00:20:58,459 --> 00:21:01,519
not trying to build the head yet you

00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:03,079
just want to get the beer into it

00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:04,759
without pissing off the beer and

00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:06,889
creating that head when it's about

00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:09,529
halfway full start tilting it up right

00:21:06,889 --> 00:21:11,059
okay once you do this is when you're

00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:12,919
starting to build that beautiful head

00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:15,349
this is where the flavor comes from you

00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:17,359
get a flat beer to bar try to send it

00:21:15,349 --> 00:21:18,950
back but don't be an if you want

00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:21,320
just drink a little bit of it and a cool

00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:23,089
bartender trick is to take a straw and

00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,769
whisk the top really quick to just get a

00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:27,409
little bit of head up you'll taste the

00:21:24,769 --> 00:21:29,329
beer much better that way believe me so

00:21:27,409 --> 00:21:31,669
once it's full back away from the tap

00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:33,139
you're done hopefully you got a head

00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:35,779
that looks just like that's about two

00:21:33,139 --> 00:21:37,789
fingers length and that should be good

00:21:35,779 --> 00:21:40,639
to really enjoy that beer the proper way

00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:41,959
but also there's customer service

00:21:40,639 --> 00:21:43,459
involved so please don't be an

00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:44,839
run to the back and critique the

00:21:43,459 --> 00:21:47,599
bartender back there while she's pouring

00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:49,609
your free beers okay it's a two-way

00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:51,679
street you want to be a good person and

00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:53,629
in return they'll be good to you as well

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,249
you might get free drinks out of it who

00:21:53,629 --> 00:21:56,929
knows even if you're not drinking for

00:21:55,249 --> 00:21:58,849
free at a conference so being that

00:21:56,929 --> 00:22:00,799
better customer start off by introducing

00:21:58,849 --> 00:22:02,269
yourself to the bartender get on a

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:04,879
first-name basis and be very polite

00:22:02,269 --> 00:22:06,559
shake can say hi whatever that way when

00:22:04,879 --> 00:22:08,479
the bar is packed tonight with everyone

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,339
here taking advantage of the free drinks

00:22:08,479 --> 00:22:12,979
you can call them up by name and get

00:22:10,339 --> 00:22:15,169
some help right away and also don't

00:22:12,979 --> 00:22:16,759
forget to tip really there's going to be

00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:18,889
a lot of us there they're going to get a

00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:20,479
tip but throwing in a little extra helps

00:22:18,889 --> 00:22:22,639
service industry tends to get really

00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:24,649
screwed by taxes and it's not a very

00:22:22,639 --> 00:22:26,269
nice thing but that's all I really had

00:22:24,649 --> 00:22:33,469
to say hopefully those tips work out for

00:22:26,269 --> 00:22:35,929
you thanks all right my name is jason

00:22:33,469 --> 00:22:37,639
clarke and i'm a ruby agent engineer at

00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:40,159
New Relic and I am going to show you

00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:43,849
today how to write a profiler in 50

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:46,279
lines of Ruby what is a profiler really

00:22:43,849 --> 00:22:48,799
quick on a profiler is an application or

00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:51,529
library that lets you get some insight

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,789
into what your code is doing it takes a

00:22:51,529 --> 00:22:54,500
look at what's running in your

00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:58,480
application gives you information

00:22:54,500 --> 00:23:01,250
that a lot of times we will take

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,320
profiles by instrumenting all of the

00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:05,510
methods or wrapping all of those method

00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,800
calls to see how long they're taking but

00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:08,660
that can be pretty heavy you run

00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,860
something like Ruby prophec and easily

00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:12,320
double the amount of time your

00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:15,020
application takes to actually run so

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,940
we're going to take a different slant on

00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:19,910
this we're going to take a sampling

00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:21,980
approach where instead of timing each of

00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:24,740
the method calls that we make we will

00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:26,270
instead take a peek every once in a

00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,950
while to see what the state of all of

00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:29,960
our stacks are and then use that

00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:33,200
information to try to give us a picture

00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:35,630
of what our application is doing so

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,000
let's imagine this is our appt just sort

00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:39,290
of a basic web stack where we call all

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,030
the way through our server through to

00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:42,920
our controller and down to our sequel

00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:47,150
and will represent that by that thin

00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:48,740
strip we go forward and we look at our

00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:51,020
application so the blue arrows are

00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:52,520
points in time you know our application

00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:55,070
continues running and things happen

00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:56,690
during the gaps but we take a peek at

00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:59,030
our app and the first time we see that

00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:01,100
we're running some sequel the next time

00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:04,280
we see that we're in our controller

00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:06,590
action a little more time passes we look

00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:08,210
again we're down in our sequel and the

00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:10,130
last time that we look we're also down

00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:12,950
executing sequel well what does this

00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:14,930
tell us this tells us the frequency with

00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:16,970
which we're seeing different parts of

00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:18,650
our code being executed and if you run

00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:20,810
this with enough samples over enough

00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:23,150
time it will build up a picture of

00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:24,470
what's going on in your application all

00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:28,370
right enough talking about what these

00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:31,910
things are let's build it the code that

00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:34,250
we need to execute for our profiler has

00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:35,600
to run next to our application code so

00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:37,490
we're going to spin this off into a

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,430
separate thread that's going to keep

00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:43,070
executing and running behind the scenes

00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:44,870
we have a loop that continues running

00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:46,520
and it's going to sleep periodically we

00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:49,280
don't want to consume all of the CPU

00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:51,860
while we're doing this so we have some

00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,360
flagging as well to let us decide

00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:55,820
whether we should continue going and

00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,340
then every so often we're going to wake

00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,840
up and we're going to take a sample

00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:02,420
that's the hard work in the heavy

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:05,390
lifting so what's it look like for us to

00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:06,920
actually take one of these samples it's

00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:08,130
a little this is the most complicated

00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,600
code that we're going to see

00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:12,120
but it's pretty simple once you break it

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,740
down the main thing here so we get a

00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,840
list of the running threads that are in

00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:19,530
our process we're going to iterate

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:21,720
through that list that we get once we

00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:23,790
get that particular thread then we can

00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,620
take a back trace on it now that back

00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:27,240
trace is going to have a series of lines

00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:29,670
those back trace is just like what you

00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,890
see like an exception message when your

00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:33,360
stack traces show in each of those lines

00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:38,010
represent a point that we're executing

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:39,300
in our code look something like this not

00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:41,190
the prettiest back trace that you've

00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,600
ever seen but it's an array of strings

00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:46,110
that we can break apart to get that

00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:47,520
information out so once we've gotten

00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:49,200
each of those lines than what we're

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,340
going to do for this sample is we're

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,080
just going to go through into a really

00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:54,240
basic count just look at each of those

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,410
lines and count up how many times we've

00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,420
seen it you can do a lot more

00:25:55,410 --> 00:26:00,390
complicated things but that'll that'll

00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:02,820
get us done first start so that calls is

00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:05,220
going to that calls variable is going to

00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:08,670
be a hash which we're going to key off

00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:12,360
of the line that we break out of that

00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:13,950
back trace the key for purposes of

00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:16,560
displaying we're actually going to break

00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:18,270
up with a regex it will be represented

00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:20,490
as an array with the different parts the

00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:22,590
file the method and the line number that

00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:25,050
we have but you could represent this as

00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:26,310
an object in any way that would really

00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:30,120
make sense for you to key the

00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:32,610
information or display it differently so

00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:34,290
with all that information with that hash

00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:36,120
of the different locations and the

00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:39,120
counts of times that we've seen it what

00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:41,730
can we get we can build something up

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,440
like this now there's a lot of noise and

00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:45,060
there's a lot of different levels you

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,250
know these stack traces get very deep

00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:49,290
it's you if you may have seen like in a

00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:51,000
rails app if you blow that out to the

00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:54,030
full profile you'll see you hundreds of

00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,920
lines worth of code but you can see down

00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:59,040
there at the bottom some of our code is

00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,750
executing at the DIY profiler lib that's

00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,760
actually the profiler watching itself

00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:04,800
running and every time it executes it

00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:07,320
notices that it's in the stack and sees

00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:09,000
itself running this is just the tip of

00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,650
the iceberg with the information from

00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,140
those back traces you can do things like

00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:15,000
building full call trees there represent

00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,590
the hierarchy of where things go all the

00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,070
information that you need is built into

00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:21,660
that model that you can pick up just

00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:22,040
from getting the back traces off of the

00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:25,340
running

00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:27,650
threads in a process code for this

00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:29,600
little sample that I made together is

00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:31,220
posted up on github and I'm also going

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:34,040
to be giving a longer version of this

00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:47,240
talk at Mountain West Ruby comp thank

00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:48,920
you okay so I'm going to try and do two

00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:51,980
things I'm going to plug in my computer

00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:54,710
after this real quick so I'm like more I

00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:56,750
do a project called mini test rails that

00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:59,780
enables mini test and means has spec

00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:00,710
within rails and I wanted to want to

00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,420
show a little bit the problem that we

00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:05,080
have within active support test case in

00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:08,090
rails 3 active support test case

00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:12,020
inherits from test unit test case which

00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:14,420
inherits for mini test test case on 1918

00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:16,190
still no problem what we want is we

00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:19,220
really want this guy to inherit from a

00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:21,530
test spec right we can't do that because

00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,330
of the inheritance and so I've done all

00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:27,260
sorts of terrible things to try and get

00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:30,080
that to work in rails for active support

00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:32,270
test case was going to inherit from any

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:36,160
test spec until dhh found out about it

00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:39,680
and changed it to go down to mini test

00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:41,060
test case right and there is the problem

00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,160
that there's a lot of features that

00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:45,470
people want in any test spec but because

00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:58,610
of the inheritance chain we can't get to

00:28:45,470 --> 00:29:00,850
it so with that said my computer will

00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,850
turn on

00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:15,510
all right oh wait that was wrong one is

00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:27,600
that right key to see that okay so this

00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:43,710
is a huh why isn't it why's that not

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:46,350
work all right just pretend that it

00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:48,000
works I want to show okay so we got a

00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:50,460
new version of any test that's going to

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,679
come out this is not quite out yet if we

00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:58,160
do that and it's so hard to do when

00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:58,160
you're going to do one handed hahaha

00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:04,200
alright so here's normal test and we

00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:06,270
want to show is this is coming mini test

00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,140
rails is going to change quickly what

00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:10,200
we're going to do is we're gonna be able

00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:13,110
to extend any mini test test case with

00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:16,620
the dsl and we can use all of this

00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:18,090
within any mini test test case that

00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:20,820
means that we can use this with in rails

00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:24,510
without dhh blocking it so that's all I

00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:30,510
want to show and this is all from Ryan

00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:39,660
Davis's work today and by my t-shirts at

00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:45,510
ruby threads com not close enough who

00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:47,610
can tell me what this means that's right

00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:50,010
and so we are nice so I actually think

00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:52,799
this is one of the the great tenants of

00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:56,940
the Ruby community and it's all because

00:30:52,799 --> 00:31:01,110
of this guy Matt's who released I know

00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:03,390
he's and uh you know 20 years ago he

00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:05,280
released a ruby and I think for a long

00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:06,600
time he you know just the community was

00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,820
small and people are interacting with

00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,880
him enough so that when people would

00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:13,409
kind of break out and start being a jerk

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,440
folks would point back and say Matt's is

00:31:13,409 --> 00:31:18,470
nice and so we are nice

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,970
and i think the Ruby community has

00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:23,090
gotten a little bit of a bad name and

00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:25,370
there's been some drama going on and I

00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:27,679
think a lot of people are thinking that

00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:30,230
Ruby is not so awesome anymore I

00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,570
disagree i think it is awesome i really

00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:35,629
like the community i think that we can

00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:38,779
also take steps to keep it awesome and

00:31:35,629 --> 00:31:41,629
make it awesomer and there's probably

00:31:38,779 --> 00:31:44,059
two ways of doing this the main one I

00:31:41,629 --> 00:31:47,450
can think of is building a community and

00:31:44,059 --> 00:31:50,120
it's a lot about small groups I helped

00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:52,129
found a little meetup that meets outside

00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:54,230
of Washington DC after a couple of us

00:31:52,129 --> 00:31:56,750
heard dr. Nick talk about how we need to

00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:59,929
start more meetups and that's been a

00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:01,789
fantastic success that we just have a

00:31:59,929 --> 00:32:04,879
bunch of great friends and we help

00:32:01,789 --> 00:32:08,240
people get into Ruby and keep Ruby

00:32:04,879 --> 00:32:10,909
awesome for them then the other what the

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:14,120
other side of that is to write nice code

00:32:10,909 --> 00:32:17,169
and not like the code is nice but like

00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:19,279
nice interacting with other people I

00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:21,799
think there's a couple of good examples

00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:24,169
of how to do this obvious ones are

00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:25,879
giving back to open source but i also

00:32:24,169 --> 00:32:29,240
think kind of at a lower level something

00:32:25,879 --> 00:32:31,250
like semantic versioning is amazingly

00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,799
nice when you can run bundle update and

00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:35,330
all the things don't break because you

00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:38,419
just did a greater than for your version

00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:41,240
numbers let's let's bind things to where

00:32:38,419 --> 00:32:43,240
they need to be version wise right get

00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:47,750
commit messages that aren't period or

00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:52,399
fix because that's not nice use things

00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:54,799
like namespaces and sensible ap is in

00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:58,039
the end let's let's keep minus-- wanna

00:32:54,799 --> 00:33:00,889
live and if you are interested in one of

00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:05,650
these really awesome 8-bit mats stickers

00:33:00,889 --> 00:33:10,550
i have i've left so come and find me

00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:11,990
so yeah anyways you have to come and

00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:15,320
find me sometime when I'm not standing

00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:30,500
on a podium all right thank you very

00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:37,870
much hello yellow learning and teaching

00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:37,870
Ruby is easy Ichigo goodbye

00:33:45,009 --> 00:33:48,879
listen to this

00:33:54,769 --> 00:34:07,460
okay you guys move this line II I speak

00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:22,919
ok so there are socially responsible

00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:27,030
from a movie boobies so we have the

00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:33,059
girls education it's only along the

00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:35,899
backside so visually impaired people

00:34:33,059 --> 00:34:39,770
does not want to pay them differently

00:34:35,899 --> 00:34:39,770
you want to be one of us

00:34:49,560 --> 00:35:41,040
then there's no business social life

00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:34,059
what of Queen Street taken for granted

00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:37,160
so draw a lot of speed reading

00:37:34,059 --> 00:37:40,450
applications where he goes you're the

00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:44,269
blame on Windows and on second and it's

00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:47,930
because the better ways and medication

00:37:44,269 --> 00:37:52,369
power accessibility and other voices in

00:37:47,930 --> 00:38:01,579
black saree and rubios less code so it

00:37:52,369 --> 00:38:04,119
is very easy to teach blinds fun the

00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:10,430
major problem while teaching them we

00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:15,079
realize that the error message now there

00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:20,059
is an exception image Ella very hard for

00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:24,289
them to understand and how many put

00:38:20,059 --> 00:38:28,039
multiple line code it's going to be off

00:38:24,289 --> 00:38:33,109
the screen so you know the better way

00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:36,200
and take a note you don't want to press

00:38:33,109 --> 00:38:44,329
take up a set amount they exist en grube

00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:46,490
than you it's taken with the boat so

00:38:44,329 --> 00:38:49,160
we're interested in between the error

00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:52,579
message or one if the position is

00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:55,210
considered lying like people you using

00:38:52,579 --> 00:38:55,210
this operation

00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,280
