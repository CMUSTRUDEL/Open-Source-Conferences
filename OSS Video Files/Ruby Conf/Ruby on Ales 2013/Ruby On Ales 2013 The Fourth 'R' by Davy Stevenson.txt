Title: Ruby On Ales 2013 The Fourth 'R' by Davy Stevenson
Publication date: 2020-01-28
Playlist: Ruby on Ales 2013
Description: 
	As technology continues to grow at an increasing rate, why is our educational system stuck in a pre-technology age? Why is programming rarely taught even at a High School level? Why do stereotypes of the isolated, nerdy programmer continue to linger, driving away smart, creative people from computer science degrees?

'The Three Rs' of Reading, Writing and Arithmetic have come to stand as the cornerstones of education in this country. We need to step into the 21st century and add a fourth R -- Programming. As a community of programmers and Ruby lovers, we should work to advocate Ruby as the fourth R.

This is not just an education problem. This is also a diversity problem, and even a technological advancement problem. Negative programming stereotypes drive away women and minorities. Difficulty finding programming talent hampers technological innovation and growth. The technology community has stood by for decades waiting for education to catch up -- instead, we need to be the catalyst of change within the system.

I want the flying cars I was promised, and teaching today's children programming from an early age is the fastest path to a Jetsons future.

you

00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,440
really glad to be here came to the

00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,970
conference last year it was great fun

00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,640
time and I'm really happy to be here

00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:31,330
this year as a speaker I mean be talking

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,550
to you guys today about programming and

00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:37,010
education and why we should care more as

00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:39,040
programmers about about what our

00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:43,820
education system is doing in terms of

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:47,150
Education and programming so I already

00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:48,680
got the introduction from Kobe thanks

00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:51,170
Coby and I'll tell a little bit more

00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,870
about elemental we do video transcoding

00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:55,280
software we have a cool demo over in the

00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,720
other room if you want to take a look

00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,750
where we have one of our live

00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:03,830
transcoding servers actually taking live

00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:06,650
Twitter feed from the official RB RB a3

00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:08,240
hashtag and embedding those tweets on

00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:15,140
live videos so if you want to check it

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:20,479
out go talk to some of the ROA thanks ro

00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:21,770
a three perfect I've got to get that one

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,290
right otherwise it would be no fun at

00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:26,360
all so yeah so we do video transcoding

00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:29,180
servers we have customers such as

00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,980
Comcast and HBO that use our our servers

00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:33,380
in their big data centers and the reason

00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:35,420
why we're here at ruby on Ailes is that

00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,250
we use rails to create the user

00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,710
interface for our servers so it's a

00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:41,000
pretty fun job I talked to many of us

00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:44,540
here if you're more interested in

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,270
learning more so I wanted to share with

00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:52,880
you a vision my vision of the future of

00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:54,440
Education so right now you're reading

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,770
writing and arithmetic or the three main

00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,450
core areas of the curriculum that we

00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:01,280
base our education system on here in the

00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:03,230
United States and I would like to see a

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,260
force added to that which is programming

00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:08,539
the fourth are and what would that look

00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,580
like and I just needs to start early in

00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:13,040
elementary school we need to start

00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:15,019
introducing kids to curriculum it's

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,060
based around learning about logic

00:02:15,019 --> 00:02:19,190
learning about problem solving this

00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,050
doesn't have to include computers or

00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:23,480
technology at this level we can it's

00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:25,040
just about how do you how do you teach

00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,650
children how to think how do you teach

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,290
children how to problem-solve and at the

00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:33,260
same time introduce them to a lot of

00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:34,730
hands-on activities fun ways to engage

00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,470
with computers in a way that much is

00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:39,230
playing games but learning how to

00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:40,939
control those games control the computer

00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,470
in ways that is engaging in fun and

00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:45,920
that's a appropriate level for

00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:48,650
elementary school students you know by

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,090
the time kids reach middle school kids

00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,849
should know how to write a basic program

00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:54,590
just like they can write a basic story

00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:55,879
kids should know how computers work just

00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,280
like they're learning how the world

00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:00,319
works and how biology works and you know

00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,609
how human body works they should be at

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,370
this point ready to learn about

00:03:01,609 --> 00:03:05,810
algorithms and data structures and have

00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:11,959
that as part of the curriculum alongside

00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:13,760
their math and science programs and by

00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:15,889
the time kids reach high school not

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,420
really kids anymore but they should have

00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:19,760
a choice to specialized high schools

00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,379
should provide more advanced programming

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,540
classes for the kids who are really

00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:27,310
really interested and wants to to go

00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:29,840
down once the STEM fields for careers

00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:31,549
for those that aren't interested there

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,340
can still be you know basic classes

00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:35,599
where they can still play around and

00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:39,500
learn a little bit more without being

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,790
quite as intensive so why do we want

00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,799
this what's the benefit that we are

00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:45,470
going to get as a society by introducing

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:50,000
programming much more integrated into

00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:51,530
the education curriculum if we if this

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,299
is the vision of our future that means

00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,500
that by the time someone graduates from

00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,419
high school they're going to have a core

00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,000
understanding about how computers work

00:03:56,419 --> 00:04:01,310
they're going to that's going to impact

00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,500
all industries not just those kids to

00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:06,190
decide to continue on in the STEM fields

00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:09,349
it means that people in all different

00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:12,109
careers and trajectories will understand

00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:13,790
how computers can help them at this

00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:16,669
point in time computers touch every

00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:20,269
single area of our society their

00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:22,610
unescapable people who are working in

00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:24,740
all these different areas first and how

00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:27,110
computers can help them have a vision of

00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:30,050
what they would need to create in order

00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,520
to make their jobs easier they have a

00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:33,500
core understanding of how computers work

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,639
and how programming works that's going

00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,639
to be a benefit for all of us

00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:44,639
education should like today at this

00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,550
point pretty much every school has a

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,440
computer lab that's having the tech in

00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,210
the school's not the problem it's how

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,940
what they're being used for the vast

00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:56,220
majority of computers are strictly used

00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:58,110
for research and essay writing and that

00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:01,110
is really not helping these kids

00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:02,460
understand anything about the behind the

00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:05,190
scenes of what these computers are

00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:09,539
capable of or how they might be able to

00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:12,599
take advantage of that when our kids

00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:15,750
first introduced to programming rarely

00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:18,720
before the high school level and even

00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:20,970
then most schools only have to you know

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,020
technology Trax they have the business

00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,660
track where you learn how to use

00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,580
software such as Word and Excel and then

00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,860
you have a track that may be teaching

00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,660
kids how to build together computers put

00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,300
together the components necessary to

00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:35,190
create a computer as far as actual

00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:39,300
programming classes true programming

00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:40,740
classes ten percent ten percent of

00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:45,930
schools in the United States teach

00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:47,880
programming is an actual class and I'd

00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,669
like you to think a little bit you know

00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,050
as far as the knowledge needed for a

00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:54,270
high school graduate what's going to be

00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,880
more important long-term the kid knows

00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:58,320
what a sign in a cosine is or if a kid

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,320
has understanding a little for in a

00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,639
while loop are you know there's vast

00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,289
majority of kids graduating from high

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:11,060
school don't understand what a for loop

00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:13,590
is or a while loop why is this and

00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,240
additionally a lot of the motivation

00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:17,340
that we are giving kids as to why they

00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,409
might want to learn how to program it

00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,180
surrounds money you know why should

00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:23,039
become a computer programmer well I hear

00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,740
that they make a lot of money is that

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:28,710
really a motivator for people not really

00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,940
for kids to get really interested in a

00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,659
topic then you have to have it be

00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,620
tangible I have to understand what what

00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:36,750
understand tangibly what that means for

00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,729
them and it has to be interesting they

00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,889
have to be introduced into in a way that

00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:45,419
that captures their interest and keeps

00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:47,450
their enthusiasm alive I'm going to talk

00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:50,190
a little bit about stereotypes so

00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:52,380
stereotypes are one way that the human

00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:53,730
bring collates information and puts it

00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:57,390
into bins so that you can very easily

00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:59,490
access it in a snap moment this is one

00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:01,680
reason why humans are so very very smart

00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:06,120
and so very very intelligent but it can

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:08,550
have a downside these stereotypes form

00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,950
very early studies show that kids as

00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,960
early as four or five you know exhibit

00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:15,480
very strongly the stereotypes present in

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,840
the culture around them however they are

00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:20,370
moldable these stereotypes are found the

00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,430
research shows that you can still alter

00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:25,920
kids perceptions of the of different

00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:27,600
people enough different the stereotypes

00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,030
around them until they're about eight or

00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:34,140
nine years old but after that it becomes

00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:35,850
much harder so what about the

00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:38,700
stereotypes surrounding engineering a

00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:40,920
lot of those stereotypes tie into a

00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,690
children's fear of math math is very

00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,610
hard and engineering is really really

00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,380
hard because as far as they know

00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,880
engineering and math or tied because

00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,350
they have never been told anything

00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,890
different they don't know what an

00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:54,840
engineer is there's also the stereotypes

00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:57,090
that that programmers have to be very

00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,520
very smart but they are nerdy they're

00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:04,080
uncool and that's often times that they

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:05,820
are men so I want to you to raise your

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,020
hand raise your hand if you had a

00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:11,190
computer in your house when you were

00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:12,900
five years old that's at least half the

00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:17,250
room what about by the time you were ten

00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:19,410
years old that's almost everyone in the

00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,810
room had a computer in their house when

00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:24,330
they were ten years old how about people

00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:27,870
who had the internet in there when they

00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:29,970
were growing up in their household again

00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:31,410
it's a little bit smaller mainly because

00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:34,260
some of us didn't have the internet

00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:35,250
around when we were kids but is still I

00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,020
mean it's still a really impressive

00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,430
percentage and we were talking forty

00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:43,469
fifty percent of the people in this room

00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:46,260
have the internet growing up so twenty

00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:48,540
percent twenty percent of households in

00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:52,650
this country don't have internet access

00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:54,930
even right now that's amazing and that's

00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:57,690
very highly correlated to income levels

00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,860
if you go to households they're under

00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,520
fifteen thousand dollars of year

00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,050
forty-three percent of them dunno

00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,820
have internet access and this is not

00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:05,980
even internet access at home this is

00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:09,340
internet access reliable internet access

00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:11,710
anywhere because I'm digital 9% only

00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,840
have internet access outside of their

00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:15,670
home this is where they have access to

00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,140
internet from their school from their

00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:20,160
job or their library but they don't have

00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:23,830
it at home so that means 29-percent

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,420
don't have internet and if you're kind

00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,160
of questioning this the one thing that

00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:30,610
the excuse a lot of this data is the

00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:32,860
fact that a large percentage of this are

00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:35,080
there are people the older generation so

00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:37,030
that does you the statistics a little

00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:40,300
bit I will fully admit but still

00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:43,300
impressive numbers so let's talk a

00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:46,480
little bit about correlations there's a

00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:48,910
strong correlation between people with

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,250
interest in the STEM fields and their

00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:54,250
access to technology and I think we just

00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:55,860
proved it here in this room by the Rays

00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,840
raising the hands of people who had

00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,880
computers when they were young and look

00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:05,470
at where you all are you're here at a

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:07,570
programming conference access tech

00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:10,150
technology is highly correlated to

00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:13,060
income and minority status so what does

00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:15,400
that mean you know that correlation I

00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:17,620
mean none of us are surprised to hear

00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:21,730
that there are not that many women and

00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:25,390
minorities intact wonder why so who

00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:29,440
cares why do we care about having you

00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:31,090
know having the the percentage of women

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,800
in the percent of minorities represented

00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:34,660
in programming it to be skewed why do we

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,360
really care is it because affirmative

00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:39,280
action is just good just by itself is it

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,310
because of a globalization threat are we

00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:45,520
scared about having engineers coming in

00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:46,960
from all over the world is it because of

00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,330
all these statistics the big companies

00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,930
like Google and Microsoft like to throw

00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:54,790
around about the dwindling workforce the

00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:56,740
increased demand of our careers and the

00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:58,870
reduced number of programmers available

00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:01,300
to fill them I don't think that's why we

00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:03,610
should care the reason why we should

00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:06,810
care is because we want to cultivate

00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:06,810
creativity in our society

00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,530
button so people that come from

00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:20,440
different backgrounds different

00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:22,300
socioeconomic status different minority

00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,370
groups different cultural backgrounds

00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,470
different gender these people all have

00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,970
different perspectives different

00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:29,050
objectives on life have different things

00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,550
that they think are important or

00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:33,220
interesting and that means they have

00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:35,770
different ideas we are a group of people

00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:38,310
that we never we don't build software in

00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:40,660
a vacuum we are building together

00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:44,860
components the other people have built

00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:47,830
to build something cool we are if we

00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:49,810
allow people with different ideas to

00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:51,280
create tools that we have would not even

00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:53,140
have thought of because they had a

00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,300
different background than us think about

00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:57,460
all the additional cool things that we

00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,680
can build by building off the cool

00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:01,360
things that they've built that's why we

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,690
should care and that's why it's

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,060
important for us and this allows us to

00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:09,400
all drive innovation together you know

00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,840
how much how many more cool websites are

00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,970
cool technologies could we build if

00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,230
people were coming up with with new

00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,790
technologies that they think we're cool

00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:21,100
and we're hacking on things just because

00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:25,030
they were interested in it so how do we

00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:26,890
break these stereotypes as I mentioned

00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:29,890
earlier the window of opportunity to

00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:32,170
really modify kids's opinions and

00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:34,150
stereotypes is focused on early

00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:37,540
education we need to engage these kids

00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:39,430
early and one of the best ways to do

00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:42,340
that is with hands-on activities to be

00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:44,140
able to show them really easily how they

00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:46,810
can manipulate a computer and how they

00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:49,840
can control a computer to do what they

00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:51,760
want it to do shown the collaboration

00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,800
works much better than then strict

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,940
competition putting kids together in

00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,130
teams and having them work together

00:12:54,940 --> 00:13:00,730
towards a common goal that's a pretty

00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:02,170
good job of fostering enthusiasm other

00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,550
important thing is for these kids to

00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:05,290
have role models that look like them

00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:08,470
they need to have the women role models

00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:10,180
they need to have the role models that

00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:12,490
have the same color of skin as them if

00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:17,380
that helps them correlate the fact that

00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:18,910
you know I could do that too and the

00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:22,300
other thing that we could focus on is

00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:23,890
teacher awareness you know kids know

00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,660
what firefighters do they know what

00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,980
doctors do they know what lawyers do

00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,570
they don't know what computer

00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,770
programmers do and I think that's

00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:32,410
partially because I don't think teachers

00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:35,080
know what computer programmers do if we

00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,760
if we teachers if we're engaging with

00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,130
teachers to increase the awareness of

00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,200
what we actually do what programmers do

00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:43,210
what software engineers do what

00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,250
electrical engineers do so they can talk

00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:48,750
about that in a tangible way with kids

00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:51,070
that can go really far just by itself

00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:53,260
it's also shown that if you introduce

00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:55,540
technology to girls in an all-girls

00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:58,420
group that tends to be more successful

00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:01,150
than if it's a intersperse gender group

00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,800
and I would probably think that the same

00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:05,080
might be true for minority groups as

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,440
well I think there's less research to

00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:10,480
back that up at this time so I'll

00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,730
highlight one example that I know about

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,920
this program that's done in the Portland

00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:17,310
area called chess for success and this

00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:20,890
is an after-school program that helps

00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:22,120
connect kids with learning how to play

00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:24,850
chess and these are elementary school

00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,430
and middle school age kids and this is a

00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:30,250
program that's been studied to see the

00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:32,590
impact on on the actual academic

00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:34,330
performance of these kids you know why

00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:36,100
is just important because it's still

00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:37,510
problem solving and that's one of the

00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,940
main things that we want to teach kids

00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:42,910
from an early age is how to solve

00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:45,130
problems and chest so that very well so

00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:47,950
what did they find well initially these

00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:49,390
this is focused on low-income schools so

00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:53,350
they're focusing this program on schools

00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:55,270
with limited resources already so they

00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:58,350
found that this not only improved the

00:14:55,270 --> 00:15:00,790
kids academic success within the math

00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:03,760
programs but also with reading which I

00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:06,040
think was kind of surprising and also

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,140
they found it was very good at engaging

00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,610
girls mainly because of the

00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:16,330
collaborative nature of the program

00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:18,460
itself so why us why should I be talking

00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:21,550
to a group of programmers about about

00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:23,770
this topic and the answer is because we

00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:26,230
have the knowledge we have that

00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:28,780
information about about the technology

00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:30,910
we can put can make computers do what we

00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:33,940
want them to do in ways the teachers

00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:35,320
cannot and then the other main goal is

00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,830
the teachers are there to cultivate

00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,390
environment

00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:40,090
they are not there to disseminate

00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:41,560
information if that was it was easy as

00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,670
just giving kids information than we

00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,810
would just hand them books of

00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,670
information and they would learn from

00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:47,370
that teachers are there to cultivate the

00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:49,540
environment culty cultivate the

00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:55,420
creativity of the kids and keep their

00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:56,710
enthusiasm high and one went good way to

00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,140
do that with technologies to engage

00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:02,590
their curiosity and I think that as a

00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:04,720
group we are primed to engage these kids

00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:07,120
crop curiosity because why else are we

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,280
here at a conference why else do we work

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,920
on open source projects but besides the

00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:14,280
fact that we ourselves are curious and

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,800
we engage our own curiosity continually

00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:21,190
outside of work to work on these these

00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:23,530
problems and we can channel this this

00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:26,970
passion in this activity to also help

00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:29,920
engage the curiosity of children and

00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:31,330
here is also thrive on problems the best

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,190
way to get something fixed is the moan

00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:35,200
loudly about the problem in your child

00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:36,970
five engineers pretty soon they're going

00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:40,420
to be jacking against each others trying

00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:44,590
to fix it so this is my challenge to you

00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:48,790
this is a problem that we have we have

00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:52,000
the tools to fix this and at the end of

00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:54,730
the day we have the power to improve

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,170
society around us we're in the unique

00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:59,380
position with our knowledge and our

00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:01,600
skills and our influence to drastically

00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:05,680
alter the future of our society in the

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:10,449
future of technology and innovation so

00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:14,050
why Ruby when introducing kids to

00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:16,570
programming syntax matters the instant

00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:20,860
the kid has to struggle over a compiler

00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:22,270
struggle over missing semicolon the

00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,850
instant that a curly braces in the wrong

00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:26,230
location or they didn't put a

00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:28,030
parenthesis in the right place these

00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:29,800
magical characters they don't understand

00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:32,230
why they needed to be there the instant

00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,030
that happens their frustration kills

00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:35,020
their enthusiasm and that's the point in

00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,670
time when you're going to lose these

00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:39,660
kids forever and they're going to think

00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:42,040
the programming is just a waste of time

00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,180
the whole point about teaching kids

00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,860
programming is to focus on the

00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:47,080
algorithms and the logic you know the

00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:48,270
exact characters in the exact order that

00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,520
they are on the

00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:52,890
the screen is not does not matter to

00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,840
these kids what matters is that they're

00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:58,560
learning but they're being able to to

00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,940
put their their ideas onto a screen in a

00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,770
way that a computer can understand it

00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,390
they can formulate that logic create

00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:07,530
that algorithm to solve the problems

00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:09,660
they want to solve and guess what the

00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:11,330
reason we love Ruby the reason it's

00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:13,980
beautiful syntax and its readability

00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:16,110
that is exactly the same sort of thing

00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:20,670
that's going to keep kids engaged and

00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:22,260
not drive them away and look at this if

00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:23,580
you were eight or ten years old and

00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,900
you're expected to write every single

00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,730
one of those characters in the exact

00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,880
right order and if you miss one of them

00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,840
you get ridiculous for what horrible

00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:36,300
error messages that you didn't

00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:38,640
understand that seems hard object

00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:40,560
oriented Java is my first language

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,030
there's so much typing so many

00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,680
characters every single one of them is

00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:45,870
important and for a kid that's just

00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:48,930
trying to figure out how to formulate

00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:50,610
their thoughts that's a turnoff and of

00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:52,680
course Ruby's not the only one there's

00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:55,170
many other languages that can offer

00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:57,540
similar benefits and I'm going to leave

00:18:55,170 --> 00:19:00,090
the religious wars on whether having a

00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:02,250
white space or having to type the extra

00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:07,590
ends is worth it or not to a later time

00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:09,300
I just want people to get excited okay

00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:11,310
so hopefully you guys are all excited

00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:13,230
about this you want to know how you can

00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:16,140
help and it doesn't have to be news

00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:17,340
doesn't take a lot of time or energy if

00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,230
there's nothing else but you take away

00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:22,260
from my talk I want you guys to be a

00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:23,820
proponent of introducing more

00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:28,200
programming based curriculum into

00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:30,690
education programming is fun we all know

00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:34,290
program is fun why is it a secret why do

00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:37,710
kids not know how much fun it is to make

00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:40,050
a computer bend to your will I think we

00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:42,540
should share that with everyone we

00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:44,340
should speak out a lot of us our parents

00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:46,530
speak out when you're talking to your

00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:48,240
teachers speak out at PTA meetings talk

00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,890
to when you're speaking a talking with

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,740
friends about education speak out

00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:54,840
support reform support things that make

00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:57,480
it easier for schools themselves to pull

00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,590
in the the resources and change the

00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,860
curriculum to meet these needs

00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:07,320
themselves and also speak out

00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:09,179
with your here with your vote speak out

00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,940
in all these different ways and you can

00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:12,929
also there's other ways and we these are

00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,940
these things that we're already good at

00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:16,110
providing space providing tools we

00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:19,080
already know how to do that to support

00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:20,940
our user groups why not also provide the

00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:25,650
same opportunities for groups out there

00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:29,480
already that are working on this so now

00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:31,590
you've done that what if you want more

00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,120
the next step could be to become a

00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:34,200
mentor there's a lot of different ways

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,270
you can do that there after school

00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,919
groups like the chest for success there

00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:39,450
are summer camps and this doesn't even

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,340
have to take a lot of time you can come

00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:43,770
in as a distinguished speaker for an

00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:47,190
afternoon at a summer camp and show kids

00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:48,720
you know give a talk or you can go try

00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:50,040
to go inside the classroom this one can

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,990
always be a little bit harder you have

00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,309
to contact usually each school one by

00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:55,290
one to see if they have some sort of

00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:57,660
program or reach out to a teacher to see

00:20:55,290 --> 00:21:00,540
if you can if they can get you in on the

00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:02,520
curriculum but it can be done and what's

00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:04,559
the benefit of that this is a way to get

00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:07,020
direct impact with the kids and this is

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:10,559
where you are measurably impacting kids

00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:13,080
is lives however the hoff scaling issues

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:15,120
and locality issues there's only so many

00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,770
kids that you can provide direct

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,450
assistance with and obviously it's going

00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:20,120
to be hard to impact a kid's life if

00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:23,330
they live in a different area than you

00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:27,720
so next step is to teach the teachers

00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:29,850
drawing things out a little bit making

00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,410
so you're you're you're in knowledge

00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,910
transfer is going to the people that

00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:37,110
thing can transfer that knowledge into a

00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:38,640
wider base of kids maybe you're not a

00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:40,049
teacher you know a lot of us aren't

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,190
we're not in programming because we're

00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:45,840
super social people that's okay too

00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:48,059
because the next thing that that we

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,830
really need is to build tools you know

00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:52,230
as I said before our schools have the

00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:55,410
computers already it's just really hard

00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:57,330
for teachers to have the tools to

00:21:55,410 --> 00:22:01,080
actually teach kids something with them

00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:02,340
and guess what there's no denial now we

00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,020
all know that you guys have the skills

00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:06,270
and the time to be building tools

00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:10,110
contributing to open source projects

00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:14,250
that are focusing on this topic and it's

00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:15,270
also it's interesting you is a very dry

00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,430
way of doing things

00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:21,660
it's a way to impact people all over the

00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:24,420
world with very simple minimal time

00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:26,640
effort from your part it's also a

00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:28,800
multi-threaded you know your work do

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,120
want work once have it run in parallel

00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:36,090
all over the place we like these things

00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:38,280
what sort of things people focus on now

00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:41,040
make it easy for kids to to play games

00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,420
or create puzzles the other way to do it

00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,160
would be to create podcasts or

00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:46,530
screencasts this could be either aimed

00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:49,830
directly at kids or something to teach

00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:51,390
the teachers how to use these tools we

00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:54,750
need some more poignant guides to get

00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:56,190
people really excited about things and

00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:58,920
there's a lot of puzzles out there that

00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:00,630
really just need implementation in a lot

00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:03,240
of these these frameworks that are

00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:04,710
already out there could teach kids how

00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,440
to write a program that solves towers of

00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:09,390
Hanoi teach a kid how to program a

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,990
computer to create a peanut butter and

00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:15,180
jelly sandwich teach kids how to you

00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:16,830
know something about a cryptography by

00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:18,270
showing them how they can send secret

00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:20,700
messages to their friends the only their

00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:24,030
friends can read I think that's engaging

00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:25,770
I think that's engaging also something

00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:27,810
simple have the kids create a simple

00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:30,510
Facebook for their friends you know

00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:33,240
implement the the parts of that website

00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:37,050
that that they're most interested in a

00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:39,240
much more pared down way and there's

00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:41,190
tools already out there that you can

00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:45,900
easily start contributing to immediately

00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:46,950
like kids Ruby and Hackney hack I just

00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,870
discovered this which I thought was

00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:51,180
super cool you can actually mod

00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:52,890
minecraft using JRuby and Ruby bucket

00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:55,320
don't you think kids would be super

00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,670
excited if they were able to write up

00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,440
programs that allowed them to have

00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:00,510
whatever powers they wanted in Minecraft

00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:04,710
I might just do that when I go home just

00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:06,930
for myself and I'm not the only person

00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:09,630
who's thinking about this I had the good

00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:12,420
fortune of having co.org launch weeks

00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:15,270
before my talk so I got to completely

00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:16,680
redo the ends to incorporate this in and

00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:18,630
if you're interested in this and you

00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:20,640
want to find resources well guess what

00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:25,830
this website has all the resources you

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:28,680
need to give you links to how you can be

00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:29,170
involved by teaching or by other ways of

00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,480
helping

00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:33,460
tributing two other other activities

00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:37,020
this is you know spans all sorts of

00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:40,110
languages and topics so it's pretty fun

00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:42,910
and it's getting some big-name backers

00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:46,560
to understands the importance of having

00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:48,880
our society understand computers more

00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50,950
some people in our own community are

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,090
going to benefit out of this hopefully

00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:55,470
it will get a little bit more impact

00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,470
towards hackney hack and kids Ruby

00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:00,820
people are becoming more aware of the

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:08,140
fact that programming is very limited in

00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:10,090
our school districts and people are

00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,890
becoming more aware that in order to

00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:14,110
teach kids how to break down problems

00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:17,200
teach em how to program is a great way

00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:19,450
to do and hopefully with some of this

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,400
awareness we can get some feedback on

00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,990
how easy it is to actually install these

00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,840
tools and get get things up and running

00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:31,270
so that we can see how quickly it takes

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:33,520
two to get kids actually involved so at

00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:35,560
this point it's up to you guys stuff to

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,450
all of us to make this change ourselves

00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,280
if we want it the education system

00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:41,110
doesn't have the knowledge or the skills

00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,520
to make a change themselves if this is

00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:45,100
going to happen if I've got to come from

00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:48,190
us and so that's why i'm here asking you

00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:49,990
