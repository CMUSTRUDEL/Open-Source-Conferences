Title: Ruby On Ales 2013 The History of Women in Programming
Publication date: 2020-01-28
Playlist: Ruby on Ales 2013
Description: 
	By Jessica Suttles and Elise Worthy

Computer science was dominated by women until the 1970's. Women like Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper paved the way for technical professions today. We'll cover the history of women in computing, possible causes of the gender shift, and ideas for how our community can shape the future.

so before we get started this is total

00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:37,059
serendipity today is International

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:41,070
Women's Day and we'll just get right

00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:43,059
into interest my name is Elise worthy I

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,680
am from Seattle

00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:49,930
live in Portland and I'm moving back to

00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:53,290
Seattle in one week today is actually my

00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:55,350
last day that LivingSocial um I was part

00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:59,140
of the hungry Academy program with

00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,550
scheffler who presented yesterday it was

00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,680
an amazing program

00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:09,430
five months of intense developer

00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:11,140
training and but I decided to take the

00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:15,850
next six months off to focus on my

00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:18,070
health since the beginning of my life

00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:20,649
I've always focused on brain endeavors

00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:29,740
not body endeavor so I'm really excited

00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:31,360
to see what I can do a clinically hi my

00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,880
name is Jesse Allen Suttles

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,690
the face that I use on the internet and

00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:40,530
I tweet at KL settles I live in Santa

00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:44,460
Monica California or Los Angeles

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:47,000
and with my two cats Wabi and sabi and i

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:51,450
really love being a software engineer

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,680
and i'm currently employed at g5 here in

00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,760
Bend Oregon I work remotely from LA and

00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,350
the most exciting thing I've done there

00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,590
lately is I started writing at

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,729
microformats to processors repressor if

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,020
you don't know what micro formats are

00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:07,020
you should look them up they're

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:12,959
essentially HTML classes that add more

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:15,200
semantics to your markup okay so we'll

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,970
get started

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,560
I'm going to talk about the history well

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:23,070
desiccants thing to talk about more

00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:26,130
recent history and the future of women

00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:28,320
in computing the one point that I want

00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,970
to drive in this today is that women

00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,610
make programming what it is today

00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:36,840
regardless of what you know about

00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:40,080
programming women had not been there we

00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,510
would not be programming at Murphy's and

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,360
they see that in the face of serious

00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:48,989
inequities socially culturally

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:53,340
particularly in the United States so

00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:58,980
that's my one takeaway hopefully some of

00:02:53,340 --> 00:03:09,870
you watching boy I will be your your

00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:11,880
doctor Peabody Sherman so we're gonna

00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:18,650
hop in the Wayback Machine and go way

00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:22,590
way back to 1800s a computing has pretty

00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:24,360
pretty simple roots this is a bloom and

00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:28,530
if you can imagine living in the early

00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:32,820
1800s most of your needs were pretty

00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:36,060
basic so technology was pretty basic to

00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:39,000
the first real punch card computer was a

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,820
jacquard loom and it was made in 1801

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,980
and it brought in the idea of a punch

00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:47,250
card now this was very very simple there

00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,170
was no additional logic or anything

00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:52,970
related

00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:59,030
it just guided the loom to do different

00:03:52,970 --> 00:04:01,310
patterns but in the 1830s dot loom IDs

00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,680
with punch cards was adapted to the

00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:05,120
analytical engine

00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,890
now the analytical engine was never

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:12,680
completed and at the time it was only a

00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:15,290
theoretical idea but some of you

00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,419
hopefully know if Ada Lovelace she was

00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:20,230
one of the programmers on the analytical

00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:24,410
engine along with its primary designer

00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:28,130
Charles Babbage now ADA is incredibly

00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:32,150
important because interrupts the first

00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:35,240
program the first program I mean this is

00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:39,850
huge so the analytical engine although

00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,850
it was just just an idea at the time

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:49,910
brought on the first programmer um now I

00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:52,850
really like the story of ADA ADA uh was

00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:55,550
the daughter of Lord Byron if anyone is

00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:58,640
into poetry you know that Lord Byron if

00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:01,640
they Pacheco a famous early 1800's poets

00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:04,040
and I just loved that he wrote all about

00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:06,860
emotion and stuff about the heart and

00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:09,260
then his daughter is an awesome

00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:15,770
brilliant mathematician and magician of

00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:23,450
course he did not he didn't stay with it

00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:26,060
as some of the potato was a pretty saucy

00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:29,240
character I said that the analytical

00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:31,520
engine was not conceded in its time that

00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,120
was because they ran out of money so Ava

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,850
and Charles were really entrepreneurial

00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:42,260
and their startup just ran out of funds

00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:44,570
um what I love about Ada and Charles is

00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:46,820
that to fund the project

00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:50,300
they decided since they were so

00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:52,290
brilliant to go and try their luck at

00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:56,880
the horse races

00:05:52,290 --> 00:06:02,580
and they lost all their money that's why

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:04,080
that's why I be in London and they don't

00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:09,480
even have the lights on all of her

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:14,550
jewelry and so not only was she the

00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:18,510
first programmer she was she was taking

00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:21,000
I didn't mention the animal analytical

00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:23,610
engine was Turing them we had integrated

00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:29,160
memory this was really advanced at first

00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:32,660
time um unfortunately computing didn't

00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:35,040
progress that quickly it was mostly

00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:37,230
innovation due to the Industrial

00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,530
Revolution with industrial applications

00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:43,560
like we saw with the jacquard loom um

00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:47,640
but things started picking up for women

00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:52,290
and for computing in the early and

00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:53,910
middle 1920 in the 1920s hopefully

00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:58,170
you've all heard of the women's suffrage

00:06:53,910 --> 00:07:00,210
movement imagine that women in the

00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:02,820
United States couldn't vote until the

00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:06,180
nineteen twenties so imagine our

00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:09,240
position related to technology and

00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:12,630
innovation so just voting rights and

00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:17,580
property rights were very limited to

00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:19,650
women at that time so computing though

00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:24,000
really picked up against in the United

00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:25,770
States in the 1940s and something that I

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,780
don't really like but it's just part of

00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:30,680
our history is the reason it really got

00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:33,840
pushed or booth because of World War two

00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:36,000
before World War two in World War one

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,960
particularly we still use very

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,090
old-school on-the-ground military

00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:46,380
techniques but in World War two we have

00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:49,890
the technology to further our military

00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:53,310
goals so I'm not happy about that but

00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:56,400
that's that's just history um also

00:07:53,310 --> 00:08:00,350
particular to women around world war two

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,190
was that World War two called in

00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:06,150
majority of

00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:11,340
for active service so if you if you know

00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:13,170
rosie the riveter in 1942 there was a

00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:16,260
program called women accepted for

00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:18,080
volunteer emergency service and it meant

00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:20,970
that women could come in and film

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,220
traditional men's jobs in the forties

00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:26,820
even if you were a highly educated women

00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:29,070
like you had a doctorate in physics or

00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:31,350
math the best you could think of doing

00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:33,720
was maybe a professor position of our

00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:35,729
teacher most women health secretary

00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,760
physicians they didn't they didn't have

00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:40,950
a lot of options so in some ways this

00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,349
was that it was a great leap forward for

00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:48,840
women and their ability to do different

00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:52,220
kinds of work so there are lots of

00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:57,890
advertisements for women do a man's work

00:08:52,220 --> 00:09:01,770
and so particularly this was related to

00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:04,470
service for the military among the women

00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:07,560
that were brought on for waves the

00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:10,200
voluntary emergency service were some of

00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,810
the first computer and the computers

00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:17,490
weren't physical machines they were

00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:21,570
people the first six programmers of the

00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:23,550
ENIAC were hired by the Navy as physical

00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:29,550
computers there were mathematicians but

00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:32,490
then came on to work I think if you

00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,480
remember one person for my talk I hope

00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:36,210
it's Grace Hopper

00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:41,190
Grace Hopper was one of the women that

00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:46,260
was involved in the women in voluntary

00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:49,080
service movement of she was a PhD in

00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:52,320
math and physics at Vassar and a

00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:55,410
professor there so she decided that the

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:58,350
tenured professor track was really

00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:00,930
boring she was kind of a crazy

00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,920
insubordinate kind of person and so she

00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:05,690
decided to

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:09,389
joining in the military and help out

00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:14,040
yeah so yeah I guess that that's kind of

00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:16,230
vague oxymoron right but the cool thing

00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:19,230
one of the cool things about grace is

00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:21,149
because she was so well educated when

00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:25,170
she joined the military she was higher

00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:28,290
up in rank and some people have proposed

00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:32,579
that she because the military has a

00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:37,110
rigid protocol related to rank that she

00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:39,870
faced slightly left insubordination and

00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,839
sexism because of her high rank coming

00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:44,130
in so I thought that was kind of cool

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,730
regardless of your opinion of the

00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:49,769
military um so most of the stuff that

00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:53,430
grace is that I find really interesting

00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:55,829
was actually post-war grace decided that

00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:57,540
she didn't want to go back to NASA and

00:10:55,829 --> 00:11:00,240
teach that she would stay in the

00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:03,510
military and this was a really crazy

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,850
move for post-war demobilization

00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:07,800
everyone was encouraging women to go

00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:13,110
back to their old positions men would

00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:16,620
fill but she said no up I'm gonna

00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:21,440
stay in the military and she stayed in

00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,440
and started the Harvard computation lab

00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:30,360
military after Harvard

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:32,690
she went to Remington Rand which is sort

00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,670
of just this old-school American

00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:40,260
manufacturing company but they did the

00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:43,769
UNIVAC they also manufacture guns and

00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:46,910
typewriters and shavers just kind of a

00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:46,910
good old American

00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:54,790
but while she was there grace grace is

00:11:52,690 --> 00:12:00,640
really incredible she became the

00:11:54,790 --> 00:12:04,660
director of automated computing and she

00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:11,980
wrote the first compiler the first

00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:16,230
compiler imagine being in Grace's

00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:19,390
division in the nineteen 1950s where

00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:21,610
basically all the programmers think that

00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:23,140
computers are just big calculators

00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:26,980
you're only gonna write a machine code

00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:28,990
and she's like no way I I think we can

00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,880
be way more efficient I think we can do

00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:33,430
these really incredible things with

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,400
computers she she got a lot of

00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:40,480
resistance but finally push that idea

00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:44,740
forward you also might have heard of her

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:47,650
as the mother of COBOL in her position

00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:50,170
at Remington ranch she wrote some of the

00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:54,210
precursors to COBOL and was one of the

00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:56,530
mean people involved in COBOL so again

00:12:54,210 --> 00:13:07,840
she wrote one of the first high-level

00:12:56,530 --> 00:13:10,420
languages obviously Fortran and lists

00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:12,100
where were put out around the same time

00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:18,330
but it was only in like the same

00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:18,330
three-year period innovative leap from

00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,990
then I found this this really

00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:29,830
interesting piece of data even out of

00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:33,870
the late 1990s 80% of all code was

00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:33,870
written in COBOL even

00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:44,290
I don't have any 50% of new apps were

00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:47,230
written COBOL and 95% of Finance data

00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:50,500
was annual which is kind of like the y2k

00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:55,390
issue but I mean this is pretty

00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:55,870
incredible forty years later still

00:13:55,390 --> 00:14:01,810
around

00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:05,830
cool so imagine that here's some family

00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:08,620
code for a hello world imagine being in

00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:11,260
this situation

00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:14,050
I mean imagine that if someone hasn't

00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:16,870
made that dramatic leap we can still be

00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:20,920
writing this and here is that in COBOL

00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:24,700
so imagine going from just really really

00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:32,710
a machine code to to such a big leap and

00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:35,320
then of course now but it wasn't all

00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:40,180
sunshine and roses these women really

00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:44,050
faced incredible problems in their in

00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:49,570
their careers in the 1950s in particular

00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:51,580
I found this ad for a Remington and this

00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:56,529
was the company that grace was a

00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:59,320
director at can you imagine what what

00:14:56,529 --> 00:15:03,570
kind of hardship she faced given the

00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:08,470
idea of what women should do at the time

00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:14,459
and then here's another ad from IBM

00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:30,009
around the same time picture

00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:33,269
and are you live or not um things might

00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:36,250
have turned up a little bit in the 1960s

00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:45,629
we started getting engaged in the space

00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:48,279
race in the late 1960s there were a lot

00:15:45,629 --> 00:15:50,350
again there was a manpower shortage so

00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:53,589
women have had the opportunity to do

00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:55,689
different types of things jobs for

00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:57,610
everyone you know we're gonna beat the

00:15:55,689 --> 00:16:00,879
Russians we're gonna we're gonna go into

00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:04,569
space there was a huge focus on science

00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:09,430
and technology so there were more

00:16:04,569 --> 00:16:13,750
opportunities for women sort of this

00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:16,180
article was in Cosmo in the late 1960s

00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:20,079
and if you if you read it you can find

00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:23,290
it online and if so it's repulsive but

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:26,529
it really it really explains the time it

00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:29,949
says that you should you should consider

00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:32,439
computer programming as a and the jobs

00:16:29,949 --> 00:16:42,220
because it's just like planning a dinner

00:16:32,439 --> 00:16:46,420
parties actually Grace Hopper but yeah I

00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:48,699
mean if that's what you have to say so

00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:51,880
it was a really crappy time however they

00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:57,100
were I mean women were sort of

00:16:51,880 --> 00:17:01,269
encouraged to come in but what really

00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:04,839
happened was that the programmers for

00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:07,390
almost all men they sat in an upper

00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:09,520
level story of the office building wrote

00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:12,010
their throw their programs and then once

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,920
a day someone would wheel a cart down

00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:16,050
with all their handwritten

00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:19,800
and the woman would have to keep punch

00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:23,400
them in the computer and so this is this

00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:26,700
is a picture of key punch girls down in

00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:30,030
a basement just basically doing this

00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:32,700
secretarial and data entry work so not

00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:36,480
exactly the environment that I would

00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:40,080
like to be in but things started to

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:43,860
change and jessica is going to talk

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:48,290
about how those things changed but with

00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:48,290
the women's liberation or second wave

00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:57,150
with the second wave of feminism women

00:17:53,940 --> 00:18:01,440
started speaking out against free

00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:04,890
product limited reproductive rights job

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,080
issues family issues all those embedded

00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:11,220
cultural expectations that were just

00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:14,450
pretty yucky and so in the 1970s I'll

00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,450
pass it over to Jessica

00:18:23,639 --> 00:18:29,049
realize that I forgot to mention during

00:18:25,869 --> 00:18:31,979
the intro that g5 is hiring solely for

00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:31,979
something new

00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:42,879
so it's 1970s the wave of feminine time

00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:47,049
really took hold it started in the

00:18:42,879 --> 00:18:52,029
sixties and women started to eat a lot

00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:53,710
of right the seventies marked the 50th

00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:57,129
anniversary of the women's suffrage

00:18:53,710 --> 00:19:00,519
movement in the passage of the 19th

00:18:57,129 --> 00:19:02,559
amendment the Equal Rights Amendment was

00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:04,419
designed to further those rights and

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,769
have passed in both houses of Congress

00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:08,589
and it went on to States for

00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:10,889
ratification the Supreme Court also

00:19:08,589 --> 00:19:14,679
ruled on Roe vs. Wade and

00:19:10,889 --> 00:19:17,529
constitutionalized abortion so some of

00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:19,659
these is pretty awesome for women and

00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:22,419
this crowd was going to be a reoccurring

00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:26,259
theme in my talk I'm already a bore as

00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:28,059
time goes on but basically um tons of

00:19:26,259 --> 00:19:29,620
women earning bachelor's degrees

00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:34,299
selectively

00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:37,330
mostly STEM fields so the very bottom

00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:38,890
line there is engineering above that we

00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:41,020
have physics and the line that we really

00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:43,510
care about is that green - one which is

00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:45,159
computer science and you can tell if

00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,299
there is an upward trend in all these

00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:49,450
lines during this period

00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:52,090
Luco this is the big part thanks to the

00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:54,100
feminist movement an increased woman's

00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:55,659
awareness that they wanted to have a

00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,279
professional career and that they could

00:19:55,659 --> 00:20:01,480
do it in these traditionally

00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:03,279
male-dominated field computer science

00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,230
was very new and exciting at this time

00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:08,100
so you can tell it kind of like shoots

00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:10,539
up a little higher than the other ones

00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:13,029
the foreman of this time was Adela

00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:15,760
Goldberg she was a researcher at Xerox

00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:20,200
PARC and she played an instrumental role

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:22,630
in defining small talk earlier Evon

00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:25,950
light said that Alan Kay develop small

00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:28,210
talk that was really a team effort and

00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:31,120
Goldberg was very instrumental on that

00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:33,309
it's an object oriented a dynamic

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:37,750
reflective language which might sound

00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:39,460
familiar like language we use today in

00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:47,200
case you don't believe me here's a quote

00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:50,320
from that saying also small talk really

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:53,919
paved the way for GUI interfaces a lot

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:56,260
of the things they developed with later

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:59,919
be seen in Mac apps because Steve Jobs

00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:01,899
got a tour of Xerox PARC got a little

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:06,159
first glimpse at what Smalltalk was

00:21:01,899 --> 00:21:08,309
doing but personal computing wasn't

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,309
really

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,300
here's we're still expensive and most

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,460
people interacted with computers through

00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:18,640
arcade games this was the Golden Age of

00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:21,280
arcade game and I'm sure you remember

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:27,160
clone well there are really great games

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:30,490
like asteroids River Basin meters and

00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:32,200
then came the 1980 unfortunately some

00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:34,660
ground that was gained from this

00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,550
movement was lost in the eighties the

00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:38,500
Equal Rights Amendment that had passed

00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:40,900
in both houses of Congress failed to be

00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:43,630
ratified by the state by the deadline so

00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:47,080
that never ends up passing but women did

00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:50,050
continue to enter the workforce and

00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:52,840
undergraduate programs interestingly

00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:54,190
they also start to disassociate results

00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,560
from their marital status with their

00:21:54,190 --> 00:22:01,270
name they started keeping their maiden

00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:06,160
name and they also started using is the

00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:07,720
Mrs or miss and also Sandra Day O'Connor

00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,420
was the first woman appointed to the

00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,610
Supreme Court ladies in personal

00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:18,790
computing really took off you guys might

00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:21,040
remember in the Commodore 64 in the

00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:23,410
first half of the 80s continues

00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:27,040
theorized in all these fields where

00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:29,080
women are entering these fields often he

00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:31,570
woman of the time is Elizabeth mindler

00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:35,290
shorts an information scientist at the

00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:37,420
Stanford Research Institute and her and

00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:41,550
her group helped define these top-level

00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:45,340
domain names of the internet.com gorg

00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:47,380
and you remember at Dell Goldberg she

00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:51,760
served as the president of the ECM

00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:54,760
during this time but then something

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,070
happens you'll notice the green line the

00:22:54,760 --> 00:23:00,930
one we care about kind of diverges from

00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:03,910
the upward trend of the rest of them so

00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:05,670
women stopped entering computing they

00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:09,310
kept entering the other scientist field

00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:11,430
so ideas behind this are that one

00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:13,810
computer science was a very young

00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:15,400
department it kind of arose out of a

00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:17,800
very diverse set of departments and

00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:20,020
different universities but as it mature

00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:22,330
it found its home or in the engineering

00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:24,790
department which you'll notice is the

00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:28,390
bottom line on this graph where they're

00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:34,240
the least number of women you also start

00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:37,540
to see prices together before we just

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:41,440
had pac-man now we have mrs. pac-man and

00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:44,230
pac-man and we start to see video games

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:52,410
where there's a male protagonist and a

00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:52,410
female danzel in distress Mario Brothers

00:23:54,690 --> 00:24:00,100
games really start to become more of

00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:02,600
everyday life especially now that we can

00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:10,799
carry them around

00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:12,720
mmm this is the game boy and we all

00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:15,000
start seeing the emergence of the male

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:19,860
nerd in popular culture remember these

00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:22,380
guys from Revenge of the Nerds then the

00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:24,929
nineteen nineties come along some

00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:27,289
awesome things happened for women 1992

00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:29,880
is actually called the year of the woman

00:24:27,289 --> 00:24:31,710
this is a record number of women being

00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,260
appointed to high office in the United

00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:36,809
States Hillary Rodham Clinton was first

00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:39,179
lady but she travelled the world as a

00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:41,490
representative representative of the

00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:44,429
State Department Madeleine Albright was

00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:46,620
the first US Secretary of State's view

00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:48,900
woman Janet Reno is the US Attorney

00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:50,280
General and Ruth Bader Ginsburg becomes

00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:55,140
the second woman on the Supreme Court

00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:58,500
and we also see rise of third wave

00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:00,840
feminism and just to be clear the rise

00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:03,059
of feminism the different waves it's not

00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:05,370
just about popularity it's actually

00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:10,650
different ideas that drive them but

00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:13,190
let's go for this talk unfortunately

00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:15,539
before when we saw the rise of feminism

00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:17,549
there is an increased number of women in

00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:19,610
computing but that does not happen this

00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:19,610
time

00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:28,760
this is a really great study that

00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:30,710
started in 1995 jana margulies is a

00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:33,200
social scientist and she's interested in

00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:36,770
gender in education and Alan Fisher is

00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,630
the founding dean of Carnegie Mellon

00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:40,940
undergraduate computer science program

00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:42,920
they're interested in understanding why

00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:45,830
there is an gender imbalance in the

00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:47,450
program so couple years into the

00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:51,080
research they changed some of the

00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:53,570
admission standards their research was

00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:56,090
they interviewed over 100 students male

00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:58,220
and female brought back course for five

00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:01,850
years and throughout their course of

00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:04,340
study there and after they changed some

00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:06,380
admission standards which included they

00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:09,050
kept the hi Jerry sports with a bit more

00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:11,240
focus on leadership qualities and they

00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:13,430
dropped um prior experience in

00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:16,280
programming and added catch-up courses

00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:17,870
and they went from seven percent females

00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:21,770
in the computer science department to

00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:25,220
42% in five years none of those changes

00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:28,780
were gender specific they also saw a

00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:32,030
huge rise in the retention rate of women

00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:34,940
after two years normally 41st only forty

00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:39,160
percent left but after two years five

00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:39,160
years later it was around ninety percent

00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:51,270
and into 2000 women are still leaving

00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:55,500
computing but male or male nerd

00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:57,320
stereotype it's makeover but it's no not

00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:03,960
really something that attracts women

00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:07,890
especially things like this like women

00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:11,550
um it used to do awesome things beauty

00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:13,170
world grant Allen was he wears woman to

00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:15,360
win the Turing award which is

00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:17,610
essentially the Nobel Prize of computing

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,700
this is awarded and give him out 40

00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:22,950
years before it was given to a woman and

00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,520
she got it for her work in high

00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:31,200
optimatus

00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:34,050
high optimization confusing in just two

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,670
years later Barbara Liskov also along

00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:38,010
the Turing Award for her work in

00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:39,720
programming language design you might

00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:41,400
recognize list off from the list off

00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,490
substitution principle which as part of

00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,690
these solid design principles of

00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:54,960
object-oriented programming first

00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:58,740
introduced by Michael others and on to

00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,630
the present just recently Etsy followed

00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:03,220
by 37signals and Hammer

00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:05,830
offered grants or women to its

00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:08,460
vd hacker school in Manhattan the school

00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:12,100
was free but living in Manhattan is not

00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,900
and they also think very encourage women

00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:15,520
to apply a nature that they reached out

00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:18,159
to women to make sure that women got the

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:21,490
message that they should apply and they

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:23,650
saw staggering results so far on the

00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:25,480
left is before the grants in the bar on

00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:32,679
the right is after the grant and the

00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:34,450
green is women so people who applies the

00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:36,520
program so we're not able to accept

00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:40,120
everybody but they got a lot more

00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:42,340
applications and there's awesome

00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:45,280
programs like rails girls now that

00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:46,870
reaches out to women they focus on women

00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,700
but they don't exclude men men are still

00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:51,909
welcome at these events they're just

00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:53,770
given priority and they're generally to

00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:55,539
day events for the installation party

00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:58,360
and then one day of like building a

00:28:55,539 --> 00:29:02,500
rails app I attended one of these events

00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:04,179
in January it was awesome turnout it

00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:11,049
turns out if you invite women

00:29:04,179 --> 00:29:12,549
specifically tons of them come and we

00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:14,590
also had a great coach turnout which

00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:16,720
meant that there is very small teams

00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:20,110
this is me working with two individuals

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:22,600
helping them build rails apps and you

00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:24,100
know you don't have to be a woman to

00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:27,929
teach these things you just have to be

00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,929
interested in all day one and learn

00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,909
Ralph's courage is a very similar to

00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,500
rails girls I haven't actually

00:29:32,909 --> 00:29:36,659
participated in rails bridge but there

00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:42,029
is one here or earlier this week I hope

00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:45,750
some of you end I was working yes girl

00:29:42,029 --> 00:29:47,970
development is a broader reaching wider

00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:51,120
focus they don't just do rails they do

00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:53,399
HTML CSS JavaScript all kinds of things

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,710
and there's tons of these programs out

00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:57,929
there and they are all over the country

00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:59,490
in some cases all over the world so if

00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:02,760
you're interested in helping women get

00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:04,710
computing please find something and you

00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:07,080
can't find something in your area start

00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:08,399
something all these organizations make

00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:14,490
it really easy for you to start a

00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:16,409
chapter of your own we all know that

00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:20,159
software engineers are shaping the

00:30:16,409 --> 00:30:22,760
future and a woman's place is really in

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,760
the revolution

00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,160
