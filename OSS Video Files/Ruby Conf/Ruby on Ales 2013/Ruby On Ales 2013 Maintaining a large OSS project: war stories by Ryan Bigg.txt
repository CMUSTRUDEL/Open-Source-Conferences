Title: Ruby On Ales 2013 Maintaining a large OSS project: war stories by Ryan Bigg
Publication date: 2020-01-28
Playlist: Ruby on Ales 2013
Description: 
	At the end of 2011, I switched from being a Ruby consultant to being one of the lead maintainers of the biggest OSS Ruby projects. Best part is: I get paid to do it.

During that time, I've learned an awful lot about what it means to be responsible for something as massive as this project. Refactoring the code without causing tears for loyal users has been an extremely interesting problem to have.

I have some rather interesting stories to tell, like the time I renamed most of the files deliberately on purpose, or that time I ripped out a component that people depended on, and everyone was still happy. There's even been times where code has been moved out of the models and into new classes, which seems to be the cool thing to do.

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,220
about possible stories in code in

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,809

issue posts or the other person or not

00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:07,920
but open source wall storage makes it

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,650
seem like I'm battling against the users

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,900
like it's a house versus axis but it's

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,299
not actually the case why what my goal

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,549
is not to win the war actually to make

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,369

open source web so now the ground up is

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:09,630
everyone live scratch right yeah oh this

00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:13,319

gallery 2010 to january 2013 a mobile

00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,860
notice from the scrub is the prayer line

00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:19,380
i don't know if you can see

00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,970
transection going down and slightly you

00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,560
expect this spring is getting more

00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:27,290
popular the trend line would be going

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:29,610
upwards right case against that moment

00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:31,800
white also notice in describe this is a

00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,990
couple of points where but posts freezer

through the december people aren't

00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,470
actually using this brief because they

00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,730
like we've got to equalize back home if

00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,070
you change anything we're going to break

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,300

absolutely insane yeah with the fifth

00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:12,670
point of the ferry 2013 possibility to

00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:16,150
do the tree lights number up what the

00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:18,910
hell happened well hope you look teams

00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:21,160
freeze actually viable thing and this is

00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,390
really friendly because before i started

00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,910
at spring there's only six hundred

00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:28,260
ninety issues open on hip up and after i

00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:30,610
started there not a 1940 issues created

00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:33,010
you interpret the star in one of two

00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,240
ways one you can say that spray is

00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:36,070
getting more popular and therefore more

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,630
people are using it and want people

00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:40,720
finding out not quite doing what they

00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:42,430
want to do is say my interpreter is that

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:48,460
i'm a cocky bastard is always stuffing

00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:52,720
things up what's up very it's like

00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:54,970
messiah in this work shows its prey is

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,020
actually getting more issues up time the

00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,510
state structure is that we're getting

00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:00,070
more comments oats which is a good thing

00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,570
because I mean spray is getting more

00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:04,840
popular as it's getting more popular

00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:06,850
with coming across it's probably more

00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,220
difficult to manage such a big open

00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:10,810
source project it's a ninety-nine point

00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:13,450
nine percent all these issues are pretty

00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:15,190
awesome by people follow through feeding

00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,690
guidelines and say they say we've got a

00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,220
problem and I'm like okay can you please

00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:20,110
provide some steps or group reproduce

00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:24,310
the problem and then I hope is they

00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:27,390
aren't fix it make our way back oh we

00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:31,350
had this issue for 47 million

00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:35,670
perfect move it up going up oh this

00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:37,680
night start was well huh the sky posted

00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:39,960
this issue about a year ago and he said

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,750
I'm having this issue when I was freed

00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,120
the road under my method whatever

00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:47,220
question and it's just not working and

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,040
then four hours later he closing issues

00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:52,260
staying at my command but the sample

00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:55,260
loading my love if it was and fix the

00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:57,300
issue so between his moping issue

00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:05,000
usually okay I don't have carry more

00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:08,340

I couldn't reproduce the problem but I

00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,600
was able to reproduce on her ogre and

00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,850
then once I figured out what was eight

00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,530
minutes later states the reason i bring

00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:44,720
up the story is that if you see an

00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,830
entitled user who's angry about their

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,320

00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,380
issue to rail striker 1000 years in the

00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:38,690
future and he said hello I'm vendor from

00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:40,640
the future and then he happens to make a

00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:43,730
commitment rails using a semester

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,380
psychic protection falls so I required

00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:47,450
Stiles post and I said there's a holic

00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,920
off just eagle Monica it's not really

00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:51,950
representative of the rails community

00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,570
ghetto is to me an outside of who spends

00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:56,030
his time trying to show that is google

00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:59,240
laid back up by breaking github or any

00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:01,820
other bright outside so this aspect of

00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:04,160
Spring has Hong Kong called issue on

00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:07,480
spring this happen to be during my

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:10,940
vacation in Denver hilarious next one

00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,500
and he said he found this exploit so

00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,300
instead of posting to the security man

00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:17,210
list he actually called issue and github

00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:19,780
DJ on the exploit and saying please take

00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:22,520
a look at mr. outside this whole request

00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:23,990
so I think in this case it is still

00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:27,620
trying to show that he's in philly pack

00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:30,050
up by breaking github or outside we did

00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:32,030
actually merge his all requests because

00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:35,080
he was nice enough to pass out of at

00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:35,080
least and not

00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:42,190
this is the side of man you guys have to

00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:47,140
pry this side of you should would be

00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:50,529
pretty for it oh yeah so suppose we go

00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:53,589
sentai 2008 and from round 2008 to the

00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:55,870
time I've known those 4382 commit stunts

00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:58,000
pre lit up here anytime doesn't seem

00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:00,070
like much at all but if you look at the

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,589
time so joining too now it's in about

00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:04,630
four thousand sixteen commutes in a like

00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:06,550
one-third the size period of time so

00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:08,770
we're doing what working there's a lot

00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:13,750
more work to do because they open source

00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:22,899
project is getting bigger dear dear sir

00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:25,270
I'm sorry okay okay Cynthia's these bits

00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:27,940
over this bread rap and hip-hop provider

00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:30,490
and who did this they deserve a beer or

00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:34,360
metal or chocolate itÃ­s something some

00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:36,370
powder prize yet they could see people

00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:40,360
describe that space what spray work has

00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:43,110
been increasing since about October 21

00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:45,520
unloved and it's been consistently in

00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,899
improving sit so when you go through a

00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,660
couple of things appear like you might

00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:51,970
find interesting the first was a gallery

00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,050
time which is this fixed idea what we

00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:55,510
had before words that we're just

00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:57,910
training Jason staff and the controllers

00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:59,709
like you know you're just doing for it

00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:03,550
okay so and brenna JSON and pleasure to

00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:04,660
JSON and it's fairly typical to do this

00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:06,310
and arouse application if you're just

00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,990
going to get up make young ass equipment

00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,490
the problem with this though is that if

00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:12,520
you don't want to customize netgear

00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:16,060
sports you're going to have problems and

00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:18,070
that's saying like also nice API we had

00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,270
and create action to find inside the

00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,910
basement role which would just return

00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:24,820
text rather than JSON so in some

00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:27,250
instances a JSON API would return JSON

00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:30,899
and other instances it with your would

00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,899
return text those hilarious

00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:39,660
absolutely it's like it doesn't get will

00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:41,220
this boom close your over can text a

00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,230
little Burton Jason on and I'm going to

00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,630
make the request hopefully we're done

00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:47,700
Jason so look different aight guys

00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:50,130
around his neck we found github they've

00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:52,530
gone back to github is there an amazing

00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:54,240
company and they don't break a cat

00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:56,190
recommendation side so you can say like

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,770
only solution it's on a repository is

00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:00,330
URL other rich probably the only name

00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:02,040
through the repository creepers probably

00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:04,710
the rebate name this is a bunch of

00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:07,020
parameters today documentation for API

00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:08,940
is amazing that API is amazing so we

00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:12,660
took out for them and time modeling at I

00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:14,820
ya then so use the nice idea to skip

00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:17,250
down our products use Karen re for

00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:19,080
pagination foot up more interesting part

00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:21,660
is the rattle gently used to structure

00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:23,520
the API responses to hear you're going

00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,980
to count total current page of pages

00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:27,240
just the pagination information I think

00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,470
if I would get us in a slightly

00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:33,840
different way and we just returned

00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:36,720
products means we do this by just

00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,970
extending the inyx template using the

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,910
show to play we showed your face the

00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:44,880
final bits which just includes a private

00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:46,440
reviews and some very far as well the

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,900
product attributes is justified as a

00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,030
helper basically so I think the rattle

00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,680
is a great way of designing it guys if

00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:55,980
you guys ever want to design a guy

00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:58,920
please while all those crushes don't use

00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:01,770
respond to conform at Khe Sanh you

00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:05,790
travel or if you're sadistic and

00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:08,100
probably evil is Jane open let's do dis

00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:09,990
language when you make it better for

00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:12,150
some users that you have this stop be

00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:13,740
one thing in this allows us to version

00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:16,230
the API responses this is stuff

00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,730
reversion k if you know one version 8

00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:23,970
guy pleased with your version packages

00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:27,290
fantastic what's up I'm not going it I

00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:27,290
really don't you get for it

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:36,120
loser so we created the Australian guy I

00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,650
designed to this great representation of

00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,510
how with different parts of spray and

00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:41,820
connect I think that's really useful for

00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:44,610
helping people who aren't really scraped

00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:47,040
on the stamp out but partner and we've

00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:50,010
got this award and sauce we completely

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,480
ripped off github for all things you can

00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:54,390
say like this product you gotta make

00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:58,380
these requests so that's really it's

00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:59,940
automatic the next hike along is the

00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,710
authentication recurring we didn't

00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,150
spring what we had before was we had an

00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:05,910
authentication component built into

00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:08,880
spring and this means that if you very

00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:10,440
strange to an application spring would

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,120
have its own concept of users in your

00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,770
application we have its own concept of

00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,930
users and if you want to use your

00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:19,290
applications user the speed would be

00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:20,190
like now off and I would be bad so

00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:22,140
we worked out the authentication

00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:24,270
compared to the street and let put it

00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:26,670
inside us up again so now you have to do

00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:29,010
is just say what you suppose is in space

00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:31,440
like okay that's fine photo and you hear

00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:33,180
it mobile things like a vocation

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,310
sunflowers just climbs the current user

00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:37,470
method what the current user it is

00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:39,060
inside verification where they can login

00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:42,060
where they can look out where they can

00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:45,110
sign up uses language called the face

00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:47,700
that one knife is free create run Quinn

00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:49,500
which allows you to modify of you gently

00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,750
without actually overriding the entire

00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,360
beautiful thing this is cool because you

00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:57,240
want in certain on before the ultimate

00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,950
is a search are there and what we're

00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,890
going through tip for that as a partial

00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:04,710
it's free shcherbakov are now part was

00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:06,180
just part of this version see here it

00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:09,720
just uses the street like a par three

00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:11,610
logan parking space hoppers to create a

00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,360
login view just before the search bar in

00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:18,000
spring that's useful the second thing

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:23,470
that we done it was as I think I not

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:26,090
count not only as well

00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:28,520
the thing you don't miss was dealing

00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:31,010
with money inside the screen what we had

00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:33,380
was if you would set a product price to

00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:35,420
specific Valley tip of locale to say

00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:37,130
English you would cool it none of the

00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:39,410
currency coke right inside of rails and

00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:44,420
that would give you back the correct

00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:46,910
amount $100 yay but if you happen to

00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:49,010
also have joined their sites you had an

00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:52,190
English scientist company side you took

00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:54,230
lakad Japanese maybe you would pull

00:16:52,190 --> 00:17:00,110
nobody can see again nobody currency

00:16:54,230 --> 00:17:01,640
would use dutifully site are again we're

00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:06,590
just welcome different one hundred

00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:10,550
dollars I hits about 12 channel 1 out of

00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:12,560
1 and 90 degree because I like that so

00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:14,810
we've created a money thoughts back

00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:17,690
Harris from the money Jim it hurts a lot

00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:20,150
of the functionality money do we had a

00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:21,380
new configuration option called currency

00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:24,350
so what this does is that you set

00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:28,700
pricing $100 us set the locale being

00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:30,740
English you pull money you party $500

00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,690
you have to change one count of Japanese

00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:34,360
it does not it still may be a hundred

00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:37,160
dollars because you've got that currency

00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:40,070
configuration set until the money fast

00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:42,110
here is quite small impact but other

00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:44,300
time you discover those things what

00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:55,010
compensating for subscribing to this

00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:56,750
massive gigantic so the next thing in

00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:58,940
this next five is the kick-out float

00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,890
it's free people wanted to customize

00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:02,950
that chicago street because right now it

00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:05,990
goes your top to address deliveries page

00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:09,050
confirming plate some people just wanted

00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:11,450
to go to the top to summary to play well

00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:13,340
that do for that was to redefine the

00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:16,400
actual state machine object used inside

00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:19,220
or a model and this got messy for one

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,800
extreme logic involved three create a

00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:23,720
short-girl dsl this is checkout flow to

00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,390
go to site summary go to Satan like

00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,610
thumb so the check out later sounds off

00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:31,549
the cart state you go to the sorry state

00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:33,740
please say check out stock just the kind

00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:36,650
of thing if you want to check the side

00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:38,270
to me check out the AVI files free it's

00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:40,340
actually a good way if you want to

00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:42,410
figure out creating your own dynamic

00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:46,970
state machines inside the state machine

00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:49,250
gym check this out it's really fun the

00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:50,960
next the one of the other penis box

00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,700
along here was found to be designed had

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,340
the shitty I think in the face it's

00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:57,440
about 140 and spring it was functional

00:18:55,340 --> 00:19:00,170
but it wasn't beautiful so I design came

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:05,059
along he really map the whole box which

00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:07,910
is which was really awesome that's a lot

00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:09,110
better and then the final thing i'm

00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:11,809
going to put back is a multi-currency

00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:13,850
stuff inside of spree this is actually a

00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:17,919
contribution by hopefully the guy of the

00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:17,919
most stylish name ever Gregor MacDougall

00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:24,140
evening a Scottish for general in the

00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:26,000
medieval time prego McDougald as far as

00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:29,000
the borders or not he's apparently like

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,770
the Scottish hero from the Bruce doesn't

00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,770
sound the Scottish burger MacDougall

00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:36,980
everyone do and his team a freerunning

00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,510
technologist came along with this ultra

00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,400
currency spoke with the Stars and say if

00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:43,220
you set a pot and set the currency

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,440
variable a configuration variable mean

00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:47,870
us ecology center part price it's going

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,540
to return one hundred dollars us say the

00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:53,570
cotton haven't said in Japanese you said

00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:57,350
it to be 50 in saying of this place okay

00:19:53,570 --> 00:20:01,190
just go this allows for parts sometimes

00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:04,640
be displayed Mestalla so if you have

00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:07,040
funds request in vessels there will be

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,440
despite having to change the currency

00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:12,740
being Japanese early price of the

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:16,250
capital again sorry what a deal what a

00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:19,820
deal I know so much cheaper just hardly

00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:21,710
mind Japanese currency if you get so

00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:26,270
here's Tony Scouts early parts with

00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:27,890
Japanese prices will be shown side so

00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:31,580
that's the peaches now i'm going to talk

00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:33,890
about the history of spring so we felt

00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:35,690
these three countries i thought i hope

00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:38,900
the commits to spring back front of

00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:40,730
exemplar commits keep saying work in my

00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:46,309
house as a keepsake was like no it's

00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:49,070
commits starts I what so go check on

00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:53,230
vibrate and the point you see a 55.7

00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:55,760
work is being a my freak if you look at

00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,990
what I want to the features I beginning

00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,460
people approached me because we've had

00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:00,980
that issue shoppers hip hop into the

00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:02,840
ride and I had a popular project and Eve

00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:05,030
are things you want that constant happen

00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,220
to the right so what will people up here

00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:10,760
I don't know who these people are we hit

00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:13,070
the venture an different projects is the

00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,809
Banda project you know I thought the pub

00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:17,330
free country as a butler that I'm where

00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:19,400
r coherently in hand then Jose Berlin's

00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:22,250
not a shooting like how does not

00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,690
introduce whooping fun book is over is

00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:26,059
what the Rio simply serve all these

00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:28,400
other things but not about them this is

00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:31,010
because Jose Jose's you because bundler

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:35,780
was it was actually a folk of four and

00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:39,169
has it been won't work on and Butler was

00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:40,700
actually called bubble to South any of

00:21:39,169 --> 00:21:42,410
you would know that so instead of being

00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,660
bundled and so I think you would do

00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:46,429
bubble top world and he wanted to

00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:52,850
destroy I get for the new bottle the

00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:55,309
first so to commit sins in the Bundaberg

00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:56,990
was actually home we would see the

00:21:55,309 --> 00:21:58,580
underground terms later actually in

00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:00,919
their purpose positions at number 12

00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:03,590
come on you know sugar 3 4 and 5

00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:08,169
respectively 73.5 percent of the work is

00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:15,650
done by this house the dickricker hit

00:22:08,169 --> 00:22:19,490
anything so many other one j.crew okay

00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:22,419
good don't race eats number 11 fifth and

00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:30,650
it's great way it what if you so much it

00:22:22,419 --> 00:22:33,830
no really I'm just a method is no Johnny

00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:35,419
notice how that's good cool and it's

00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:40,450
actually has quite full of joke

00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:40,450
about 90 days what do you think you hit

00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:47,940
I'm gonna keep guessing what presented

00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:47,940
fun right no waiters on this list are

00:22:48,690 --> 00:23:02,880
you should mention that because he is

00:22:50,920 --> 00:23:02,880
actually he is actually once today /

00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:15,310
sure I'd say and he's on the loading a

00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:17,200
green action and just by promoting the

00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:20,920
experiences and a great football team

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,870
photo line and folks are one of the week

00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:26,050
of our games we know we know I love

00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:27,910
sorry it's the rounds per day and age

00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:31,660
has done even less than ten percent work

00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:33,790
which is interesting Jeremy camera has a

00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:36,640
timer on Parsons 18 or enjoy your paper

00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:39,700
all names probably no see two percent of

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:42,420
like you has been done by the top 20

00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:44,530
contributors so what the other things

00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:47,530
thirty-seven percent has been no buyers

00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:51,610
the other 2155 project leaders grounds

00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:54,370
so go back the top 20 people have done

00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:56,320
sixty percent of the work but about

00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:57,730
2,000 people have done the other

00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,710
amenities and some of these are

00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:01,510
anonymous people these are people who

00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:03,520
like I'm just going something in rails

00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:05,650
that is broken I'm going to patch it

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,450
they they patched once and then they go

00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:10,140
away these are people who are actually

00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:12,460
bringing your lives making things that

00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:14,830
look upon loads got a similar figure

00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:16,420
about forty-one percent and spreading

00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:20,850
its up slightly hype is about slightly

00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:22,690
less countries at 350 I think what

00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:26,260
encourages contributor stars your

00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:27,970
country code is documentation que crees

00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:31,530
for documentation have you ever gone

00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:33,790
through every site council you did one

00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:35,650
we found there in your life I want to

00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:38,680
figure out how this how this function

00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:40,960
works and it doesn't explain how it

00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:44,620
works I personally have it on there and

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:49,630
found that the real sides a great crazy

00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:51,850
jack that's rails guys are pretty

00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:55,390
awesome though arouse it guys sucked so

00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:57,370
much i hate searching for a new bottle

00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:58,870
design has great documentation but

00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:01,170
spring itself doesn't have suffered

00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:04,000
documentation by bruce buck-boost

00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:07,390
opportunities story 15 sdn and we

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:11,410
haven't been using svn since 2009 and

00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:13,420
140 was released in 2010 so we're

00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:15,790
revamping a documentation and we're

00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:17,080
using without the street Volta guides

00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:18,640
when you announced this will hopefully

00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,140
encourage more people to country for

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,170
spring because this stuff that describes

00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:25,210
how products work and things that relate

00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:27,040
the parts there's things that describe

00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:29,890
our orders work things that are linked

00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:32,440
orders so by this by us having this

00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:34,990
information we get the knowledge out of

00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,190
these silos and attitude spring colors

00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:39,100
and we actually share this knowledge

00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:40,450
with people and I'm Healy these people

00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,460
read these guys to understand this

00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:45,550
promotes and never be able to come to

00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:46,660
Beatrice tree by coming bigger when

00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:48,580
we're running into this program not

00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:52,510
enough people know about spring counter

00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:54,160
that for writing documentation Bosnia

00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:56,950
one program today is continuous

00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:59,200
integration what was happening before is

00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:01,260
that we're using honest what would

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,240
happen is that I would kid two sprays

00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:06,880
general repository that we've got Travis

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,190
at the same time anyone who wanted to

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,040
updates freak show the download at work

00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:14,440
it's cool or what happens is that when i

00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:16,180
push it broke and build it goes off the

00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,240
pancetta guys up all these people who

00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:24,420
want downloads free one-hour layer i'm

00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:27,490
informed builders broken either whoops

00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:32,470
so that's a good college people have

00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:33,790
bills and so we wanted work learn what

00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:36,490
else i think this is that sometimes i

00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:39,160
can push a button build and palace will

00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:41,470
report back that bill is actually green

00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,269
you can see this here this is actually

00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:46,259
an exam

00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:47,639
this 3714 bill is actually old brain but

00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:50,359
if you click on any of these bills

00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:55,320
you'll see that it's actually failing

00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:58,859
and it's definitely family like this 37

00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:01,589
babies except aspect exited with zero

00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:06,690
which means it harnesses is4 working

00:27:01,589 --> 00:27:09,779
yeah success so to get onto the trailer

00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:11,459
spots there isn't actually a way to ssh

00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:15,899
to this machine and see that thing isn't

00:27:11,459 --> 00:27:17,849
working but we wanted that so what we

00:27:15,899 --> 00:27:20,909
infused was the staple teamcity it's

00:27:17,849 --> 00:27:23,549
just different integration continuous

00:27:20,909 --> 00:27:25,379
integration server team Sydney what this

00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:27,929
setup allows us to do is that I push off

00:27:25,379 --> 00:27:30,149
to my focus fruit and that nigga's a

00:27:27,929 --> 00:27:31,950
teensy reports back to me once

00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:35,789
everything is green godless freak and

00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:37,259
here on good fill the thing that we

00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:39,299
didn't expect to happen is that when i

00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:43,259
run the build locally and would take one

00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:46,799
minute 13 seconds and on Travis took 15

00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:50,339
seconds less on the team city it's 48

00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:53,849
second place which is stupidly insanely

00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:56,429
fast for built it's actually faster on

00:27:53,849 --> 00:27:59,639
Team City to run the builds the entire

00:27:56,429 --> 00:28:02,009
build entire self and flutes free from

00:27:59,639 --> 00:28:03,749
the set up scripts run the specs than it

00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:06,690
is to run the actual build on our

00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:08,789
machine back for seconds what this

00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:10,649
allows us to do is do that we hit the

00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:12,539
broken bones and good builds going

00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:14,190
through right out straight and off the

00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:17,579
team city and pointing back to me within
