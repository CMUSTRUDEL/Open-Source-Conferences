Smalltalk has mystique. We talk about it more than we use it.
It seems like it should be so similar to Ruby. It has similar Object-Oriented structures, it even has blocks.
But everything is so slightly different, from the programming environment, to the 1-based arrays, to the simple syntax. Using Smalltalk will make you look at familiar constructs with new eyes.
We'll show you how to get started on Smalltalk, and walk through some sample code. Live coding may be involved.
You'll never look at objects the same way again.
