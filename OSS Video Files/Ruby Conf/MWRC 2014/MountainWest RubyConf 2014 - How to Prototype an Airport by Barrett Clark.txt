Title: MountainWest RubyConf 2014 - How to Prototype an Airport by Barrett Clark
Publication date: 2020-01-24
Playlist: MWRC 2014
Description: 
	I transformed my office building into an airport using a combination of Ruby, Objective-C, and a number of hardware hacks. The goal was to prototype a better in-airport experience using a mixture of GPS and iBeacon technology to establish precise indoor geolocation.
This talk will run down the various stages of the project, an overview of outdoor vs indoor location technologies, and how the iPhone (and Android) devices currently handle location. I'll also discuss how I built a robust Ruby backend, and how I hacked some hardware together to create iBeacons.
