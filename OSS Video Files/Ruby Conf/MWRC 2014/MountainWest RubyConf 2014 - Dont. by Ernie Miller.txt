Description: 
	We all know that intelligent species learn from mistakes, right?
There's just one problem: Life is too short to make every possible mistake! Also, some mistakes are more costly than others. What's the ambitious learner to do? I'm glad you asked! I'm an expert at making mistakes, and I'm happy to share as many of them as I can possibly fit into a 45-minute time slot with you, my dear conference attendee!
We'll discuss a variety of exciting mistakes, ranging from the misapplication of metaprogramming techniques to letting emotions become barriers to new technologies to why it's a horrible idea to stretch a gel keyboard wrist rest across a room, even if it seems like an awesome plan at the time.
