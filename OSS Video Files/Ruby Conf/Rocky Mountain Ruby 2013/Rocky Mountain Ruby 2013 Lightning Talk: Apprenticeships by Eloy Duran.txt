hello how's everyone doing today huh

00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:17,220
okay so I want to start out by asking

00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,320
how many people here is involved with a

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:25,140
mentorship or apprentice program or your

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:27,869
company okay decent show of hands so I'm

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,400
Kinzie and I'm an apprentice in that

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,730
BOTS apprentice program apprentice i/o

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:36,330
which I put up here thoughtbot calm /

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:38,250
Japan estadio and I think that

00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:40,710
apprentice programs are really important

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:44,010
so we have all these great programs like

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:46,200
railsbridge g school hacker school dev

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,210
bootcamp but we don't have any in

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,400
between between that and becoming a

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,340
full-time developer we don't have enough

00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,020
experience etc so apprentice programs

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,080
are great because you get to work with

00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,270
real code you get to pair with full time

00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,550
advanced developers and continue

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,750
learning in a structured environment so

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,759
I think that's something that's greatly

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,740
lacking so I'm really fortunate to be in

00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:10,140
a program where I'm learning every day I

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,499
not only learn how to write high quality

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:16,140
code and how to write tests that sort of

00:01:13,499 --> 00:01:18,299
thing I'm also learning soft skills that

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,969
I think are really important I'm also

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,619
learning how the business works I get to

00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:25,200
go to sales meetings I get to learn how

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:28,319
to write an invoice and I think it's

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,850
really important so I just want to

00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,560
encourage everyone here to get involved

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,380
with an apprentice program or if you own

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,130
a company to start one and that's it

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,130
