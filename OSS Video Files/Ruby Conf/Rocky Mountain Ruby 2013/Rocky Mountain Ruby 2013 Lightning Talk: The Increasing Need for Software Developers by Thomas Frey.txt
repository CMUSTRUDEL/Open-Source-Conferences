all right hi everybody let's try to wake

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:18,179
everybody up after lunch here I would

00:00:16,259 --> 00:00:21,330
like to ask you a question here and I

00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:23,310
want you to raise your hand if you think

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,249
I'm going to go through five different

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:28,079
industries here and I want you to raise

00:00:26,249 --> 00:00:30,779
your hand if you think that the average

00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:33,630
person 20 years from now is going to be

00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:36,150
spending less money on energy than they

00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,340
do today so just raise your hand if you

00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,540
think the average person 20 years from

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,080
now is going to spend less money and

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:45,840
energy okay just a few hands how about

00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:49,230
less money on health care 20 years from

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,680
now than they do today okay a few more

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:55,080
hands there how about less money on

00:00:52,680 --> 00:01:00,270
housing 20 years from now than they do

00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:07,229
today okay a few how about less money on

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:09,359
education okay good good so just so you

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:10,890
understand I actually think that we're

00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,649
going to be spending less money on all

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,140
of these areas 20 years from now and

00:01:13,649 --> 00:01:18,659
what happens when we spend less money on

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:24,060
these areas that frees up more money to

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:26,939
go other places so in 2008 in March of

00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:30,899
2008 Steve Jobs introduced the software

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:33,389
developers kit for the Apple iPhone it

00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:36,359
was july of that year in 2008 when they

00:01:33,389 --> 00:01:38,460
opened the app store they had 552 apps

00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:41,100
when they opened the app store over the

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,990
next three days those 552 apps got

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:49,139
download at 60 million times now today

00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:51,149
we have over two million apps that can

00:01:49,139 --> 00:01:56,219
be downloaded through either Android or

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:59,789
Apple devices and this economy has grown

00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:02,399
up to a 26 billion dollar economy just

00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:05,549
over this last five years according to

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,039
the gardener group so this is an area

00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:10,229
where money has gotten freed up it's

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,270
come from other places to go into the

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:15,440
apps economy

00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:18,290
so my name is thomas fry I work at The

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:21,530
Da Vinci Institute we have our program

00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:24,380
called da Vinci coders and we're

00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:26,330
developing new Ruby on Rails programmers

00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:29,450

00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:35,270
new technology coming into play whether

teacher Lysette occation or dr. les

00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:45,350
hospitals all of this is increasing the

00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:47,180
demand for coders and this is this is

00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:49,910
