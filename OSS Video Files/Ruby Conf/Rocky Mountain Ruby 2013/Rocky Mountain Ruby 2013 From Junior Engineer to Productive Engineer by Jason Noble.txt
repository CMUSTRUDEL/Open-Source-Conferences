Publication date: 2020-01-27
Playlist: Rocky Mountain Ruby 2013
Description: 
	At Rocky Mountain Ruby 2012, Mike Gehard hosted a Growing Developers Panel which discussed how senior engineers, companies and code schools can help alleviate the shortage of quality software developers.

Two to three months before the conference, Comverge had one Junior engineer on staff, but no formal training/mentorship program. Since that conference, we have hired an additional junior engineer and put both of them through our Junior Engineer program.

This talk will cover the process Comverge uses when bringing on Junior software engineers, from interviewing techniques to on boarding and the first couple months of on the job training. This training includes Pivotal Tracker, Git branching strategies, learning to love pull requests, TDD, BDD and learning our products.
