Title: Rocky Mountain Ruby 2013 From Junior Engineer to Productive Engineer by Jason Noble
Publication date: 2020-01-27
Playlist: Rocky Mountain Ruby 2013
Description: 
	At Rocky Mountain Ruby 2012, Mike Gehard hosted a Growing Developers Panel which discussed how senior engineers, companies and code schools can help alleviate the shortage of quality software developers.

Two to three months before the conference, Comverge had one Junior engineer on staff, but no formal training/mentorship program. Since that conference, we have hired an additional junior engineer and put both of them through our Junior Engineer program.

This talk will cover the process Comverge uses when bringing on Junior software engineers, from interviewing techniques to on boarding and the first couple months of on the job training. This training includes Pivotal Tracker, Git branching strategies, learning to love pull requests, TDD, BDD and learning our products.

hello my name is Jason mobile and I

00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:38,379
talked today is from junior engineer to

00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:40,030
productive engineer I had someone point

00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:42,879
out on Twitter that junior engineers are

00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:44,350
not necessarily not productive so that

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,840
is not the intent of this talk the

00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:49,480
intent is to give you the process that

00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:53,050
we've gone through to help bring junior

00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:55,750
engineers into our team so a little bit

00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:57,760
about me I 15 years professional

00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:00,430
experience six years Ruby on Rails I've

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,280
taught rails classes in Atlanta for

00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:06,909
three to four years at top 45

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,280
contributor to ruby on rails and one of

00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:13,770
my students pointed out I'm now a top 47

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:16,420
contributor still have to work on that I

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:20,409
am a senior software developer and lead

00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:24,340
at converge I'm a mentor and I'm an

00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:26,380
instructor da Vinci coders okay converge

00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:29,579
is the company I work for they were

00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:35,579
found in 1980 headquartered in Georgia

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:38,079
they work and intelligent energy so we

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:41,380
help utilities reduce their energy

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,610
demands so we'll turn off your AC make

00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,930
your pool pump run at three in the

00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,659
morning instead of in the middle of the

00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:49,509
day and so on so these are some of the

00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:53,729
devices that we talked to be a ruby on

00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:53,729
rails it's pretty exciting

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:19,900
so back in March of 2012 we hired our

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,880
first junior developer Beth Medina she

00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,670
was a cold fusion developer for a couple

00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,799
of years she took seven years off to

00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,360
raise some children and when she

00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:32,590
returned the internet was a very

00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:35,519
different place I coverage at that point

00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:38,049
didn't have a training program per se

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,970
she came into work we kinda threw her a

00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:43,720
couple books go read agile web

00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:47,110
development we bought the pragmatics to

00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:49,180
do Ruby on Rails courses for her the

00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:51,040
ruby on rails tutorial by Michael hurdle

00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,819
and those are all really good resources

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,489
if you're looking to get into rails she

00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:59,470
would pick cumbridge we pair all the

00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:03,250
time so she would pair with senior

00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:06,690
developers occasionally but usually

00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:09,970
we're too busy working on you know stuff

00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:12,639
so we gave her a small side project to

00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:15,670
build rails out rose up from scratch

00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:19,930
that would allow versions of our iPhone

00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:22,540
app to be provisioned correctly in last

00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,489
year at this conference there was a

00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:27,069
breakout session moderated by Mike

00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:30,639
gayhart and we talked about the fact

00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:32,590
that we need to train new developers I

00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,870
found that the panel ended with a lot of

00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:38,560
questions like how do you grow

00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:40,540
developers so that they gain experience

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,420
and how does the new developer get

00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,819
started I walked away from the

00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,680
conference wanting to get back into

00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:50,109
teaching rails it had been a couple

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,190
years and I really enjoyed teaching and

00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:55,720
so I figured out how to get into

00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:58,389
teaching as well as talking with

00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:04,930
cumbridge about developing a junior

00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:07,870
program John Williams is a guy I work

00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:10,780
with he has a background in sales mostly

00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:12,519
cell phone industry he decided to get

00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,560
into programming so he enrolled The Da

00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:21,630
Vinci Code errs and

00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:29,190
vil and I he picked me as a mentor as

00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:31,770
part of that and the associated we did a

00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:34,470
lot of mentoring outside of work so he

00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,660
would show up at Cambridge after work

00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,520
two or three times a week I spend an

00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,950
hour to with him just kind of going over

00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,480
what they went over in class explaining

00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:47,550
things that he didn't really understand

00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:49,710
per se and really testing him to see if

00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,870
you know help expand his knowledge and

00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:55,500
also approaching topics in a different

00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:58,440
way so you can have NBC explained to you

00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,900
but unless you are asked 17 ways of how

00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:07,320
to implement it you kind of don't get

00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:09,960
the you know the gist of it he coverage

00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:14,010
started interviewing in January 2013 for

00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:16,889
junior people and we really focused on

00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:18,180
the personality and the passion we were

00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:21,300
looking for someone that didn't

00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:25,080
necessarily have any rails experience we

00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:29,010
wanted someone who was willing to jump

00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:32,039
in dive in and learn things our

00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:35,130
interview process consisted of fizzbuzz

00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:38,940
type algorithm sorting algorithm can you

00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:40,200
sort these index cards loops arrays how

00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,550
does the web browser work just kind of

00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:45,510
the basics you know have you used a

00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:49,770
computer before John was hired as a

00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:54,479
contractor in January and it effectively

00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:56,250
doubled our engineering staff I in it

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,410
April's three months later he converted

00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,729
from contract to perm and there was

00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:02,700
quite a few lessons that we learned

00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:04,410
through this process the first one is

00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,630
probably the most important we found

00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:09,060
that two junior developers are better

00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:11,940
than one and the reason behind that is

00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,770
that junior developers tend to be I

00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,470
don't know if afraid is the right word

00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:17,669
but they're they're worried about

00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:20,039
affecting someone's productivity at work

00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:23,039
by stopping them and saying hey how does

00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:24,450
this work and so if there's two junior

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,129
developers that can really work with

00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,559
each other

00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:29,749
and where one is stuck the other one

00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:31,999
might be able to get past it and you

00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:35,330
know just pairing working off each other

00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:38,209
I we also found it very helpful to have

00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:40,339
one of the senior developers have

00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:42,679
dedicated time to working with the

00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:44,300
juniors we found that when John first

00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:47,029
came on it was twenty to twenty-five

00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:50,629
percent of their time where they are

00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:53,059
explicitly tasked with work with the

00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:55,039
junior developer have you know work

00:06:53,059 --> 00:07:00,369
through a story have them ask you

00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:00,369
questions general domain knowledge etc

00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:05,509
Junior is pairing with each other works

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,179
really well when one of them gets stuck

00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:10,580
they can help the other one out if

00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:12,529
they're both really stuck they can

00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,749
figure out the right question to ask a

00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:17,209
senior developer it's completely

00:07:14,749 --> 00:07:20,419
different for two junior people to come

00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:22,669
to you and say this doesn't work and

00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:25,189
that's the end of the question it's it's

00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:27,110
much different to say I've got a route

00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:29,809
in the routes file that routes to this

00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:31,909
controller in action but the action is

00:07:29,809 --> 00:07:33,649
pulling records from the database but

00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:35,869
it's not getting the right records how

00:07:33,649 --> 00:07:38,149
should I change this query a senior

00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:40,759
developer can listen to that question

00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:43,159
give them an answer explain the answer

00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:48,199
and it won't take them forever to figure

00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:51,229
out what's going wrong we also tried we

00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:53,269
call that trying which is basically two

00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:56,749
junior developers side by side with a

00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:59,869
senior developer in the middle the

00:07:56,749 --> 00:08:01,610
junior developer run is right is working

00:07:59,869 --> 00:08:04,459
on one story junior developer on the

00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:06,169
left is working on another one and the

00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:09,519
senior just flips back and forth as they

00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:11,779
get stuck on things or have questions

00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:14,349
warning the mentor will find this

00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:19,399
exhausting because you're constantly

00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:22,879
context switching some of the processes

00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:25,490
that we used I took the Ruby combs

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,939
project which is a intro to ribbing

00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:33,039
project that is basically test-driven to

00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:35,630
get you familiar with Ruby methods and

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,120
basically I've got

00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:40,669
I created stories out of each one of the

00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,340
files and Ruby cones and so they have a

00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:45,830
tracker story to implement about arrays

00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:49,730
and so they have to go and get all the

00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:51,530
tests passing open a pull request you

00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:54,170
know which involves creating a branch on

00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:56,420
and get so it gives them a lot of

00:08:54,170 --> 00:09:00,970
experience with the tools that we use on

00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:05,870
a daily basis get-get branching merging

00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:09,080
resolving conflicts rebasing etc a

00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:11,510
second one I did was convert the command

00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:14,480
line crash course to tracker stories so

00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:17,390
you would have one that you know learn

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,420
about LS and I added a bunch of

00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:23,510
questions you know what is the minus our

00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:25,370
flag do or what is the you know that

00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:29,720
sort of thing and they had a bunch of

00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:31,490
tracker stories so at this point because

00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,640
they had worked through those processes

00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:38,060
they really know enough to start working

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:40,850
on converge stories so they know github

00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:43,180
they know the pull request process we

00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:47,780
use pull request to get code feedback

00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:50,930
and so we started asking our iteration

00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:52,520
planning team to start thinking of the

00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:55,130
juniors as they're going through stories

00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:57,410
and if there was a story that had you

00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:59,510
know we want to change this label from X

00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,950
to Y that's an excellent junior story

00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:03,470
because they're going to have to go and

00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:06,010
find a test that is currently passing

00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:09,050
that needs to fail make the test fail

00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:10,880
fix the code make the test pass open a

00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:14,140
pull request and they get the whole

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:18,560
process we also have them focus on

00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:20,780
Jenkins build failures you know senior

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,840
developers get to that when they can but

00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:26,960
juniors you know have a lot of time to

00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:29,120
work through that so after a couple of

00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,680
months we found that the junior

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,570
developers had gotten to know our test

00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,840
suite pretty well and so they were

00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:40,100
working on morning more advanced stories

00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:42,860
and so we you know had them pair of

00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:46,640
senior developers they were at a point

00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:48,160
where they could follow along and ask

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,389
questions is

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,149
you know the senior developer was

00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:54,370
working through things and the

00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:56,680
involvement of the mentor or senior

00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:59,079
developer became less and less so it was

00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:02,829
more of a hey let's go spend an hour

00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:09,339
this week talking about it not every 10

00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:12,699
minutes in September 2013 Josh joined

00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:16,660
the team he's a 2013 G school graduate

00:11:12,699 --> 00:11:18,160
and Beth left converse take a contract a

00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,800
permanent position with rallies offer

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,819
and bolder and so we're excited to have

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:29,339
our junior staff go out into the world

00:11:23,819 --> 00:11:34,389
and impress people so that's all I had

00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:36,040
the top one is a rape my talk email

00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:39,009
Twitter github slides are available

00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:42,279
online and I'm an instructor at the da

00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:44,649
Vinci school in Louisville so if you're

00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:46,810
a junior developer wanting to get into

00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:50,160
this field you may want to look at that

00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:53,160
class as an option there any questions

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,160
yes

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:11,350
yes okay so the question was what did we

00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:13,910
hope to gain from the trying process and

00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:16,340
really the process was so that each

00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:18,650
junior developer could be working on a

00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:20,630
different bug and they're really working

00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:25,070
on their own but they're also pairing

00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:26,810
and so the thought was that if we put

00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:28,850
two junior developers they're going to

00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:31,160
be moving somewhat slowly through a

00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:33,710
story but if we have a junior at the

00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:38,510
senior and a junior working on a story

00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:41,240
then our combined velocity would go up

00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:43,310
so the two juniors would be working on

00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:49,700
the stories the senior would be helping

00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:51,910
as they got stuck I John what do you

00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,910
think

00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:32,350
you

00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:38,270
so in case some people didn't hear that

00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:40,670
basically he was saying that he found it

00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:43,610
useful because he's working on his own

00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:45,170
but when he gets stuck you can ask me a

00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:49,550
quick question and get right back into

00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:52,399
it it's you know allowing both of them

00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:54,440
to be productive while the senior is

00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:59,860
there to help either one of them when

00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,860
they get stuck questions yes

00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:24,970
okay so the question was we have hired

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,130
junior developers with varying amounts

00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:29,310
of experience so the Beth came into the

00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:32,920
role with absolutely no Ruby on Rails

00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:36,930
John had had 11 weeks of Ruby on Rails

00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:40,360
instruction and G school six months so

00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:43,330
really the process is the same I think

00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:46,450
the how long it took them to get through

00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:49,960
the process is what changed so it took

00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:52,990
Beth probably six to nine months to get

00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:54,850
up and productive John was productive in

00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:56,620
two or three months and josh is

00:14:54,850 --> 00:15:04,530
productive now he's been on the team for

00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:04,530
three weeks so questions yes

00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:16,060
yes so the question was we pair all the

00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:18,430
time did we think about rotating the

00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:23,440
juniors through the senior pairings and

00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:26,200
and we did do that we do that now the

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,260
the problem that i really see at first

00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:32,500
is the junior developers are struggling

00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:36,130
with two things the first one is Ruby on

00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:39,400
Rails itself you know how do I develop

00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:41,740
software what is a controller should I

00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,630
be editing the view or a helper or you

00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:47,020
know that sort of thing and those sorts

00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:48,730
of questions a senior developer can help

00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:52,600
people with but it really slows them

00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:55,120
down and so our junior program was set

00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,850
so that they could get comfortable with

00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,880
our domain so the energy sector in

00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:03,310
general the you know talk to this

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:06,850
transmitter what's a endpoint what's a

00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:09,160
device etc get them comfortable with the

00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:11,560
domain as well as the technology and

00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:15,430
then when they work with the senior

00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:18,160
developer they're really they they know

00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:20,920
what an endpoint is the senior doesn't

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:24,340
have to explain that so it they're able

00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:26,050
to ask more intelligent is not the right

00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:28,600
word but you know more involved

00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:31,630
questions so they could possibly help

00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,310
steer where a solution would go whereas

00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:36,190
brand new junior people would just be

00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:40,300
sitting there and watching Chris fly

00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:46,140
through the bim editing and you know

00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:49,140
what was that fina so other questions

00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,140
yes

00:16:50,050 --> 00:17:01,720
I know with Beth like I mentioned it was

00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:07,329
the agile web development book the rails

00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:12,309
tutorial etc John in Josh bolt had rails

00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:14,860
experience prior really the the process

00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:19,240
that we employed with all of them was

00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:21,309
the ruby cones tracker project so that

00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,470
they understood poll requests they

00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:25,630
understand the git branching model how

00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:27,069
do I rebase this it's you know based off

00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:30,850
the latest branch and that sort of thing

00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:35,350
so it's kind of a customized curriculum

00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:45,640
it's not an industry standard ok any

00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:49,179
other questions yes so future plans I I

00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:52,420
was recently promoted to a lead software

00:17:49,179 --> 00:17:54,419
developer I've got three junior

00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:57,400
developer people under me now and

00:17:54,419 --> 00:18:00,250
hopefully next year we're going to be

00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:02,740
expanding the plan I haven't talked with

00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:07,900
Lee about that yet but I hope we expand

00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:10,240
it and really it's you know get our

00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,340
junior people more and more senior so

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:20,580
that they can contribute more and more

00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:20,580
to the team thank you very much

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,260
