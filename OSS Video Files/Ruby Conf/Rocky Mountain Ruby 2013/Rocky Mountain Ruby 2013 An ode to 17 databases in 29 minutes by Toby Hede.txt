Title: Rocky Mountain Ruby 2013 An ode to 17 databases in 29 minutes by Toby Hede
Publication date: 2020-01-27
Playlist: Rocky Mountain Ruby 2013
Description: 
	A detailed, deep-diving, in-the-deep-end and occasionally humorous whirlwind introduction and analysis of a suite of modern (and delightfully archaic) database technologies. How they work, why they work, and when you might want them to work. For no extra charge I will attempt to explain the oft-misunderstood CAP theorem, using databases as a device for understanding the trade offs and compromises inherent in building complex distributed systems.

Including but not limited to:

PostgreSQL Redis Cassandra Hyperdex MongoDb Riak
