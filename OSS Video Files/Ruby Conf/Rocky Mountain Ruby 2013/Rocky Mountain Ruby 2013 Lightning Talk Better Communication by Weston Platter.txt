my name is Weston and I want to talk to

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,000
you about better communication I

00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:18,000
recently ran into a situation where i

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,830
was using a gem in production and the

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,710
gem needed an update so i submitted a

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:25,199
pull request tests were passing but i

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,240
got no response and it was a little bit

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,269
hard because i had two main options i

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,910
could either fork the repo and deploy

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,500
off of github which i wasn't a fan of

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,690
because i would rather stay with kind of

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,340
the main branch of the code base and

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,100
receive updates and patches as they

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,440
happen in open source or add the other

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,060
option of making my own gem and

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,410
unfortunately i went with the make my

00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,930
own gem and the reason when i say

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,910
unfortunate because i believe we as a

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,560
community lose out on kind of the

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,590
collective problem-solving abilities

00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,000
that we have together so i want to

00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,920
propose a couple ways that we might make

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,120
this better in terms of how we

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,189
communicate so i'm not a maintainer i

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,590
don't have a lot of experience in open

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:10,079
source but i would ask maintain errs

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,659
when you do get issues focus on

00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,549
responding not fixing the world is too

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:17,100
big to have a solution for every problem

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:19,469
that comes through but telling someone

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,049
hey i'm on vacation for the next week I

00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:25,140
can't look at this or sending links to

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:27,090
documentation is fantastic involving

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,710
others there's a lot of people who want

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,689
to understand how to develop and how to

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,210
think well about software to have the

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:35,579
automatic filtering for good code so

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,920
involve junior doubts they're happy and

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:39,450
eager to help and then categorize issues

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,100
this is a huge thing if people want to

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,689
get involved with open source but they

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,920
don't know where to start categories are

00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:46,049
really helpful because then they can

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,209
essentially solve one problem and then

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,100
see the one offs from there and then

00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:54,030
people who you know ask questions or

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:55,619
aren't in control the repo um ask for

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,659
links or docs I mean problems have been

00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,429
solved before so let's look at great

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,319
solutions and copy those and try and do

00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:04,590
one offs rather than looking at the base

00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:06,659
for everything and then I've just found

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,000
like context is everything in

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,619
communication and so if you're creating

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,930
an issue these are just a couple of

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,890
things I found to be helpful explain

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,510
what you're doing and

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,610
why you're doing it tell the person what

00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,770
your assumptions are you know I put in

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,540
this input and I was expecting this

00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:23,330
output I didn't get it I don't

00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,970
understand can you help me understand

00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:29,640
and then honestly ask for help and I

00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:32,190
think ultimately it will lead to better

00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:35,940
communication and a better synergy

00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:37,650
between all of us so and in the end is

00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,410
not just about getting problems and

00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,300
solutions it's about relationships and I

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,850
think there's a couple of repositories

00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,580
out there the fog repository I don't

00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:49,530
know if anybody's use that the lead

00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,180
developer behind that is fantastic with

00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,890
the issues who responds back says hey

00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,140
thanks for doing this you know did you

00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,640
check out this or this of this and it I

00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,170
don't know sometimes I just read through

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,330
it a couple issues and see how he

00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,830
responded so I'm not just treating

00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:04,709
people like a unit test but actually

00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:06,959
treating them like a real person so I

00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:08,100
don't have all the answers but if you

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,050
have opinions on how to better

00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,680
communicate would love your input so

00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,680
