Title: Rocky Mountain Ruby 2013 Programming with that Disreputable Part of your Brain

Description: 
	by  Brian Marrick

When smoothing wood with a hand plane, you should always work with the grain rather than against the grain.

It's becoming increasingly clear that what we normally think of as rationality is fairly rare. Much of what we do is governed by our brain operating on autopilot. Reasoning is the expensive stop-gap our brain uses (sometimes!) when the cheaper solution isn't working right.

Programming is typically seen as an occupation that requires thoughtful precision and rationality: we will work against the grain of our brain. The resulting nicks and chips are only evidence that we should try harder!

What if we try to work with the automatic part of the brain, rather than against it? In this talk, Brian Marick will discuss how he tries to do just that.

okay good morning i am here to brainwash

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:42,239
you into something crazy but let me

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:45,500
start out by saying a strange thing

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:54,210
happened to me in may which is that i

00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:58,140
got a job after many after many years as

00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:01,680
a consultant i work for a real company

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:04,679
and they pay me on holidays and the

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,380
whole salary thing it's pretty it's

00:01:04,679 --> 00:01:10,229
pretty interesting and the reason that I

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,090
decided to get a job was because as a

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:15,090
consultant I used to go into companies

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,100
and I would pair with people and teach

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,490
them TDD and refactoring and all that

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,859
sort of thing but I never got to do

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,649
anything but be a visitor to a code base

00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:29,490
I had my own open source stuff I've had

00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:31,319
I've had a closure a testing tool that's

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,719
been fairly popular that's been going on

00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:36,420
for three years but you know it's small

00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,490
and they don't pay me to work on it so I

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,609
wanted to have a chance to work on a

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,859
large code base over a long period of

00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:45,929
time and see it get better and better

00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:48,119
over time because that's something

00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:50,669
that's really motivated me for a long a

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:52,979
long long time so the fact that I'm now

00:01:50,669 --> 00:01:56,450
getting paid to work a producing

00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:59,219
software caused me to sort of sort of

00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,569
reinvigorated my interest in a question

00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:04,020
that's been interesting to me for a long

00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:06,569
time which is what is it that makes a

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,119
good programmer how do you become a good

00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:12,380
programmer and in particular how can I

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:15,780
become a better programmer and so the

00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:19,020
talk is about some of the things I've

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,580
been doing recently toward the end of

00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,380
becoming a better programmer and I'm

00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,590
presenting it to you in the hopes that

00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:29,460
some of it might help you in that same

00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:33,060
goal so I have a self-improvement goal

00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:35,400
and this particular part of my goal is

00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,010
in some sense based on this book

00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,730
Thinking Fast and Slow by daniel

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:43,980
kahneman and what he does is he's a he's

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:47,000
a psychologist he won the Nobel Prize in

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:50,700
Economics he's one of the founders of

00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,530
economics that recognizes that human

00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,330
beings are not in fact rational

00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,459
calculating machines but they have

00:02:54,330 --> 00:03:01,500
brains that often behave in irrational

00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:05,430
ways and he in this book and in his work

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,800
divides the brain into two systems he

00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:11,040
calls them and he gives them the catchy

00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:13,290
name system one and system two I can

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,570
ever remember which one is which so I

00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:19,530
call them the effort full system in the

00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:21,750
automatic system so as an example of an

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,820
effortful activity something that's done

00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:26,790
by the effort full system in your brain

00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:30,630
there's adding two numbers like 1 23 +

00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:34,290
82 now when you solve that problem if I

00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:35,750
ask you what 123 + 82 is most of you

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:39,510
can't come up with the answer

00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:41,220
immediately you some of you would do the

00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,200
thing you learned in grade school where

00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,880
you add to the left to the right or

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,040
right to the left and you carry the one

00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:50,730
some of you probably know some

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:54,510
calculational tricks like 12 plus 8 is

00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:56,670
20 and then you have five so it's 205 so

00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:59,549
that's a faster way of coming up with

00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:02,160
the answer but it's still a step by step

00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:04,950
linear effortful activity now in

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:08,670
contrast to that if I asked you what two

00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:12,120
plus two is you don't have to go through

00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:14,579
any procedure to get the answer you

00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,459
immediately know the answer and in fact

00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:20,609
you can't not know the answer to two

00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:22,800
plus two it's impossible for you to hear

00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:25,410
two plus two what's two plus two without

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,220
thinking for in the same way when I say

00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,340
a word and you

00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:32,370
native language you can't hear that as a

00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:34,830
sound you hear it as the meaning of the

00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:37,980
word not as the actual sound because the

00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:42,210
automatic system is translating the

00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:44,520
sound into meaning before you the effort

00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:47,550
phul system has a chance to get ahold of

00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:51,630
it so another example of an automatic

00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:53,670
system is if you be if you've probably

00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:56,280
had the experience of your driving on a

00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:58,560
highway not in busy traffic but out in

00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,350
the country somewhere on the interstate

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,270
and you realize you've been absolutely

00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:06,090
paying no attention to driving for the

00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:09,120
last half hour you've been going around

00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:11,340
curves and you've been coming you stayed

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,640
between the lines and everything but you

00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:16,560
consciously have no memory of doing any

00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,140
of that stuff and that's because the

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,440
automatic system takes charge of that

00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:24,240
sort of thing for you in contrast if

00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,640
you're like most people and you're

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,669
trying to get your car and parked in a

00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:32,400
really narrow spot what you will find is

00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:34,530
you have to be extremely conscious of

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,810
your car you have to think about the

00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,970
dimensions of your car where it is in

00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:42,360
relation to the things around it you

00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:44,250
have to think about things in a way that

00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,040
you don't think about the lines on a

00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:50,729
highway when you're driving so final

00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:53,850
example if I go up if I take you to the

00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:56,300
top of a hill in Scotland and I say

00:05:53,850 --> 00:06:00,300
could you count that flock of sheep

00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:02,820
below that is an effortful activity for

00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,710
you you will have to keep track of which

00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,270
sheep you've already counted and deal

00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,790
with the fact that they're moving around

00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:11,940
and so on and so forth but if I take you

00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:14,460
to the top of a hill in Scotland and

00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:17,370
show you a group of sheep and one of

00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:20,669
them is green before I even say anything

00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:23,160
to you you will notice that that sheep

00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:27,390
is green you can't if unless you're

00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:29,910
colorblind you you will not be able to

00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:31,410
not notice that the Sheep is green

00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:34,530
because your automatic system is in

00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:37,440
charge of that so the effort phul system

00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:39,550
is is so called because it actually is

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,700
effortful its work to do

00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:45,820
at its work to add numbers up all day at

00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:48,520
the end of the day if your job is adding

00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:50,020
5 digit numbers you'll be tired at the

00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,920
end of the day if you're programming

00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:55,870
you'll be tired you can meant as as long

00:06:53,920 --> 00:07:00,460
as you're actually working and not on

00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:02,560
Twitter or something like that the the

00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:05,710
way you can tell if a task is effortful

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,410
or automatic is your pupils dilate when

00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:10,330
you're performing effortful tasks so if

00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:12,250
you're a subject in an experiment and

00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:14,110
you've been given a task to do your

00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:17,290
pupils will dilate roughly in proportion

00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:21,070
to the difficulty of the task and a

00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:22,990
researcher can by looking at how your

00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:25,210
dot pupils are dilating make a

00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:27,340
reasonably good guess at whether you'll

00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:29,800
give up on the task is being too hard or

00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:32,350
not so that's the effort phul system

00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:35,170
it's tiring the automatic system is not

00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:38,110
tiring you do it all the time it's

00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:42,160
completely automatic it's always on you

00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:44,560
have no real control over it at all it

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,740
also operates in parallel so if I'm

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,960
taking you up to the top of that hill

00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:52,480
site in Scotland and you're looking at

00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:55,360
the green sheep your automatic system is

00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,670
also continuously monitoring to see if

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,020
somethings sneaking up on you and it

00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:03,550
does that even though there are two

00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:05,860
parallel tasks in in contrast the the

00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:08,110
effort 'full system really can only do

00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:11,080
one thing at a time so if you give

00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:13,330
somebody the job of adding five digit

00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,330
numbers while simultaneously parking

00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:18,700
their car in a really tight space they

00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:21,640
will do markedly bad at both of those

00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:26,220
tasks they will have to switch between

00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:28,840
the two okay so um because the so I'm

00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,640
kind of building up the automatic system

00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,340
here it's sounding pretty good and

00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:37,030
unsurprisingly the effort 'full system

00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:40,510
since it's tiring also tries to be lazy

00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:43,090
and it offloads work whenever it can

00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:44,800
onto the automatic system and that's

00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:46,900
good because that reduces the total

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,230
amount of effort you have to put in

00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:52,480
things the problem with that is although

00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,930
the automatic system is very good at

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,180
what it

00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:58,210
it's limited in the number of things

00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:00,339
that can do which is a problem it also

00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:02,529
happens to have been evolved for an

00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:04,899
environment that is completely different

00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:06,790
from the environment we operate in today

00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:09,399
which is why you get all sorts of

00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:11,470
strange cognitive biases which is why

00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:14,830
people make very poor financial planning

00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:17,020
decisions because we didn't have to make

00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:19,839
that many financial planning decisions

00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:21,820
on the savanna in Africa 200,000 years

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,890
ago and the automatic system is not

00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,720
tuned for that sort of thing so the

00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:28,390
effortful system is a good general

00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,490
purpose system but it's one you want to

00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:34,060
use only when you don't have something

00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:36,339
automatic that works for you okay so

00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:40,450
effortful and automatic there's one

00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:44,410
thing I I left out parking a car in a

00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:47,140
narrow space is very hard unless you do

00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:50,080
that for a living if you're a car park

00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:52,510
and you manage to keep your job as a car

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:56,950
park you will get to the point where

00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:59,560
parking a car is as automatic as driving

00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:02,560
on the highway is for most of us so a

00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:04,779
task which was effortful has become

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,320
automatic and I think that's kind of

00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:10,480
interesting because remember automatic

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:15,370
is cheap and fast and good at what it

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:19,209
does so most of us do not aspire to park

00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:23,640
cars some of us probably like to play

00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:26,560
chess one characteristic i have read of

00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:30,130
really good chess players that's not

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,480
true of not really good chess players is

00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:34,180
when a really good chess player

00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:37,329
perceives when really good chess players

00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:42,310
look at the board they see only the good

00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:45,010
moves with mediocre chess players look

00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:48,010
at the board they see all the moves and

00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:49,930
so you can see you can think of the

00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:52,149
process that's going on here is the

00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:54,790
automatic system in the grip the good

00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:58,329
chess player has been trained to filter

00:10:54,790 --> 00:11:01,240
out bad moves and only funnels the

00:10:58,329 --> 00:11:03,459
promising moves to the effortful system

00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,900
and that can clearly would give that

00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:08,770
person at advantage against someone who

00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:14,930
had to use the effort 'full system to uh

00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:17,600
to manage to evaluate every move so this

00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:20,320
guy is steve freeman he's a programmer

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:24,350
in london and he's a programmer

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:27,850
consultant he bounces around a different

00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:31,610
jobs he's been involved with a large

00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:34,370
number of the interesting things that

00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:37,550
have happened in software in the past 15

00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:40,670
years he worked on the first XP company

00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:43,460
in London he was a co-author on the

00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:45,230
first paper about mock objects and so on

00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:48,140
and so forth so he's been around a long

00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:50,120
time and he's a good programmer and we

00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:52,850
were talking about this effort full

00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:56,720
automatic thing and he told me something

00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:58,990
along these lines some of what he has to

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:04,220
do as a consultant is he has to write

00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:07,220
bad code to give to people so that they

00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:09,590
can practice refactoring and what he

00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:12,170
said is that as he's become a better and

00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:15,700
better programmer it's gotten really

00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:19,310
really hard for him to write bad code

00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,750
now I didn't actually at the time we had

00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:23,300
a conversation I didn't think I was

00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:25,970
going to use him as a centerpiece for

00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:28,550
for a talk but so I could be Miss

00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:31,610
representing some of what he meant but

00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:35,050
the way I interpreted it as when he's

00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:39,260
looking at a problem the good code is

00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:42,140
obvious there it just leaps out in an

00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:46,880
effortless way whereas it is an effort

00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:49,700
to write the bad code he has to turn off

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,960
the automatic writing of good code in a

00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:57,350
order to write bad code and so my goal

00:12:52,960 --> 00:13:00,040
became to be like him because wouldn't

00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:03,590
it be great if the automatic system

00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:06,410
automatically wrote good code and it was

00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:08,720
an effort to write bad code instead of

00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:12,190
the other way around which is the way it

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:15,350
usually is so I've become interested in

00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:17,390
rather than working on the rational part

00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:19,430
of my brain the effortful part of my

00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:22,910
brain working on the automatic

00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:28,450
part of my brain and that means that I

00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:28,450
want to train the automatic system and

00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:35,839
I'm using as my model for this talk at

00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:38,390
least the way people like that person

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,399
that's my wife trained veterinary

00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:42,560
students at the University of Illinois

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,170
or in fact the way they train them at

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,290
Fort Collins up the road so there's a

00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:51,110
diagnostic distinction that's important

00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:53,420
in veterinary medicine and I believe in

00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:56,390
in human medicine but I'm not sure about

00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:58,459
that so in veterinary medicine one of

00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:01,010
the things you want to do when you're

00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:02,480
evaluating an animal in addition to

00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:05,300
things like taking its temperature

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,190
taking its blood pressure you also want

00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:10,640
to evaluate whether that animal is

00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:13,510
bright or dull so that's a diagnostic

00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:16,430
distinction that's valuable when you are

00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:18,020
working with an animal and the

00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:21,050
interesting thing about bright and dull

00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:23,720
is that to a veterinarian it's a

00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:26,570
perception it's the same thing as

00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:31,100
looking at a sheep and saying that sheep

00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:33,470
is green they look at a sheep for

00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:36,290
example and it is as obvious to them

00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:39,740
that the Sheep is bright or dull as it

00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:41,930
is to you and I that the Sheep is green

00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,640
but they don't start out that way they

00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:46,580
have to be trained their perception has

00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:48,860
to be trained and it's it's an integer

00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:50,870
it's an interesting process and I don't

00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:53,570
have time to talk about it in a lot of

00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:56,150
detail but here are three parts that are

00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:58,520
important first part is naming that's

00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:00,650
fairly straightforward they're not being

00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:03,500
asked to invent new diagnostic

00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:06,410
categories they're being asked to take

00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:09,529
two words and train their brain to

00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:12,140
associate those words with a subset of

00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:13,910
the universe of animals they'll see it

00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,709
takes a lot of repetition to get good at

00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:18,190
that that's pretty straightforward all

00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:20,660
kinds of learning takes repetition

00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:28,130
reaction however is the interesting

00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:29,900
thing so they do not a student of

00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:32,690
veterinary medicine does not learn to

00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,260
distinguish bright from dull by being

00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,960
shown

00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:38,120
on a bright cow and being told please

00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:40,580
list the characteristics that make this

00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,400
cow a bright cow so they don't put a cow

00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:45,080
up on stage during tests and have them

00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,060
do that sort of thing because that's

00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:50,770
engaging the effort 'full part of the

00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:54,170
brain it's the systematic step-by-step

00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:58,850
decomposing part of the brain and nor do

00:15:54,170 --> 00:16:02,390
they they say here is here is a dull cow

00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:06,020
please modify this dulk how to become a

00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:07,880
bright cow like change it's the way it's

00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:11,420
holding its ears so they look more

00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,860
bright they don't do that either which

00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:15,380
it seems like that'd be a dumb thing to

00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:18,860
do but consider that when we we teach

00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:21,740
people to improve code refactor code we

00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:24,230
say here's bad code change its

00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,790
step-by-step to make it good code that's

00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:28,310
not how they do their training

00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:30,710
essentially what they do in short is

00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:33,050
they present the student with an animal

00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:35,960
the student has to make a judgment

00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:38,300
bright or dull the student is corrected

00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:41,060
in that judgment and you simply repeat

00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:43,640
this process over and over and over

00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:46,760
again until the student gets to the

00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:48,650
point where they simply see the animal

00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:51,170
as being bright and dull and in fact

00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:53,240
asking someone how do you know if an

00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:55,550
animal is bright and dull strikes

00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:59,360
veterinarians as being kind of a stupid

00:16:55,550 --> 00:17:00,920
question you can just see it so we have

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,970
some of the same things the

00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:09,380
veterinarians have we have coat smells

00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:12,500
as documented in Fowler's book and these

00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:15,470
code smells are much more akin to things

00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,900
like brightness and dullness than they

00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:21,290
are to things like no high blood

00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:24,860
pressure or fast heartbeat in particular

00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:29,720
the probably the most important code

00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:32,060
smell is duplication and a very very

00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,310
shallow view of duplication is all about

00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:37,610
are there strings of text that are

00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:39,650
duplicates that is doesn't scratch the

00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:41,960
surface of what good programmers mean

00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:44,030
when they talk about duplication so I've

00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,320
worked with good programmers programmers

00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:48,419
better than me and they can see

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,240
application that is not apparent to me

00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:53,490
at all and those programmers talk about

00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,500
even better programmers who see

00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,570
duplication that the good programmers

00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:01,320
don't see and what they do is they

00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:03,690
describe you know as if with awe this is

00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,490
a particularly recollection of Ron

00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:08,460
Jeffries describing working with Kent

00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:10,740
Beck where Kent would sort of say well

00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,720
here's some code over here let's move it

00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:14,669
over here and let's change this a little

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,429
bit and and all of a sudden the

00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:20,039
duplication becomes obvious Tehran and

00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:22,590
then they can go ahead and fix it so we

00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:26,070
have that sort of we have the same sort

00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:28,860
of need to increase our perception when

00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:31,100
we're looking at code as a veterinarian

00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:34,370
does when they're looking at an animal

00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:36,929
though I think we have an advantage over

00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:40,559
veterinarians which is a veterinarian

00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:43,399
only gets to see a sick cow for a period

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:46,049
of a few days and then the cow goes away

00:18:43,399 --> 00:18:48,960
maybe the cow comes back but if it comes

00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:51,240
back it's got a different disease and it

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,580
might as well be a different cow as far

00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:58,399
as perceiving whether it's brighter dull

00:18:53,580 --> 00:19:02,070
is concerned but we are special in that

00:18:58,399 --> 00:19:05,519
we look at some code and then we leave

00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:09,960
the code and then time passes and we

00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:12,480
look at the code again and then we leave

00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,210
the code again and then we look at the

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,990
code again so we revisit the same code

00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:22,190
over and over and over again and I think

00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:25,110
that's helpful for us in learning how to

00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:26,909
how to improve our perception of what

00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:29,549
codes you'll wet where there's

00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:34,669
duplication or other code smells because

00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:39,120
I don't think I'm unique in that I often

00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:41,460
leave a piece of code with an awkward

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,679
feeling that there's I know there is

00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:48,210
something wrong with this code here I

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:51,210
don't know quite what it is but I I have

00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:52,980
to move on or I come back to some code

00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:55,350
and i'm working with that code and I

00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:58,029
can't pinpoint the reason but that code

00:19:55,350 --> 00:20:00,729
is just awkward to work with

00:19:58,029 --> 00:20:02,499
I can't see why it's awkward to work

00:20:00,729 --> 00:20:04,599
with in such a way that I can change it

00:20:02,499 --> 00:20:08,139
but if there's just something wrong with

00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:10,479
it and so I liken that to know there

00:20:08,139 --> 00:20:13,239
there's just something just out of reach

00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:15,429
that I can't quite get and sometimes I

00:20:13,239 --> 00:20:19,409
come back to the code and all of a

00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:23,979
sudden I get it so my perception has

00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:29,710
increased one slight small amount okay

00:20:23,979 --> 00:20:34,330
so um what we've got here is I think the

00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:38,679
the best way to learn to write good code

00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:41,440
is to revisit bad code or borderline

00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:44,229
code over and over and over again until

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:48,009
you've trained your automatic system to

00:20:44,229 --> 00:20:51,149
be better at recognizing it now it's

00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:54,849
hard to justify somebody paying a salary

00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:56,710
to say I have to revisit this code and

00:20:54,849 --> 00:20:59,019
revisit this code and revisit this code

00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:02,080
for my professional development but

00:20:59,019 --> 00:21:05,139
fortunately we get sat and me in general

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,509
we work using extreme programming and

00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:10,089
actually Ron Jeffries asked me to ask

00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:14,529
this question how many people have even

00:21:10,089 --> 00:21:17,169
know what extreme programming is okay so

00:21:14,529 --> 00:21:19,509
he'll be happy about that he he was one

00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:24,999
of the original extreme programmers and

00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:26,830
and he feels sad that scrum one so

00:21:24,999 --> 00:21:29,049
extreme programming is really really

00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:32,830
fascinating it's a it's a collection of

00:21:29,049 --> 00:21:34,269
techniques but the more I learn about it

00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:36,969
the more I learned that there's a lot

00:21:34,269 --> 00:21:40,059
going on under the surface and one of

00:21:36,969 --> 00:21:42,219
the things XP is about is about being a

00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:43,599
heavy heavy learning tool it's about

00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:46,359
learning as much as it is about

00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:49,719
performance and one of the ways that it

00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:52,149
makes us learn is by this phrase you

00:21:49,719 --> 00:21:54,399
aren't going to need it and that's

00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:57,099
justified in most of the extreme

00:21:54,399 --> 00:22:00,070
programming literature in economic terms

00:21:57,099 --> 00:22:03,159
which is to say when you write code if

00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:06,789
you anticipate how some other later

00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:09,729
future code will need to use the code

00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:11,320
you're writing there's a fair chance

00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:13,300
you'll be wrong

00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,760
and in that case you will pay the

00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:18,580
expense of writing the code and pay the

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:21,160
expense of not writing the code so given

00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:24,670
that we're all kind of bumbling clueless

00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:27,520
creatures your best bet economically is

00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:30,130
to only write the code you need but the

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,570
good thing for learning is if you do

00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:34,090
yeah Guinea that means you're going to

00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:37,210
be revisiting that code more and more

00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:43,000
and more and more often and so I think

00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:44,920
that is the key to to improving yourself

00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,370
as a programmer is to go back and

00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:50,170
revisit your code with the attitude that

00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:52,330
you're trying to train yourself to

00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:57,220
recognize things that you didn't

00:22:52,330 --> 00:23:00,460
recognize before in the code that brings

00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:03,790
us to another topic about learning which

00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:09,070
is you as a programmer situated in your

00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:10,870
world most of the time programmers so

00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:15,370
there was this one programmer I met who

00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:19,050
said my body is just a thing that keeps

00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:24,190
my brain from falling to the ground and

00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:26,710
he he is an extreme case because most of

00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:29,650
us think that we need something other

00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:32,140
than our brain we need a big monitor in

00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:34,600
an ergonomic chair and that's all we

00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:36,520
need for programming and learning but

00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:40,000
that's not actually true because we are

00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:42,280
embodied human beings and we are social

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,590
human beings and you have to take

00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:47,250
advantage of that in the tasks you do

00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:49,870
and in the learning you kind of do so

00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:52,510
I'm going to talk about that in terms of

00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:56,350
a phrase called set and setting I first

00:23:52,510 --> 00:24:00,520
came upon this phrase in reading a paper

00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:04,180
about jazz musicians and intravenous

00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:07,930
drug users who both use set and setting

00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:10,960
to craft the experience their different

00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:15,160
experiences set and setting originally

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:17,920
came about when discussing psychedelics

00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:20,440
and I actually I realized that you know

00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:23,920
I'm here in bold or telling you about

00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,850
psychedelics which is you know I'm sure

00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,830
you have farm

00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:28,750
more experience than I do with

00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:31,120
psychedelics but nevertheless you may

00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:34,180
not have heard this formalism about

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:37,110
psychedelics so sudden setting was

00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:41,890
coined by Timothy Leary who was a

00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:45,730
notable Harvard professor who was very

00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:48,220
into LSD in the 60s and the interesting

00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:51,360
thing about LSD was not only did he

00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:56,260
study it in his living room in Cambridge

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:59,980
in the 60s LSD had also been studied by

00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:04,750
the CIA in the 50s I think it was the

00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:07,510
50s and the CIA was looking at it as now

00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:09,910
we need a drug to use in interrogations

00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:12,730
is this a good drug so they did a lot of

00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:18,400
that sort of work and they classified

00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:22,240
LSD as an exam ex back and anxiety

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:26,250
inducing drug and that was not Timothy

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:30,000
Leary's experience of LSD at all so

00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:33,280
because he founded a mind-expanding not

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,580
anxiety inducing drug so his question

00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:40,780
was what what's what's the deal here why

00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:44,770
is the LSD experience so different for

00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:47,410
our CIA subjects as for people in my

00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:50,380
living room in Cambridge it's the same

00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:53,200
molecule in either case and his

00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:55,690
conclusion was that the drug experience

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,480
is not based it's not a function just of

00:25:55,690 --> 00:26:03,970
the molecule it's a function of set

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:07,360
setting and the molecule so set is about

00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:10,330
you it's about I mean set is alert you

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:14,320
you get set for something you take a

00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:16,570
position you adopt a stance so that's

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,910
part of the set is your base personality

00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:21,820
part is the expectations you bring to

00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:25,600
the experience part is your mood part or

00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:27,010
certain ritual acts of of preparation

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,320
and I'm underlying that because I'm

00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:31,150
going to talk about one of my ritual

00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:33,070
acts of preparation I use when I'm

00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:36,040
thinking about learning to be a better

00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:38,110
programmer setting is your environment

00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:40,600
it's the physical environment your

00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:44,410
and it's the immediate social

00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:47,260
environment we are herd animals a big

00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:50,110
part of our brain is tuned to paying

00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:53,350
attention to people physically near us

00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:55,390
so that affects that part of the setting

00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:59,400
affects the experience the entire

00:26:55,390 --> 00:27:03,040
culture me part of the reason that that

00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:05,710
the CIA got different results from

00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:07,990
Timothy Leary is that the culture

00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:10,540
Timothy Leary was working in was very

00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:13,780
different from the culture of the CIA

00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:16,900
both in the organizational culture and

00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:20,830
the larger culture of the country 50s

00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:23,169
versus 60s was a big cultural change so

00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:25,260
um so those are the ideas of set and

00:27:23,169 --> 00:27:29,380
setting and what I want to do now is

00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:31,750
there are these two people here who are

00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:33,790
going to do a demonstration these are

00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:37,419
famous tango dancers they're going to

00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:41,410
dance in a kind of a lousy setting looks

00:27:37,419 --> 00:27:43,660
like a gym floor watch in the beginning

00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:45,640
I think you can see though the pictures

00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:48,340
kind of blurry some of the things they

00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:50,440
do to establish their own set so that's

00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:52,390
one thing to watch for the other thing

00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:57,160
to watch for is I just think this is

00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:59,820
really pretty so a sound person put the

00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,820
sound on

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,420
you

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,190
okay this actually stops there because I

00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:08,330
have this whole other thing I do about

00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:11,390
the close relationship between tango

00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:15,260
test driven design and catching flyballs

00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:19,970
in baseball and the particular move he

00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:21,440
just made is relevant to that but if you

00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:23,750
want to hear that sign me up for a

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:30,290
lightning talk and I'll tell you briefly

00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:34,520
about that um so I dance tango who does

00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:40,630
anybody here dance tango there's one guy

00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:43,880
so don't contradict me here um tango is

00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:47,450
an unusual dance in that it is very very

00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:51,320
highly improvised and so especially for

00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:56,660
the follower who is typically a woman it

00:29:51,320 --> 00:30:01,670
is a dance that requires careful non

00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:05,090
attention to physical cues of the leader

00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:07,640
and I mean non attention because you

00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:09,290
have to train your automatic system to

00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:12,410
pay attention to those cues because the

00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:14,450
effort full system is too slow to be

00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:16,420
able to keep up with the leader one of

00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:18,770
the hardest things for women especially

00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:21,290
people like my wife who tend to over

00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:24,110
intellectualize things in tango is is

00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:28,370
just to stop thinking about it and let

00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:30,530
the man the leader move you so tango in

00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:36,380
my mind is associated with sensitivity

00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:38,180
and so when I want to prepare myself for

00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:41,540
a session where I I want to actually

00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:43,910
really learn I will actually make the

00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:46,100
same body

00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:49,580
movement as I do when I'm getting ready

00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:53,270
to start a tango dance which is I lean

00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:56,450
slightly forward I draw the body up put

00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:59,540
the chest out and to me that is a ritual

00:30:56,450 --> 00:31:02,530
that induces the appropriate set for

00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:06,260
learning you may have different rituals

00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:11,450
probably but rituals are important for

00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:15,920
this kind of thing I also do a setting

00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:19,670
and this is a odd Atia of mine I live in

00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:23,090
champaign illinois which is a university

00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:26,690
town university of illinois and for some

00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:30,440
reason noisy environments with lots of

00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:35,750
students bustling around puts me in the

00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:39,260
mood for learning more than sitting at

00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:41,720
home in my front window or I work or

00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:44,740
sitting in an office when I was in

00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:47,630
Chicago with the other people so oddly

00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:50,120
by paying attention to where I seem to

00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:54,680
respond best I've noticed that noise

00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:56,930
helps me learn and therefore I do try to

00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:59,570
set things up that way so I encourage

00:31:56,930 --> 00:32:02,740
you to do this sort of thing and that's

00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:06,530
really all that I have to say except

00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:08,900
you've been patient uh-uh and you

00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:10,820
haven't you haven't you've been nice to

00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:14,870
me you haven't laughed as much as I'd

00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:17,000
hoped but you've been lies to me so the

00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:21,350
reason one of the reasons i was hired at

00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,780
a get set was to be a closure programmer

00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:26,690
so i'm a closure and Ruby programmer I

00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:28,520
was actually introduced to closure by

00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:32,510
Glenn Vanderburgh who will be the last

00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:34,460
speaker at this conference I wrote a

00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:38,510
book called functional programming for

00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:41,780
the object-oriented program it is a it's

00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:43,220
a fairly popular book it's done really

00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:44,570
well if I'd known it was going to do

00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:46,670
well I would have gone through a

00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:49,130
traditional publisher but it's published

00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:54,590
by lean pub which means it's an online

00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:56,540
ebook and since you're nice I'm gonna

00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:02,000

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:09,020
