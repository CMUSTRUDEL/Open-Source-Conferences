Description: 
	It's not your fault. Code rots. We don't hold entropy against you, but we expect you to give a damn.

This story is about code that brings new meaning to the word 'legacy'. The accidental discovery of this body of code provoked a moral crisis. I wanted to pretend I hadn't seen it, yet I couldn't justify tiptoeing quietly away.

This talk examines the dilemmas we face when balancing our choices today with their cost tomorrow.

It's not your fault. Even so, it is your responsibility.
