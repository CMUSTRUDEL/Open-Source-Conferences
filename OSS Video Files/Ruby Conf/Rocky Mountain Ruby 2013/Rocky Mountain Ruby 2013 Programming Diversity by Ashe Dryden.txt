Title: Rocky Mountain Ruby 2013 Programming Diversity by Ashe Dryden
Publication date: 2020-01-27
Playlist: Rocky Mountain Ruby 2013
Description: 
	It's been scientifically proven that more diverse communities and workplaces create better products and the solutions to difficult problems are more complete and diverse themselves. Companies are struggling to find adequate talent. So why do we see so few women, people of color, and LGBTQ people at our events and on the about pages of our websites? Even more curiously, why do 60% of women leave the tech industry within 10 years? Why are fewer women choosing to pursue computer science and related degrees than ever before? Why have stories of active discouragement, dismissal, harassment, or worse become regular news?

In this talk we'll examine the causes behind the lack of diversity in our communities, events, and workplaces. We'll discuss what we can do as community members, event organizers, and co-workers to not only combat this problem, but to encourage positive change by contributing to an atmosphere of inclusivity.

Objectives: -Educate about the lack of diversity and why it is a problem -Examine what is contributing to both the pipeline issue as well as attrition -Isolate what is and isn't working -Inspire direct action by examining our own behavior and learning more about the people around us so we can empathize better

all right everybody good morning it's

00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:37,420
still morning I so I was here a few

00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:39,670
months ago for Boulder startup and i

00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,079
really love boulder and i came out and

00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,210
everybody warned me about the altitude

00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:44,590
sickness and i was like oh i'll also own

00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:48,070
the altitude sickness and the first time

00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:50,289
I was pretty ok but last night I totally

00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:52,000
fell prey to it so I promise I will

00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:56,800
never make fun of you for the way you

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,859
feel when you're hungover ever again not

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,270
not fun not fun uh so my name is ash

00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:03,460
dried and I talk a lot about diversity

00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:05,260
in tech I myself am a rubia stive been a

00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,549
programmer for 12 years this is

00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,770
something that's especially important to

00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:10,330
me because I am a woman i am a queer

00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,979
person but also because I care a lot

00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:14,080
about the people around me and I want to

00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:17,020
see everybody had the same access that

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:20,799
I've had so before we get started I just

00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:23,680
want to turn on my thing I just want to

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,689
thank some people I actually have been

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,830
very lucky to be able to kind of tour

00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:29,740
around the world and talk about this

00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:31,990
because a lot of companies sponsor me to

00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:34,689
do this so it's kind of like my nascar

00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:36,790
wall I don't work for anybody doing this

00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:39,759
so these people enable me to do that so

00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:41,470
thank you so my name is ash Dryden I'm a

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,290
striding pretty much everywhere online

00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:46,720
if you have any questions just as a

00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:48,040
heads up I'm hard of hearing so before

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,540
the end of the talk if you don't mind

00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,119
moving forward and speaking really

00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:55,360
loudly would make it easier for me so

00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:57,790
what is diversity we talk a lot about

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,409
diversity in tech and it we talk a lot

00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:01,540
about specifically women we talk about

00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:03,520
where are the women in tech and when I

00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,229
say diversity I mean more than gender I

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,399
mean more specifically than women and

00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:10,200
men I also mean that diversity being

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,909
a a set of various backgrounds

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,319
experiences and lifestyles that kind of

00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:16,379
add up to the way that we go through

00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:17,970
life the other thing to remember is that

00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:19,709
diversity is not always visible there's

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,650
a lot of things you can't see about me

00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:25,140
that make me different than you so

00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,730
diversity includes things like age young

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,859
and old if you look around the room

00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,439
you'll notice that a lot of people

00:02:27,859 --> 00:02:33,569
around you are probably at least 20

00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:37,409
years old 21 years old and probably the

00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:39,540
cap is around 45 or 50 and that's a very

00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:41,340
very big curve there so there's a lot of

00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,739
people I'm sorry if I excluded someone I

00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,690
heard someone laughing hahaha so there's

00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:47,129
a there's a very big range of people

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,659
there that we're missing it also

00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:51,139
includes things like physical and mental

00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:54,810
health age ability sexuality race

00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:56,069
economic class education and before we

00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,079
get started I want to kind of cover a

00:02:56,069 --> 00:02:59,670
few terms so we can all get on the same

00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:00,900
page so you know what I'm talking about

00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,930
and we can have these conversations

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,790
later so intersectionality is the idea

00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,200
that there are a lot of traits about you

00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,620
when you're born or the way that you go

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,889
through life the kind of changed the way

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:16,530
the society perceives you and and allows

00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:19,109
you to go through life intersectionality

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:21,209
is kind of the pancaking effect of all

00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:23,669
of the different traits so it's not just

00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:24,959
being a person of color it's also being

00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:28,500
a person of color who has disabilities

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,030
or who is also queer the way that the

00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,769
world looks at you is differently than

00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:35,129
somebody who is white and queer for

00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:37,620
instance so what does that actually mean

00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:39,510
in terms of people well in the United

00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,419
States women earn about eighty point

00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:45,120
nine percent of what men do and that

00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:46,169
sounds a little bit better than we have

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,239
been hearing but actually this

00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:50,280
percentage has dropped in the past three

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,650
years we've actually gone back a little

00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,690
bit and this is controlling for all

00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,379
other factors including education time

00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:01,139
in and away from the industry and

00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:03,599
experience so we know what women make

00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:05,579
now the difference between what latina

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:09,120
women make and met and white men make is

00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:11,609
huge it's really big I mean imagine if

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,169
tomorrow you went into work and your

00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:16,380
boss said we've decided to cut your

00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:19,440
salary basically in half would you be

00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,620
able to pay for your house to take care

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,010
of your family

00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:25,630
it impacts a lot of people so what else

00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,790
the unemployment rate in the United

00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:30,190
States is about 7.5 percent depending on

00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:32,160
who you ask and who you trust but for

00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:35,919
the blind community it's 10 times that

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,240
huge difference huge difference so the

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,430
next term will talk about is privileged

00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,449
and this is something that a lot of us

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,330
talked about in the social justice

00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:45,820
movement so kind of trying to find a way

00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:47,620
to make people more equal in society so

00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,900
privileged is basically an honored

00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:53,320
advantage that you get for being who you

00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:55,330
are born or who you grew up to be so for

00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,970
instance I myself I'm a white person I

00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,440
have a lot of privilege because of a

00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,729
white person the fact that I can stand

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,949
on the stage and talk to you about

00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:04,960
something like this as a white person is

00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:07,240
huge there are a lot of people who don't

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,900
have the same kind of opportunities that

00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,010
I do because I'm a white person so what

00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,010
kinds of things we get for that

00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:16,570
privilege better education access to

00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:18,190
technology at an earlier age we'll talk

00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:20,860
about that a little bit later a higher

00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:22,479
pay assumed competency that having to

00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,610
prove how smart you are is really

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,500
important and seen as a skill set

00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,910
instead of a set of traits so this is

00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,979
the difference between being a geek and

00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:33,220
being a girl geek you don't have to

00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:35,680
qualify the first one right so

00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,090
stereotype threat stereotype threat and

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,580
most people I think know what the word

00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:41,380
stereotyping we means but Siri type

00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,330
threat is basically being worried that

00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,639
you'll confirm a stereotype that exists

00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:47,860
about your group I think most people

00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:50,620
have seen this comic before there's XKCD

00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,840
on one side you have wow you suck at

00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,460
math man talking to another man on the

00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,550
other you have wow girls suck at math

00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:59,139
man talking to a woman and unfortunately

00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:00,760
this is this is a negative stereotype

00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:02,710
that exists about women the women aren't

00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,430
good at math I think I'm losing my mic

00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:07,539
women are good at programming and

00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:09,760
studies have shown that prompting a

00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:11,380
group based on race or gender and

00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,789
telling them at the opposite group does

00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,729
better than you at a certain thing

00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:19,510
actually makes them do worse when in

00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:20,590
reality there's no difference I think

00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:25,860
I'm gonna lose this is there a way to

00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:25,860
fix this not heaven here

00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:37,330
it makes it so much more visible with

00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:39,590
orange hair right my good cool all right

00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,360
so imposter syndrome this is something

00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:43,340
that affects everybody regardless of

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,100
race or gender or station and life

00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:48,020
sexuality it's basically the inability

00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,840
to internalize the things that you've

00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:53,570
been able to succeed at so you'll hear a

00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,970
lot of things like I'm I'm really bad at

00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:57,830
programming I'm stupid I don't know how

00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:59,300
to do this I could never stand up and

00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:01,280
talk to people about what I do because

00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,620
people would jump all over me for being

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,450
wrong I don't know enough I could never

00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,190
apply to work at a place like github

00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:09,140
because I'm just not smart enough and

00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:11,300
this is something like I said that a lot

00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:14,210
of people suffer from and it's really

00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:15,800
hard to overcome this is especially

00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:18,020
pronounced in groups that have a

00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,190
negative stereotype about them because

00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,200
they're they're listening to what

00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:23,480
society and the communities are saying

00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,940
about their abilities on top of how they

00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,650
feel about themselves these people are

00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,810
also less likely to apply for certain

00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:31,880
jobs less likely to submit a talk to a

00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:34,040
conference they're even less likely to

00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,750
come to a conference so take a look

00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:40,640
around you and notice who's missing from

00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:42,800
your community so I think one of the

00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,780
last one of the last definitions we're

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,250
going to learn is marginalized so if you

00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,890
think of like college rule notebook

00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:50,660
paper the blue lines that in the pink

00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:52,250
lines the margin is everything that

00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,600
exists outside of that pink area and

00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,430
that was kind of like where you drew all

00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,470
of your doodles and all of the stuff

00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:59,030
that wasn't important marginalized

00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,260
people fit into a certain group where

00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:02,390
their current their needs and concerns

00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:05,030
are kind of pushed out past that pink

00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:07,610
line they're not given the kinds of time

00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:10,160
and concern that other groups are and

00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:12,920
unfortunately society teaches us to do

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,880
this with everyone and I'm sure that

00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,410
you're sitting there and thinking to

00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,590
yourself and I'm different I'm logical

00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:20,630
and rational what you know as

00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:23,240
programmers we definitely believe

00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:25,760
believe about ourselves and I don't see

00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,160
gender and race and unfortunately I

00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:34,340
don't think this is gonna work for me my

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:35,870
ears weirdly shaped okay so even

00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,520
scientists and stem professors do this

00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:39,209
to each other there's a study that was

00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,219
done at Yale and they took

00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:42,899
two sets of professors there so these

00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:45,389
are some of the smartest people in the

00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:47,129
country right and they said here are two

00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:50,369
resumes tell me who you would rather

00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:52,529
hire what you would pay them and on a

00:08:50,369 --> 00:08:54,800
scale of one to seven how like you how

00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:57,240
likely you would be to work with them

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,949
they didn't tell them however that the

00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,559
two resumes were exactly the same the

00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:02,790
only difference was the first name one

00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:06,149
was named John and one was named

00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:08,009
Jennifer so exactly the same resume so

00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:09,329
they went back to them and said okay who

00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:11,189
would you rather hire on a scale of one

00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:15,540
to seven they gave John of four and

00:09:11,189 --> 00:09:17,369
Jennifer 3.3 same resume they said okay

00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:20,309
what would you pay Jennifer and what

00:09:17,369 --> 00:09:21,809
would you pay John they paid Jennifer 84

00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:25,319
eighty-seven percent of what they paid

00:09:21,809 --> 00:09:27,480
John same resume the killer part of this

00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:30,179
is that marginalized people do this to

00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,459
each other to these sets of professors

00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:35,189
were of mixed gender so women were

00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:37,559
rating women low men were raiding women

00:09:35,189 --> 00:09:39,329
low it didn't matter so we're kind of

00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:41,850
taught by society that some people

00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:46,139
unfortunately are worth less are not

00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:48,899
worthless but worth less or need need

00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:52,319
fewer things or are deserving of less

00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:53,759
things so how diverse is tech now that

00:09:52,319 --> 00:09:57,029
we've kind of established the horrors of

00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:59,610
this situation so if we look at and I'm

00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:02,249
sorry that a lot of these examples are

00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,389
us centric and women centric that just

00:10:02,249 --> 00:10:05,490
happens to you were a lot of the funding

00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:06,809
dollars come from but if you look at

00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,649
this graph for instance you'll look at

00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:09,779
the difference between the tech

00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:11,009
population in the u.s. population and if

00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:14,399
you look around the room I'm sure that

00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:16,829
it looks very similar to this women make

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,189
up about half of what we do in the u.s.

00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:22,529
population as we do in tech for blacks

00:10:20,189 --> 00:10:25,079
it's about half of the US population as

00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:27,119
exists in tech and then for Hispanic

00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:28,949
this is the scariest one there one of

00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:31,769
the largest groups in the United States

00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:33,959
and they only make up a third of people

00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:35,579
or a third of what they do in the u.s.

00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:39,689
population in tech there's a lot of

00:10:35,579 --> 00:10:41,369
people missing here so let's kind of dig

00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:42,689
deeper into one of those so we're gonna

00:10:41,369 --> 00:10:44,850
make up about twenty four percent of the

00:10:42,689 --> 00:10:47,100
industry but only three percent of all

00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:49,799
open source contribute contributors I'm

00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,769
sorry now think of how many jobs ask for

00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:52,860
you to have open source contributions

00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:55,260
before

00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,730
you even apply does that person even

00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,650
exist likely in your area or

00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:02,460
specifically for what you're looking for

00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:03,990
and this isn't just us this is all over

00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,850
the world unfortunately if we look at

00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:07,320
countries like India about eight percent

00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,840
of the people that are graduating with

00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,760
computer science degrees or women the US

00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,800
at 17 this is actually dropping

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,370
dramatically over the past 30 years the

00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:19,740
UK it's 18.2 Frances 20 Brazil is 20

00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,960
South Africa is 25 so you can see like

00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:24,000
this is all over the place it's not just

00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,890
us house there's nothing necessarily

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,090
terrible about the way that we do things

00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:31,650
it's a very big problem and a lot of

00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,820
times bike by the time I get to the

00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,350
point where i'm staying these statistics

00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,610
somebody will say well maybe women just

00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:37,320
aren't interested in programming like

00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:40,560
maybe you know if they wanted to be

00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,240
there they would but the first compiler

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,680
was written by a woman the first

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,240
programming language was written by a

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,150
woman so women weren't interested in

00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,100
this why would we invent it right or

00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:51,660
they'll say women aren't biologically

00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,870
predisposed to programming which is

00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:58,380
probably my favorite reaction um because

00:11:54,870 --> 00:12:00,030
I've I've I know definitely that there

00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,650
have been programmers who have had their

00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:03,450
lives saved because they've been able to

00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:08,040
outrun a cheetah because they were such

00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:13,050
great programmers all right it really

00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:14,490
helps so but sciences science has told

00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:17,730
us that there's no physical or

00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:20,370
biological difference when it comes to

00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:22,560
race or gender with regards to how it

00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:23,850
impacts somebody's ability to program so

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,460
what does this mean for us this is

00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:28,590
actually kind of great because it tells

00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:30,150
us that these are solvable things these

00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:32,430
are purely social and cultural

00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,750
constructs and we can we can overcome

00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:36,210
them it's not something that we have to

00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:38,310
go into people's heads and fix them it's

00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:41,910
we just have to learn how to deal with

00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:43,680
the situation and how to adapt so one of

00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:45,570
the countries that I left out before in

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,070
that group of countries where women were

00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:49,680
graduating from computer science was

00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:52,020
Bulgaria and this was a statistic I was

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,240
super shocked to find out like I know as

00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:56,970
an American with an American high school

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,670
education um I don't know much about

00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:02,010
Bulgaria I don't know that I've thought

00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,570
much about bulgaria in my life but I

00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:05,350
actually spent a lot of time researching

00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:08,350
Bulgaria after I found this

00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:11,080
and I found that when kids are growing

00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:13,360
up parents are just as likely to push

00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,890
girls into STEM fields which is science

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,020
technology engineering and math as they

00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:18,220
are boys this is not something that's

00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:20,170
gendered to them this is something that

00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,450
they see is really important to rebuild

00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:24,910
our country to improve their economy and

00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:26,770
to have a better society overall and

00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:29,410
they think everybody is as equally

00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:31,510
likely to be able to do this so we can

00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:35,260
get there we just have to kind of focus

00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:37,990
on it a little bit so uh why does

00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:40,510
diversity matter and I mean I met a lot

00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:44,530
of you it's hard to see but I met a lot

00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:47,680
of you the past day and a lot of us fit

00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:49,960
into the same kind of groups the vast

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,510
majority of us are white very many of us

00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:54,190
are male a lot of you fit the programmer

00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:58,660
stereotype that i like to call beard and

00:13:54,190 --> 00:14:00,220
glasses um so so it was for so to you

00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,900
beard and glasses folks why does

00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,120
diversity matter to you how does I mean

00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:06,190
does it actually affect your life does

00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,960
actually change the way that you go

00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:09,880
through life or your ability to do a

00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:13,570
good job or how successful you could be

00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:16,360
and it does it's actually kind of

00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:18,850
amazing how how greatly it impacts all

00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,430
of us science has shown that as racial

00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:23,410
and gender diversity increases sales

00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,970
revenue number of customers market share

00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:27,730
and profits relative to competitors

00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:31,450
competitors increase how many people

00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:34,320
would like arrays today far fewer people

00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:34,320
are raising our hands than I expected

00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:38,980
diverse teams are also able to solve

00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:40,300
complex problems better and faster which

00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,880
is kind of important when you're a

00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,710
programmer we're more creative and

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,100
stimulated when we're exposed to

00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:49,750
minority viewpoints and we also make

00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,120
better decisions and generate more

00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:53,530
innovation now considering the fact that

00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,290
technology is on the cutting edge of

00:14:53,530 --> 00:15:00,280
everything we are pushing forward every

00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:02,110
different kind of every different kind

00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,670
of product in the world all the

00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,350
different solutions when it comes to

00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:08,790
medicine when it comes to different

00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:11,920
areas in science when it comes to

00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:14,680
changing the way that we trade money

00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,360
even on stock markets this is extremely

00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,790
important if we're going to be

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,370
be as innovative as we're able to be and

00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:24,459
we know that we can do that by

00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:28,250
increasing the diversity why aren't we

00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:30,500
we know that the financial success and

00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:32,329
viability of a company are directly

00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,430
related to how diverse their teams are

00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:36,860
and still the vast majority of our teams

00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:38,870
are made up of beards and glasses and I

00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,700
love beards and glasses I love you guys

00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:42,350
I really do but I would like to see

00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,700
everybody be able to work with us

00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:50,660
everybody else work side-by-side with

00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:52,970
with us so so why do we have the lack of

00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,290
diversity I actually I talk about this

00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,579
all over the place and I talked about it

00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:58,040
last night at dinner and yesterday at

00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:59,630
lunch and and I talked about it in line

00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,680
I talked about this all the time it's

00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,850
something that's really important to me

00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,589
and everybody always wants to know like

00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:06,140
but where is the real problem coming

00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:08,500
from and there are a few different areas

00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:11,149
one is the pipeline so people coming in

00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,279
we have these cultural cues that kind of

00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:15,380
tell us that geeks look a certain way

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,779
geeks act a certain way they like

00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:20,570
certain things even as earliest

00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:22,089
childhood we're giving different toys to

00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:24,350
boys and girls and telling them that

00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:26,060
certain groups of people should be

00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:29,089
breaking things and remaking things and

00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:30,829
inventing things so from a very early

00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:33,199
age what kind of programming this into

00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:34,820
kids there aren't any famous role models

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:38,000
to represent a lot of different kinds of

00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:40,250
people we have problem with access to

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,750
technology where boys get the first

00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,070
computer at age 11 I have a lot of

00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,440
friends who will tell me gleefully I

00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:47,029
program I did my first program when I

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,640
was six I'm like that's awesome

00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:51,680
congratulations that's not the

00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,910
experience of most people though so how

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,690
much longer have you been programming

00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:58,339
then maybe your female counterparts well

00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:00,740
women get their four girls get their

00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:01,730
first computer about age 14 that's a big

00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:05,270
difference especially if you consider

00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:06,770
like puberty between 11 and 14 the

00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:08,419
amount of time that you spend sitting in

00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,770
your room because you really don't feel

00:17:08,419 --> 00:17:10,910
good about yourself and you're kind of

00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:13,040
freaking out about everything in your

00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:18,260
life like that's a lot of good computer

00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:20,660
time right so yes so there's also lower

00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:22,400
computer ownership and adoption rates

00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,780
for broadband when it comes to

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,449
african-american and hispanic households

00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:29,390
the united states but they also adopt

00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:30,710
smartphones at a much higher rate so now

00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:33,470
think about

00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:36,230
work for a second think about whatever

00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:39,220
web app you have for work and think

00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:42,380
about what you're either mobile or your

00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:44,630
your web at your iOS app or Android app

00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:47,240
look like can you do as much as you can

00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:49,309
on the desktop version how much more

00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,840
frustrating is it to try and do

00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:52,820
something on your phone that it would be

00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,960
if you just had a computer I can't tell

00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,520
you how many times I'm just like

00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,899
whatever I'm just gonna wait until I can

00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,669
be on my computer because this is so

00:17:56,899 --> 00:18:00,799
frustrating it's just not worth the

00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:02,750
extra time it's gonna take that's most

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,760
that's very many people's experience

00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:08,330
with the Internet as a whole it's just a

00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:10,730
frustrating experience so access to

00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:12,350
quality education is a big one it's one

00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:14,570
of the greatest indicators of earning

00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:15,830
potential we have a lot of poor

00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:17,630
neighborhoods in the united states that

00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:19,549
have their libraries are being defunded

00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,169
their schools are being shut down

00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:23,029
chicago had a ton of schools that were

00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:24,350
shut down and kids are being bussed to

00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:26,450
schools that are an hour hour and a half

00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:28,490
away thinking about think about adding

00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:31,250
an extra three hours to your school day

00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:32,779
every day think about the fact that a

00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,950
lot of schools require you to type up

00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,270
your homework now and you don't have a

00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:38,179
computer at home in your library was

00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:40,370
shut down schools in poor neighborhoods

00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:42,710
have lower quality science and math

00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:44,059
programs cities have actually shown that

00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:46,370
there's a twenty five percent difference

00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:48,080
between readiness of african-american

00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:49,220
and Hispanic students as compared to

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,640
white students when they get into

00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:55,669
college so they're already basically a

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:59,750
year behind now consider how expensive

00:18:55,669 --> 00:19:05,000
colleges consider the the difference in

00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:06,980
wealth between those communities access

00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,120
to health care when you look at groups

00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,580
like people have color people with

00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,020
disabilities LGBTQ people they'll have

00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:15,500
less access to quality health care

00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:17,480
they're less likely to risk losing a job

00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,980
or moving to another job even if it's

00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,870
more profitable and a better experience

00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:22,909
for them because if they lose that

00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:25,279
health care or they risk a lapse in

00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:26,690
their health care that could mean not

00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:29,120
having medication that could save their

00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:32,330
life that can mean not being able to get

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,700
their kids shots women are more likely

00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:36,950
to be to be caregivers both of children

00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:39,440
and adult dependents so when you're

00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:42,080
looking at having a business that asks

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,230
people to work 50 60 hours a week at the

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,390
drop of a hat

00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:48,540
and you have to go home and take care of

00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:50,220
an ailing parent that greatly impacts

00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:52,080
whether or not you're going to go for

00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,280
that job or whether or not you're going

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,919
to get a promotion because you're not

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:58,290
putting in all those extra hours so the

00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,580
second area is attraction like I said

00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:01,020
before we kind of have a lack of role

00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,450
models we're not seeing people that are

00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:06,000
like us representing companies or at

00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:09,870
conferences or in the top of communities

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,490
and we're less likely to see people that

00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:13,620
are like a struggle as well and that

00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:16,860
part is kind of important we need to see

00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:18,780
people like us kind of overcome things

00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,730
that that exist in society because this

00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,380
isn't just a problem in tech but it's

00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:23,730
kind of a specially amplified in tech

00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,890
because there's such a lack of diversity

00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:27,090
we need to see those people succeed and

00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:30,000
we're not seeing them at the rates that

00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:32,040
we need to we have this thing about a

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,890
geek stereotype think back to you every

00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:37,140
movie I have to have this tumblr blog

00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:40,799
called geek film festival they go as

00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:44,130
like a list of all of these basically

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:45,480
like hacker esque movies like anywhere

00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:48,480
there's a really smart computer

00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,760
programmer and I can only think of two

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,040
that have a female programmer in them

00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,630
none of them have a programmer who's a

00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,850
personal color so you have this kind of

00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:58,650
geek stereotype where their beards and

00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:00,120
glasses right there's somebody who's

00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:02,220
socially awkward which is a very

00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,419
unfortunate a stereotype that we have

00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,520
because many of us are not socially

00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:08,160
awkward we're unpopular we live in our

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,850
parents basements we smell bad we're

00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:14,700
really snarky and mean to each other now

00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:16,950
imagine if you're thinking about what

00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,600
kind of job you want to go into for the

00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:21,210
for the probably the rest of your career

00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,620
would that attract you if you didn't

00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:24,000
know any other geeks and you didn't know

00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:27,270
the best stereotype wasn't necessarily

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,770
true and then the stereotype hinders us

00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:31,830
there was a study that was done at a

00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:33,960
university where they had a class of

00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:36,660
women and they brought in somebody who

00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,850
met the geek stereotype and this person

00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:40,590
taught their class and they found that

00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:43,380
at the end of the year more than half of

00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:45,270
the women had dropped out now an

00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,100
interesting thing is the gender of the

00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:49,320
person who met that geek stereotype

00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:51,179
didn't matter if it was a woman or if it

00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,159
was a man it was irrelevant if they

00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:54,659
could not see themselves in that person

00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:56,160
that was teaching them they were

00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:57,870
automatically thinking am I gonna fit

00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:00,090
in am I gonna have any friends here I'm

00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:01,560
so different am I going to be miserable

00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:04,610
the entire time I'm in this career

00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,610
because I'm just gonna feel so isolated

00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:10,470
so attrition is the third area this is

00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:12,870
this is a statistic that really scares

00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:15,630
me fifty-six percent of women leave tech

00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:18,990
within 10 years and this is twice the

00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:21,000
rate of men and this is accounting for

00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:24,690
women leaving for childcare or for

00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,750
having children so why are women leaving

00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:29,130
it's such a greater rate than men and

00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,110
this is a really interesting kind of

00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:33,420
ramp up to like the longer you're in the

00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:35,550
industry you're the more likely you are

00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:37,020
to leave I'm very happy that I've been

00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:38,610
able to defy this but I feel like I

00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,020
fight against it every day and I can't

00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:42,210
tell you how many times that I've said

00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:44,280
to myself this is gonna be the thing

00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:46,470
that is gonna make me not want to

00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,550
program anymore I am NOT gonna want to

00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:50,820
do this anymore because i'm just so

00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:52,710
miserable and i don't i don't want to

00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:56,820
feel this way every single day waking up

00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:58,920
trying to do something that I love the

00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:01,080
the other thing is harassment and this

00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:03,210
is something that is really difficult

00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,180
for me to talk about on this past week

00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:07,800
there was a horrific act of violence

00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:09,300
against female programmer in another

00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:14,550
community and both of them are

00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:15,920
programmers and I watched as a lot of

00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:19,140
people stood out for the person who

00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:20,640
attacked her and I also watched as they

00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:23,420
turned around and attacked her for

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,100
coming forward that's horrifying

00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:28,740
absolutely horrifying about two months

00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:30,390
ago I asked people if they had ever

00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,420
experienced sexual harassment or any

00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:36,240
other kind of harassment at work if they

00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:37,800
went forward to HR or to a boss about it

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:42,180
if they would contact me and let me know

00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:45,000
what happened 25 people responded 23 of

00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:48,210
the 25 were fired in the following three

00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,540
months after reporting so we have these

00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:53,910
mechanisms for reporting but it doesn't

00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:55,560
say much if we're willing to kind of

00:23:53,910 --> 00:24:00,570
drop these people off a pier after they

00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:01,650
do it's really really terrifying people

00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:05,310
are marginalized groups are twice as

00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:08,020
likely to be harassed or mistreated men

00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:09,820
are half is likely to even notice

00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:11,290
that I'm sorry not just men people that

00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,970
aren't in marginalized communities are

00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:14,770
half as likely to notice that people are

00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:20,500
getting harassed a lot of this stuff is

00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:22,390
really subtle it's hard to see this is

00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,800
something that is kind of shocking to me

00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:25,480
because after being after making the

00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,160
industry for 12 years I have a lot of

00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,080
stories I think that if you talk to you

00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,840
any person of color if you talk to you

00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,880
any woman or any LGBTQ person or any

00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,620
person with disabilities you'll hear

00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,120
store a horror stories from then about

00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,140
all these things that have happened to

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,130
them and they have you know kind of

00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,540
pushed through because they're just like

00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:43,810
whatever some people are jerks I can

00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:46,000
deal with it and everybody has those

00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:47,230
stories and it's sad to me that we have

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,820
to have those stories we kind of have to

00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:50,050
push through this is something extra

00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,810
that we have to do on top of our jobs

00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:54,780
every day on top of dealing with some

00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:57,430
jerk in the issue queue is on github

00:24:54,780 --> 00:25:01,930
this is something extra on top of all of

00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:05,110
that so discrimination we have a problem

00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:07,240
with pay advancement in job offers for

00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:09,130
these marginalized people men are 2.7

00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,410
times more likely than women to be

00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:12,610
promoted to high-ranking jobs and this

00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:14,110
is considering the fact that they're

00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:18,310
equally likely to be in middle

00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:20,080
management and I hear a lot of people's

00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:22,600
I had to work hard to get where I am and

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,190
they should too and I totally understand

00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,720
i don't discount that you had to work

00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,730
really hard to where you are i had to

00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,860
work really hard to but when you're

00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:32,830
piling on top all of these other things

00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:35,140
think about how much harder people have

00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:38,320
to work just to exist in this industry

00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:40,390
every single day so like i said i don't

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,280
discount that you had to work hard but

00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:45,520
kind of piling all these extra things

00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:49,870
onto these ppl makes it so much more

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:52,660
difficult so what can we do to help this

00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:54,040
stuff what can we do to stop it i know a

00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,450
lot of people have asked me that like I

00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,790
don't want to be part of the problem I

00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:00,370
don't think I'm part of the problem what

00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:01,900
can I do to change this stuff and the

00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:03,630
cool thing is that we can change it and

00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:06,100
all starts it starts with all of us

00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:08,020
education is a Trojan horse to empathy a

00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:10,180
lot of people are not going to seek out

00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:12,310
this information on their own so let

00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:14,340
them know these statistics let them know

00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:17,830
asked ask people to tell their stories

00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:19,630
help encourage people get to know people

00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:20,500
that are different than you I play this

00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:22,630
game when I go to calm

00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,190
because I'm actually like as outgoing as

00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:25,870
I seem I'm actually a really anxious

00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:27,730
nervous person when it comes to new

00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:28,690
people so kind of find the people that

00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:31,600
I'm comfortable with and I'll kind of

00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:33,010
glom onto them and like like very shyly

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,660
like walk around with them and be like

00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:36,340
please introduce me to people this is

00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:38,620
really weird and scary and I totally get

00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:40,390
that so don't feel like I'm forcing you

00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:42,460
out of your comfort zone so I play this

00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:44,830
game where I pick a color at the

00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:46,180
beginning of every day and whoever is

00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:49,600
wearing that color I have to go up and

00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:51,310
talk to them so I'll say okay I'll pick

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,230
yellow which because a lot of people

00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:55,360
don't wear yellow so star sure so easy

00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:57,460
right so I'll go up and talk to every

00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,710
person that's wearing yellow so I know

00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:01,570
that I'm not discriminating about who

00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:04,300
I'm going up to based on what they look

00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:07,560
like or if I haven't seen them around

00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:09,130
before cuz anybody can wear yellow and

00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:12,040
remember that bias and discrimination

00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:13,420
are often subtle I tell my stories about

00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,560
the kind of experiences that I've had to

00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:16,540
my grandmother cuz my grandmother is

00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,040
also a programmer which I didn't realize

00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:20,560
until about 10 years ago I thought that

00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:22,990
was awesome um and she said you know

00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:25,270
when I was a programmer on all of the

00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:28,810
programmers for women and i worked at

00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:30,190
this insurance company in chicago and we

00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:34,150
all worked in the middle of the office

00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:36,970
in a steel cage that locked from the

00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:37,840
inside and like my jaws on the floor and

00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:39,250
i was like i don't know what you're

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,140
talking about Lee maybe you dreamed this

00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:44,290
is this does not even sound like a real

00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:45,700
thing it's very scary sounding and she

00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:47,020
said he was because they couldn't the

00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,430
their managers found that they weren't

00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,600
getting as much work done because men

00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:51,880
would come up and talk to them and

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,030
harass them and touch them so they had

00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:58,060
to be locked in a cage like zoo animals

00:27:54,030 --> 00:28:00,160
so's like well on the plus side I'm not

00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:02,200
locked in a cage every day so thank you

00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:04,000
thank you for contributing to that I

00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:07,900
appreciate it there's a lot of progress

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:11,170
that has been made but but that kind of

00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:12,550
thing isn't uh that that overt stuff

00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:14,710
isn't necessarily what's happening

00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:16,450
anymore a lot of people know that like

00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:17,740
when somebody's walking by slapping them

00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:21,340
on the ass isn't the thing you're

00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:22,810
supposed to do right uh and the problem

00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:24,160
is that that's what we're educating

00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:27,310
people for we're saying you know this

00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:29,140
kind of touching people is not okay and

00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:32,080
most people don't do that so that's

00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:35,409
awesome but I also

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,549
i also want to help kind of reinforce

00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:40,720
the idea that a lot of this stuff is

00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:42,429
subtle I with a lot of different friends

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,630
and I'm kind of interested to see the

00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:46,299
reactions that people have to them

00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:48,490
versus to me I got quite often people

00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:51,309
people especially before I had bright

00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:52,690
hair would ask like oh so he's your

00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:54,640
boyfriend what do you do I'm like no

00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:56,799
actually we're just friends and we speak

00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,649
at conferences together but um we're not

00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:02,110
together at all or they would I still

00:28:59,649 --> 00:29:03,580
get a conference relatively recently and

00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,950
I went on Satan said hi I'm a programmer

00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:07,360
this is what I do lo wah and then at the

00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:09,340
after party three people came up and

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,929
asked me if I was a project manager now

00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:12,159
do they mean something mean by that no

00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:13,720
of course not they just wanted to know

00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,159
what I what I did for a living and

00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,470
wanted to have a conversation with me

00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:19,750
but at what point in time am I allowed

00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:22,000
to be upset when people keep coming up

00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:23,649
to me and assuming you don't look like

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,690
me so I assume you know do the same kind

00:29:23,649 --> 00:29:27,250
of stuff that I do and I know a lot of

00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:29,260
people that are like you do that other

00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:31,570
thing like at what point am I allowed to

00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:33,940
be upset that people think that I can't

00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:35,529
do what they do and I don't want to get

00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,549
crabby at people because they assume a

00:29:35,529 --> 00:29:37,899
project manager cuz there's nothing

00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:39,789
wrong with being a project manager and

00:29:37,899 --> 00:29:42,519
they don't mean it maliciously but it

00:29:39,789 --> 00:29:44,019
kind of hurts me too so one of the

00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:46,269
things we can do is learn to apologize

00:29:44,019 --> 00:29:47,440
this is something that I'm trying really

00:29:46,269 --> 00:29:48,669
hard to get better out I don't want

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,190
anybody to think that I'm perfect in any

00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:52,720
of this at any of this stuff um so

00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:54,460
apologizing is really easy it's just

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,529
like making ice if you've ever seen the

00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:59,289
recipe online for making ice which is

00:29:56,529 --> 00:30:01,269
very easy it's get an ice cube tray fill

00:29:59,289 --> 00:30:03,880
it with water shocker put it in the

00:30:01,269 --> 00:30:05,889
freezer right cool awesome so making ice

00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,809
is easy so was apologizing and the more

00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:09,760
we do it the easier it is so the three

00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:12,580
steps for apology are what I did was

00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:15,309
wrong I'm sorry I'll try my best to not

00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:17,260
do it again pretty easy stuff so it's a

00:30:15,309 --> 00:30:20,110
really good way to defuse a situation I

00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:22,720
mean talk about these issues openly it

00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:24,279
gives the people gives people around us

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,169
more power to stand up if they see

00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:27,220
things going wrong but it also educates

00:30:26,169 --> 00:30:28,960
the people that they're standing on the

00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:30,399
sidelines trying to see you know I don't

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,169
really know how I feel about this I

00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:35,679
don't know enough about it to kind of

00:30:32,169 --> 00:30:38,230
jump in when somebody does something

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,809
wrong especially online like I should

00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:43,000
almost have this a macro in Twitter just

00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:45,190
that's not cool and actually I've seen

00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,670
that this has worked quite a lot like I

00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,140
have

00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:49,600
a friend that was talking about

00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:51,040
something being and I hate that

00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,200
word like it's something that I used a

00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:55,540
lot when I was younger and when I became

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,220
an adult quite a few years after I was

00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:58,960
in adult actually somebody said hey you

00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:00,970
shouldn't say that word he goes really

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,320
embarrassed my face turned red and I

00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:03,460
like my first reaction was to get

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,140
defense and like I'm not a bad person

00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:08,950
like that's just a word that everybody

00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:10,540
uses but I've tried really hard and I'm

00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:13,270
I'm happy that I've eradicated that word

00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:14,890
for my language but it's hard to do like

00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:16,900
guys is another word that I'm trying to

00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:19,930
stop saying because we use it to mean

00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:21,070
like a group of people of any gender but

00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:22,300
when you like are walking down the

00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:24,610
street and you say hey I'm at these two

00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,750
guys used in that they're both male so

00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:27,550
I'm trying that's just one that thing

00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:30,660
I'm trying to stop saying that's really

00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:33,070
hard we can have hard conversations

00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:35,830
influence change in our communities and

00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:37,690
workplaces talk about the kinds of

00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:40,480
things that other people face we can

00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:41,890
increase education and access somebody

00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,690

this stuff you're actually girls with

00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:52,060
parents in stem are statistically way

00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,340
more likely to also follow their parents

00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:55,360
into stem so just be there talk to them

00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:58,060
about what you do and give them the

00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,500
access to the stuff that you do you can

00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:01,540
help facilitate events from marginalized

schools and groups please do this at

00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,980
schools and groups that don't normally

00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,210
have access to this information you

00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,130
probably don't need to go into rich

00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:25,870
neighborhoods and talk to them about

00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:28,600
computers because they have super nice

00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:30,880
computer labs right you can commit

00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:33,040
financial resources how many of you are

00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,430
donating money to your college or like

00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:37,570
alma mater right now few of you okay do

00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:39,940
you think that they still need all that

00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:42,250
money there are a lot of technical

00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:43,600
colleges historical black colleges

00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:45,700
women's colleges that could use that

00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,930
money a lot more so think about even if

00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:49,330
you want to continue to donate maybe

00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:51,370
split that donation with another with

00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:53,980
another institution that could use the

00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:55,510
money more you work with colleges and

00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:58,000
universities to kind of decrease their

00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:58,780
biases by asking them what are you doing

00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,600
to help students who

00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:03,460
less access to technology we can remove

00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,040
bias from our educational institutions

00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:08,890
in a really easy way harvey mudd i urge

00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:10,330
you to look up harvey mudd they did a

00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:12,790
really cool thing where they increased

00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:15,100
the number of female seus grads by

00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:17,260
asking one question have you programmed

00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,970
before they hadn't they put them in

00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:21,130
another room so they all were with their

00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:22,390
peers and it was a safe place to learn

00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:25,210
they didn't feel like these people are

00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:27,520
so far ahead of me I'm dumb I'm never

00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:30,510
gonna get this and it was so simple for

00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:32,170
them to do we can change our workplaces

00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:33,610
especially if you think about what the

00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:36,220
about page of your website looks like

00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:37,330
right now there's this awesome tumblr

00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:41,080
and by awesome I mean absolutely

00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:43,240
horrific called 100% men and it's a

00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:45,160
tumblr of all of these businesses that

00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:47,320
we really respect some user products and

00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:49,510
their services and almost all of them

00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:51,550
all of the executives all of the cue on

00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:54,520
management almost all the people that

00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:57,370
work there are almost all men almost all

00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:59,290
white men we can change our culture it's

00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:00,820
a lot harder to retain than recruit and

00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:04,780
our companies you can think of your

00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:07,240
culture as a garden you want to value

00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:08,530
variety and prune the weeds just because

00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,700
somebody is an awesome program or

00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:12,669
doesn't mean they're not hurting other

00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:14,560
people we can change our job listing

00:34:12,669 --> 00:34:15,760
languages or languages and requirements

00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:19,990
to make sure that they're not gendered

00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:22,659
remove things like he guy dude man bro a

00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:25,780
lot of those things turn people off men

00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:27,940
and women don't require a CS degree as I

00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:29,950
pointed out before a lot of women do not

00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,600
have CS degrees a lot of people do not

00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:33,250
people of color do not have CS degrees

00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,300
if on top of that you're acquiring that

00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:38,980
they've made open source contributions

00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:40,780
that person doesn't exist ok we can

00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:44,080
check to make sure our benefits are

00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:46,090
inclusive of same-sex partners that we

00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,919
have trans inclusive health care that we

00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:50,850
have maternity and paternity leave

00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:53,080
policies that are kind on both parents

00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:54,820
offering flex times make sure that

00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,500
people can get to medical appointments

00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:58,180
and that kind of thing make sure that

00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:01,360
people are being paid equally by doing a

00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:03,640
regular payroll audit do things like

00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:05,020
mentoring and career goal attainment ask

00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:07,000

up with a mentor and give them some time

00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:17,940
