this is awesome because I can't kick

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,150
myself off the stage I had written my

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,269
name there I just need one minute for

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,310
this thing when i pair with people who

00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:22,439
are not used to pairing a whole lot

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,390
sometimes I see the fall in which you

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,269
saw me dude this morning where is that

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:31,710
window again so don't ever do that and

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:33,900
go to go to this page on Z shifted

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,520
install this thing and use these three

00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:39,240
fingers put them on command option

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,620
control em makes it maximize see centers

00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,460
it or makes it smaller you press it

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:46,620
three times and recycles through that or

00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:49,410
when you're soloing and you need to once

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,150
again get that Netflix screen in the

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,370
bottom right now doesn't work it's too

00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:56,700
small but so you need to have netflix on

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,110
one side and your code on the other then

00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,100
we'll use this and you just move it all

00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,690
around with your keyboard and you're

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,049
very precise at what you move where and

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,399
they won't overlap the previous speaker

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,429
was Enrique failed to mention his name

00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:12,140

00:01:08,429 --> 00:01:12,140
