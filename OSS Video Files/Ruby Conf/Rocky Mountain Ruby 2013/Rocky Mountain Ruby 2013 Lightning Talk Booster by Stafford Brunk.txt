hi everyone I'm Stafford bronchi work

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,320
for custom ink you might recognize us we

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,259
printed the shirts that it's terrible

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,890
that resolution so I just wanted to

00:00:19,259 --> 00:00:25,380
bring up a new product we just launched

00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:27,839
its called booster it is a fundraising

00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:31,619
platform right now it is fundraising

00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:35,580
with t-shirts so basically how it works

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:37,050
you go there you create your t-shirt

00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,660
design and then it's like Kickstarter

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:44,030
with t-shirts the reason I'm bringing

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:46,920
this up is mostly because what was it

00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:49,890
there is a booster fundraiser going on

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:57,990
right now for flood relief sorry I had

00:00:49,890 --> 00:01:00,360
all these pulled up on my other so if

00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:02,910
you go to booster calm / CEO flood

00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,409
relief we're trying to raise money for

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,329
this shirt design is actually a pretty

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:09,210
cool design they've got about nine days

00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:10,649
left to go in their campaign they'll

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,170
raise about 1,500 bucks if their

00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:14,729
campaign ends up meeting its goal of 150

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,999
shirts they got a little bit of a ways

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:20,369
to go you can see it's 20 bucks a shirt

00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:23,009
and then we basically print them at cost

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:24,659
and ship them out to them so anything

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:26,310
that's left over it gets sent directly

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,469
to in this case it's the crossroads

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,210
recovery team this organizer chose to

00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:33,030
donate to that so again that's booster

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,280
calm / co flood relief and i'll go ahead

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:38,240
and tweet that and copy Rocky Mountain

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,240
Ruby thanks
