00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:25,850
my name is Patrick Leonard and I think

00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:28,340
this is too close and I head up the

00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:30,519
technology group at iTriage how many

00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:34,149
people have heard of iTriage

00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:37,519
okay is it because you saw her way in

00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:40,819
well good so iTriage is oh is a local

00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:44,420
company we were founded and were based

00:00:40,819 --> 00:00:48,469
in downtown Denver we were founded five

00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:50,839
years ago and what the reason we found

00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:52,760
the company is to help people take

00:00:50,839 --> 00:00:54,019
control of their health care and health

00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,149
care is something you probably don't

00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:57,649
think about a lot you hear it on the

00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:59,269
news health care reform the political

00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:01,159
battles and all that kind of stuff but

00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:03,559
it's actually a huge problem for all of

00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:06,049
us it's the fact that our health care

00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:09,229
industry is a mess is the reason that

00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:11,719
it's costing 16% of our GDP on the way

00:01:09,229 --> 00:01:15,920
to 20% it's a big piece of our national

00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:17,420
debt and we really believe that it's a

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,320
generational challenge that we have to

00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:23,719
take up and fix and so we set to to use

00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:27,140
technology to put control back in the

00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:28,609
hands of consumers all of us to take

00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:31,130
control of our healthcare so that's why

00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:33,679
we started the company and we've made

00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:37,219
really great progress we just celebrated

00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:39,109
our 10 millionth download so iTriage has

00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:44,509
been downloaded over 10 million times

00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:47,600
around the world thank you and and it's

00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:49,159
used by 3 million people every month so

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,659
we've got a lot of people using the app

00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:55,729
to to manage their health care and and I

00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:56,990
guess so what does that mean manage your

00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:58,880
health care well think about what you

00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,229
can do with with your mobile devices now

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,119
right take your phone out of your pocket

00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:03,049
well in it if you haven't down the tight

00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:06,619
triage take your phone out of your

00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:08,599
pocket okay and and then think about

00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:09,619
what you can do and what you do every

00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:10,909
day you don't even think about it you

00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:11,569
message your friends you can download

00:02:10,909 --> 00:02:13,790
music

00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:16,939
book a flight you can connect to people

00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,930
that you haven't talked to in years now

00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:20,840
think about what you can do with

00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:22,819
healthcare on your phone or your iPad or

00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,439
whatever and it's it's kind of pathetic

00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:26,450
you can't you can make a phone call

00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:28,489
really it's kind of what you do you call

00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:31,040
a doctor so we're trying to change that

00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:33,230
and so with I triage you could say well

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,689
a my stomach hurts you can go into the

00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,489
app and say my stomach hurts and we have

00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:38,959
a machine learning based symptom checker

00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:40,879
that knows how to ask you follow-up

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,069
questions away a doctor would do you

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:47,060
also have this you also have this based

00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:48,349
on your age and your gender and then it

00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,730
helps guide you to the right level of

00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:52,040
care so that then when you get it taken

00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:53,449
care of it doesn't cost you your whole

00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,620
fortune you get to the sort of right

00:02:53,449 --> 00:02:57,680
level of care don't go to the ER for

00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:59,900
everything we also provide secure cloud

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,370
storage it syncs your data securely

00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,049
across your devices so kind of

00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:05,750
everything you need to to manage your

00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:07,790
healthcare and and that's it's a lot of

00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,409
work building an app that does

00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:11,389
everything that I described is a lot of

00:03:09,409 --> 00:03:12,799
work and most of that work happens on

00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:16,099
the server side and most of it happens

00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:18,290
in rails and so we built I triage

00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:21,829
originally as a rails app five years ago

00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:24,079
and about two years ago as we were

00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:25,879
really growing so I company about three

00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:29,209
years ago and as a small team as me and

00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:31,239
a couple other developers and about two

00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:35,840
years ago we were getting big enough

00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:38,000
that I realized that that we were

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,949
outgrowing the the single app that we

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,780
had and it wasn't going to scale as we

00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:44,180
started hiring more people we're really

00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,949
gonna run into problems because you get

00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,359
enough people in a codebase I'm sure a

00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:49,639
lot of you have had this experience you

00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:51,919
have people in a codebase and everything

00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:53,030
just slows down so weari architected the

00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:57,019
product as a service-oriented

00:03:53,030 --> 00:04:00,169
architecture driven by you know restful

00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:02,209
api s and we now have over 20 rails apps

00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:05,810
running in production that are the

00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:07,129
backend of iTriage and it's it's been

00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,359
really interesting it's been a lot of

00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:11,359
work there's a lot of stuff we had to

00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:14,569
figure out along the way but to get a

00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:16,310
big rails app going the solution we came

00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:18,949
up with was to have lots of little rails

00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:21,099
apps and so that's the direction we went

00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:23,389
it's been been really really successful

00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:24,180
and that's how that's how we run it

00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:27,570
today

00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:29,820
and so I kind of want to just give you

00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:32,729
the overview of our experiences as sort

00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:34,940
of a longtime rail shop and a local rail

00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:37,139
shop we've got I think 17 people here

00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,880
from from hi treehouse from our

00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:41,850
development group so we got a bunch of

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,940
people here and this is our third year

00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:46,650
sponsoring this conference and I'm just

00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,660
really thrilled to be here if you have

about or questions you want to ask

00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,630
things that we've learned along the way

00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,180
we've made lots of mistakes and we've

00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,770
learned lots along the way and if you

we be be thrilled to talk to you so that

00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:12,270
