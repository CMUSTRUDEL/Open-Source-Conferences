so I tell you about three things real

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,970
quick one is about something I built

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,320
last weekend it's a social grader me

00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,910
it's gonna go up on the screen in a

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,380
minute and basically it is a tool that's

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,150
sister all your social media looks for

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,669
embarrassing stuff like swears or

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,380
check-ins in Vegas or you know if you'll

00:00:23,669 --> 00:00:27,119
if you check into bars a lot it'll

00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,679
basically alert you that hey here's some

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,179
stuff you might want to come come take a

00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:32,100
look at so why am I talking about this

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:34,920
at a ruby cough well I think that this

00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,240
is a it's a really cool testament to

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,220
what is possible with open source

00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,850
software so this was built in about 10

00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:43,290
hours and it integrates with like 12

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,180
different services all because of things

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,560
like devise a nominee off and I just

00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,500
think that it's it's kind of a really

00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,390
good example for people that are that

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,680
maybe are newer to the scene just to see

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,570
like what you can do just if you know

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,640
not not so much like where to look but

00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,860
just to look right so there's stuff out

00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,970
there for everything all of this all

00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,650
these integrations were just done with

00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:04,499
something called Omni off and there are

00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:06,060
plugins for like literally everything

00:01:04,499 --> 00:01:07,770
right so I didn't write really any of

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,619
the code to pull in data from these

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:14,579
services part of the the idea behind

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:16,920
this is that when you you sign up you

00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:19,710
you get a score and you kind of get an

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,780
overview of what what we find and then

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,920
there's this premium service that you

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,140
know I kind of want to charge for where

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,880
you can kind of go in and look at the

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,319
actual details and kind of you can click

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,399
into the original post and maybe delete

00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:34,020
stuff or edit stuff or whatever and kind

00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:36,569
of the big reason them up here is that

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,130
it's kind of easy if you're just walking

00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:40,649
around downtown you don't realize that

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,450
this area got completely destroyed a few

00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:44,609
weeks ago and a lot of people get really

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,859
really messed up and so what we're doing

00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:48,990
is that if you come and sign up for this

00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:50,459
thing the first two thousand dollars all

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,780
the first month of donations is a lot

00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:53,999
going to go to colorado flood relief and

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,869
so if you think it's interesting give it

00:01:53,999 --> 00:02:01,639
a shot give me feedback and yeah that's

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:01,639
