all right my name is Kevin's teams I'm a

00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,860
software engineer engine yard I'm going

00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,330
to talk about my experiences both in

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,609
theater and it's professional software

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,039
developer this is about the briefest bio

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:21,779
I can possibly give you this is me out

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,579
of a degree in computer science degree

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:26,310
in acting and I work for Siegfried and

00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:27,630
Roy I used to spend summers at the

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,099
collar on her Shakespeare Festival just

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,839
up the road working summers in theater

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:32,070
there I'm always amazing how much I've

00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:33,150
learned in theatre applies to software

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,980
someone to talk a little bit about that

00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,420
I'm often asked what's the biggest

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,160
difference between theater and software

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,360
engineering I usually say that there's a

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,910
lot less hugging and engineering but

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,990
then I started working for Wayne that's

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,080
a direct quote from my daughter by the

00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:50,630
way I'm going to talk to specifically

00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,290
body improvisational theatre

00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,790
improvisational theatre looks chaotic

00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,320
but there are underlying series of rules

00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,460
you have to follow their nominee can

00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,350
string them in to open you up to the

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,180
ideas of others and hopefully those

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,740
ideas can make your team and possibly

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,049
cut a little bit better and the first

00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,489
idea is just say yes and what you mean

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:07,109
by that is they need to be open and

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,210
honest and receptor the ideas of others

00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:10,649
on your team let's talk a little bit

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,960
more about what that means and by the

00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:16,679
way anyone here get this prog rock joke

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,740
yeah everyone about my age AARP cards

00:01:16,679 --> 00:01:21,749
for everyone Tina Fey and what

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,700
Bossypants talks about this the first

00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:25,319
little improvisation is agree always

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,969
agree and say yes when you improvising

00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:28,799
that means that you were required it's

00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:30,479
not an option you are required to agree

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,979
with that of your partner is created for

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,630
instance if I say this is a gun you're

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,710
not allowed to say that's your finger

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,170
because then you've got everything to

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,840
the world everything grinds to a halt so

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,310
one objection I get to this rule is i

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,479
really need to tell people that the

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,159
wrong and i'm not saying you can tell

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,729
people the wrong i'm saying that the way

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,009
you do it matters so what I say is it's

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:51,030
not just yes it's yes and that means if

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,619
you have something to add to the idea

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,030
you do if they're about to make a

00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:56,789
mistake with the junior engineer don't

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,469
say no because no you're stupid say yes

00:01:56,789 --> 00:02:00,630
I can see why you might think that but

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:02,729
here's why we need to do something a

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:05,609
little bit differently comes our next

00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:07,259
rule everyone plays you no matter who

00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:09,149
you are or just as entitled to be silly

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:09,780
and stupid and offer idiotic ideas as

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,000
everyone

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,700
a lot of great products started out as

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,790
someone else's stupid idea let's talk a

00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:19,319
little bit about my heroes here Stephen

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,690
Colbert I don't think you can see all

00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:23,100
this but what he talks about is that you

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:25,470
are not the most important person in the

00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,060
scene but it says like everyone else is

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,250
and if they're the most important person

00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,930
is seen you'll help and serve them but

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,430
the good news is is that you are in the

00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,290
scene to there for everyone else in this

00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,910
scene will help interview so you're all

00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,709
leading each other you're all following

00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,720
each other because you cannot with

00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:42,330
improv and like improvisation a theater

00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,019
you cannot win your life everyone's just

00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:47,100
making up things as they go along so

00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:48,540
what that means is if everyone knew

00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,980
teams acts as if their teammates are

00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,390
more important than they are you create

00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,600
an environment of support and giving in

00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:56,760
progress what this means in practice is

00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,930
when someone asks you a question don't

00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,030
send it at Google which is a bit of a

00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,260
jerk move in any case act as if their

00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,700
problems are at least as important as if

00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,160
not more important as yours and then

00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,630
when you ever probably like the same way

00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,819
what I'm saying the end is no more rock

00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:11,280
stars ninjas are superheroes this is my

00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:12,330
favorite professor from school yes you

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,769
may have a passion but your patch may be

00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:16,019
a stupid idea remember Johnny Depp

00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:18,360
playing taunton was a good idea and

00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:19,500
lastly if you're working for them and if

00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:24,290
you're working for money you'll always

00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,290
be overpaid underpaid thank you

00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,400
