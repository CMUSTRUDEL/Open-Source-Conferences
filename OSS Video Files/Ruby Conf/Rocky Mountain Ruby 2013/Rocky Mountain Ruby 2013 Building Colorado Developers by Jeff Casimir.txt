two years ago I was here giving a

00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,529
full-length talk and will now try and

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,750
cut out all the jokes and swearing and

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:20,939
fit together a three-minute talk it's

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,050
called building Colorado developers want

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,150
to tell you a little bit about what

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,300
we've been up to especially if this

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:30,659
piece of crap would work I felt already

00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:33,570
so about nine months ago I told Franklin

00:00:30,659 --> 00:00:34,890
and Katrina hey instead of DC we're

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,900
going to move to Colorado and

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:40,200
everything's going to be cool don't

00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:44,790
worry and they like a lot of people I

00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,380
talked to like Colorado all right let's

00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,880
see what happens so we came to Colorado

00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,790
we started a program called G school

00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:55,170
that we've run out of denver now we

00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:58,560
started with this group can I get a hell

00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,960
yeah from the Alumni all right we got a

00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:05,579
few alumni in the house today we

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,499
graduated the first group in July this

00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:09,119
was the feedback that we got from one of

00:01:07,499 --> 00:01:11,909
the companies who interviewed a young

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,240
lady that had been a sales manager had

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:17,490
never touched programming before and

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,469
when I saw this I I'm kind of soft now

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,700
that I'm old i sat on my desk and I shed

00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:22,640
a little tear and said like all right

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,399
we're actually doing something good here

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:29,060
we got 23 professional developers out of

00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:31,639
the program and specifically in Colorado

00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:34,499
they're working at these fine companies

00:01:31,639 --> 00:01:37,799
including myself I had to hire one kuna

00:01:34,499 --> 00:01:39,630
resist G school one just kicked off two

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,859
weeks ago so they're in their third week

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:47,459
now there you go we got a lot of them i

00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:49,619
totally seated the audience and so they

00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:51,090
are going to graduate in February if

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:52,979
this is something that you would like to

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,649
get involved in you're welcome to join

00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:58,770
us for one-on-one mentoring to be guest

00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,149
speakers and of course to hire them we

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,920
would love to see more Colorado

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:03,329
companies we were able to keep about 12

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,259
of the developers from the first class

00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:08,819
here in Colorado but after februari

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,259
that's going to be our last G school

00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:12,940
class I want to tell you a little bit

00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:14,860
about what's coming next in 50 seconds

00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,390
we're creating a new program we're going

00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:20,890
to call the Turing school of software

00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:22,510
and design the plan for this is to take

00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,400
what we've learned running hungry

00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:26,800
academy running G school and take it to

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,710
the next level so in hungry academy back

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,360
in DC we graduated 24 people now in G

00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:33,490
school we will have finished almost 50

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,250
our direct purpose is to seek

00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:38,080
accreditation as a vocational school

00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,330
we're forming a non-profit to manage

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,580
that thank you that means that people

00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:45,430
can access federal student loans VA

00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:47,440
funding private college loans all those

00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,960
kinds of things in the first year we're

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,750
going to graduate 112 developers in the

00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,940
second year it's going to be 168 to give

00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,180
you an idea Colorado School of Mines

00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:59,740
graduates about 80 computer science

00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,450
majors per year so this is going to be

00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:04,510
the most significant engineering

00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,580
pipeline in the state and if you'd like

00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,140
