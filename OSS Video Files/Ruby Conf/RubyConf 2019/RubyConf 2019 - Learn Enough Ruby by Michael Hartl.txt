	RubyConf 2019 - Learn Enough Ruby by Michael Hartl

Ruby is a big language, used for lots of different things—so, where to start? This talk discusses the core subjects needed to learn enough Ruby to be productive, focusing both on features it has in common with other languages and the things that make it unique. For those interested in web development, we’ll also talk about the pros and cons of learning Ruby before Rails, as well as whether to learn Rails at all.
