Good morning. So, I am going to talk about biology stuff in the deep earth. The background

00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:27,189
picture is in the volcanic arc of the Andes. My Chilean colleagues invited us down, but my

00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:33,050
talk will be about oceans. Hopefully you will see how that connects back to volcanos when

00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:40,340
I'm done. What planet is this? It's great to flip the earth around and check out the

00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:49,120
Pacific ocean every now and then. You can almost get a view of earth that has no land

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:58,800
in it. New Zealand creeps in. It's a nice reminder that we probably all know that percentage

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,049
of 74%of the earth is oceans. It really is. If you flip it around, you can remind yourself

00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:11,350
of that. So, because most of the earth ‑‑ since most of the earth is oceans, if you

00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:17,250
want to know what's inside earth, like how life goes into earth, how deep it goes, then

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:23,369
what you're talking about is marine sediments. That's the majority of the crust that is habitable

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:36,600
by microbes. There are so many microbial cells living buried in the sea floor. That's

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,179
about a third of the microbes on the planet are buried under the sea floor. It's roughly

00:01:42,179 --> 00:01:49,749
10,000 times than the number of stars in the universe. This is just a fast, fast eco‑system. So,

00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:54,950
if you want to study life on earth, you have to look inside earth, because that's where

00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,709
it is.  So how do we do this? How do we go about

00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:05,789
learning about the deep subsurface microbes? The big thing is we go out in nature and get samples.

00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:11,080
Certainly you're a scientist sitting at a computer or at the lab bench and some adventurer

00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,940
goes and gets stuff for you, right? No. That's the point. I could do other fields of science,

00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:22,720
but I do this one because I get to go to cool places. We get samples and we measure the

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,781
chemicals around the microbes. We measure as many things as we can to get at what they

00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:33,750
are eating and breathing, just how life works in this strange place. And the big thing we

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:40,390
do, usually we do this back in the laboratory is we chemically extract their DNA and other

00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:45,480
biomolecules directly from the natural sample. And this is what we use to infer what they

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:51,520
are doing. And we can bring home these samples and try to grow things in the laboratories. 

00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,530
So the work that I'm going to tell you about was taken from oceanic sediment. This is

00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:05,620
the Joides Resolution. This is a long series of ‑‑ you have to load up pipes. So the

00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,170
pipes get taken down to the sea floor, and there's a little explosion that happens at

00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:15,140
the sea floor, and they get shoved down into the sediment. So, this advanced piston coring

00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:22,190
can bring you back hundreds of meters into the earth sediments coming back on ship. It's

00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:28,220
exciting and fun stuff to do. So we go out on ships and we get this stuff. And if you

00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:32,470
want to start thinking about what kind of microbes are out there, one thing that you

00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,820
sort of have to know as background is that we actually already know quite a bit about

00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:42,120
the microbes elsewhere on earth. So, one thing we know for sure is that there are a

00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,890
lot of microbes on this planet. I just found this picture on the internet, and I thought

00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:52,620
it was really beautiful. It may seem a little disgusting, because somebody put their hand

00:03:52,620 --> 00:04:00,040
down on a petri dish, and these are the microbes that were on their hand. If you think about

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,460
that person who made that hand print probably didn't die from an infection from the microbes.

00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:11,930
So most of the microbes on the planet do not kill us. We spend a lot of time in microbiology

00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:18,239
studying pathogens and diseases. But for the most part, the microbes are not pathogens. They

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:23,150
do not kill us. I do want to make the point that we have only been on this earth for a

00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:28,260
few million years. Microbes have been here for literally billions of years. So, they

00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:35,900
maybe just haven't figured out how to kill us. I'm going to put a yet there. It could

00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,750
be... So when we got the first samples that we could

00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,431
be sure were not contaminated that were from the deep subsurface environment, they were

00:04:45,431 --> 00:04:53,950
from off the coast of Peru. I didn't do this work alone. No scientist ever works alone. If

00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:58,240
somebody tells you, like, so and so discovered something, like, no. So, and so and a bunch

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,780
of other people discovered things. This was my project as a PhD student. It was a Heady

00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:13,100
time. I will show you the data that we found, and I will show you not microbial names or

00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:18,620
a genetic tree or something technical. I will show you each microbe by a box. I will

00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:25,590
put a rectangle like this up every time we got a DNA sequence out from a microbe that

00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:32,090
was similar to what somebody discovered before. I will make a heat map where the light color

00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:38,360
is totally different, a DNA sequence that we got that was something that was an entirely

00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:45,040
new type of microbe that nobody had ever discovered before. So, this is what we got. We got

00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:52,030
almost all white boxes or pretty light‑colored boxes. It was truly amazing as an entry into

00:05:52,030 --> 00:06:00,410
the field that there is a whole undiscovered world down there. You look at a result like

00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:05,389
this and you say everything there is new. It's time to start culturing things and get things

00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:11,170
growing in laboratories. Luckily we had some of the best culturing labs in the world on

00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:15,520
this ship. And they took samples back to their lab and started growing things. I will

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,400
show you their results, too. Every time they got a microbe that we found, I will put it

00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,830
directly Underneath the box, and new ones I will pack to the right of them. And they

00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:37,360
will be color coded the same way. Ready to see what they found? Zero! Zero of the things

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,740
we found they managed to grow. Nothing. No overlap. And further more, everything that

00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,980
they got is very similar to kind of stuff we already knew about. 

00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,840
So we realized we had a big problem here and there was actually another lab that did this

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:59,040
as well. And they got a similar result. And I don't want to malign these labs. They know

00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,650
what they're doing. It's just simply that these microbes were living in a way that we

00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:09,260
were not adequately replicating. And I know a lot of times people say pressure, it's all

00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,900
because of pressure. And these experiments were not done under pressure. But that has

00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:18,270
been done quite a bit, and it's not the missing link. You can't just apply pressure to these

00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:29,330
things and have them grow perfectly. This is such a pervasive problem. A lot of people

00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:34,860
refer to these things as microbial dark matter. I don't know if you have heard that word, but

00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:40,889
it's borrowing from the astronomers, but most of the matter in the universe is dark matter

00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:45,350
that we know exists because of its gravitational pull, but we don't know what it is. And most

00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:50,770
of the microbes on the earth are just weird stuff that we don't know what it is. So,

00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:57,070
we call it microbial dark matter. So the fact that this stuff exists means that we have

00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:05,690
to crank back the clock and talk about microbiology 101. We teach this in classes. Microbes grow

00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:10,660
in cultures like test tubes. And we have a general conception of what microbes do on

00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:20,780
the planet. I want to point out that these weird microbes do this. That's a framework. It's

00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:26,250
not necessarily true. These are basic assumptions that our whole field has been based on. But

00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:31,479
we don't think of them as assumptions because, well, it's true. Maybe they're not true. This

00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:36,440
stuff is making us question that. I think it's important to be able to see your frames

00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,419
and they have allowed us to do that.  So we want to try to figure out what do they

00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:47,880
do? Let's be aware of our frame of thinking. And let's think about this from the microbes'

00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,480
perspective, get in their head. What's it like to be buried in the sea floor? This

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,830
is how I think of things, so this is my schematic of sea water, overlying sediment, as microbes

00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:04,600
are buried, it happens slowly. Sometimes they get kicked back up, and on average, they

00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:10,550
are buried and buried and buried, slowly, slowly, slowly. The best things to breathe

00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:15,750
are breathed up quickly. Oxygen is a fabulous thing to breathe. The fact that we can be

00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:22,899
these big multicellular organisms literally spewing out heat everywhere is so inefficient. We

00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:31,960
can do that just because we breathe oxygen, which has so much energy. And your next things

00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:39,020
to breathe like sulfate or iron or manganese, they get breathed up next. And then after

00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:44,541
that's all gone, the last thing you've got to breathe is carbon di oxide, which is crazy

00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:50,610
to think of using that as something to breathe, but these microbes can do that. It means

00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:55,950
there's a decreasing oxidation potential. The things you can get energy from are getting

00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:01,620
crappier and crappier as you get buried. You combine this with the fact that the food you

00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:07,750
eat, the carbon that you use to make your biomass, where you get your electrons from,

00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:16,680
that doesn't get replenished. You have to eat the leftovers of what got laid down thousands

00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:22,910
of years previously. So, this adds up to massively decreasing energy availability as

00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:28,580
you go down in marine sediments. What we predict is that the number of microbial cells

00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:33,540
in the sediments should decrease with this. And that's one thing that we actually have measured

00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:38,750
pretty well around the world. And this is a compilation of data from all around the

00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:45,080
world. And this is actually a form of the plot that I will show more, so try to remember

00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,960
it. Up at the surface, that's the sea water, that's the sea floor. As you go down into

00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:55,310
marine mud, on the Y axis here, we have the total number of cells. It's decreasing. So,

00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:59,130
pretty much everywhere in all different oceans around the world, the number of cells are

00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:05,760
decreasing with depth, which is what we expect.  But what we want to know is how fast do they

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,270
grow? Like, you know, on average, these populations are decreasing. But if you see a patch of

00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:16,260
grass one summer and the same patch of grass another summer but the patch got smaller,

00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,120
it doesn't mean that the grass blades didn't grow, they just changed in population size. So,

00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:27,610
we can put this on an age model. If you look

00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:35,290
at the sediment age, we go down to 5,000 years on the Y axis. This is work that my colleagues

00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:43,310
did looking at the respiration rates. And at the surface, we have cell generation times

00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:49,600
of months. Which is really, really slow. If you put E. Coli in a test tube, it will double

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,660
every 30 minutes, but these things are taking months to double. If you fill in the rest

00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:02,930
of it, they go up to sometimes 50 years or 70 years. So, these are microbial cells that

00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:11,779
don't divide for 50 years, which is weird.  Biology is not really designed to deal with

00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:18,339
that sort of problem. Yet, that's how we find ourselves. So, we have to go to it. So,

00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:23,529
they're not really dividing or making new cells at all, because they don't even have

00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:28,650
to divide in every 50 years. They could just is be switching out their internal biomolecules

00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:32,750
and fixing the parts that are broken. This is a carbon turnover. They don't have to

00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:40,279
make a daughter cell. So, an individual cell could hang out for thousands of years or hundreds

00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:45,660
of thousands of years. And the thing is, like, maybe that sounds crazy to all of us, and

00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:50,430
it is crazy. But it's not. This is actually the consensus in my field. We say oh yeah,

00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:55,240
these cells are probably hundreds of thousands of years old, living cells. 

00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,830
So what this has ‑‑ what this means is that my graduate student, as he was learning

00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:05,730
this stuff, he was shocked as I was to learn this. So, he came up with a word that I love. So,

00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:12,750
I'm going to share it with you guys. He says Karen, it's not a biome, it's a die‑ome. I

00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:18,870
was like that's so good! That's great. But at this point in the talk, I should probably

00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:24,100
raise the thing that maybe some of you are thinking, like why am I doing this? Like,

00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:30,430
this is an entire eco‑system that's dying, and I'm devoting my entire professional life

00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:35,180
to studying this. Not just me, but other people, too. What's the point? They're just

00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:41,180
dying. Let them die! But I'll tell you the reason, and the reason is that I find it utterly

00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:45,800
fascinating. How does a cell live for that long? What does that mean? They're still

00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:51,170
alive. This is a mode of biology that is fundamentally different than all other biology

00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:56,120
that I've ever heard about, and I don't know how the evolutionary pressures work over such

00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:02,480
long time scales. When you take the rules off of biology, suddenly really strange things

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:10,680
can emerge. For instance, if you think about what it takes to get ahead in darwinian evolution,

00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:17,130
fast growth makes a ton of sense, right? So when we talk about competition and ecology,

00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:22,769
we normally talk about the goal is increasing your population size. So, we have different

00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:27,560
flavors of how to win a race, right? You can be the hare, and you can sprint and get

00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:36,570
there fast, but we know that being a tortoise is a valid way to win. In ecology, we call

00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:41,740
this R strategists and K strategists. And K strategists will wait until the rabbits

00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:49,089
die off and then they will catch up. But all of that is based on growth, increasing

00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:53,769
your population size. What about this group of microbes who are in not actually increasing

00:14:53,769 --> 00:15:02,790
at all? So maybe I'm proposing that the goal in the deep marine sediments is just existing. 

00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:09,820
So, like, a Zen sort of thing. You know, you look at a Buddhist monk who is meditating,

00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:15,550
and he may not look like he's doing anything, but he is. He's making forward progress,

00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:19,730
even though he's not racing. If you're not into the religious reference, maybe you will

00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:27,500
get this one. For years, I didn't understand the point of this movie, the big Lobowski,

00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:40,149
Then I realized there is no point. I think that's what these microbes are doing. They're

00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:44,410
just looking for a white Russian.  [ Laughter ]

00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:51,590
So, in this eco‑system where this seems to be the goal is just kind of hanging out,

00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:57,040
what does that look like? How do they do this? So now I'll tell you some ‑‑ sorry

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:03,209
to go from pop reference to technical stuff, but you can handle it. We did a project in

00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:09,900
the Baltic sea, which is between Sweden and Finland and Latvia and Estonia. These are

00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:16,940
my students who did all the work on it. This is actually not the same ship. We worked

00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:24,540
on a drill ship that was retro fitted be I the Europeans. The Japanese have a ship and

00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:29,089
the Europeans make their ships as needed. So, we don't have a ton of ships for this kind

00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:35,030
of thing. But we wanted to ask the question, what are the potential mechanisms that allow

00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:43,930
bacteria and archaea to persist in near zero growth state for 8,000 years 50 meters deep

00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:49,230
into the Baltic sea sediments. I got to tell you about the technique that we used to get

00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:54,420
these things. Because the situation in marine sediments is there's a big group of microbes

00:16:54,420 --> 00:17:02,430
there, heterogeneous, they're tiny, bundled together. And we needed to pick apart individual

00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:08,929
genomes, but we can't culture them. So, we have to pull out a genome in mixed population

00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:14,990
in literal muck. Think of dirty, crappy muck. That's what we're working with. So, what we do is

00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:20,050
we physically pull out a single cell from this weird, mucky stuff. We do this with

00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:26,900
flow cytometry, which makes droplets of water. Each droplet has one cell in it which we pass by

00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:32,410
two lasers to look at the fraction patterns as the light scatters off. So, this lets

00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:37,730
us know roughly the size and shape of what's sitting in the water droplet. So, we say

00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:43,470
that thing looks like a cell. Flick it into its own well. So, we get a tube that only

00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:49,090
has one cell in it, which is not much to work with. Then we have to crack it open. We

00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:54,500
do this usually with changing the pH, so like shooting alkaline stuff in, because it's reversible. And

00:17:54,500 --> 00:18:04,820
then we copy its genome with an enzyme, and we make lots and lots of copies of that one

00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:11,620
cell. Then we send it off to a magical sequencing machine. It's all proprietary. I don't know

00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:19,940
how they work, but they come back with sequences of DNA. So, tons of data that we get from

00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:31,190
this. And we bioinformatically knit it together. This is a fun area of research, putting together

00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:36,080
data like this.  So in this way, we analyze the genes that

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,640
are present in the microbe. You can imagine genes are like a menu for what the microbe

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,860
can do. Okay?  So when we first got these genomes out of

00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:50,370
the deep subsurface organisms, we looked for what's abundant and what looks interesting. Something

00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:58,030
that looked interesting right away was a bunch of toxin‑anti‑toxin systems. I'm showing

00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:03,580
the data where we have the different microbes that we caught. None of these things belong

00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:10,460
to a filum that has ever been grown. And we have this number of different toxin and

00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:17,299
anti‑toxin systems. You probably have not heard of toxin/anti‑toxin systems. Evolution

00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:23,460
worked out such that we have a lot of cells that will make a toxin that kills themselves

00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:28,010
and simultaneously produces the antidote to it and that's why they don't die. Doesn't

00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:35,490
that sound like a terrible system? That's how biology works. It's like a governor on

00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:40,820
your system. You can have this toxin that slows down your metabolism, makes your cell

00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:51,900
sick. This is using in mycobacterium tuberculosis. This is from a published paper showing how many

00:19:51,900 --> 00:20:04,860
different toxin/anti‑toxin systems are present in this. Tuberculosis, if you hit it with

00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:11,360
a bunch of antibiotics that destroy a growing cell, it just stops growing. It's like I'm

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:17,840
going to persist and hang out until your body forms a granuloma around it and then you have

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:26,270
tuberculosis for your whole life. So, the mycobacterium tuberculosis uses these systems

00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:32,240
to get in this low, low zero growth state. So, we have lots of other things that we have

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,640
identified that I'm just telling you about one because it would take all day. We think

00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:41,160
one of the things that the microbes do is they're using toxin systems to slow down their

00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:47,299
growth rate and be very, very slow. So, that's kind of cool. That means that we've known

00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:52,380
that everyone in this community is starving because the food is 8,000 years old. But

00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:56,790
that's okay, because they're not trying to grow fast anyway. 

00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:05,370
But can we identify what they actually eat? What does one eat when living so long without much

00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:14,690
food? So we looked at the metabolites. That's another technical thing. All the metabolisms

00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:21,330
that are happening inside cells occur by changing molecules. So, individual monomeric molecules. So,

00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:35,110
if you get a view of all the molecules present in a cell at once, that's called a metabolome. They

00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:40,750
get these subway‑looking map things where you can look at the ‑‑ it's like pipelines

00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:46,419
or dials. So, you can look at the upregulation and downregulation of the different metabolites. This

00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:52,960
is something that people have done in cultures, but we are working in sediments. It just

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,390
seemed like a big mess. It's already a mess in a living organism, and we're going to take

00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:04,020
this natural sample that's full of tree leaves or whatever dead stuff and try to pick apart

00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:10,549
individual molecules from it. It seemed intractable to me. How much do I know? The only reason

00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:16,390
why we ended up doing this work is that guy, Hector, whenever he saw me was like Karen,

00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:21,400
you got to put some of your weird deep sea mud and let's just look at it and see what

00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,920
the metabolites look like. It just seems like not a great idea, but fine. We did it. We

00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:32,650
put all of this stuff in. How did it work out? Did you get anything? He was like no,

00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:42,010
it was total crap. It didn't work at all. Obviously. Nothing ever works in the deep sea. That's a truism. We

00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:49,780
only got out of the thousands, we only got 20 molecules. And 20? That is so much more

00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:55,270
than zero! I can work with 20! And it was great. 

00:22:55,270 --> 00:23:01,080
So I went through, my students and I went through those 20 molecules and tried to figure

00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:06,720
out if we could see what they were important for. And I'll just tell you about one of

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:14,090
them, and that's this ‑‑ it's a molecule that I had never heard of before, it's called

00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:20,190
allantoin. What stuck out to us about it is this is another heat map showing the depth

00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:25,400
on the X axis here, looking at two different cores. It goes down quite deep. This is

00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:32,460
down to 100 meters, almost, into the sea floor. And we got allantoin present at every depth

00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:41,350
and another form of it called allantoate. This is potentially a food substrate, a product

00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:46,120
of the degradation of everybody else dying. This is something that would result from that. And

00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:51,490
it's a substrate that we never would have thought ‑‑ we wouldn't have guessed that

00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:56,610
they could eat this. So, luckily, we have all of these genes to look for. Like, are

00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:02,580
they eating it? Let's see.  So we looked across the major groups of microbes

00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:11,100
that we have. Each column is a different microbial group, and then the rows are different

00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:26,250
enzymes that are important for allantoin metabolism. So, it looked like this one clay had a leg up

00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:34,670
on everybody else. It was able to eat this food genetically. That's what we found. It

00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:41,440
looked like they had a corner on the market for allantoin. So, this brings up the question

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,789
if atribacteria are the best at eating the food, why don't they kill everybody else and

00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:54,470
win the game? You've got an inside track to a food source that nothing else has. So,

00:24:54,470 --> 00:25:01,340
divide your cells a bunch and take everybody over and be the king of the thing. So, I'm

00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:05,030
gonna answer that.  So we put together its whole metabolism from

00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:10,530
these genes. This is a hefty reconstruction of all the genetic machinery that we could

00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:15,360
put together, which, you know, obviously you're not going to go into depth and read all of

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:22,990
this stuff, but it looked like they were a fully functional microbe. And further more,

00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:29,360
we found that they had all of the genes necessary to make amino acids, to basically just produce

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,281
the essential building block for all the proteins that they need. So, it looked like what they

00:25:34,281 --> 00:25:38,620
were doing with this food source was producing some biomass. That's good. That means they

00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:44,110
should divide. So, to answer this question of why they weren't just growing like crazy,

00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:54,370
I went to more colleagues at Texas A & M and USC. And they looked at how many of the genes

00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:59,230
are turned on in the system. It is amazing to me that they were able to do this in the

00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:06,151
muck that is deep under the Baltic sea, but they were. From this list of RNA, or genes

00:26:06,151 --> 00:26:12,450
that are turned on and active and doing stuff. The second most abundant one out of all the genes

00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:18,480
that could have been there in the cellular metabolism was this one that I circled in

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:30,440
blue. And it's an exporter of amino acids. Amino acids are energy rich. But instead of hanging

00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:37,020
on to this stuff, it looked like, at least genetically that this organism was actually

00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:45,240
giving it away to its friends. I don't know.  I do not like apocalyptic movies, because

00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:53,550
I am scared of movies. I have only seen one of them, it was Zombieland. I liked it. It

00:26:53,550 --> 00:27:01,510
wasn't too scary. I learned from woody Harrelson that the thing to do when your resources are

00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:08,320
limited is you have got to get guns and keep people away from your food, keep your Twinkies. That

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:13,320
is the apocalyptic story, that narrative that we tell each other. Resources are slim? Gather

00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:20,029
them up and keep everybody away. Here we have this eco‑system that has been dying

00:27:20,029 --> 00:27:27,350
for 8,000 years and they are literally giving their amino acids away? That doesn't make

00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:34,789
sense at all. If they allow their intracellular concentrations of amino acids to build up

00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:42,059
too much, they will have to divide. It will force their enzymes to go forward, and they'll

00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:46,980
make competition from themselves. This is a hypothesis. We don't know. We could be

00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:54,309
totally wrong. We think they are releasing the amino acids simply because they don't

00:27:54,309 --> 00:27:58,010
want to divide. They want to keep in the zero growth state, because that's the way

00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:04,710
to persist. If they hold it, they would grow too fast, so they have to release it. This

00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:10,980
has the secondary benefit of feeding everybody else in the community. I don't claim altruism

00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:18,671
on the part of microbes. That's ridiculous. But it is an amazing system. Apocalyptic movies

00:28:18,671 --> 00:28:30,840
are about a recent apocalypse. But these guys are pros. And they share. 

00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:40,840
How does this get set up? What I have discussed are adaptations to doing nothing. But we

00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,710
know that Darwin said that you had to pass your genes along to the next generation to

00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:50,809
get them to be selected for. So, how does natural selection happen to allow a microbe

00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:57,680
to persist for this long? How did this system get set up? And I think for that, too, we

00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:02,659
have to take our heads out of our frame of reference. For that, we have to remember

00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:07,340
now these microbes live for thousands of years or longer. So, now we have to start saying

00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:12,800
are there geological factors? That's geological time that could allow them to come back to

00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:18,440
the surface. So, now don't think about writing ‑‑ getting buried down in marine sediments. Now

00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:23,330
we have to think about the oceanic sediments. Plate tectonics start to matter when you live a

00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:30,510
long time. What happens in oceanic tectonic plates is they get crushed under continental

00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:41,840
plates, usually. This is a schematic. This happens offshore. There's a subducting oceanic

00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:54,590
plate that get crushed under continents. All of this stuff gets squeezed and shoved back

00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:59,669
up. So, it's possible that these microbes are brought back to the surface early in subduction

00:29:59,669 --> 00:30:07,630
zones. And of course they don't survive going down to the mantle and mixing with mantle

00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:18,190
and lava. But all of that is connected. Maybe this is how this connects to volcanos. Maybe

00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:26,030
life deep within the earth is connected across spatial scales and time scales that biologists

00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:32,789
are restricted from thinking about.  So, as a new project, I don't have a lot of

00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:38,210
results to show you, which is fine, because I'm almost done. But I will tell you about

00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:43,350
what we're doing with this project. I put a dot up for every time we have a sample. So,

00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:52,640
we have sampled with my colleagues from costa Rico, and this is what it looks like. We

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:58,470
checked in just a few miles into the jungle, and all of this stuff right here? This milky

00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:03,220
stuff? This is me and some of the rest of the team. We just sort of fan out with our

00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:09,460
tubes and real cheap‑looking stuff, because it is cheap. And we sample all of this stuff. And

00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:15,350
this milky red stuff right here is all microbial. So, there's tons of these deep subsurface microbes

00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:19,990
that are spewing out of the earth and taking advantage of the fact that there's a great

00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:27,419
interface with oxygen at the surface of the earth. Definitely ‑‑ the second most

00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:34,480
dangerous site I have ever sampled, inside the crater of Poas volcano. This is the closest

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:48,390
to San Jose. We went because it was pretty on that day. We had to hike and it's scribbly

00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:54,960
rock. It's not settled stuff. There's nothing growing here because the thing blows up every

00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:01,620
now and then. And this is getting ‑‑ this is basically like a lake full of phreatic

00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:13,429
water. So, it's literally battery acid. The pH, this is me with a pH meter right there. It

00:32:13,429 --> 00:32:25,020
was .85. It goes down to ‑2. It's sad. It is terrifying to be there, this is a picture

00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:33,679
of me. It's very steep and scree‑filled. The ground is hot. Duh. 

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:40,100
[ Laughter ] It's really hot. If you fall, you fall into

00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:45,140
battery acid. But you don't want to fall, so you put your hands down, but it's 600 degrees,

00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:52,350
and you're like crap. You just walk along and keep your boots moving. I will say I

00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:58,320
don't now how many volcanos I'm going to go into in the future. A month and a half after

00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,640
we went in, this happened. That's ‑‑ this is the shoreline I just showed you. This

00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:14,049
is where I was standing. Right there. It's just a reminder that nature does not care

00:33:14,049 --> 00:33:20,640
about scientists who are sampling it. It will kill you. And we have to be really,

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:28,210
really cautious and not be cowboys out there and really take mitigated risks. And it also

00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:32,799
means we now know the microbes that are present in the place. This is the biggest eruption

00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:38,180
in 60 years, so we were awfully glad to miss it. We did all call each other on the phone

00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:45,610
and were like nobody's in the volcano, right? There are microbes that survive this. This is a

00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:54,100
place where microbes live, which is crazy. To think that is a valid eco‑system for microbes

00:33:54,100 --> 00:34:00,039
that are like cool. I'm good with an explosion every now and then. It really makes you want

00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:06,880
to extend your thinking of where life is to outside of earth. So, if you ever think about

00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:13,659
life outside earth, which I hope that you do, because it's awfully myopic to focus just

00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:22,959
on our planet. It's hard to imagine life on other planets within our solar system and

00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:28,200
planetary bodies, because they lack the thick atmosphere. It's hard to live at the surface

00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:35,389
because you have to deal with magnetic and uv assault. It's a rough place to live. But

00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:40,479
nothing is stopping their subsurfaces from teeming with life. When I think about life

00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:46,379
and where it might be in our solar system, I think about the subsurface. I am not going

00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:52,619
to think about what's sitting on the surface and dealing with the sun's rays. I think

00:34:52,619 --> 00:35:03,959
there is stuff in Europa and possibly mars. I hope you will continue to get out of your

00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:09,890
frame of references as well and think about life on other planets.

00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:15,969
I will end by thanking my funders, because I think it is amazing that we have a society

00:35:15,969 --> 00:35:22,180
that values this kind of science. And I am grateful for that. This is my building at

00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:26,339
the university of Tennessee in Knoxville, four hours east of here. It's lovely, and

00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:31,529
a slightly dirtier, scruffier version of Nashville. Thank you. 

00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:32,709
