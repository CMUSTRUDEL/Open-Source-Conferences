	RubyConf 2019 - lo-fi hip hop ruby - beats to relax/study to by Zachary Schroeder

Lo-fi hip hop, or chillhop, is both a successful meme (thanks to some very specifically worded youtube playlists) and a relaxing music genre. It is characterized by loops of quiet, calm music (often jazz), a hip-hop inspired beat, some airy effects, and perhaps some vocal samples. Now, would it amaze you to learn that our best friend Ruby can help us make our own tracks like these? In fact, by using a few gems for audio manipulation, beat making, and UI construction, weâ€™ll construct our own chillhop studio! Thanks Ruby!
