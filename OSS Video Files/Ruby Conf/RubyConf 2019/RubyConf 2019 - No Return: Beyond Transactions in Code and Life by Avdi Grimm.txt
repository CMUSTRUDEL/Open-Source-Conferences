Description: 
	RubyConf 2019 - No Return: Beyond Transactions in Code and Life by Avdi Grimm

At the root of catastrophes in both code and life lies a pervasive fallacy: the attempt to model processes as if they were transactions. Join me for an honest, sometimes raw retrospective on two decades of building a software development career. We’ll examine how personal philosophy impacts software design—and vice-versa. We’ll encounter the Transactional Fallacy, and how it can hinder our attempts to build resilient systems. And we’ll explore how a narrative-oriented mindset can lead to both better code and a more joyful life.

[Music]

00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:22,650
good morning hi I'm so happy to be here

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:25,830
back here at Rubicon and back here in

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:30,060
Nashville so okay let's get right into

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:32,819
it today I want to talk to you a little

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:38,699
bit about some mistakes that I've made

00:00:32,819 --> 00:00:41,249
in life and in code and some of the

00:00:38,699 --> 00:00:48,269
lessons that I am learning from those

00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:53,039
mistakes so a couple of years ago I lost

00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:57,299
my dreams and I lost my faith let's talk

00:00:53,039 --> 00:01:00,420
about dreams I was one of those people

00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:05,309
who from a very young age had a pretty

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:08,790
specific idea of the life that I was

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:15,060
supposed to arrive at the life that was

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:19,200
correct for me to have and so from the

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:23,100
age of about 18 onward I set myself

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,710
pretty much single mindedly to arriving

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,620
at that life and I knew that I had a lot

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,100
to do to get there and so I said about

00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,580
it

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:36,770
kind of like ticking off these

00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:39,030
checkboxes towards this goal things like

00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:42,150
getting into the into the software

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:45,830
industry and getting married having

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:50,280
about having kids leveling up my career

00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:52,470
leveling up my my reputation you with

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,860
stuff like podcasting and blogging and

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:58,020
and writing books and public speaking in

00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,700
order to level up my career further and

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,710
then going out and some consulting and

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,650
then running my own business all these

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:07,020
things checking off boxes towards this

00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:08,929
goal this picture that I had in my head

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:12,510
of the life that I needed to arrive at

00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:14,950
and like I said I was pretty simple

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:19,360
single-minded

00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:24,010
along the way things like other things

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:31,540
like hobbies and friendships kind of

00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:37,510
fell by the wayside and at the age of 35

00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:40,870
I achieved that goal I was done I had a

00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:44,710
big house in the mountains in the woods

00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:46,330
I had a wife and lots of kids I was

00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:48,940
working I was running my own business

00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:51,400
working from home with my family

00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,930
surrounding me I had exactly the life

00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,310
that I had set out to achieve

00:02:52,930 --> 00:03:00,670
and I got to enjoy this state of being

00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:03,640
for about two years and then a surprise

00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:07,030
occurred my marriage unexpectedly fell

00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:09,460
apart and I found myself alone in that

00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:11,770
big house in the woods reconsidering

00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:16,960
pretty much everything about the life

00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:19,030
that I'd lived up to that point and as I

00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,620
was thinking about this I kind of

00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,620
realized I don't know if you've seen the

00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,930
lego movie but I realized I had become

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:31,270
Lord business trying to get everything

00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:32,650
just fixed in place in the perfect ideal

00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,840
position that happily-ever-after

00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,600
positioned so I could glue it all in

00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:43,959
place with Krazy Glue until the end of

00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:46,630
time I realized that I had been trying

00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:52,480
for almost two decades to bring my life

00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:56,620
to an end not an end in death but a

00:03:52,480 --> 00:04:02,260
static state fixed I had been trying to

00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:06,130
achieve a successful return value now as

00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:09,310
I was pondering this I was also in the

00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:12,160
process of losing my faith and when I

00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:14,040
say faith I I mean my faith in the

00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:20,859
dominant religion of our time

00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:24,250
object-oriented programming my entire

00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:25,660
career has has circled around

00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,960
object-oriented programming from the

00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,880
very beginning

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,470
along the way I learned a lot about what

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,169
it meant to do object-oriented

00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:38,919
programming and then along the way

00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:42,590
further on I unlearned most of that and

00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:44,660
but I mean what who even gets to define

00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:50,419
what is true object-oriented programming

00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:52,820
any way well this guy is a good it's a

00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:55,759
good one to go to for that uh who knows

00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:58,009
who this is all right so this is Alan

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,630
Kay Alan Kay invented object-oriented

00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:02,419
programming he came up with the concept

00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:04,430
and eventually I discovered his writings

00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:07,840
about it and I discovered that that he

00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:11,900
had written that to him oh oh just meant

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:16,400
messaging encapsulation of state process

00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:19,789
and extreme late binding of all things

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:23,510
and of these three the most important to

00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:25,490
him was messaging and he even said that

00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:27,169
he regretted calling it object-oriented

00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:30,919
programming because it put the focus on

00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:33,770
the wrong piece so once I once I

00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:35,690
understood this about oo I started

00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:38,599
trying really hard to just focus on that

00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:40,430
one piece messaging that one component

00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:42,050
and try to understand all the

00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:44,810
programming that I did in terms of

00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:54,080
messaging and I try to teach oo in terms

00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:55,820
of messaging but along the way I started

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,930
to feel more and more cognitive

00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:02,840
dissonance so let's let's think about

00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:04,669
messaging for a minute here messaging

00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,010
this is built on the the physical

00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:11,150
metaphor of sending a message in the

00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:13,820
mail so let's compare sending a message

00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:16,010
in the mail to what we call sending a

00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:18,169
message in any modern object-oriented

00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:19,940
programming language like Ruby when we

00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:21,500
send the message in the mail we sum up

00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:25,000
all the information that the recipient

00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:28,070
needs in order to act on the message and

00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,430
we send that summary to them and that's

00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:33,620
all they get in an oo language we send a

00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:35,990
reference to an object and they can

00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:39,370
reach back through that reference to get

00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:39,370
all kinds of extra information

00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:46,940
when we send a message in the mail and

00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:50,990
the recipient doesn't understand it or

00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:53,970
maybe it just doesn't reach them at all

00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:55,710
what happens well as the sender nothing

00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:57,930
happens to me nothing bad happens to me

00:06:55,710 --> 00:07:00,660
but when we do that in a NOAA language

00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:02,610
what happens we get an exception our

00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:05,190
whole the sender's whole stack of

00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:10,080
execution blows up it's game over for

00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:14,010
the sender most importantly when we send

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:17,040
a real message in the mail we don't have

00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:19,380
to freeze at the mailbox until the

00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:23,280
sender is able to act on that message

00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:29,790
but that is exactly what happens in any

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:31,620
modern olo language you know a lot of

00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:35,250
people will tell you that the original

00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:39,660
sin of object-oriented programming was

00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:41,250
mutable state I disagree I believe that

00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:46,440
the original sin of object-oriented

00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:49,530
programming was returned values retained

00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:53,580
from the procedural languages that came

00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:59,250
before return values are a fundamental

00:07:53,580 --> 00:08:00,240
denial of the messaging model and when

00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,700
you look at some of the other stuff

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,320
that's L&K wrote you know he wrote I

00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,330
thought of objects being like biological

00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:09,060
cells or individual computers on a

00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:12,419
network and only able to communicate

00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:14,070
with messages and in talking about small

00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:17,580
talk which was the language that he and

00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:20,930
his team built to embody the OO idea

00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:23,580
he said they never quite got there and

00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:26,190
then future versions further versions

00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:29,460
kind of back slid towards the past and

00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:32,550
that those future versions of small talk

00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:38,669
are what Ruby and every other modern oo

00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:40,709
language is based on and inspired by so

00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:43,919
here's the big lie of object-oriented

00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:46,500
programming for the past 40 years we

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:50,910
keep saying or sending messages we keep

00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:52,210
talking as if messaging is the model but

00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:54,190
it's not

00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:56,500
that's not the actual semantics of what

00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:59,589
we're doing it's really it's really the

00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:06,190
same call and return semantics of the

00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:12,490
procedural languages that preceded it so

00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:15,370
I lost my my dreams and I was losing my

00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:17,350
faith in oo and as I reflected on these

00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:22,060
things I realized that they had

00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:24,399
something in common that there was

00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:28,029
something at the core that related both

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:33,430
of these things I realized they both

00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:35,800
stemmed from the same worldview they

00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:38,490
both stemmed from viewing the world in

00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:42,390
terms of goal obsessed uninterrupted

00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:45,670
blocking procedures fixated on success

00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:48,220
on that successful return value and

00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:53,980
another word for this a shorter word for

00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:55,930
this is a transaction a transaction is

00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,180
something that is synchronous and

00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:00,370
blocking it either completes or it

00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:05,380
self-destructs it has no visible or

00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:08,200
intermediate state it's it's totally

00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:10,690
built around a goal it has no identity

00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:15,160
of its own it has no persistent state or

00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:20,709
history and it's independent it's

00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:24,459
self-contained I have come to call this

00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:27,790
I've come to think of this as the

00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:31,270
transactional fallacy the transactional

00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:34,510
fallacy occurs every time we look at

00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:37,810
something that is a process and we model

00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:41,200
it as a transaction instead and this

00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:45,640
transactional fallacy is endemic in

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,410
programming it is everywhere every time

00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,300
your program freezes up while it's

00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:51,190
parsing a particularly big hunk of data

00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:54,010
and you realize that just to show an

00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:55,930
updating progress report while it's

00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:57,880
processing those big hunks would take a

00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:01,150
significant rewrite that's the

00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,560
transactional fallacy when you've got an

00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:05,440
architecture that's built around a bunch

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,130
of stateless service objects and you've

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,440
got a work

00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:09,730
that originally just hits one of those

00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,290
service objects you know it's got a

00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:15,040
request that hits one of those service

00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:17,079
objects and then later on that workflow

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,029
becomes more complex and it needs to

00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:20,769
flow through several different requests

00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:23,170
hitting different service objects and

00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:25,750
you find yourself trying to find ways to

00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:27,850
sneak little bundles of intermediate

00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:31,170
state from one service object to the

00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:35,920
next in order to complete that workflow

00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:38,079
that's the transactional fallacy I see

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,690
this all the time with forms forms are a

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:44,470
way that we try to force communication

00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:48,089
into the into a transactional model the

00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:50,410
communication is not transactional and

00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:52,779
so we find ourselves doing things like

00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:55,180
realizing that oh that we need to split

00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:58,899
a form across multiple pages in the debt

00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:00,730
requires some rewriting and then we

00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:02,350
discover that people are mad at us

00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,759
because they fill out part of the forum

00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:07,660
and then they have to go pick up their

00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:10,509
kids from school and and the forum has

00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:13,170
reset itself in the in mean time and so

00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:15,490
we start have to add a bunch of code to

00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:19,569
make it possible for them to save and

00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:21,430
continue later and then then we discover

00:12:19,569 --> 00:12:24,449
that oh we actually need to be able to

00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:26,829
query data from those incomplete forms

00:12:24,449 --> 00:12:29,259
so it's not sufficient to have that data

00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:32,380
just like squirrel dawei in in the the

00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:35,199
session or something and so we have to

00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:38,560
rewrite a whole bunch more in order to

00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:40,329
and change our schema this is the

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,519
transactional fallacies the results of

00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:48,220
modeling a process as if it was a

00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:50,980
transaction whenever I have to take one

00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:54,970
of my kids to a new doctor I have to

00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:55,889
spend 15 minutes filling out in intake

00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:59,529
paperwork

00:12:55,889 --> 00:13:02,470
anybody else feel my pain on this it

00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:07,259
sucks right but at least I know if I put

00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:09,880
the clipboard down it won't reset itself

00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:12,189
at least I know if they call my kid back

00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,779
to the examination room while I'm

00:13:12,189 --> 00:13:15,579
filling it out I can take it with me and

00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:18,100
I can keep filling it out while they're

00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:19,930
getting checked out at least I know if I

00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,000
leave some fields blank you know

00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:24,120
to find me they can call me back it's

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,710
not a transaction it's a process I

00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,870
shudder to think what the intake process

00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:33,310
would look like it was if it was

00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:37,450
architected by a programmer the

00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:39,070
transactional fallacy has a symbol and

00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:41,320
it's one that you're probably already

00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:43,899
familiar with even if you're not if you

00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:48,250
if you you're not aware that symbol is

00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:50,529
the spinning beach ball of doom this is

00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:53,170
the universal symbol that a programmer

00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:56,850
thought a process fought something would

00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:59,920
either finish or fail more or less

00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:06,779
instantaneously and it did neither of

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:06,779
those things so what's the alternative

00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:15,370
well for another alternative we can look

00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:18,130
again to Alan Kay he sent he thought of

00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:19,480
objects being like biological cells or

00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:21,610
individual computers on a network

00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,520
sending messages to each other does this

00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:26,680
sound does this sound like a

00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:29,950
transactional model does this sound like

00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:32,100
call and return no it sounds like

00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:34,180
something much more asynchronous and

00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:37,120
independent and when we look at the

00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:40,450
history of small talk we can see hints

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,620
of something very different this is a

00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:44,950
snippet of small talk

00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:49,709
72 code what you're looking at here is a

00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:54,690
class and that class is also a function

00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:58,000
it's a function over a stream of events

00:14:54,690 --> 00:15:00,430
and it's pattern matching on those

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:06,820
events and deciding what to do with each

00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:09,670
one now for some of you this might be

00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:13,480
ringing a little bit of a bell because

00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:17,320
if you squint it looks kind of like err

00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:21,010
Lang or a lik sir code the code for an

00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:23,710
actor pattern matching on events

00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:26,620
and this is not a coincidence there was

00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:28,510
a lot of cross cross-pollination in the

00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:35,620
history of these two projects Erlangen

00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:38,560
and Smalltalk and as you may know if you

00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:43,890
have messed with air languor elixir they

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,890
are built on what processes

00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:52,899
this is what I've realized message

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,839
orient message oriented programming

00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:57,339
implies process oriented you can't have

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,990
the one without the other you have to

00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:01,480
have something that's more like

00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:04,420
independent active processes something

00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,160
like actors when Alan Kay was talking

00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:11,889
about message oriented programming he

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:13,839
was implying objects as processes and so

00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:15,879
much of what we model in software

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,879
actually turns out to be a process it

00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:22,329
turns out to be a workflow a purchase

00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:24,339
order it's not just a static entity it

00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:26,709
gets created it goes through various

00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:29,199
states it gets filled in with line items

00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:33,269
it gets sent for review it gets

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:36,250
finalized maybe eventually gets archived

00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:40,420
user accounts our processes they get

00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:42,399
introduced maybe in a partial state and

00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,870
then they get validated confirmed and

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,509
then they might get elevated in

00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:50,560
privileges or they might get locked they

00:16:46,509 --> 00:16:53,380
too might be archived at some point HTTP

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,720
requests we try to make them look like

00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,980
transactions but they're not taking you

00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,040
know look at the look at them under a

00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:03,430
look at the actual TCP conversation

00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:09,039
that's happening there and HTTP requests

00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:11,380
are processes so much of what we we

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:14,589
model are actually processes and then we

00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:18,819
arbitrarily slice across those processes

00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:20,020
into objects into entities and we wonder

00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:25,539
why our systems are so hard to

00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:28,360
understand what if we stopped focusing

00:17:25,539 --> 00:17:32,380
on the static structure and we started

00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:35,020
looking for those processes we started

00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:37,179
explicitly modeling these workflows in

00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:40,240
those human systems that we are trying

00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:44,919
to facilitate and this is the space that

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:46,570
I've started exploring and pretty early

00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:48,760
early on in that I realized that one

00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:52,929
problem with this is that the word

00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:55,330
process is a little too ambiguous

00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:56,919
because it's highly overloaded in our

00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:58,899
space we use process to mean a lot of

00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:00,909
things already and so I've started using

00:17:58,899 --> 00:18:02,050
the word narrative instead and for the

00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:04,620
rest of this talk

00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:09,550
c'est narrative I think this captures

00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:11,350
kind of what I'm talking about the more

00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:13,510
you look the more you look at the world

00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:15,520
from this perspective the more you

00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:18,160
realize it's narratives all the way down

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:21,820
it's narratives everywhere it's not just

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:24,790
the the business models but the project

00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:29,260
that you are working on right now is a

00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:37,150
narrative your software team is a

00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:42,550
narrative your own cells are constantly

00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:46,720
dying and being replaced and yet you

00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:50,650
have a coherent identity it's not so

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:56,190
much that you are a person as that you

00:18:50,650 --> 00:19:01,540
are personal you are a living narrative

00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:03,370
and your life is a narrative it is not a

00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:06,640
transaction with a return value there is

00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:09,700
no return which means there is no finish

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:16,510
line there is no success success does

00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:19,450
not make sense in this context and I

00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:22,120
have a belief I believe very strongly

00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:25,150
that the way we design software is

00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:27,730
unconsciously influenced by our beliefs

00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:28,600
about how the world works and it goes

00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:30,520
the other way too

00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,460
I believe our ways of perceiving the

00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:37,450
world are unconsciously influenced by

00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:39,160
how we model the world in code because

00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:41,620
you can't do this stuff eight hours a

00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:46,060
day or more without it influencing the

00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:48,930
way you think of the world so

00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:52,360
transactional thinking is really a

00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:57,520
philosophical problem and it leads to

00:19:52,360 --> 00:20:00,490
brittle lives and brittle code and this

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,590
actually turns out to be a point of

00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:04,720
division among actual philosophers it's

00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:07,640
a point it's a something they debate in

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,960
the field of metaphysics

00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:13,130
between the schools of substance

00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:15,559
metaphysics and process metaphysics

00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:18,059
kelsey of Vieira has an article in a on

00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:20,130
where they say they kind of break this

00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:22,169
down they say we often see the world as

00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:24,240
a world of things objects are the

00:20:22,169 --> 00:20:26,179
paradigm attic mode of existence the

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,950
basic building blocks of the universe

00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:31,260
the process philosophers think we should

00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:34,200
instead examine the processes that make

00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:38,490
up the world processes not objects are

00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:40,820
fundamental process philosophy invites

00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:43,230
us to look at longer stretches of time

00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:46,320
blurred boundaries and connected

00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:48,960
relations identity as a process welcomes

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:54,240
innovation through small recurring

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:57,450
changes so this is a philosophical

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,700
problem I also happen to believe that

00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:01,620
programming fundamentally is not about

00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:06,179
coding programming has fundamentally

00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:08,970
applied philosophy we use code as a way

00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:14,070
to reflect our understanding of the

00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:15,659
world so we can't partition these parts

00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:19,380
of our lives we can't compartmentalize

00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:21,780
them away from each other as a result I

00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:26,250
think that the best way to start

00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:30,270
thinking in narratives may be to start

00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:32,789
with how we approach our lives so with

00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:35,250
that in mind I want to spend the rest of

00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:39,020
my time up here talking about what it

00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:41,400
means to think in terms of narratives

00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:43,559
but I want to do that mostly from the

00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,169
point of view of how I am now learning

00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:48,600
to think about my life and to live my

00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:51,780
life and along the way maybe we'll have

00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:54,169
some hints about how that might apply to

00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,169
code

00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:10,799
so first off a narrative has a direction

00:22:04,669 --> 00:22:12,480
not a goal as I've started embracing as

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:16,980
I've started moving away from a

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:22,429
goal-oriented life I've found it helpful

00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:26,519
instead of having goals to have certain

00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:29,340
images that I pull towards and these are

00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:32,489
images that are they're kind of concrete

00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:35,159
but they're also kind of fanciful my

00:22:32,489 --> 00:22:37,980
friend Artie star refers to these calls

00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:41,999
these having an arrow something that

00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:46,759
gives you direction one example of an

00:22:41,999 --> 00:22:50,179
arrow that I'll give you is my beer list

00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:53,850
now my beer list is not a list of beers

00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:56,609
it is a list of people that I would love

00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:58,350
to have a beer with someday now you will

00:22:56,609 --> 00:23:01,850
probably not be surprised at this point

00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:06,330
to learn that Alan Kay is on that list

00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:09,859
but there are others it'd be really cool

00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:13,759
to have a beer with the poet Ruby Cour I

00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:13,759
think that would be fascinating

00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:20,610
I'd love to have a beer with a dancer

00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:23,910
marquise Scott someday otherwise known

00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:27,780
as non-stop but here's the thing about

00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:29,940
the beer list it's not about I hope I

00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:32,130
random like run into them in an airport

00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:35,450
bar someday or I get a backstage pass

00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:35,450
it's not about that

00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:43,230
what the beer list means is what would

00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:45,870
it mean what would it take for it to

00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:47,340
make sense for me to have a beer with

00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:51,560
one of these people for one of these

00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:51,560
people to want to have a beer with me

00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:57,060
what is the direction that my life would

00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:59,430
need to move in for that to become more

00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:02,640
likely what are the circles that I would

00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:04,350
need to move in what is the impact that

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,820
I should be have the kind of impact that

00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:07,920
I should be having on the world and

00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:10,140
people around me in order to make that

00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:15,630
kind of thing that kind of meeting more

00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:19,890
likely who do I need to be who do I need

00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:22,050
to be becoming in order for one of these

00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:24,240
meetings to be more likely I will

00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:26,820
probably never have a beer with most of

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:30,300
the people on this list but it gives me

00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:35,910
a direction it gives me a heuristic when

00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:39,120
making choices in life what does it mean

00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:42,270
what might it mean for code to have a

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,010
direction instead of a goal well it

00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:46,980
could mean embracing the actor model

00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:49,910
like I was talking about earlier or it

00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:52,050
could mean just acknowledging that

00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:54,990
all-or-nothing thinking is not good

00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:58,620
enough and then we need feedback earlier

00:24:54,990 --> 00:25:03,140
than all done and so structuring our

00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:06,450
code using streaming or batching models

00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:07,860
if you want to learn more about doing

00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:10,320
things using the actor model approach

00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,490
elixir is a great way of learning licks

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,090
ER is a great way to start it's kind of

00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:17,730
a mash up of air Lang and Ruby many

00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:21,410
people here or have studied some elixir

00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:21,410
I'm curious nice

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,330
so in narrative has the direction and

00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:32,090
having a direction implies that a

00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:34,880
narrative is constantly becoming and

00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:37,670
becoming requires being also aware of

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:41,660
where you are so you can see where that

00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:44,540
direction points where you are what and

00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:50,540
who you are now and that means that a

00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:54,110
narrative must be aware of itself the

00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:56,210
best teacher you could possibly have for

00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:58,010
being aware of yourself is one that's

00:25:56,210 --> 00:26:03,190
right there with you all the time

00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:08,030
it's your body your body is never static

00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:10,430
it has no ideal end state your body is

00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:13,370
constantly dying and replacing itself

00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:16,880
your body will interrupt you in the

00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:20,930
middle of of trying to achieve some

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:24,740
return value with little reminders of

00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:31,130
the process of life like I'm sleepy

00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:33,470
I'm hungry I'm cold you know I think as

00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:38,060
programmers we try really hard to be

00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:42,590
brains in jars we like to pretend that

00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:46,250
our ideas can be completely separated

00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:48,860
from our bodies learning to embrace

00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:52,160
narrative as a person means

00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:56,030
acknowledging that you are an embodied

00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:58,430
mammal it means learning to live in your

00:26:56,030 --> 00:27:00,020
body this can mean something as simple

00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:02,660
as embracing some kind of mindfulness

00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:07,370
practice I mean taking up yoga can mean

00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:08,660
running or lifting or biking all these

00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:12,170
things can help put you in touch with

00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:19,640
your body but as you do any of these

00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:22,970
activities be careful because we hackers

00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:25,580
are so addicted to being brains and jars

00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:28,490
that even as we're in the midst of these

00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:31,040
activities in our bodies we find ways of

00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:33,789
taking ourselves out of our bodies and

00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:39,129
getting back into our analytical brains

00:27:33,789 --> 00:27:41,200
measure and we quantify instead of

00:27:39,129 --> 00:27:43,600
learning to listen to our bodies and in

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:47,970
case it's not clear what I'm saying what

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,970
I'm saying is throw away your Fitbit

00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:55,659
learn to feel when it's time to take

00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:59,350
more steps learn to feel your target

00:27:55,659 --> 00:28:03,659
heart rate learn to feel when you're

00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:03,659
dehydrated excuse me

00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:13,559
what might it mean for code to be

00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:18,590
self-aware well it could mean building

00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:20,220
our code building in observability first

00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:21,590
instead of treating it like an

00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:25,320
afterthought

00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:27,899
it could mean finding ways to make our

00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:31,009
algorithms tell the story of their

00:28:27,899 --> 00:28:33,419
results and the provenance of their data

00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:37,769
this could help with addressing

00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:40,159
algorithmic bias as well if you want to

00:28:37,769 --> 00:28:42,690
get started learning more about about

00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:46,109
building observability in I highly

00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:47,369
recommend charity majors work follow her

00:28:46,109 --> 00:28:54,869
on Twitter look at the stuff that she's

00:28:47,369 --> 00:28:58,409
written knowing where you are and where

00:28:54,869 --> 00:29:00,799
you're going also means that you know

00:28:58,409 --> 00:29:00,799
where you've been

00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:08,220
so embracing narrative means embracing

00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:10,139
history and state I realized that

00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:14,369
embracing state is not always the most

00:29:10,139 --> 00:29:16,739
popular suggestion but state it's simply

00:29:14,369 --> 00:29:18,539
the acknowledgement that everyone

00:29:16,739 --> 00:29:21,509
everything we want to accomplish with

00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:24,450
computers or otherwise involves the

00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:26,159
passage of time state is the

00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:27,480
acknowledgment that any narrative in the

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,629
world whether it's a work flow or a

00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:36,210
human being is an accumulation of events

00:29:30,629 --> 00:29:40,429
and their lasting effects you know we

00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:44,759
love the idea of a clean reset a reboot

00:29:40,429 --> 00:29:48,450
it's so simplifying but that's not what

00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:52,580
we actually have to work with embracing

00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:54,419
state means embracing history and

00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:56,210
acknowledging that there are no clean

00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:59,759
slates we have to build with the past

00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:01,529
means embracing it means embracing that

00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:03,029
rich legacy project instead of throwing

00:30:01,529 --> 00:30:06,019
it away and building a new one no matter

00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:06,019
how much you might want to

00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:11,510
it could mean other things too it could

00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:14,030
mean looking into the practice of

00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:16,070
temporal modeling which is the practice

00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:19,880
which is the practice of modeling your

00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:21,890
systems no not in terms of their static

00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:24,590
entities and structure but in terms of

00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:27,980
the events that occur and the commands

00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:29,780
that humans send to them this leads

00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:32,090
naturally into the event sourcing

00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:33,380
architecture which is another great

00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:36,140
thing to study if you haven't looked

00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:38,030
into it modeling again modeling systems

00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:41,960
in terms of the flow of events through

00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:43,820
them first and discovering these events

00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,730
figuring out how your system is

00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:49,130
structured out of events can mean

00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:50,840
looking into events storming which is a

00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:53,660
way of getting everyone together and

00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:55,640
figuring out how your system looks from

00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:58,130
it from a temporal perspective from an

00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,179
event-based perspective and discovering

00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:01,040
those events you want to learn more

00:30:59,179 --> 00:31:04,510
about that last one event storming look

00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,510
into Alberto Brandolini his work

00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:15,429
embracing history means embracing

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:21,380
entropy it means embracing surprises and

00:31:15,429 --> 00:31:27,110
failure but in narratives we look for a

00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:32,170
way to fail forwards because we realize

00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:32,170
that there will always be surprises

00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:38,059
sometimes the Skorpion just falls onto

00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:44,870
your monitor out of the blue totally

00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:47,090
hypothetical example but think about in

00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:49,250
in standard oo languages like Ruby what

00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:54,020
is this what is the stereotypical way to

00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:58,040
handle a surprise of this nature we

00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:59,720
raise an exception right we blow away

00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,340
the whole process the whole the whole

00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,050
stack blow away all of our local

00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:05,270
variables all of our state probably a

00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:07,850
bunch of database connections and other

00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:09,410
connections in the process we wipe away

00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:11,600
you know we burned down the whole house

00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:13,990
we wipe away any of the any of the

00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,640
information that might have helped us

00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:19,629
diagnose that problem or maybe even

00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,320
continue forwards from it

00:32:19,629 --> 00:32:24,259
you know something that I've observed

00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:27,109
over my career is that the more focus we

00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:29,090
get on preventing failure the more

00:32:27,109 --> 00:32:31,549
catastrophic the failure is when it

00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:35,720
finally breaks through and it always

00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:39,379
breaks through we need to be less

00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:43,450
focused on preventing failure and how

00:32:39,379 --> 00:32:46,309
more on how we adapt and move forwards

00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:52,159
part of this be part of this means being

00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:56,899
okay with being not okay it means

00:32:52,159 --> 00:33:00,859
learning to sit and work skillfully with

00:32:56,899 --> 00:33:02,570
suffering and failure my friend Amy

00:33:00,859 --> 00:33:04,070
Noelle has been giving some talks some

00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:05,539
great talks about the importance of

00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:08,149
working skillfully with suffering

00:33:05,539 --> 00:33:09,919
instead of rejecting it and she is

00:33:08,149 --> 00:33:11,389
giving a talk later at this conference

00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:16,789
and you should totally go to it Amy are

00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:20,269
you in here okay Amy you should totally

00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:23,450
go to our talk so what is what does it

00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:25,429
mean to fail for words in code well it

00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:28,129
could mean choosing in some situations

00:33:25,429 --> 00:33:30,409
in some contexts not to model failure as

00:33:28,129 --> 00:33:33,859
an exception not to model surprises as

00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:36,139
exceptions but model that is an outcome

00:33:33,859 --> 00:33:38,989
instead collect information about the

00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:44,529
outcome errors as data could mean

00:33:38,989 --> 00:33:45,950
embracing patterns like sagas sagas

00:33:44,529 --> 00:33:48,049
ar-ar-ar

00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:51,139
a pattern where instead of trying to

00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:52,999
prevent failure we staged some actions

00:33:51,139 --> 00:33:56,029
that for mitigating the failure should

00:33:52,999 --> 00:33:58,879
it occur we get those ready and then if

00:33:56,029 --> 00:34:04,029
it does happen we apply those those

00:33:58,879 --> 00:34:06,739
mitigating actions in general it means

00:34:04,029 --> 00:34:09,220
spending less of our time trying to

00:34:06,739 --> 00:34:12,230
prevent working to prevent failure

00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:14,510
writing code to prevent failure writing

00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:16,849
tests and checks to prevent failure and

00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:19,129
more of our time thinking about how are

00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:21,710
we going to do mitigation how are we

00:34:19,129 --> 00:34:24,099
going to do remediation when something

00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:24,099
does go wrong

00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:31,549
mitigation and remediation can be as

00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:33,869
simple as issuing a heartfelt apology

00:34:31,549 --> 00:34:36,419
instead of being heads down so heads

00:34:33,869 --> 00:34:40,740
down in trying to fix it that you look

00:34:36,419 --> 00:34:42,869
like you're not even there the the

00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:44,879
resilience engineering movement has

00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:47,549
started a wonderful conversation about

00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:50,339
this and one of the things that they

00:34:47,549 --> 00:34:54,210
will tell you is that you cant encode

00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:55,919
resilience into your software you can

00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:58,470
only build resistance into the

00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:03,240
socio-technical system that surrounds

00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:05,369
your software and if you want to learn

00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:07,020
more about resilience engineering one

00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:10,730
place to start is with this the stella

00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:10,730
report you can look that up

00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:22,999
being learning to be okay in a failed

00:35:16,499 --> 00:35:22,999
state means embracing interdependence

00:35:23,089 --> 00:35:28,079
when my transactional life raised an

00:35:25,829 --> 00:35:30,299
exception and came crashing down I

00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,609
realized something I realized I had a

00:35:30,299 --> 00:35:34,769
lot of friends online but I had

00:35:32,609 --> 00:35:41,279
completely failed to build my local

00:35:34,769 --> 00:35:43,049
tribe locally I had no one I did a

00:35:41,279 --> 00:35:45,569
Twitter poll about this a while back and

00:35:43,049 --> 00:35:47,670
over a thousand people responded and the

00:35:45,569 --> 00:35:49,380
vast majority of them felt that they did

00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:55,499
not have an adequate local support

00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:58,170
system I think this is an epidemic

00:35:55,499 --> 00:36:01,349
problem among programmers I think part

00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:02,700
of being a brain in a jar is that we

00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:05,160
find it really easy to content ourselves

00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:08,130
with online relationships you know it's

00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:09,749
not it's not a big leap from believing

00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:12,569
we can divorce our ideas from the rest

00:36:09,749 --> 00:36:14,279
of our bodies to believing that typing

00:36:12,569 --> 00:36:17,190
text to a friend is just as good as

00:36:14,279 --> 00:36:20,220
getting beer together and it is just as

00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:23,999
good until it's not so you really really

00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:26,700
need to just go out and and have someone

00:36:23,999 --> 00:36:28,109
who can actually hold your hand and talk

00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:31,769
things through with you or until you

00:36:28,109 --> 00:36:33,509
need somebody who can bring a meal over

00:36:31,769 --> 00:36:39,989
to you when you can't bring yourself to

00:36:33,509 --> 00:36:41,249
get out of bed so if you're in that

00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:45,650
majority if you feel like you're in that

00:36:41,249 --> 00:36:48,839
majority that doesn't have an adequate

00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:50,460
local support network if you take

00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:52,470
nothing else away from this talk I hope

00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:54,749
you'll take this away I strongly

00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:57,450
encourage you come out and start

00:36:54,749 --> 00:36:59,849
building those local friendships do it

00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:02,970
now before something catastrophic

00:36:59,849 --> 00:37:06,259
happens if you're not sure how to get

00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:06,259
started please come talk to me

00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:14,930
what does it look like for code to be

00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:16,940
interdependent well we actually have a

00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:21,920
lot of we have a lot of patterns for

00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:25,369
this patterns like backpressure and Q's

00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:27,559
or back-off algorithms or the circuit

00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:30,260
breaker pattern the thing that all these

00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:34,160
have in common is that they're all about

00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:35,660
one component holding state for another

00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,089
component meaning they're all about

00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:40,700
components knowing about each other not

00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:44,200
being black boxes but knowing about each

00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:47,359
other knowing about each other's health

00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:51,920
in other words these are all rudimentary

00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:53,210
forms of empathy in code if you want to

00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,069
learn more about some of these patterns

00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:57,619
I recommend checking out one of these

00:37:55,069 --> 00:38:02,119
books release it or reactor design

00:37:57,619 --> 00:38:05,619
patterns they've got some great stuff so

00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:09,290
these are these are some of the values

00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:13,099
that I'm learning as I learn to look at

00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:17,770
life more in terms of narratives have a

00:38:13,099 --> 00:38:23,829
direction since yourself embrace state

00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:23,829
fail forwards and be interdependent

00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:31,940
transactions they I either finish or

00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:36,800
they fail and along the way they deny

00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:40,790
other possibilities but narratives go on

00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:44,000
and on like a graceful dance they

00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:46,880
embrace possibility so I want to

00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:51,620
encourage you to weave graceful

00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,820
narratives in code and in life thank you

00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:58,280
very much

00:38:52,820 --> 00:39:11,589
[Applause]
