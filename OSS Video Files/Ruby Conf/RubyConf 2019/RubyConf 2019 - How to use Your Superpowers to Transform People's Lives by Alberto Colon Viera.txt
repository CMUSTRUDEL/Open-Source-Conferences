	RubyConf 2019 - How to use Your Superpowers to Transform People's Lives by Alberto Colon Viera

Have you ever thought about how government services should actually meet people's expectations? Have you ever considered using your skill sets to transform the way government operates?

Even if you haven't, you have to interact with government in your everyday life. Imagine being able to use your programming and technical superpowers to design a new government. You'll hear about how the U.S. Digital Service (USDS) team at the Small Business Administration redesigned the experience for small business owners. And we used ruby! You'll also learn about the civic tech ecosystem and other organizations from where you can contribute, as well as how USDS keeps transforming people's lives at other agencies.

>> Hi. So, hello. I'm gonna talk today about how to use your superpowers to transform people's

00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:29,630
lives. So, first, let me introduce myself. Hola. My name is Alberto. I'm originally from Puerto

00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:37,540
Rico, so my thoughts are in Spanish.  You may be asking yourself what are we talking

00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:47,629
about. Let's talk about government. So, this is healthcare.gov. So, this is a screen

00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:53,610
shot from a week ago. Open enrollment season is up. And you can go there and enroll for

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,690
healthcare benefits. But it wasn't always like that. When the affordable care act was

00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:06,940
passed, Medicare were given the ability to develop a new website. Government officials

00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:13,200
did it the way they know how to do it. They did a contract and put millions of dollars

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:20,830
into it and started gathering requirements.  They built something. Fast forward to October

00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:28,450
2013, and open enrollment season opened and users went to the website and it crashed. The

00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:36,280
system was down. It couldn't handle the load. That's how the website looked for a while. It would

00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:42,660
read the system is down at the moment. We're working to resolve the issue as soon as possible. So,

00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:47,290
a group of technologists from the private sector was called to help. They temporarily

00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:52,130
moved to Washington ‑‑ more like Maryland ‑‑ and started working on stabilizing the website. It

00:01:52,130 --> 00:02:05,980
was probably ‑‑ it basically states that organizations tend to design systems that

00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:12,760
replicate their own communication structures.  So they got people in the same room. They

00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,840
started breaking their communication walls, and they implemented some monitoring tools

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,799
that actually were pretty badly needed and got the website up. Citizens were able to

00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:30,430
get access to healthcare and benefits. So, healthcare.gov has become the modern poster

00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:40,129
child of government failure. Fast forward to 2014, part of that rescue team from healthcare.gov

00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:48,400
founded a service. They wanted to recruit designers, engineers, and bureaucracy hackers

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:55,260
to join a tour of duty from six months to four years and anything in between, and put

00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:01,379
them to work with the national civil servants to untangle the most important government

00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:05,689
services.  So today, this is how it works. The U.S.

00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:11,260
digital service is a team of nerds across the federal government. And we use design

00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:16,140
and technology to deliver better services to the American people. But let's go back

00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:22,930
to that healthcare conversation we were having. So, why does that matter? What's the deal with

00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,020
the website?  So, well, it's not about the tech, right? The

00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:32,709
problem is not with the tech. It's about the impact on people's lives. So, there are

00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:38,029
some stats from the health conference this year. Kudos to a co‑worker who live tweeted

00:03:38,029 --> 00:03:44,319
this, because I wasn't there. And I'm going to share some of this. Over the past 20 years,

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:56,239
U.S. drug spending has increased by 330%. Health expenditures increased by 208%total U.S. Specialty

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:04,650
drugs predicted to account for 55%of spending by 2020. Insulin increased in list price

00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:14,980
by more than 350% between 2002 and 2016. And medical costs are, like, one of the prime

00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:20,919
contributors in two out of three bankruptcies in the United States. 

00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:29,419
So, that website could make the difference between life or death. So, said otherwise,

00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:34,490
like that website was important because people are the mission. 

00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:40,889
So I was talking about the USDS, the team of nerds. We have been working on multiple

00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:46,650
agencies across the federal government. I will mention some of them. We have teams

00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,740
at the VA working with veterans to provide them access to their benefits. We have a

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,550
team at the health and human services, which is where I work today, where we're transforming

00:04:54,550 --> 00:05:00,419
the delivery of care by modernizing the Medicare structure and providing access to beneficiaries

00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:09,580
to their data. We have a team working to improve the path to citizens and asylum seekers. We

00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:16,090
have a team at DOD improving the life of military families. We have a team at the small business

00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:21,970
administration helping economically disadvantaged small business owners, and this is what I

00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:28,210
want to talk about today. I was part of a team that was sent to the small business administration. I

00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:34,370
was the second engineer to join. And we worked there for more than two and a half years transforming

00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:40,520
the experience for economically disadvantaged businesses. You get a sense. This is the

00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,199
small business administration and this is their mission. 

00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:46,979
[ Reading ]

00:05:46,979 --> 00:06:05,490
So, the SBA basically has a bunch of programs, and some of them are aligned to government

00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:10,860
contracting in business development. And they fulfill the SBA mission in the following

00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:18,319
way. The federal government awards contracts. They have billions of dollars that get awarded

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,971
every year, and they want to open that up to small businesses, especially small businesses

00:06:23,971 --> 00:06:30,460
that are started and owned by underrepresented groups. SBA sets goals so that agencies award

00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:35,820
a fixed percentage of their contracts to those small businesses, and then small businesses

00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:41,530
not only grow economically, but they grow and develop their business to education, partnership,

00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:47,860
and mentorship. This is what these programs try to do. Let's do some numbers around that

00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:53,389
so we can gauge the impact.  So the federal government awarded $120.8 billion

00:06:53,389 --> 00:07:04,000
to small businesses in 2018. That only represented 25%of all the contract money that was awarded

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,300
by the federal government. And that was actually an increase on $15 billion more than previous

00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:19,699
fiscal year for small businesses.  So, that's a lot of money. So, what are these

00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:25,569
programs that I've been talking about? Just to give you some more sense of how it works,

00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:29,080
so these are some of the SBA programs. You can go to SBA.gov and read the details. I'm

00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:35,169
going to go through all of them. But in a nutshell, if you or someone you know start

00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:41,840
a business and you're either a woman, a service‑disabled veteran or an economically disadvantaged minority,

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:55,060
the government will prefer to contract you.  So one of those programs is actually the HUBZone

00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:03,050
program. It stands for historically underutilized business zones. This is a very interesting

00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:09,199
program. It is to promote job growth, capital investment and development in economically

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:18,240
distressed communities. They need to have their principle office in one of the economically

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:25,460
distressed areas and they need to hire at least 35%of their employees from there. So,

00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:30,889
the idea is to drive dollars to the economy and grow those depressed economies. 

00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:36,919
So, I mentioned having a building in one place and hiring from one place. So, basically

00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:49,500
if we were to simplify this, HUBZone is a map. So, this is what you see, the different

00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:56,870
colors are HUBZone areas. Let me zoom out this is Tennessee and some of the surrounding

00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:02,370
states. As you see, there's many, many more HUBZone areas. If you keep zooming out, this

00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:07,209
is the United States. Part of it. This is the real United States. So, you have like

00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:14,240
Alaska, Hawai'i, Puerto Rico, virgin islands. So, as you see, big portions of some states are

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:25,310
big HUBZones. So, at this point, you're probably asking, like, how is all of this determined,

00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:30,660
maybe?  So, basically in order to qualify the areas,

00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:35,370
the small business administration uses geographic and statistical data from multiple government

00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:42,220
agencies. They look for such indicators like income, poverty, and unemployment to determine

00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:48,630
whether that area should be a HUBZone. They aggregate this data with what the census called

00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:57,440
county and census level. The SBA identifies Indian lands, difficult development areas,

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:04,880
closed military bases, and areas hit by natural disasters to add them as additional HUBZones. These

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:13,370
data are updated at different intervals. The ideal is to drive economic activity to all

00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:21,790
of these areas I mentioned.  So, I showed you the little pretty fancy map? But,

00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:30,870
well, it wasn't like that when we joined SBA. This is what we found. It was like we walked in

00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:38,681
and we found the last existence of MapQuest. This is what the small business administration

00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:46,300
was using until 2017. If you were to use two words to describe it, the team will call

00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:52,199
it sad map. This actually became like our mascot. This became the mascot for our 500

00:10:52,199 --> 00:11:00,850
error page on the new map.  So it was pretty bad. So, it had limitations. It

00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:06,470
had no documentation, no version control, no APIs or web services, it wasn't mobile‑friendly,

00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:17,389
it took forever to load. It was built in a proprietary GIS technology. It had limited

00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:23,230
data export capabilities. And of course, some features require a desktop client that

00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:34,459
you needed to install.  So someone could be asking here, why don't

00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:39,329
you ditch that and just get the data? Right? Well, yeah. We started and then we found the ring

00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:45,790
binder. So, there was a binder full of CDs, and basically it contained like the archive

00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:54,030
of HUBZone data for all the years. It was in some proprietary format, too. We couldn't

00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:59,630
know which CDs were missing, and not all of them were even labeled. 

00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:11,680
So, if this is what it looked like, how did that thing even work, right? How is it maintained? Let

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:23,089
me simplify this. A human would burn a CDROM, and it would go into the mail, next‑day

00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:28,760
delivery. Hopefully it gets received in one or two days, and then more humans would do

00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:36,209
things with the CD using computers with servers and a data center, not on the cloud. And

00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:44,029
then it would be deployed somewhere. So, an SBA analyst would go and open his computer

00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:51,220
and would manually test it somehow. And they would continue the process of repeating indefinitely

00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:58,520
until it was ready to deploy or they had, like, a patch that needed to be applied. 

00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:05,459
It could take up to six months to do a data update. But then, let's complicate things

00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:11,279
a bit more. So, it turns out that some of the HUBZone areas actually expire. So, by

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:19,060
the time the data was published, well, it was actually out of date. So, let's pause

00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:25,030
here. There was like a crazy roller coaster of things that we had to deal with. And the

00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:31,220
truth is that the basic infrastructure that the agency needed was not there. Government

00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:35,899
partners didn't know how to fix it, and they didn't know what was a better solution. There

00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:42,500
were like a lot more things that we had to untangle and fix in order to fix the HUBZone

00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:47,120
map.  But, let's circle back to the user for a second. So,

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:55,509
how did this work for small businesses? So the short answer is, like, it didn't. So,

00:13:55,509 --> 00:14:00,779
if you're a HUBZone small business owner, you would face the following situations. You

00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:06,381
had an out of date map. You needed to make business decisions about where to locate your

00:14:06,381 --> 00:14:14,250
business and where to hire from using inaccurate data. Basically this could comprise adverse

00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:19,870
economical impact for them. For example, one business owner was moving his principle

00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:25,000
office to a completely new location because his HUBZone was expiring, and it turns out

00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,329
that the place he was going to move to was not going to be a HUBZone either. So, businesses

00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:36,569
were at risk of losing their contracts if they didn't stay in compliance with the program. And

00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:41,960
this translated to an additional overhead. Small businesses have to do extra paperwork and

00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,800
do more checks and keep their own data records just to track whether they were HUBZone compliant

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,370
or not.  So, it can be definitely hard to grow a business

00:14:52,370 --> 00:15:00,760
under such conditions. So, we fixed it. We modernized it. I want to talk about how we

00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,430
did it and the things that mattered in the process so you get a sense. 

00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:12,079
So this is the new HUBZone map. I want to give kudos to Tyler who was here, one of the

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:20,110
core engineers working on this with amazing design front‑end superpowers. I'm pretty

00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:24,959
proud of the work we did here. This wasn't about the tech, actually. This served as

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,759
a foundation for many of the things that we did at the small business administration to

00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:37,440
help other economically disadvantaged programs. This was built on rails and we used Ruby to modernize

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,459
all parts of the HUBZone program. We helped the agency determine which ones they needed

00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:48,899
to subscribe to and which ones they needed to maintain. That meant we needed to hack

00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:55,709
the way that traditional services were bought and purchased in government. 

00:15:55,709 --> 00:16:04,260
So let me take you through the journey. So, this is our map. So, you go there and type

00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:09,399
an address. We decided, like, the agency should not build their own geocoding infrastructure

00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:15,160
again. So, we adopted Google services. So you could get Google places and simplify your

00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:21,510
searching process. Once you have your address, it will take you there. And then you would

00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:28,690
see the address and the coordinate. And you would see your HUBZone qualification. That

00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:37,420
side bar was one of the most complex things to build. It wasn't that we couldn't do JavaScript. It

00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,959
was hard because simple is hard. It was a lot of policy and complexity in this program,

00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:47,529
and we needed to simplify this on that side bar for users to make sense of it. It required

00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:51,770
thoughtful research and feedback from our users. It required restructuring the HUBZone

00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:58,790
data to get all of the information we needed to provide back to business owners. It required

00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:05,430
a lot of policy hacking. We needed to work with lawyers and designers in order to understand

00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:09,380
not only how policy should be implemented in software but how information should be

00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:15,780
conveyed to users.  You could click anywhere and you would see

00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:22,079
the information for the new place you selected. So, geocoding is, like, not perfect. Big companies

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:28,070
have not perfected it. We quickly learned that in some rural areas and places like Puerto

00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:36,640
Rico, geocoding is not perfect. We implemented some reverse mechanism so an SBA analyst could

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:44,710
get an approximate address when he was looking into business compliance. We not only had

00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:48,730
different personas for different business owners with different needs and expectations,

00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:59,200
but also government employees for which this became their tool. 

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,760
You see all of the layers and formats. There are dates that could be in multiple layers

00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:10,500
that are overlapping. So we needed to remove the noise in cases where the expiration date

00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,340
from one area didn't really matter, like this one, right? When you see on the side bar,

00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:22,030
there's a redesignated county that expires December 21, 2031, and there's a census tract

00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:31,160
in there that doesn't expire. So, we tell users that you don't need to care. You qualify. 

00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:38,929
And then this tool was used and made an impact for users in vulnerable communities. I mentioned

00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:48,510
Indian and other communities for HUBZone. Areas hit by disaster are one of those. This

00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:57,740
tool can help rebuilding a community and rebuilding a business. And policy can be complex. So,

00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:03,250
sadly, policymakers usually don't have technologists in the room to help translate words in regulation

00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:12,820
to software. Or from stopping them from adding the wrong language to the policy. We have

00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:20,850
redesignated county. But hurricane Irma and Matthew actually affected this area. Based

00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:29,830
on the way that HUBZone qualified disaster areas are designated and due to the complexity

00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:35,640
stemming from the written policy, this area could actually become a qualified disaster

00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:42,250
area in the future and remain HUBZone for many years, or it could very well not. So,

00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:46,850
we had to find the right balance between not telling users what was happening versus trying

00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:51,559
to simplify the language and the policy, and all the concerns coming from the agency stakeholders

00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:56,789
about conveying information that could be misleading. 

00:19:56,789 --> 00:20:01,230
We put a lot of effort into writing plain, simple language, making the tool accessible

00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:07,299
to users. We tested with users to make sure it was compliant and accessible. Being a

00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:14,370
visual tool, we checked for color blindness so that all users were included. 

00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:20,360
So our technical strategy was quite simple. We just built a geospatial data pipeline. We

00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:34,950
used a lot of tools. Being a geographic data system, we used many tools and gems to process

00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:43,280
and render our geospatial data. We worked hard to automate things. We adopted an API‑first

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:49,400
architecture. It became evident that we didn't want to reinvent the wheel. And government

00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,880
is not good about building software. So, we wanted to subscribe to commercial products

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,040
where it made sense and be intentional about the software we were building. We had to

00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:09,480
think about the use cases and others using our tool to get better at building APIs. From

00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:18,370
the hubs to the API generated PDF to the other internal and external services that were interacted

00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:24,960
with, everything was an API.  And we wrapped up everything in a single app

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:34,260
built with Rails. We adopted the U.S. design system. It would design with accessibility

00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:40,799
in mind. And we slowly evolved into our own design system. We added many features from

00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:51,179
sharing HUBZone locations to adding street view. An SBA analyst needs to go to the field

00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:57,039
and find the principle offices of the businesses. At times they don't know where to go or the address

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:03,179
doesn't properly geocode, so we use Google street view to provide an additional way to

00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:09,820
do a virtual site visit.  And we adopted the cloud. We started building

00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:20,510
what became the foundation for engineering culture at the agency. We built some tools

00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:26,289
for that, and we worked together with other projects, especially the SBA.gov team to standardize

00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:34,039
their tools and think about scaling and managing our cloud instances in collaboration. 

00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:39,909
And finally, we established a framework at the agency to open source software. This

00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:45,470
is code.gov, a government initiative to foster collaboration and reuse of code in the federal

00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:53,110
government. So, we sat down and put together a process so that other teams could adopt ‑‑

00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:57,150
that other teams could adopt and start open sourcing their work. You can go there and

00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:02,679
see many more projects that the SBA has opened up. 

00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:11,870
So, in case you haven't got the hint, let me be very clear. You can do this job. Government

00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:16,600
doesn't need complex solutions that implement all the buzz words. It needs nimble solutions

00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:26,220
designed with users at the center.  Government definitely needs better experiences. This

00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:36,029
is not about government. It's about citizens. Citizens need better experiences. They deserve better

00:23:36,029 --> 00:23:40,799
experiences. And for some, it could mean life or death or growth of their communities

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:46,400
and the commonwealth. So, all of our users are represented here and the teams that we

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:52,760
work. And there's more. We need people to come and do a tour of duty to help citizens. 

00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:59,970
So you're probably asking yourself right now, how can I do this? Right? If I just wanted

00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:06,919
to ‑‑ I just want to tell you where you can start looking at. So, this is code for

00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:16,440
America. Has anyone heard for Code for America here? Basically, this is a nonprofit organization

00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:21,990
that was created, and they started with a fellowship program sending technologies to

00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:27,091
government to work on open source projects in different cities. And then they also were

00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:34,429
creating brigades that basically got together technologies, citizens, and local government

00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:38,900
to transform their cities.  They have built a network of brigades all

00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:45,250
over the nation, and they are actively working on improving their cities. If there's not

00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:50,810
a brigade, you can start one. And this is the best way to start making an impact. You

00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:55,549
know all of your problems better than anyone, and you know the people that suffer them,

00:24:55,549 --> 00:24:59,409
too.  I had the opportunity when I was in Puerto

00:24:59,409 --> 00:25:03,640
Rico to be part of the founding team for code for Puerto Rico, and we worked closely with

00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:09,659
the state government back then to integrate their open data portal with services and prototypes

00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:19,010
that citizens were building.  And then imagine Code for America, but, like,

00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:25,299
international, right? So this is Code for All. It is a collaborative network made of

00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:30,600
organizations from all over the world. As you can see, it includes Code for America,

00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:37,270
and basically it is the umbrella for all the nationwide Code for America brigades, you

00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:44,710
could say. There's Code for Japan, there's Code for Australia, Code for Brazil. There's

00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:53,169
initiatives in Mexico and Code for Canada. You can also collaborate with technologists if

00:25:53,169 --> 00:26:01,940
you're not in the United States.  And then this is the U.S. digital service,

00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:08,399
right? So if you are in the United States, you can work at the U.S. digital service. So,

00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:14,410
as I mentioned, we do a tour of duty, and you can join and work from six months to four

00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:19,470
years, and anything in between.  And we need to represent America as diverse

00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:24,110
as it is. So, we hire from all over the place, even from Alaska, Hawai'i, Puerto Rico, and

00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:32,809
virgin islands. We need people to bring perspective to the way we build services for Americans. I

00:26:32,809 --> 00:26:40,250
put here some stats about our leadership. We try to be a diverse culture, so we're serious

00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:46,309
about looking at ourselves. So, these are some stats from ‑‑ gender stats from

00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:52,179
our leadership. So, basically 58% of our leadership are female. We're pretty proud

00:26:52,179 --> 00:27:02,399
about that. And 44% of our staff self‑identifies as female, too. 

00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:10,399
And then there's 18F. So, if you ‑‑ if you know about the general service administration

00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:17,690
it's an agency that provides services to government from construction and buildings to buying

00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:23,480
cars and planes. So, they have the technology transformation service, and under the technology

00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:29,690
transformation service, 18F exists. So they're like an internal consultancy shop that other

00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:37,240
government agencies can hire to help them build modern software putting users at the

00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:45,480
center.  If you don't want to come to dc to join USDS,

00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:51,720
they hire all over the nation, remote first. They will be looking for the next director of engineering,

00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:58,080
so if you're interested, you should check it out. 

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:04,590
And then there are initiatives at different states. So, I'm putting here the Colorado

00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:12,940
digital services, because a former team member just left to start this venture. So, the

00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:17,600
government wants to start a digital service initiative over there and transform the way

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:23,750
digital services are developed and exist at the state level. There are multiple initiatives

00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:30,300
like this. New York City has one that is looking to hire. San Francisco has an innovation

00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:34,520
office. Other government agencies in California are also looking for great talent. There

00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:42,110
are multiple initiatives in different states where you could help transform the lives of

00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:47,440
citizens.  There's also some fellowships. So, this is

00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:53,130
the presidential innovation fellows. This is a program that pairs talented diverse technologists

00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:58,669
and leaders with top civil servants and change makers working at the highest level of government

00:28:58,669 --> 00:29:06,760
to tackle some of the biggest problems. They actually live under GSA today. And you can

00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:11,070
do like one year of service with them and go to an agency and transform the way things

00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:15,570
are built and developed for users and bring your talent to them. 

00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:20,980
And then I also mentioned earlier, like, policymakers don't actually have technologists at the table

00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:28,460
most of the time. So, there are some folks trying to change that. So, this is techcongress. Techcongress

00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:32,779
gives talented technologists the opportunity to gain first‑hand experience in federal

00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:39,270
policymaking and shape the future of tech policy. So, important things are happening

00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:43,910
today in our country. So, if you want to have a seat at the table and transform the

00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:49,840
way policy is shaped and think about the digital age, you can do this tour of duty and support

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:56,970
that.  And maybe you're not, like, in is job market,

00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:04,799
and you're like either a graduate student or undergrad. So, there's coding it forward. They're

00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,860
like an internship program for students, and they also work with government agencies and

00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:16,820
partners to pair them to transform pressing problems in federal agencies. This is a great

00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:23,659
program. So, they not only bring interns to government, but they also look for technologies

00:30:23,659 --> 00:30:29,220
that could serve as mentors to those interns. I had the opportunity to do that, and this is

00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,730
a great experience that I would recommend to anyone. 

00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:41,480
So, if I haven't convinced ‑‑ if government was like an object, we really need to monkeypatch

00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:47,020
government to have it work as intended. I hope you will join us. Thank you. 

00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:47,570
