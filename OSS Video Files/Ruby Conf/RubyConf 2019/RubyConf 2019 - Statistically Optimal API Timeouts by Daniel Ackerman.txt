	RubyConf 2019 - Statistically Optimal API Timeouts by Daniel Ackerman

Have you ever written code that retries an API request? How did you pick the amount of time to wait before retrying? If you resorted to making an 'educated best guess' then this talk is for you.

You will walk away from this talk with: 1. Knowledge of when a timeout is optimal & how important this optimality is! 2. An explanation of the algorithms necessary to calculate optimal timeouts! 3. An overview of a new open source Ruby library to calculate optimal timeouts using an open source CAS!

By the end: you will be equipped to optimize your timeouts, using your favorite language, Ruby.
