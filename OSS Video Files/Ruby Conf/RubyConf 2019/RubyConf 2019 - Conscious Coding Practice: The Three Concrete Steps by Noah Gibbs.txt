	RubyConf 2019 - Conscious Coding Practice: The Three Concrete Steps by Noah Gibbs

You feel guilty about not knowing enough "Computer Science." But that isn't what you're still missing in your coding. If you could just pick up any problem and solve it, you wouldn't care if you used a formal-sounding algorithm to do it.

There's a way to get that "fingertip feel" for coding. And it comes from mindful, conscious practice.

Sounds abstract, doesn't it? Instead, it's very simple, specific and concrete. We'll go over the basic steps, the pitfalls, and how to do it. It works whether you're a beginner or an expert. You'll be able to create coding studies for yourself, not just find other people's exercises that are already worked out for you.

This talk is in Ruby. But the technique works with any language, library or paradigm. It's also good for pairing.
