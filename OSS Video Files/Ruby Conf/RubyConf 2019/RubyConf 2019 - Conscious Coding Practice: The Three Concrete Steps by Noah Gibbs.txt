	RubyConf 2019 - Conscious Coding Practice: The Three Concrete Steps by Noah Gibbs

You feel guilty about not knowing enough "Computer Science." But that isn't what you're still missing in your coding. If you could just pick up any problem and solve it, you wouldn't care if you used a formal-sounding algorithm to do it.

There's a way to get that "fingertip feel" for coding. And it comes from mindful, conscious practice.

Sounds abstract, doesn't it? Instead, it's very simple, specific and concrete. We'll go over the basic steps, the pitfalls, and how to do it. It works whether you're a beginner or an expert. You'll be able to create coding studies for yourself, not just find other people's exercises that are already worked out for you.

This talk is in Ruby. But the technique works with any language, library or paradigm. It's also good for pairing.

00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:16,970
all right conscious coding practice the

00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:18,980
three concrete steps for any of you that

00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:25,580
think I'm Abdi Grimm I have bad news

00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:26,899
he's in the next room over all right so

00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,550
Who am I some of you know I wrote the

00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:30,169
book rebuilding rails any of you that

00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:32,300
didn't know that congratulations now you

00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:34,280
do and I write a bunch of blog posts on

00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,660
Ruby performance I've been doing this

00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,030
for a very long time and teaching people

00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,559
about this for a very long time but by

00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,360
and large if you have to care about how

00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:43,519
awesome I am then I didn't do this

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,280
White's right so with luck this should

00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:48,649
be mostly self-explanatory and the bits

00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,550
that aren't self-explanatory are the

00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:52,010
kind of thing where you'll eventually

00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:56,019
try it both ways and decide I hope that

00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:58,489
I'm more or less right I also have

00:00:56,019 --> 00:01:00,170
stickers of the lovely bear there so

00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:02,059
feel free to you know come up after the

00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,530
talk or grab me at any point during Ruby

00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:06,050
conf and ask for a bear sticker I got a

00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,990
bunch Oh

00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:10,220
also I love questions I love questions

00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,540
and there's a pretty good chance any

00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,910
question you've got somebody else has

00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,890
feel free to yell out I also talk really

00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:16,850
fast I'm sure this is a shock to those

00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:19,250
of you who've been listening for the

00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:21,920
last 30 seconds and so if I'm talking

00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:23,600
too fast that it would be wonderful if

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,070
you said slow down because you're not

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,930
the only one thinking it they may be

00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:30,950
just you know too polite to say it but I

00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:32,180
appreciate it if you would alright so I

00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,410
talked about me and that's never the

00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:37,250
interesting part of the talk let's talk

00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:38,870
about you for a sec now instead of

00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,730
coding which is what I'm saying there

00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,230
you could say software development or

00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:43,700
software engineering or whatever it is

00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:45,770
you personally call that thing you do

00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,000
where you write code but now that thing

00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,560
you do where you write code I don't mean

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,790
algorithm design I don't mean sitting

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,020
and reading books about it I mean the

00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:54,350
bit where you actually get the code

00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:56,480
written down and call it whatever you

00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:58,130
like but I assume you want to get better

00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,110
at that and I assume that's why you are

00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:02,300
sitting in this room today I hope that's

00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,810
true if for some reason you're here by

00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:07,220
accident

00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:09,289
well I hope you decide to do that so I'm

00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,610
gonna I'm gonna hit this first because a

00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:13,879
lot of the time you can't cover this

00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:16,310
topic without hitting this first so many

00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:17,659
engineers have as their personal Bugaboo

00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,310
their personal reason that they can't be

00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:20,749
all that good at this the computer

00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,489
science stuff they mean different things

00:02:20,749 --> 00:02:23,530
by it but that's the phrase so many

00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:25,210
people use

00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,380
and that's not just the bootcamp people

00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,730
and the young people it turns out the

00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,320
people who've been you know graduated

00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:33,210
from college or have been graduated from

00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,210
college a long time use the same phrase

00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:39,520
so usually you mean something kind of

00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:41,110
academic by that and you've met a lot of

00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,960
good programmers who are not good

00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:46,240
academics so at least for them that

00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,590
wasn't the obstacle so I'd like you for

00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,600
today you know as a suspending disbelief

00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,770
thing just for a little while to assume

00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,600
that if they can do that you probably

00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:58,150
can do that if it didn't stop them it

00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:59,260
probably won't stop you either yeah if

00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,670
you were afraid of the computer science

00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,810
stuff keep in mind there's a lot of

00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,190
there's a lot of other stuff besides

00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,170
that and we'll talk we'll talk more

00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:06,730
about that in a moment because coding is

00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:08,770
practical you get better at it by doing

00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:10,660
it you don't really get better at it by

00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,850
reading it turns out you can know all of

00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,320
the algorithms you can know all of the

00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,000
language idioms you can have read in

00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,890
great detail about all this stuff and

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,750
you can still sit down at your IDE and

00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:24,280
stare for an hour at this for loop that

00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:26,020
just isn't happening and if it can fail

00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:32,290
in that direction it can also succeed in

00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:33,850
that direction related to that when I

00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,280
say you get better at it by practicing

00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:38,860
good practice is better than bad

00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,090
practice there's a there's a whole set

00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,320
of books and things about you know the

00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,209
kind of practice you should do for all

00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,650
sorts of skills I don't know many books

00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:45,670
about that for programming exactly but

00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,560
they're a bunch of them for in general

00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,330
the good practice is important and how

00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,530
you practice is important and that's

00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,000
part of the reason that you get into

00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,440
these fights at work where everybody

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,910
wants to use their favorite library or

00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,080
their favorite way of doing it because

00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,430
there's the code you write for the

00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,890
business and the business would like you

00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,810
to write boring profitable code fair

00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,340
reasonable and you would like to write

00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,709
the code that causes you to get better

00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:08,470
at programming the fastest part of this

00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:10,120
this fight and part of the part of the

00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,340
wonderful and heartwarming thing about

00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,480
it is that it happens because the people

00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,370
here just like all of the other

00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:21,459
programmers that you work with really

00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:23,440
hunger to get better and of course

00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,880
business code only gets you so far in

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,100
that way

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,720
now I say it's not the academics it's

00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,030
not that it's not that well what is it

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,340
if there's all the it's not that you'd

00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,470
like to be able to approach a problem

00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,090
pick up the problem make progress on the

00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,370
problem and get a solution written to it

00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:41,260
what you want isn't so much knowing what

00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,750
the algorithm is what you want is to be

00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,040
able to approach a new thing structure

00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,410
it in your head and write it you want

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,600
that to feel straightforward as you do

00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:51,550
it and again the way you the way you get

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,170
to that point is practice is mindful

00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,850
practice careful practice repeated

00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:58,840
practice a lot of practice but the way

00:04:54,850 --> 00:05:01,180
you get there is practice now some of

00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,530
you may be thinking ah he's here to

00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,980
point me at one of the code to exercise

00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:08,740
sites um coding exercises as they mostly

00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:10,420
exist today are fine like they're not

00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,210
bad I'm not going to tell you not to do

00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:15,850
that but there are a few specific things

00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:17,350
they do poorly one is that you need

00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,910
somebody experienced to write them

00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,560
usually someone more experienced than

00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:22,180
you to write them and you need someone

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,830
who's a good teacher to write them and

00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,270
you need to be reasonably certain you've

00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,610
got a good teacher to write them I mean

00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:29,620
like sandy Matz his book 99 bottles of

00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,730
object-oriented programming many of you

00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,730
have read it many others of you have

00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:35,620
heard of it is amazing but it's partly

00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:37,090
amazing because an extremely experienced

00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,740
developer who was also an extremely

00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:40,300
experienced teacher wrote a book and put

00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,280
a lot of time into it

00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:47,410
the vast majority of coding exercises

00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:49,300
are not that book generally the

00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,740
exercises don't exercise much of your

00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,470
judgment you know aren't aren't to have

00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:56,140
you choose what to build and that's the

00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:58,480
vast majority of our job and they don't

00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,740
really touch that it's hard to learn

00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,420
things you don't already know from

00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,190
standard coding exercises and you have

00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,630
to find new ones constantly because

00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:07,870
repeating the same one only gives you so

00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:11,140
much so when I say coding exercises are

00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:12,910
ok that's what I mean

00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:16,900
in the difference between ok I'm really

00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:18,580
good so it turns out that there's a

00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,230
different discipline that has most of

00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,570
the same teaching to problems that we do

00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:27,250
that has a really standard exercise that

00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:29,560
we can just steal completely so I'll

00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,000
tell you how to do this and we'll go

00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,450
over examples and guidelines and all

00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,890
that so the way you do it you pick three

00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,360
things you pick a tool you pick a task

00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:38,350
you pick a purpose and again we'll talk

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,640
about that

00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:41,170
you can do it for yourself you can do it

00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,120
pairing you don't need a teacher to

00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,590
administer this to you as an exercise

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,060
you don't need someone to carefully

00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,920
evaluate where you're at it's a thing

00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,660
you can do for yourself you can also

00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,830
pair but you know then the two of you

00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:54,010
are evaluating what you want to do

00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:55,530
together and it's useful from about the

00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:58,540
time you can put a few loops together

00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:59,710
let's say at least through 20 years of

00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,540
professional practice because that's

00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,520
where I'm at but I have met people who

00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,560
have even more experience than me that

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:10,450
use almost exactly this technique so I'm

00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:12,280
pretty sure it lasts beyond that and so

00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:13,810
in simple steps what you do is you you

00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,090
choose you tool task and purpose you

00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:17,620
write them down you choose your time box

00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:18,700
for the specific exercise how long

00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,160
you're gonna work on it you write it

00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,510
down you do it till you're done or time

00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,880
runs out and then you you know look back

00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:26,290
on it several of these are tricky I'm

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,700
not expecting that at the end of this

00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:31,870
slide you'll just all be able to do it

00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:34,210
but that's and for folks taking

00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:36,880
photographs or no it's it's awesome yay

00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:40,320
there is gonna be a slide link and so

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,850
don't worry about just not seeing stuff

00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:48,160
all right

00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:49,930
definitions uh so tools by and large you

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,550
know of tool tasks and purpose tool is

00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:53,290
the easy one you probably have a go to

00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:54,760
like language and library that you tend

00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:56,200
to pick up for new projects and I'm

00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,700
certainly not gonna try and talk you out

00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,990
of that that's a good thing when you're

00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,580
using a new tool you probably want to

00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,680
familiar a task and purpose when you're

00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:05,050
choosing a new task and purpose you

00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,430
probably want a familiar tool but you

00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,840
know how to pick tools like it's not

00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,920
hard to pick tools you do something

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,600
you've already done before in a new

00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,190
language great that's a way to learn a

00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,270
new language you do something else you

00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,350
probably want to pick a language you

00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,540
already know well and you probably

00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:20,440
already have preferences great tools are

00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:22,210
the easy bit the task is what you built

00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,620
this is what a normal coding exercise

00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,670
provides you know the coding challenge

00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,170
of the week sort of things where they

00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,640
give you some some algorithm that is a

00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:29,920
what you built that is what they are

00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,010
supplying to you and we'll talk about

00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,390
some ways you can choose a task for this

00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:36,550
but the purpose which is probably less

00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,960
familiar is why you're doing the

00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:40,030
exercise it's what you hope to learn

00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,740
it's the point of the exercise and it

00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:44,770
turns out even if you already know your

00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:46,900
tool and your task your purpose should

00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:50,800
affect what you build at how you build

00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:51,790
it and again we'll talk about how to

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,200
choose that but

00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,910
the purpose just keep in mind in the

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,450
back of your head that's that's what

00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:59,620
gives all the rest of it its meaning and

00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:01,180
yeah we talked about how choosing your

00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,010
tool is easy and again you either choose

00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:05,110
your tool specifically to get familiar

00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:08,800
with the new one or or you use a common

00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:09,850
one two ways to choose a task we'll

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,170
start with the easy way and then we'll

00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:14,530
get to the interesting way that works

00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:15,640
really well here's the easy way pick

00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:18,190
something simple or pick something

00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,930
you've done before I I don't literally

00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:22,780
recommend Fibonacci even though that's

00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:23,950
what I've got on on the slide there but

00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,240
you know if you write a little music

00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,770
organizer that reads through your files

00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,090
reads tags out of the file names and

00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,680
organizes them into playlists or

00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,310
something there are a lot of small tasks

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,260
that are good

00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:33,850
I like small tasks like the music file

00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,740
one more than I like small tasks like

00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:37,180
the math algorithm because algorithms

00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,010
and coding challenge of the week because

00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,600
it's so hard to get excited about the

00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,950
coding challenge of the week I mean I've

00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,300
got a math degree and it's hard for me

00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:45,780
to get excited I assume it's not any

00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:48,100
better for the other folks in this room

00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,870
but it's fine you know you can you can

00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,200
pick a task you don't care about it's

00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,060
okay

00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:57,340
so let's talk about the fun way to

00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:59,890
choose a task one thing I love about the

00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:02,260
world is it is a giant mountain of

00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:04,120
ludicrous complexity literally anywhere

00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:07,030
in this world that you'll arrest your

00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,860
eyes you could describe that in as much

00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:12,340
detail as you wanted and you would die

00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:13,870
before you finished literally everything

00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:16,450
in this world is a fountain of limitless

00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:17,650
complexity so if what you're looking for

00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:20,110
is complexity there's there's no

00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:22,930
shortage of it is what I'm saying uh and

00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:25,330
so finding a thing in the world and

00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:27,100
coding it you do have to abstract it you

00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:28,690
can't fully code everything about it

00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,280
which is true of everything else you've

00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,600
ever coded in your life as well it turns

00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:36,100
out and everything you ever could

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,810
conceivably code but simplifying giant

00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:40,840
complex systems into a smaller set of

00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:41,950
rules is what you do like if you're if

00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,080
you're a professional coder it's what

00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:46,570
you do sort of all day every day you're

00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,950
already good at that so in a minute when

00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,360
we get to the example we will get to

00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:52,630
that as an example because I think

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:56,350
that's the interesting way to do it and

00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:57,490
then how to choose your purpose well you

00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:59,680
may already know what you want to learn

00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,000
and if so fabulous don't let me talk you

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,769
out of doing the thing you already

00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,300
wanted to

00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:05,680
but just in case you don't already know

00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,389
what you want to do or if your goal is

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,889
simpler like I want to get better at

00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:10,660
programming which is fine which is a

00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:12,430
great goal let's talk about some

00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:16,690
purposes that will help you out with

00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:18,790
that here's one what what superpower do

00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:21,190
you wish you had who's somebody that you

00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:23,470
wish you could do what they did right

00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:24,940
that they do or you know what something

00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:28,120
like object-oriented design or an

00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:29,800
ability you wish you were better at you

00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,730
can pick the rest of it based on what

00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:35,170
you want to get good at you know if you

00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,790
if you are impressed by the people at

00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:38,290
work who can design no sequel

00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,029
architectures it turns out that you can

00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:41,649
pick as your purpose hey I want to get

00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:45,699
better at using Reddit

00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:49,089
hey sorry Redis different yes do using

00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:50,649
Reddit would be a different exercise but

00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:52,480
you can you know you can pick something

00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:55,060
that somebody else can do and it's not a

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,070
bad way to get better I mean I'm I tend

00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:58,360
in the hero worship direction myself you

00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,889
know a lot of how I got better was to

00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,079
look at people and go oh my god how do

00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:03,459
they do that and so if there's if

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,290
there's a thing you can do that's that's

00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:06,430
an unlimited source of inspiration where

00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:09,220
you say they did that and I don't think

00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:11,019
I can great that's a purpose you can

00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,839
write that down somewhere you can you

00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:15,760
know do exercise is to get good at it so

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,740
that's great another way that you can

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,420
choose a purpose if you know if that one

00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:22,660
doesn't instantly appeal to you is what

00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:24,699
decision scares you in your hobby

00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,810
projects or your professional projects

00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:27,160
or anything you're doing there's

00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,870
probably something where you're looking

00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,490
at it and going maybe I'll use that

00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,290
library maybe I'm wrong maybe I'll use

00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:34,959
that structure maybe I won't maybe I'll

00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:36,370
you know use this method and it bothers

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,560
you and you kind of avoid it because

00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,819
it's you might not think of it as

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,760
scaring on you but it's not a thing you

00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:43,870
want to look at and one of the beautiful

00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,220
things you can do to break out of that

00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,870
deadlock is to build a little prototype

00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,519
you don't have to build a prototype that

00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,480
fully solves the problem one of the

00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:50,949
things you're going to hear me keep

00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,720
coming back to is you don't have to do a

00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:54,130
thing that fully solves your problem you

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,959
can do work in that direction and get

00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:58,300
better and smarter and then keep doing

00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:00,339
that you can keep grinding in a

00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,709
particular direction to get better but

00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:04,600
if you curious about is this API method

00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:06,130
gonna work well build one out that's

00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,440
sort of like it but not in the middle of

00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,790
your giant complicated project and then

00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,709
play with that for a while and see what

00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,569
you think you are now better at that and

00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:15,160
maybe you'll do another trial too you

00:13:13,569 --> 00:13:19,779
know to figure out more about it or

00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:21,940
maybe you've solved your problem and a

00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:26,170
third technique a third way to choose a

00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:31,930
purpose what's the weirdest thing that

00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:33,519
might possibly work if you try to be

00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:35,860
like somebody you'll get better in a way

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,300
that that somebody already is if you try

00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,100
to solve a problem you'll get better in

00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:41,259
a way that people are already trying to

00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,759
get if you pick something random and do

00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:46,360
it you may learn something that nobody

00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:48,100
already knows there are many fine best

00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,470
practices there are many things people

00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,509
tell you to do and not only can you

00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:54,160
break those best practices a lot for

00:13:52,509 --> 00:13:56,290
preference and find out what happens if

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,029
you screw it up which is great I highly

00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:00,129
recommend it you can also take one of

00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:01,750
those best practices and do it until it

00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:04,779
breaks every other best practice

00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,339
completely and both of those will teach

00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:07,509
you things people don't already know one

00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:10,149
of the things that makes me happiest

00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:12,449
about Ruby on Rails is that the ways

00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:15,310
that it uses dry don't repeat yourself

00:14:12,449 --> 00:14:17,379
looked insane at the time that he did it

00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:19,959
looked ludicrous at the time that he did

00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:21,279
it like we've already got a class name

00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,509
for it and therefore that determines

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,889
your database table name and we don't

00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:26,610
need any declared methods because we can

00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:29,709
read it out of a database schema like

00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:31,389
that that was taking don't repeat

00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:33,370
yourself to it a completely unreasonable

00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:35,199
extreme you often find something

00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:37,120
valuable if you take a principle and you

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,550
just turn it all the way up past eleven

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,170
and as a side effect it breaks all the

00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:42,790
other things if you do the weirdest

00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:44,920
thing that might possibly work you can

00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:46,779
learn things that nobody knows which

00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,370
either sounds really alluring to you or

00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:49,750
like a stupid idea and that determines

00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:54,730
whether this is your way to choose your

00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:55,990
purpose alright great well I've been

00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,970
I've been hand waving and giving you

00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:59,410
abstract stuff and abstract stuff is

00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:00,279
fine but at some point you get tired of

00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,769
it let's do an example

00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:04,630
I like examples so I said you can look

00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:06,639
at anything in the world so I was out

00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:07,480
with my kids in a park and there were a

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,029
bunch of kids playing on the

00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,529
merry-go-round my kids included and I

00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:12,939
find you always learn something looking

00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:14,559
at the world especially if it's made of

00:15:12,939 --> 00:15:15,970
people and there were you know little

00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:17,290
kids who really wanted to be pushed on

00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:18,730
the merry-go-round but couldn't push as

00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,019
hard as they wanted to and you had you

00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:22,600
know bigger kids who were happy to push

00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:24,009
and you know partly just wanted to push

00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,800
until the little kids were flung off

00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:27,730
violently but one way or another you

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,819
watch them and you see these little

00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,959
systems and you suddenly

00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:31,489
realize that the world is complicated

00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:32,749
because you've just about figured out

00:15:31,489 --> 00:15:34,579
what the rules are and then the kids do

00:15:32,749 --> 00:15:36,979
something else because you know they're

00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:38,329
kids they keep doing new things the real

00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:39,649
world surprises you if you watch it for

00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:42,559
any length of time and then you keep

00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:44,029
watching and surprises you again okay

00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:46,850
you know those are those are fun little

00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:49,100
little systems of behavior so here is

00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:51,949
that as a coding study here is what I

00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,419
mean by the fun way to choose a task and

00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:53,899
I said we should write things down in

00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,100
advance

00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:57,949
so let's write things down in advance

00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,089
tool simple rubyprogram tasks tiny

00:15:57,949 --> 00:16:00,289
little simulation of kids on a

00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:01,910
merry-go-round I wanted to play with

00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:02,209
those systems of behavior and see what

00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,549
they did

00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:06,529
purpose you know playing with that

00:16:04,549 --> 00:16:08,479
behavior edge strength pushing being

00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:11,329
able to hang on to understand it better

00:16:08,479 --> 00:16:13,039
and I get myself about an hour the times

00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:14,689
I'm gonna mention here are very short

00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:16,189
this is partly because I'm an old guy

00:16:14,689 --> 00:16:18,709
that's been coding a long time but it's

00:16:16,189 --> 00:16:19,970
also because if you get wedged in the

00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:21,350
middle of trying to do something for a

00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:22,789
long time you're not learning during

00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:25,759
that time and so you may want a real

00:16:22,789 --> 00:16:28,309
short time box to learn well anyway

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,589
wrote it down so the first thing I did

00:16:28,309 --> 00:16:32,179
was to say okay well what am i

00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:33,589
interested in here I think we'll I think

00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:35,209
we'll pick a bunch of kids I pick kids

00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:37,339
of about the same ages that I saw in the

00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:39,199
park fifteen twelve eleven five four

00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:40,999
three sure that's about right

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,249
and then I mapped a little structure for

00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:45,109
each one how old are they how hard can

00:16:43,249 --> 00:16:46,639
they push how much do they weigh how

00:16:45,109 --> 00:16:48,229
hard are they clinging on and there's

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,609
nothing magic about this there's nothing

00:16:48,229 --> 00:16:50,929
for those of you that know your physics

00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:52,699
you already know this is not a careful

00:16:50,929 --> 00:16:54,379
physical simulation and this is not what

00:16:52,699 --> 00:16:56,389
the standard physics looks like but you

00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:57,559
play with something you know I picked I

00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:58,879
mean the square roots the most

00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:01,909
complicated thing there and that's just

00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:04,759
because it it goes up slower than the

00:17:01,909 --> 00:17:05,899
edge which way it does and you know

00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:08,500
there's a buzzer numbers and you play

00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:10,879
with them and you get different results

00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,439
and then I said okay well you know how

00:17:10,879 --> 00:17:13,519
fast as a merry-go-round going well at

00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:15,019
the beginning it's not going at all

00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:16,549
speed equals zero

00:17:15,019 --> 00:17:18,019
how hard are the kids pushing well let's

00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:19,399
just add up all the pushing how much

00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:20,870
does the whole thing weigh let's just

00:17:19,399 --> 00:17:22,850
add up all the weights you know how fast

00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:24,589
is it going how hard they push divided

00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:25,909
by the weight which again the more

00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:27,289
physics you know the more you understand

00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:28,490
this is seat-of-the-pants this is not

00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:30,350
something where you have to careful they

00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:32,389
research all of it nor should you you're

00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,769
playing you have fun with it you know I

00:17:32,389 --> 00:17:34,940
changed these numbers a little bit and

00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:36,230
you should change your numbers a little

00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,090
bit and it turns out it doesn't matter

00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:40,460
at all for the specific problem but play

00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:42,740
with it anyway because it might for your

00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,960
problem and then I

00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:46,580
you know how far it's going the printing

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,929
out is important doing in little steps

00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,340
and printing out is important because

00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:50,360
you're playing you're finding out what

00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,860
you did right and you're finding out

00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,880
what you did wrong and nobody else is

00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,080
watching you except you

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,120
unless you're pairing and then you know

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,530
you're pairing with them so they're

00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,390
gonna see how well or how badly you do

00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:00,980
there's not a way around it but you're

00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:04,730
playing you're figuring out how it works

00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:06,260
and I said well you know how hard can

00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,550
they hang on well the youngest kid the

00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,140
way I did it is gonna have the hardest

00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:11,290
time hanging on so we'll just see if the

00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:15,250
youngest kid is thrown off and if so by

00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:15,250
and at some point you run out of kids

00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:21,860
and this is this is meant to be not

00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:24,320
everything that I saw right again the

00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:26,600
world has so much complexity I can't do

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,950
everything that I see I can't but I can

00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,090
pick a couple of interesting things I

00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:31,040
can put them together and I can see what

00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:35,090
happens and if I like the result I can

00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:36,080
add more things afterwards and so you

00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,790
know this was one where I was trying to

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,320
bring it to a to a fairly quick halt so

00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:41,030
I went okay that's fun what am i doing

00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,980
oh I know I'll turn it into a little

00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:44,780
song you know I read I read 99 bottles

00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,250
of recently and so everything seemed

00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,600
like a little song it does for a while

00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,550
right and you've been staring at it and

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,440
so now it says you know how many monkeys

00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:53,120
on the merry-go-round and then tells you

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,440
which kid is falling off and then says

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,580
no more monkeys on the merry-go-round

00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,290
which i think is a lot more fun than

00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,270
just running out the variables every

00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:00,410
time through the loop but it's the same

00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:02,150
kind of thing you make a little tweak

00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:03,440
and you play with it I liked that this

00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:05,990
came out as sort of a little song I

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,250
didn't go into it thinking it would that

00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:09,230
was nice

00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,940
and at this point if I was going to

00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:12,110
continue on this then I would pick

00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,670
another thing kids do on the

00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:15,530
merry-go-round and I would add that in

00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:16,940
as well you know I've got I've got the

00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:18,650
pushing I've got the weight I've got the

00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:20,179
age I've got the how hard can they hang

00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:21,350
on and I could add something else really

00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:24,920
easily here I just stick it in the

00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:26,330
structure and play with it and you know

00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,970
since I have limited time on the talk

00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:30,140
that you get you get a shorter example

00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:33,920
instead of an example that would take

00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:36,860
hours to work through but if I had the

00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:38,540
same tools and the same tasks on a

00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,280
different purpose it turns out this code

00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,990
would not come out the same if what I

00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,880
intended to do with it was different but

00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:45,650
I had all the same basic inspirations

00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:49,309
you would get a different result

00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:50,990
for instance if my purpose was to play

00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:52,580
with object-oriented design if instead

00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,110
of reading 99 bottles Boop and wanting

00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,520
to make it a song I'd read principles of

00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,590
object-oriented design and I wanted

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,150
make it a series of objects then instead

00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:01,880
I would start off in a kind of similar

00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:03,650
way but I would instead you know put

00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,450
together a structure and very shortly

00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:06,710
these you know this weight and push and

00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:08,060
cling and these formulas would come out

00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:09,230
into little getters that I would you

00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,520
know play with the business logic there

00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:13,640
and I would probably have played with

00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:15,650
that math a lot more not because the

00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,820
math is better or worse but because when

00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:18,140
I'm trying to learn object-oriented

00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,730
design the first thing I need is

00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,900
interesting business logic and so this

00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:27,260
would have gone a completely different

00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:29,270
direction all right so that's sort of a

00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,740
basic description of how you do a coding

00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,480
study how you do this thing I'm

00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,520
describing let's talk about guidelines

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,900
and even if you don't do exactly what

00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,280
I'm describing here even if you don't

00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,870
get religion about I must do coding

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:42,020
studies Noah Gibbs told me I must do

00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:43,820
coding studies even if you don't decide

00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,350
to do that these guidelines are useful

00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:47,270
for almost any kind of practice you can

00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:48,620
do and because they're guidelines which

00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:50,060
is to say you shouldn't trust me I'm

00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:52,790
giving you what sounds like you know

00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:54,710
best practices you should instead listen

00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:56,510
to it and evaluate I'll tell you what I

00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:58,130
believe happens to go wrong if you don't

00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:01,640
do it and then you get to decide whether

00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:03,140
you want to do it so the first bit

00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,720
choose first and right you choose your

00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:07,340
tool tasks and and purpose and then you

00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:10,220
choose your time box and you write them

00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:12,410
out in words the reason you do that is

00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:14,030
because you're trying to learn you're

00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:15,380
trying to figure something out and if

00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:17,900
you've written down what you plan to

00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:19,580
learn then when you are adding feature

00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,960
after feature you are allowed to you

00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,820
know stop and look back at that thing

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,030
you wrote down and say oh yeah I guess I

00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:27,800
already did that okay am i trying to

00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:30,170
find something new to learn or am I done

00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:32,360
the answer I'm recommending is you're

00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:33,890
done you you can do something else after

00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,540
that there's nothing wrong with that but

00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:37,220
if you know what you're doing you can do

00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:39,070
it and then stop whereas if you don't

00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:41,870
know what you're doing you'll tend to I

00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:43,310
tend to sort of Thresh around and add

00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:44,990
things at random because they seem neat

00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:46,670
but I stopped learning really quickly

00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:49,490
once I finished the thing that I'm doing

00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:51,860
and so I recommend making it clear what

00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:54,470
you're doing to avoid future creep the

00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,790
time box is the same general idea if you

00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:57,410
say I'm gonna do this for two hours

00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:59,440
you're likely to learn really well for

00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:01,520
two hours you have a great natural

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,260
understanding of how far through your

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,460
two hours that you are and the more

00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,140
times you do this the better your

00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,090
understanding gets which means you're

00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:09,460
going to actual

00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:12,700
lean into it and work hard for that two

00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:14,139
hours and after that you're kind of like

00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:17,019
you've kind of finished in some sense

00:22:14,139 --> 00:22:19,360
and and I at least tend to lose focus

00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:21,779
pretty rapidly if I don't have any kind

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,159
of a deadline even a self-imposed one so

00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:25,749
my opinion about why you do this because

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,490
if you break it you tend to get long

00:22:25,749 --> 00:22:28,960
failures where you don't learn very much

00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:30,549
because you're kind of wedged and you

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,629
seem to get long successes which in some

00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,740
ways or even worse where you've already

00:22:31,629 --> 00:22:33,970
learned the thing and you don't really

00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:37,389
know what you're doing that you haven't

00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:39,429
stopped yet if you want to learn and

00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:41,529
play and you know do well I find that a

00:22:39,429 --> 00:22:44,970
fixed time period helps me a lot with

00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:48,070
that I recommend it highly slide three

00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:50,289
throw it away when you finish the

00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:52,809
exercise don't keep it I mean you can

00:22:50,289 --> 00:22:54,610
keep a copy somewhere but don't treat it

00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:55,419
like a finished product and the reason

00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:56,860
you don't want to treat it like a

00:22:55,419 --> 00:22:58,659
finished product is you don't wanna be

00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,919
tempted to document it you don't want to

00:22:58,659 --> 00:23:01,240
be tempted to use absolute best

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,440
practices you don't want it to be

00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,940
tempted to treat this like production

00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,799
code you have the thing you want to

00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:07,149
learn and everything you do that gets

00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:09,340
you to that point where you start

00:23:07,149 --> 00:23:10,419
learning is good if it's sloppy and

00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:11,830
messy and it's made of little pieces

00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:12,809
that don't hang together very well but

00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,409
you still learn the thing

00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:15,940
congratulations you succeeded

00:23:14,409 --> 00:23:19,090
brilliantly and you didn't take a lot of

00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:21,850
extra time to do it well done

00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:23,889
and so the reason you don't keep it is

00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:25,119
because if you know you're gonna keep it

00:23:23,889 --> 00:23:26,649
in the back of your head you're gonna

00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:28,240
make more conservative choices about it

00:23:26,649 --> 00:23:29,830
you're gonna treat it like a real piece

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,240
of code you're not gonna do kind of

00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:33,610
stupid over-the-top stuff that's a bad

00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,240
idea because you're going to support

00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:36,460
that later

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,320
don't tempt yourself to support it later

00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:40,330
know that when you're done you're gonna

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:45,190
throw it away and at every point as

00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:47,200
you're building it it'll be better one

00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,730
idea at once when I say purpose I mean

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,639
you could imagine writing out five or

00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:53,350
six different things as a purpose don't

00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:55,509
you want a priority and the reason you

00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,860
want a priority is because when you say

00:23:55,509 --> 00:23:58,869
oh do I want to build this next thing

00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,529
next you want to have one way to say yes

00:23:58,869 --> 00:24:00,730
or no

00:23:59,529 --> 00:24:02,559
which of these three things do I do

00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:05,139
whichever one is fits best with your

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,879
purpose if your purpose is one idea big

00:24:05,139 --> 00:24:09,639
that can be more than one sentence but

00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:11,230
if it's one idea big then you can tell

00:24:09,639 --> 00:24:12,549
really easily whether what you're

00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:14,139
planning to do is the right thing to

00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:15,759
find out the idea if you know what

00:24:14,139 --> 00:24:17,500
you're doing you can do it successfully

00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:21,539
if you only sort of know what you're

00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,539
doing you tend not to

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,640
built simply on in layers we talked

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,560
about this a couple of times as we go

00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,660
through but basically don't be ashamed

00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:31,790
to build toward exactly what you're

00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:33,410
doing and no more building little bits

00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:35,300
because if you've got this giant

00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:36,620
ambitious thing you want to build you're

00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,150
gonna write a huge amount you're gonna

00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:39,590
have to try and debug that huge amount

00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:44,480
of code and it's gonna take a very long

00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:46,310
time before it works that means not only

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,290
a long startup time for each study you

00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:49,480
burn a lot of time doing every every

00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:51,500
coding study if you do it that way

00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,000
you've got that feeling in the pit of

00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,370
your stomach where you go oh god I'm

00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,200
gonna spend 90 minutes or more trolling

00:24:55,370 --> 00:25:01,970
through this just trying to get it to

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:03,800
work you don't want the dread on

00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:05,420
starting pick the simplest thing you can

00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,980
pick pick the shortest time you can pick

00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,510
pick the simplest approach to this code

00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,820
because you want to spend your time

00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:13,640
feeling like you're playing not only do

00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:15,020
you want to learn the most possible you

00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,040
want to feel like you're doing like

00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,600
you're doing good you want to feel like

00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:20,150
it's a good thing for you to do and like

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,440
you want to do more of it the main way

00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:23,540
you're gonna get the most practice done

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:29,240
is if you want to do the practice try

00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:30,740
not to have practice time feel bad work

00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,390
from life we've talked a little about

00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:36,860
this this guideline you know pick a real

00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:38,810
system in the real world you want to

00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:40,010
grade yourself a little bit hard I don't

00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:41,330
mean that you want to be down on

00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:42,620
yourself I don't mean you want to feel

00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,640
bad about yourself I mean you want

00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:45,440
something where you can tell if you

00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,150
succeeded or not and the real world is a

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,270
giant source of interesting complexity

00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:51,560
where you can tell if you did it right

00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:53,060
working from the real world is like

00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,340
working from somebody else giving you a

00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:57,050
specification you've either done it

00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:59,390
right or you've done it wrong and you

00:25:57,050 --> 00:26:01,700
can tell which and that is a massive

00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:03,380
cheat that is so much better than

00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,240
working from you know something in your

00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:07,160
head that you're allowed to kind of play

00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,540
with and fudge on

00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,920
I don't know MIT maybe you'll hold

00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,870
yourself to it and maybe you won't but I

00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,940
find it is incredibly valuable to do

00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:15,710
that because I know if I'm cheating if I

00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:20,570
can turn my head and look at the thing

00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:22,700
that I'm working from and the last ones

00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:24,650
break rules I don't just mean these

00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,300
rules though yes these rules I don't

00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:30,380
just mean best practices though yes best

00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:31,670
practices break rules the most important

00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:34,460
thing you're doing is having fun and

00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:36,950
playing and trying to keep yourself game

00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:38,450
skill rapidly any rule that gets in the

00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:42,680
way of that is a bad rule at least at

00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:45,170
that time blow right past it by the way

00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:47,150
when I say unbreak rules I mean for any

00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:49,670
of these things again feel free to take

00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:51,070
that one rule and just do that you know

00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:53,780
if you want to play with time boxing

00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:55,760
great like do shorter and shorter time

00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:58,190
boxes see how much code you can write in

00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:01,310
30 minutes 20 minutes ten minutes five

00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:02,900
minutes and I'm not saying that you wind

00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:04,640
up with something massively awesome I'm

00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:06,440
saying that kind of like rails was dry

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,700
taken to a ridiculous extreme you may

00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:14,270
find something really interesting

00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:15,800
happening there all right so to talk

00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:16,970
again about the fun way to choose a task

00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,410
and the reason I keep coming back to

00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:20,030
this is it's probably the weirdest thing

00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:21,170
I'm recommending in this talk but it's

00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:23,210
also the most valuable thing I'm

00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:25,700
recommending in this talk so I want to

00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:27,950
make sure I've made a go at explaining

00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:29,420
it there's no shortage of complicated

00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:31,640
systems in the world they're literally

00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:33,200
everywhere which means that the question

00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,660
you're answering in choosing one is what

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,850
do I find interesting since there is a

00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:39,410
ludicrous profusion of them the question

00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:41,900
is which ones do you find interesting

00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:44,210
enough to pick up and play with

00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:46,490
I like systems related to people I like

00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:47,930
you know stores walking patterns you

00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:49,520
know group dynamics of who's talking to

00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:51,200
who and what they're saying you know of

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,390
how people think and part of the reason

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,760
I like that is because humans are really

00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:59,210
good at telling whether something acts

00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:00,830
like a human really good at it it's the

00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,060
same reason that drawing humans is hard

00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:03,590
because you don't have to be an amazing

00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:06,020
artist to look at a picture and say that

00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:08,960
doesn't look like a person in the same

00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:10,550
way the Turing test is so ridiculously

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,050
hard no one has ever passed it because

00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:13,580
humans are really good at telling

00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:15,830
whether something looks and acts like a

00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:17,390
human and so if you choose human systems

00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:19,370
or at least systems with humans in them

00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:22,120
you're grading yourself hard because

00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:25,010
it's easy to tell if you did it wrong

00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,450
and you know code is about people there

00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:28,340
are all sorts of other good reasons to

00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:30,950
you know to deal with systems of humans

00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:32,360
but if if you don't don't otherwise find

00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:33,500
yourself attracted to humans keep in

00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,090
mind they are one of your hardest

00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:38,900
grading criteria even if you don't like

00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:40,250
them the rest of the time you can also

00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,390
pick natural systems that are fun to

00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,800
look at you know there's a lot of things

00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:44,390
with marbles or plumbing pipes or

00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,250
planets that actually make interesting

00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:47,310
coding systems building the structure of

00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,630
those things or

00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:51,570
if you're really ambitious you know

00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:52,890
having them in motion one glorious thing

00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:54,330
out there in the world is that there are

00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:55,950
all those computer rendered movies you

00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:57,450
know Pixar movies things like that and

00:28:55,950 --> 00:29:00,630
an awful lot of computer rendering and

00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:02,190
other movies the vast majority of that

00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:03,900
is built with code if you look at a

00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:05,040
waving field of grass in a movie you

00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,480
know in a rendered movie there's a

00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,760
pretty darn good chance somebody wrote

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,650
that field of grass and that is almost

00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,090
exactly what I'm recommending you do a

00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:13,800
field of grass is a genuinely

00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:15,330
interesting thing if you can play with

00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,680
it and again you're surrounded by

00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:18,420
everything it's not just a field of

00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:21,000
grass it's not just the things in movies

00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:22,800
but building these things is really

00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
interesting and building them by

00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,950
figuring out what you find interesting

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,020
about them is at least to me really

00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:31,230
gratifying try it many of you will

00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:32,910
probably find the same it's fun you can

00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:34,530
also pick a part of the natural world

00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:35,640
that reflects what you want to learn you

00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:37,410
know if you want to if you want to learn

00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,790
recursion trees by the way when I say

00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:40,530
trees I don't mean the the sterile

00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:42,180
uniform data structure that we all spend

00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:43,920
our time playing with I mean if you go

00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,240
out and you look at an actual tree one

00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,070
of the things you find out is it's not

00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,150
in fact the same at every scale most of

00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:49,890
what makes a tree data structure

00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:52,020
uninteresting is in fact with a real

00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:53,280
literal tree really interesting and it's

00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,480
the same kind of thing if you go out and

00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,370
look at nature you'll be surprised by

00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,930
nature if you look at somebody else's

00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:59,190
carefully trimmed down representation

00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:01,320
they intentionally took out all the

00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:05,070
interesting parts great but that's not

00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:06,420
how you should practice and if you want

00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,950
to play with like modularity or

00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:09,060
encapsulation there you want to look at

00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:10,500
human things like buildings and

00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,240
structures because modularity and

00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,980
encapsulation it turns out to not how

00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,300
very much of that in the real world it

00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:18,300
turns out the real world is messy and

00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:20,130
intertwined and intermixed so for things

00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,270
where you want a really clean separation

00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:23,130
you probably have to look at human

00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:27,450
systems one way or another because

00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:28,710
Nature doesn't do much of that cool so

00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:31,370
I'll talk a little bit about pairing I

00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:33,300
keep saying you can do this pairing and

00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:36,480
mostly will cover it very quickly

00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:38,220
because mostly pairing and good studies

00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,840
just come together like peanut butter

00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:41,580
and chocolate I need to give you almost

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,960
no additional guidelines beyond how you

00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,550
do a coding study and how you pair

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:49,530
because mostly you just do both and it

00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:51,240
works but to have set it pair on

00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:53,550
defining the task and the purpose not

00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,870
just writing the code if you work it all

00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,130
out in advance and you figure out the

00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:57,810
systems and the two of you sit down to

00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:59,670
write it that doesn't work nearly as

00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:00,630
well as if the other person can surprise

00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:02,550
you with interest

00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:05,940
guidelines - for the same reason that

00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:07,440
you should work from nature again start

00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:09,360
flat-footed don't bring in a fully

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,040
developed idea the interesting part is

00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,570
figuring out what the aspects are that

00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,410
you're gonna play with and not only can

00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:15,150
they help you figure out what's

00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:16,620
interesting they can also help keep you

00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:17,640
honest about whether the two of you have

00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:20,400
just built it or built something

00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:22,650
different from that brainstorm together

00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,420
about the rules about the about the

00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:26,220
ideas one person on the keyboard it

00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:28,800
wants same as the same as a standard

00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:30,570
repairing do something small and then

00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,040
swap roles that could be one aspect of

00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:33,780
the thing you're doing that could be you

00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,250
know sort of one piece it could also be

00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:37,140
do the whole study and then swap in and

00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:38,730
do the whole study again one of the joys

00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:40,680
of this is that you don't always pick

00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,210
the same things about it if you if you

00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,860
decide to build Ivy it turns out that

00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:45,270
there's you know 50 things you know in a

00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,950
standard strand of Ivy that you could do

00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:48,240
in an interesting way if you pick five

00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:49,890
and they pick you know two of the same

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,240
things and three different ones what you

00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:53,690
have is a whole new coding study that's

00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:56,820
interesting to do together

00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:58,380
and so yeah you can take turns doing one

00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:02,100
aspect or another or take turns doing

00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:04,140
the whole coding study and working from

00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,610
nature absolutely applies for for

00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,050
pairing as well I mean you could both

00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:11,730
take your laptops out to the park it's

00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:13,260
not a bad thing to do so hey I said in a

00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:17,220
little throwaway line back there I tell

00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:19,170
you where I stole this exercise artists

00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:22,290
have the same educational challenges we

00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:24,150
do artists turn out to have most of the

00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:26,340
same obstacles to teaching what they do

00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:28,560
that we do they have a small number of

00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:30,390
really interesting abstract principles

00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:32,310
which you can only learn by doing a

00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:34,320
concrete thing with one of the Ludacris

00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:36,630
profusion of tools that they actually

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,950
spend their time teaching and it's just

00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:39,330
in our case the tools are things like

00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:40,940
Java and Ruby and in their case the

00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:43,620
tools are things like paint and charcoal

00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:45,390
and in our case you know the design

00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,860
principles are things like solid

00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:48,000
principles of oo design and in their

00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:51,000
case the principles are things like

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,730
composition and shading and value but

00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,020
they call this a life study and when you

00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:56,810
when you hear about something like a

00:32:55,020 --> 00:33:00,300
still life where they paint fruit or a

00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:02,940
figure well many things including fruit

00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:04,410
most famously fruit or when they do you

00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:06,180
know figure drawing which again is using

00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:07,920
humans as your as your grading point

00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:11,400
which is really difficult for them and

00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:12,990
for us both it would be fairer

00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,590
I mean it's fairer to say I stole this

00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:15,570
and then that

00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:17,250
made it up because really what I'm doing

00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:20,460
is getting just enough guidelines that

00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:23,610
you can do the same thing with code but

00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:24,810
the thing to keep in mind is that we've

00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:25,380
been doing this programming thing for a

00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:27,240
little while

00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:30,930
artists have been teaching art for about

00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:32,520
40,000 years and they've got some

00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:34,860
interesting educational techniques that

00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:37,110
we should be stealing it turns out there

00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:39,750
they've got a significant head start and

00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:46,140
we should respect that by which I mean

00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:47,490
steal that great commerce warning I send

00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,780
email classes about this and I'm

00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:50,820
attempting to sell a book you don't have

00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:53,820
to do anything involving giving me money

00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:55,620
if you don't want to here but the

00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:57,210
software technique calm that's a book

00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,980
I'm selling on this topic code folio

00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:01,470
that's my blog and I have a bunch of a

00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:02,880
bunch of blog posts on that some of

00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:05,370
which are quite good if you want a more

00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,110
in-depth coding study the I think still

00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:08,400
the most recent post on there isn't one

00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:10,170
I mentioned with the idea on the window

00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:13,550
which i think is pretty well written up

00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:16,260
but in case more examples help you there

00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:18,870
I'm also getting out teddy bear stickers

00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:20,460
of the chalkboard teddy bear most of you

00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:25,500
I assume can see the physical teddy bear

00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:29,340
but all right questions nobody asked any

00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:34,080
questions during this thank you thanks

00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:37,830
not curious on the defining of practice

00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:40,050
activities any thoughts on the

00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:43,170
identification of specific techniques as

00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:45,600
things to learn so perhaps in the in

00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:47,160
life example there's to be recreating a

00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,440
simulation or simulating some sort of

00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:53,250
process how might want to apply that's

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:57,800
too concrete to press more theoretical

00:34:53,250 --> 00:35:00,060
techniques and mastering those so

00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:03,020
bearing in mind that some of that's hard

00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:05,520
to answer in this amount of time

00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:08,190
recursive structures of various kinds

00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,480
think seashells think plants think you

00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:11,160
know think things that look like they've

00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,480
got a very regular structure to them can

00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,340
be great for techniques like recursion

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,810
object-oriented design is usually about

00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:17,760
behaviorist and so fix something with a

00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:19,410
complicated behavior again I like things

00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,580
like kids on a playground I like systems

00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:22,470
of humans where you can watch

00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:23,490
interesting behaviorist kids on a

00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:25,830
playground have the advantage that

00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:26,820
they're not hard to find but look for

00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,150
something where you've got several

00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,769
different

00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:30,660
behavior is going on you could also pick

00:35:28,769 --> 00:35:32,039
something like you know objects dropped

00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,390
in a wall in the water you could you

00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:34,980
could flick you know leave us and leave

00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:36,390
us on sticks into the water but you want

00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,519
something where several behaviors come

00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:41,279
together which doesn't stop you from

00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:42,809
using you know a fixed thing again when

00:35:41,279 --> 00:35:44,099
I talk about IV you know one of the

00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:45,569
things I did was it's got a

00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:46,920
back-and-forth regular structure like

00:35:45,569 --> 00:35:48,299
that another thing is that the leaves

00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,710
are large on the bottom and get smaller

00:35:48,299 --> 00:35:51,089
toward the top another thing is that it

00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:53,039
actually does do a kind of like that and

00:35:51,089 --> 00:35:56,009
tends toward vertical and those are all

00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:57,569
behaviors the fact that it's already a

00:35:56,009 --> 00:35:59,190
done deal by the time you look at it

00:35:57,569 --> 00:36:00,359
doesn't mean that as your code figures

00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,980
it out your code doesn't have a

00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:04,920
chronological progression of combining

00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:06,390
those behaviors and so for something

00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,589
like object-oriented design what you

00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:09,269
want are behaviors that are kind of

00:36:07,589 --> 00:36:11,130
partly at odds and partly reinforcing

00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:12,539
each other and for that client find

00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,549
something you know complicated find

00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:17,279
something with several different

00:36:13,549 --> 00:36:20,009
colliding behaviors yeah I mean I can't

00:36:17,279 --> 00:36:21,119
tell you everything about it but figure

00:36:20,009 --> 00:36:22,380
out what you're doing and there's a

00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,490
pretty good chance that you will be able

00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,720
to look around the room and find

00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:26,910
something that feels a little bit like

00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,920
that or there will be some really

00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:30,049
standard exercise for how to do it and

00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,160
if neither of those two things are true

00:36:30,049 --> 00:36:39,170
it may be harder to learn or take some

00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:46,200
brainstorming I see some I see some and

00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:47,400
there we go hi thank you I was wondering

00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,339
if there was anything else that we

00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:53,789
should be stealing from artists

00:36:49,339 --> 00:36:56,599
pedagogically speaking that would be

00:36:53,789 --> 00:36:58,980
several other talks for for full details

00:36:56,599 --> 00:37:00,390
the main thing I would say because it's

00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:02,549
a difference in mindset as much as

00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:04,799
anything else don't be afraid of doing

00:37:02,549 --> 00:37:06,299
the same thing repeatedly the most

00:37:04,799 --> 00:37:08,249
frustrating thing about artists tools

00:37:06,299 --> 00:37:09,390
for a programmer if you sit and you you

00:37:08,249 --> 00:37:11,789
know start doing it is they want to

00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:14,999
redraw the same thing over and over and

00:37:11,789 --> 00:37:16,230
over and as amazingly wonderful as it is

00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:17,430
that we built a thing where we reuse

00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,599
code and we don't have to keep doing

00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:20,819
that I mean that's the primary trick

00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:22,980
that automation does for us if you never

00:37:20,819 --> 00:37:25,019
do that you never really build up the

00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,609
skill of doing it really well and what

00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:28,200
you automate is always kind of clumsy

00:37:26,609 --> 00:37:30,660
because you haven't done the basic task

00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:32,130
that many times and that mindset that if

00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,779
you do the thing over and over and over

00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:36,960
you get really good at it

00:37:33,779 --> 00:37:38,849
is a trick that is ridiculously valuable

00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,349
so if we were gonna steal one thing from

00:37:38,849 --> 00:37:42,690
artists it would be that the

00:37:40,349 --> 00:37:44,549
is not small amount of that and that's

00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:47,009
one reason that I mentioned the blog

00:37:44,549 --> 00:37:49,410
posts one of them is that you should do

00:37:47,009 --> 00:37:51,089
the same exercise repeatedly and you

00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:52,380
should you know you want something where

00:37:51,089 --> 00:37:54,869
you can repeat the same thing with minor

00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:56,849
variations because just doing the same

00:37:54,869 --> 00:37:58,920
task over and over if you do it right

00:37:56,849 --> 00:38:04,650
will make you really good in a way that

00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:08,190
as programmers we tend to suck at thank

00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:09,509
you sorry I was wondering what's a good

00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:12,269
strategy when it comes to defining

00:38:09,509 --> 00:38:14,279
purpose of like cutting down you know

00:38:12,269 --> 00:38:17,729
what we want to do into like something

00:38:14,279 --> 00:38:19,319
that's kind of discrete and you know can

00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:21,569
be done and accomplished or at least

00:38:19,319 --> 00:38:23,160
like a good stab at it within like our

00:38:21,569 --> 00:38:24,869
time limit because you know what I'm

00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,369
talking about maybe something like doing

00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:29,009
asynchronous programming that's like a

00:38:26,369 --> 00:38:30,569
huge box like can of worms for me but

00:38:29,009 --> 00:38:32,400
how would I go through and say like well

00:38:30,569 --> 00:38:34,259
I want to like get good at this you know

00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,759
but how do I break this up into my

00:38:34,259 --> 00:38:38,420
purpose because that's a big purpose for

00:38:35,759 --> 00:38:41,970
me I want to get the small ones

00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:43,920
unreasonably short time bugs fail pick

00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:45,599
the same time box or an even shorter one

00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,039
again and you will realize what you are

00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,619
doing that keeps you from getting there

00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:51,420
and that will really focus your mind on

00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:53,009
cutting that task down you will suddenly

00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:56,309
discover you have a vast profusion of

00:38:53,009 --> 00:38:57,989
ideas for what you can stop doing but

00:38:56,309 --> 00:39:00,029
you fail a few times and then you'll get

00:38:57,989 --> 00:39:02,549
the feel for for how you pick up a tiny

00:39:00,029 --> 00:39:12,329
task quickly but yeah shorter and

00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:15,299
shorter time boxes hi as someone with a

00:39:12,329 --> 00:39:17,309
Bachelor of Fine Arts I can tell you the

00:39:15,299 --> 00:39:20,940
first thing that they taught me in art

00:39:17,309 --> 00:39:23,640
school was steel relentlessly find

00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:28,259
someone who's art you really love and

00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:30,539
copy it we also took a lot of art

00:39:28,259 --> 00:39:33,599
history classes and that was to learn

00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:37,469
about how all the guys that are hanging

00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:39,719
in museums did it so we could kind of

00:39:37,469 --> 00:39:41,789
practice their techniques as well so

00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:46,499
find someone whose code you really like

00:39:41,789 --> 00:39:48,690
and read it once then try to recreate it

00:39:46,499 --> 00:39:52,730
from memory those kinds of things would

00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:54,930
be really good suggestions and critiques

00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:58,080
absolutely all of those things that's

00:39:54,930 --> 00:40:02,730
all great advice all right any other

00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:04,070
hands any other questions all right I

00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:11,969
don't think I saw any more questions

00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:11,969
[Applause]
