audience so can I please hear it for the

00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:48,649

00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,160
far let me introduce myself so my name

00:01:23,929 --> 00:01:26,240
is Adam cubby I've been a part of the

00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,490
Ruby community and the rails community

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,530
for a decent amount of time not a ton a

00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:33,200
ton of time but a fair amount of time

00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:35,330

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,490
together for you all today so I hope you

00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,610
along with our team a chunk of the

00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:42,950
software so there's a good chance that

00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,209
it will blow up in your face no I'm just

00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,530

00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:47,360
way or the other but if worse comes to

00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:51,979
worse we're just gonna have a good time

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,929
all right sounds good fantastic okay so

00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:56,479
like any good game show you must have an

00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:59,989
introduction with introduction music so

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,940
here we go ready all right so here is

00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:03,500
our game show for syntax here ladies and

00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:05,500
gentlemen thank you so much for arriving

00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,880
thank you thank you thank you so much I

00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,190
would like to introduce our panelists

00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,160
who are randomly placed in order but

00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:14,870
here we are today I had them all submit

00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,459
a little bit about themselves so we're

00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,140
gonna try and figure this out just a

00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:20,090
little bit so our first panel is for

00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,379

community for almost ten years she has

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,129
been a major contributor to the r-spec

00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:29,239
library so probably many of you raise

00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:32,209
your hand if you've been a part of the

00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:34,030

please join us up here on the stage for

00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:18,450
the game show you volunteered for

00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:20,440
[Laughter]

00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:22,150
perfectly acceptable perfectly

00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,350
acceptable all right well very good so

00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,210
these are our first two contestants we

00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,890
hope to do a few more rounds but for

00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:30,430
today I need to explain the game show

00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:34,030
that has been so baked in in M ambiguity

00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:35,980
well today's game show is modeled after

00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:38,410
another very popular American game show

00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:40,030
called Hollywood Squares now in

00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:42,220
Hollywood Squares the basic premise is

00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:43,540
this there is a tic-tac-toe grid which

00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:46,120
where I'll show you here in a moment and

00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:48,280
so nine different spots now on those

00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,530
nine different spots are six panelists

00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,110
that you have right here who are experts

00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:54,640
in the field of Ruby of all things and

00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,360
then we have two contestants now here's

00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,700
how this is going to work

00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,330
contestant number one Phillipe can I

00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,330
hear it from Philippe

00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:05,900
is going to represent X so if you're not

00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,040
familiar with tic-tac-toe there is an X

00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:11,830
in an O so Philippe is going to

00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:17,360
represent X can we hear it for X and

00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:21,230
jounin will represent the Oh perfect

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,000
oh yeah a lot of excitement for the oh

00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:25,010
this is good all right so here's how

00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,780
this works so they are going to start by

00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,950
selecting a grid number on the

00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,410
tic-tac-toe board that they would like

00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:31,880
to win now from that point there's a

00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,599
name that's listed next to it you'll see

00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,460
that here in a moment

00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:37,430
and I will ask the question to our

00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,950
panelists under that name to give the

00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:41,900
answer to the best of their knowledge

00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:42,950
now whether or not they know the answer

00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,380
to this question they're supposed to

00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:47,390
speak confidently and then from that

00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,740
vantage point either Filipa jounin or

00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:50,900
going to decide whether or not they

00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,360
agree or disagree with the answer if

00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,280
they are correct then they get that spot

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,930
the first to make a correct tic-tac-toe

00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:01,730
line wins

00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:04,340
make sense fantastic so here we go once

00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:08,900
we get the grid up no I don't want to

00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:11,870
join your Internet all right here we are

00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:13,940
all right so here is our grid but before

00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:16,580
we get too far let's randomize our slots

00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:18,110
if we could so a slight bit of

00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,700
randomization it's a very complicated

00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:22,520
algorithm brought to you a part by set

00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:25,240
time and set interval all right and here

00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,810
we are so here's the grid for sinkhole

00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,790
all right

00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:31,160
so contestants if you would please

00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:32,990
select your winning strategy whatever it

00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,430
looks like but like the game of Go or

00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:39,140
chess it's gonna need to get complicated

00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:40,730
fast now with a simple and very complex

00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:44,720
system I want you to select who goes

00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:47,750
first a single round of rock paper or

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,160
scissors no face-punching

00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:56,150
right I was getting rock paper scissors

00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:58,570

but it's okay if you're not correct your

00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:51,880
question Davy is artichoke Ruby is an

00:10:49,480 --> 00:11:05,920
upcoming Ruby VM written in what rustic

00:10:51,880 --> 00:11:06,460
language say Oh camel Davey and all no

popping agree or disagree I agree a

00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:29,890
hundred percent

00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:34,270
rust is very rustic and you would be

00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:36,670
correct wonderful for the strong

00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:38,980
position on the board okay Phillipe it

00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:42,970
is now your chance where do you go Marla

Seguin Mardle Marla okay and here we go

00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:48,130
Marla here is your question a variable

00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:52,420
Pro pendant with a dollar sign is what

00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:55,270
type of Ruby variable well I have

00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,980
traveled all over the world and in

00:11:55,270 --> 00:12:01,660
similar fashion I'm gonna go ahead and

00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:02,410
say this is a global variable hmm that

00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:06,160
is correct

00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:07,900
oh and you are correct very good way

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,060
easier than questions about artichokes

00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,440
by the way emcee a little balance if you

00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,150
please little balance

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,480
little balance the next question will be

00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:17,950
much yeah easier okay now your next

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,540
position are you going to take a strong

00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:23,800
stance what are you thinking I'm

00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:27,730
thinking Sandi Metz okay here we are

00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:29,200
and Sandi the question for you is adding

00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:46,170
self before a method declaration does

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:50,290
what go ahead Sandi lie to me correct

00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:53,020

Jonas is presenting himself well right

00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,870
now here you are so you can either go

00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:08,800
for the block or you can just pretend

00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:10,210
he's not going to get it the next I'm

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,670
gonna go for the block I'm gonna give

00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:14,500
the consensus consensus okay so here's

00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:16,870
how consensus works this is up to you

00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,970
the audience what will happen is you

00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:20,320
will all you will all get a question you

00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:22,000
will either throw out an answer now it's

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,040
possible that it's multiple choice it is

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,760
also possible that it is not in either

00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,160
way

00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:30,430
whoever yells the loudest might gain my

00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:32,440
attention and I will declare what the

00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:35,680

here we are and your question is not

00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:19,510
gonna be that one but it might look like

00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:21,310
this instead Twitter was originally

00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:24,670
started in Ruby but later ported to what

00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:29,130
primary language a Java B Scala or C

00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:29,130

you think it's a Java okay B Scala C

00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:53,410
HTML I'm feeling that the consensus is

00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:58,660
really on the line but I think I'll go

00:21:53,410 --> 00:22:01,420
with the consensus is a B Scala agree

00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:05,500

Washington or C Florida I am going to

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:39,430

00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:45,550
it was held in California California do

going to do what's called ignite roll a

00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,600
tour on the website it's called blind

00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:04,880
ignite if you're not familiar here's

00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,710
what an ignite is an ignite talk is a

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,470
set amount of time generally about five

00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:13,429
minutes where there is exactly 20 ish

00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:15,230
slides 20 ish that auto-advance every 15

00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:16,940
seconds now a standard ignite is that

00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:19,130
you will have prepared that but this is

00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:20,600
a rillette meaning that the people that

00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:22,400
are going to come up and going to give

00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,970
presentations will have never seen the

00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,970
slides before

00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:32,710
and I designed all of them so this will

00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:33,970
be quite an experiment adding to that we

00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,110
have a couple more dynamics I won't

00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:37,210
