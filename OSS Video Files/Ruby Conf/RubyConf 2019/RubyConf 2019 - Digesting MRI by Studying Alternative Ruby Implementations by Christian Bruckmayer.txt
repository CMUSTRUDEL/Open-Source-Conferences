	RubyConf 2019 - Digesting MRI by Studying Alternative Ruby Implementations by Christian Bruckmayer

Pointers, managing memory and static typing - writing C code is hard! However, most programming languages, including Matz's Ruby Interpreter (MRI), are implemented in a low level programming language. So you think without knowing these concepts, you can not contribute to Ruby? Wrong! Although MRI is implemented in C, fortunately there are Ruby's in Java, Go and even Ruby itself.


If you ever wanted to learn about Ruby internals without being a C expert, this talk is for you. Join me on my journey of re-implementing hash maps in JRuby, breaking bundler and actually learn to write (some) C code.
