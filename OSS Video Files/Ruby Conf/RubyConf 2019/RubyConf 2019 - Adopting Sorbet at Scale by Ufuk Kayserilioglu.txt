	RubyConf 2019 - Adopting Sorbet at Scale by Ufuk Kayserilioglu

Shopify is a platform used by 800K merchants generating 12B$ revenue per year, serving 80K requests per second. Our core monolith is a 21K file Ruby on Rails application modified by 800 PRs per day. At this scale, we’re always looking out for tools that improve our confidence in the code that we write and maintain.

In this talk, we’ll explain how we adopted Sorbet to leverage static typing in our Ruby codebase. We’ll talk about our journey, the challenges we faced and how we overcame them. Based on this experience, you’ll get a better understanding of how you can benefit from Sorbet, too.
