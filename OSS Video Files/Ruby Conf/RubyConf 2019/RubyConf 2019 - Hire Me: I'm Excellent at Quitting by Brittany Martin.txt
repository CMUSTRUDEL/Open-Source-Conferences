	RubyConf 2019 - Hire Me: I'm Excellent at Quitting by Brittany Martin

You have the right to be happy at work — why would we want it to be any other way? As our careers as Ruby developers flourish, amazing new opportunities will require you to quit a job that you may love or loathe. It's OK to quit. If you want to learn how to gracefully leave your job with a solid game plan, an educated successor, and without burning bridges, this talk is for you.

>> All right. We will get started. Greetings, RubyConf. My name is Brittany Martin, and

00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:21,820
guess what? I'm great at quitting. There are a lot of great talks. I want to thank

00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:26,760
you for joining me today. Also, we're not alone. This is the live stream room. So,

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,860
if we could turn around and give our friends on the live stream a wave. We wish you were

00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:37,470
here. But thank you so much for watching.  Speaking at RubyConf has been one of my personal

00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:42,520
career goals, I just never thought it would be about quitting. I cannot express enough

00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:50,930
thanks. I also want to thank our awesome captioner today. I have been taught that

00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:55,820
if you read something, it must be true. So, it's wonderful to have this captioning to

00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,930
make everything so accessible. Thank you also to our awesome audio‑visual team it's

00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:04,680
a tough job, but it's awesome that this talk is so accessible. 

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:14,460
I'm the lead web developer at the Pittsburgh cultural trust. The goal is to bring arts

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:23,020
to the people of Pittsburgh. It was founded in 1984. I have been working there for about

00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:28,729
four years. Now funny enough, I love my job so much that I feel that I have actually peaked

00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:34,579
in my career. However, when I told my boss that this was the title of my talk, he definitely

00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:45,319
made a face. Pictured here is my best buddy, George brown. It's a short name. I am the

00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:50,060
host of the Ruby on Rails podcast, a weekly conversation about Ruby on Rails, open source,

00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,990
and the programming profession. The best part of running the podcast is getting to

00:01:53,990 --> 00:02:01,469
ask questions from my heros and bringing new voices on to the show. I am always open to

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:05,929
feedback, comments, and of course guests. And I'm serious about that. If you have never

00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:10,619
been on a podcast and you have something interesting to say, please come talk to me after this

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:18,730
talk. Speaking of podcasts, I was recently a guest on the bike shed talking about quitting. And

00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:22,820
Steph is an excellent host. If you enjoy this talk, I highly recommend checking out

00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:33,490
the episode and subscribing. Lastly, I'm the president of the little steel derby girls. People

00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:38,290
get into roller derby for all types of reasons, but most are looking for community. It's

00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:42,110
not whether you get knocked down but whether or not you get back up again. 

00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:47,591
Enough about me. Why am I here talking about quitting? To take on a new opportunity, it's

00:02:47,591 --> 00:02:52,740
very likely that you need to quit something in order to take advantage of that opportunity. There's

00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:58,400
lots of content on hiring, but what about quitting. Now wait a minute, why should I

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,910
be the one giving this talk? I just told you that I love my job and I have been there

00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:08,450
for four years. What's going on there? Over the course of my career, I have had several

00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:16,600
"Hey boss, I'm quitting" talks. One involved tears of saddens. One involved tears of happiness.

00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:25,370
One involved my boss asking if he could come with me. I have evolved into a product manager

00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:32,980
role. I have evolved from a purely technical support role into a full‑time developer. Those

00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:38,230
transitions accounted for a lot of jobs that I have quit in the past ten years. Actually,

00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:43,500
I consider myself a certified quitter. I have quit all kinds of things, and I recommend

00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,520
you spend the time to look at things that you have quit in the past. Because there

00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:54,060
are so many roads that you can take, but one thing is certain. What you have quit in the

00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:01,040
past very much shapes where you are today.  Quitting is not giving up. It's choosing

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,050
to focus your attention on something far more important. Quit something not losing confidence. It's

00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:09,620
realizing that there are more valuable ways that you could be spending your time. And

00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:15,400
quit something not making excuses. It's learning to be more productive, efficient, and effective

00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:21,769
instead. So, much time, so many things to quit. But for the sake of focus, today we

00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:26,340
are going to focus on quitting jobs that fall within your career. 

00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,620
A lot of the advice and stats are coming from individuals who have gotten hired and quit

00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:35,540
jobs in the United States. So, a quick disclaimer here. I believe a lot of the advice I have

00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:40,680
to share today is still applicable to anyone outside of this country, though. My goal

00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,900
in this talk was to avoid any of your co‑workers gleefully telling the terrifying tale of when

00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,270
you quit to pursue your dream. We're here to avoid any and all embarrassment. That

00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:56,670
being said, I do like to be entertained, and I bet you do, too. If you have a good story,

00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:01,320
please tweet it to me. My Twitter handle is on each of my slides for your tweet pleasure. I'm

00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:06,860
all ears and if we have time at the end, I would like to hear the horror stories you

00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:13,720
may like to share. Have you ever heard the expression, never burn a bridge? You end

00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,180
a relationship in such a way that you could never go back and restart the relationship

00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,630
again, or if you did choose to go back, you would have to beg your way to forgiveness

00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:28,160
in order to restart that opportunity. One tale that I love to share is the story of

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,740
how someone in a dev ops position at a company decided to quit their job and they chose to

00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:41,520
go into the server room and sever every cable to every device in there. I consider that

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,050
bridge pretty burnt. I don't know about you, but I would not trust that person to work

00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:50,280
at my company.  So before we get into the actual act of quitting,

00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,639
let's dive into some background. The first question to ask ourselves is what's going

00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,830
on with our careers as developers. And the truth is, we are just so lucky. According

00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:06,270
to U.S. labor bureau, the job outlook growth for web developers is more than double the

00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:13,290
national average for all job growth up until 2026. The reason for this is there is a huge

00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:19,300
growing need for developers and why desperate employers in metropolitan cities are paying

00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:25,700
top dollars to any sort of developer who can demonstrate the skills they need in order

00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:31,590
to get the job done. I include myself in this, but many of us have bet our careers

00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:37,930
to start or shift into software development. As someone from a marketing and sales background,

00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:43,590
I love the continued education, great pay, and stability that this career brings me. 

00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:49,410
So, the nation's unemployment rate is at a near record low with more job openings than

00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:54,810
candidates to fill them, and technology is the sector for the fewest people available

00:06:54,810 --> 00:07:00,000
for all vacant positions. Where can we go for answers about how developers are feeling

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,050
about their careers? We turn to the tried and trusty source, stackover flow. Their

00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:14,060
survey is one of the largest surveys of people who code around the world. Over 90,000 people

00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:19,890
participated in the 20‑minute survey that took place. The first question is how satisfied

00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:25,520
are you with your current job? As it turns out, developers tend to be more satisfied

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,630
with their career in general than with their current job. You can see here that about

00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:37,479
20%of developers surveyed are a little bit dissatisfied with their job. How about what

00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:42,801
do you hope to be doing in five years? I love this question, because as developers, we should

00:07:42,801 --> 00:07:51,889
always be forward thinking and thinking about what is coming next. Don't just stay stagnant. Developers

00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:56,550
career goals are largely focused on technical work. Over half respondents say they want

00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:03,310
to be in the same or similar role in the future. About a quarter of the developers say they want

00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:08,360
to start their own company. It makes sense. If you're a developer, you're able to build. If

00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,860
you can grab the marketing and sales skills, you are an amazing combo, and you can build

00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:21,460
your own company. Now this is a good one.  How long ago did you last change your job? This

00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,870
is kind of awesome is that more than 50%of developers surveyed have switched jobs in

00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:32,610
the last two years. I'm at the bottom 20%. A weird feeling since so many of my co‑workers

00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:37,190
at the nonprofit that I work at proudly tout the fact that they have been there over ten

00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:42,159
years.  Lastly, and something that is an interesting

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,230
question, are you actively looking for a new job? Well, a full three quarters of developers

00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:56,120
are interested in hearing about new job opportunities, only 16%are actively looking. A common meme

00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,460
is that developers are not interested in what recruiters have to say, but the stats kind

00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:06,560
of point in a different direction. So, knowing this, why do we choose to leave our jobs? 

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,830
It's clearly for the cash. All problems can be solved if we're compensated more. That

00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:20,290
is absolutely false. Money is relative. We don't mind our actual level of income as long

00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:30,000
as we can meet our basic needs with extra for entertainment and savings. Autonomy is

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,410
the ability to shape your working environment that allows you to perform at your best. This

00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:40,350
might mean more control over your work, perhaps your work environment, or as noted before,

00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:46,550
starting your own company. Motivation. Motivation is rather elusive, isn't it? Some days you

00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:52,370
feel it and some days you don't. No matter how hard you try, you stare at your screen

00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:57,360
willing yourself to type, create, develop, and find yourself simply going through the

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:03,850
motions. You need to find a job where you feel motivated to put in your best work every

00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:08,830
single day.  Growth. Have you excelled in your current

00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:14,620
role? Have you grown to your full potential? Have you hit that ceiling? If you've answered yes,

00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,520
then perhaps it's time for you to move on to the next stage in your career. Moving

00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:23,420
into a larger or perhaps a new position might seem like an obvious next step. 

00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:29,420
Now a definite reason for us to celebrate quitting. Remember, we're taking such wonderful

00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:38,870
care of our health and financials, right? Retirement. It is an exciting reason to quit. But in all

00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:43,000
seriousness, preparing for retirement as a software developer could be a wonderful conference

00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,920
talk in itself. People tend to be happiest when they're in their 60s and 70s when work

00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,670
responsibilities have shed, the kids have grown, and everyday stress levels melt away. I

00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:58,380
recently had a co‑worker declare that she's going to be retiring at the end of the year. I

00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:03,640
couldn't be more happy for her. She's in great health, loves her family, and has plans

00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:11,550
for what she wants to do. You should think about that as a really valid reason to be

00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:17,890
quitting your job.  So when should you decide to move on? Worth. If

00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:22,130
you suspect that you are not being paid what you are worth, do your research. The best

00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:31,520
way to set your personal salary raise is to use an anonymous salary calculator. Do not,

00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:42,700
by any means, trust anecdotal information from co‑workers. If you suspect a pay disparity,

00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:48,330
consult your boss or human resources rep. If they won't discuss it, it's likely a telling

00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:52,170
sign. I don't like anything that's going on there. 

00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:56,260
Negative energy. If you are consistently bringing negativity into your home and work

00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:02,550
life, you might be too comfortable. You might tell yourself it's just a job. You can do

00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:07,340
your job with your eyes closed. That's a lot of negative energy that you don't need. If

00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:12,000
you have become a sad cheer leader, this has happen to me. You find yourself not cheering

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,440
for your employer's successes, innovations, and plans to bring the team together. You

00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:24,529
might find yourself feeling snide towards any company communications. If you're making

00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:33,010
careless mistakes or you're feeling physically unhealthy. Your career could be stagnant. You

00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:39,240
could be bored, overloaded, the organization is going downhill or no opportunities for

00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,780
growth. And this is a tough one. You're not being heard at work. Maybe you have a

00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:48,029
ton to share at work, but nobody is listening or nobody seems to take your contributions

00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:53,920
seriously. Or worse, other people are taking credit for your work. So, you have decided

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,760
to leave. How are you going to do it with style? 

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,510
So, there are a lot of talks about hiring and this is definitely not one of them. But

00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:08,060
you're about to get a shameless plug. If you want to hear great advice, check out episode

00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:18,310
287 on the Ruby on Rails podcast. We talked about how the Ruby job market is doing, what

00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:23,300
technologies employers are looking for, interview tips, and if the fabled full stack developer

00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:29,420
job is around. I highly recommend that you start here if you're looking for a new job. RubyConf

00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:36,740
has an on‑site jobs board where anybody can post or write information about openings. I

00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:41,310
checked and it's absolutely full to the brim. Do give that a check. 

00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:46,030
I am here to offer advice on what to do when you're looking for your next opportunity. There's

00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:51,370
a lot of fear that quitting your job will ruin your reputation. Your reputation is

00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:57,870
important. If you want to leave on good terms and you have to be stealth and smart. Starting

00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:05,480
off, don't leave before you leave. If you have a job, stick with it and act like you're

00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,840
going to be at that job for the rest of your life. Do not check out at your current job. What

00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:15,150
that could lead to is you actually not having a job any more. You could get fired for it. This

00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:19,040
leaves you demoralized and puts you in a position of weakness. You want to go to your job search

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:25,029
from a position of strength.  Do not cry wolf. No one wants to work with

00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:32,701
somebody who constantly says they want to quit. If you're getting ready to quit, find

00:14:32,701 --> 00:14:41,040
a confidant outside of work to confide to about your negative feelings. Search quietly. Update

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,269
your LinkedIn profile. Yes, it's a necessary thing, update your profile. Don't post your

00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:52,660
resume on job boards and don't drop hints that you're leaving. Be smart about scheduling. Schedule

00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:58,780
interviews outside of work hours. Don't sabotage yourself by double booking yourself. Don't

00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:04,610
include your co‑workers or bosses as references, and ask your prospective employer to be discreet. If

00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:11,480
they choose not to be discreet, that's probably a telling sign. 

00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:18,180
Try job search networking. It does work. At least 60%of all jobs are found by networking. Develop

00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:26,620
friends, neighbors, college alumni, perhaps Ruby friends, anyone who might help generate

00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:33,110
job leads. It's amazing who knows who. Keep that in mind. Everybody knows everybody. If

00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:42,110
you're looking to leave, you must be discreet. You have an ever watchful new employer. The title

00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:48,210
is hire me, I'm great at quitting. If you leave your job on bad terms, your next employer

00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:53,170
is watching you, and your next employer might try to test you. They might try to see if

00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:57,660
you won't give two weeks to your next employer. If you are willing to sign a hastily written

00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:04,930
contract and not give your employer any notice. They could be testing you. Our goal is to keep

00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:10,269
you as hirable as possible. Whatever you do to your current employer, it's very likely

00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:13,910
that you will do to your next employer. So, remember to keep that in mind. 

00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:19,800
So you finally have the next step in your career. It's time to quit. How do you go

00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:27,321
about doing it gracefully? It's a science and an art. You can feel guilty about leaving

00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:31,910
your job, especially if your boss has put a lot of personal development into you, but

00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:37,339
you need to do what is best for your career. So, I have an exciting announcement to share. I

00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:44,149
have been building a product on how to make this transition flawlessly. Introducing the

00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:53,420
quitting kit. Stick with me, Ruby friends, we're going places. 

00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:57,510
Professionalism. Don't tell your colleagues about your plans before you tell your manager. You

00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:03,639
must quit in person, and you must give at least two weeks' notice. If you are remote,

00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:08,110
schedule a meeting with your boss with your camera on. This is a personal interaction. And

00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,490
review your employment contract if you have one. 

00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:17,410
The next one's tough. Discomfort. You're going to have to be comfortable with being

00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:21,740
uncomfortable. You're not the first person who has ever quit and believe me you are certainly

00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:26,620
not the last. Be sure to know exactly what your message is before you approach your boss. You

00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:31,580
do not want to stumble upon your words. Even if you are leaving on good terms, the conversation

00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:37,240
will be awkward and difficult. Lead that conversation and understand that you have

00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:43,170
just ruined your boss's day.  Stand firm. You want to be firm in your decision

00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:48,280
and be prepared for any potential questions or objects that your manager brings up. Are

00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:54,270
you prepared to say no to a counter offer? While a counter offer can be very tempting, take

00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:58,970
care not to fall into the trap or be blind sided to your own detriment. It is stressful

00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:03,240
enough to make this big decision. A lot of change is about to happen. You're about to

00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:09,840
uproot yourself from your familiar co‑workers, your commute. Cash does not solve problems. If

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,261
the counter offer is purely cash, think to yourself what that will be adding to your

00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:20,480
general life.  Tame the reaction. Even if you provide two

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,870
weeks' notice as a courtesy to your current company, your boss could ask you to leave

00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:29,299
immediately. This happens. There are no federal or state laws in the U.S. requiring

00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:35,400
employers providing employees the two weeks that they have offered. Are you prepared

00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,919
to lose an additional two weeks of pay or possible health coverage? 

00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:47,580
Defeat the bus factor with documentation. The bus factor, an unpleasant concept, is a measurement

00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:52,390
of the risk resulting from the information and capabilities not being shared amongst

00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:58,890
team members derived from the phrase, in case they get hit by a bus. The version I like

00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:03,419
is that you won an all expenses paid vacation and you have to leave immediately, but we'll

00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:11,330
go with the bus factor. If you find any component of your job that is undocumented, never shared,

00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:17,410
encrypted, not published, or incomprehensible to others, you must fix it immediately. This

00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:23,960
means writing down every detail of what you do day to day. While this is tedious, trust

00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,520
me. It will be so helpful to point to your co‑workers later. 

00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:36,650
Succinct communication. Out of your colleagues, you will probably grow closest to your teammates. Your

00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:45,360
good‑bye e‑mail is a reflection of good times, not the bad. And please express gratitude

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:53,260
for working alongside them. Become a task slayer. Remember the tasks that stressed

00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:58,100
you out the most that made you dread Mondays? Make sure you have given your co‑workers the

00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:04,200
tools to handle those tasks with ease. While they may not thank you for this, they will

00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:10,770
be cursing you less. Those bridges are important, and one more bridge will remain in tact. Emotionally

00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:18,330
detach. Your co‑workers could end up feeling like family. Quitting is not a betrayal,

00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:25,000
but it can be a difficult and tearful good‑bye. Once while driving to quit my job, I pulled over

00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,470
on the side of the road and I threw up. I took that time to be upset so I could be as

00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:35,789
professional as possible once I entered my boss's office. It helps to maintain relationships

00:20:35,789 --> 00:20:40,630
with your co‑workers that you like the most. Some of my dearest friends in the whole world are

00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:45,669
people that I have worked with in the past.  With any good kit, you will have your core

00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:53,840
components and also your additional optional accessories. Here are some to think of. A

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:59,020
successor. Having a successor in place is optional. It is normally your choice to decide

00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:03,400
if you're gonna be involved in selecting that successor. And that comes in two different

00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,740
ways. The positive part of being involved is you can assist in writing the job description

00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:12,380
and making sure that you're really finding the best fit for that job. If you're not

00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:16,280
involved, the good news is it gives your successor space to design the job in the way they see

00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:23,841
fit. This is an odd one, but trust me. Recommendations. Believe it or not, as you are leaving, this

00:21:23,841 --> 00:21:27,610
is prime time to ask your co‑workers that you have had great relationships with to write

00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:34,990
recommendations. In turn, offer the same for them. You will be glad you have them. 

00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:40,420
Exit interview. Conducting an exit interview is entirely up to you and your company's culture. I

00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:47,400
have seen it optional. I have been asked and required to do it. Exit conversations

00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:54,060
are a means for your employers to learn what they need to do to retain key employees. Be

00:21:54,060 --> 00:22:02,470
careful. If you feel that you need to criticize peers or supervisors, remember that very seldom

00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:08,390
are people problems one‑sided.  I'm going to pause here to take a quick drink. I

00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:17,260
provided a quick tweetable version of the quitting kit. 

00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:22,660
All right. So, I've just spent a lot of time convincing you that you should quit. However,

00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:29,230
we do need to stop to consider if there are situations where you should stay. What if

00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:33,580
you really shouldn't quit your job? Here are some conversations to think about before

00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:41,960
you do it. Can the situation be fixed? You love everybody except that one person. Fact. Working

00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:47,890
with people is very difficult. Everything's going great until one person decides they

00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:52,780
have it out for you. Do not let that one person have control over your career. Take

00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:58,570
a stand and/or try to empathize with them to fix the situation. 

00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:04,160
Leadership lacks, but change is coming. When you see the people above you are moving on

00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:09,620
or moving out, hold tight. This could mean a positive change for you. Their movement

00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:14,720
makes room for perhaps your advancement, a role change, or even just a general work culture

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,010
change. Hold tight.  Boundaries are not set, but they could be. I'm

00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:25,690
a recovering people pleaser with a serious compulsion to say no problem without thinking. I

00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:36,231
had to get comfortable with setting boundaries. If you find yourself without boundaries, try

00:23:36,231 --> 00:23:42,049
to fix this first by approaching your boss.  You don't have any responsibility at work,

00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:47,150
but you could. Have a conversation with your boss to discuss your career goals. Let your

00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:50,679
boss know what you hope to get out of your current position and how you want to grow

00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:55,720
your career. We're thinking about the five years forward, right? This will give them

00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,970
the opportunity to give you the types of responsibilities that best suit your ambitions. Do not wait

00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:07,000
around hoping that your job role will change, because it won't. 

00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,710
You love the company mission, and you still believe in it. For me as an example, I work

00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:17,059
for a nonprofit in Pittsburgh whose goal is to bring art to every single person in Pittsburgh,

00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:20,679
whether or not that person is spending money to buy a ticket to go to one of our shows

00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:26,040
or simply attending one of our free festivals. I love that mission and a big reason why I continue

00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:30,610
to work there today. If your company's mission still resonates with you, contemplate whether

00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:36,400
or not it's worth fighting to stay. In the end, after making strides to improve your

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,380
work situation, if the thought of staying there for another five years does not fill

00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:46,610
you with panic, but instead with excited anticipation, perhaps you have found your place. 

00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:52,659
So, you have still decided to quit. Things are okay at your new gig, but you kind of

00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:57,570
wonder, have you made a mistake? What if your former company fixed the issues that

00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:05,309
you had with it? There's good news. Boomerang right back. The idea is workers who voluntarily

00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:15,740
leave an organization and join the organization at a later date is getting more and more acceptance. They

00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:21,710
want the known knowns. The increasing acceptance of boomerang employees is the tight job market

00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:33,010
I talked about. Boomerang employ es have worked there before, gained new experience,

00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:41,410
and now bringing some new best practices back. Three out of four employees would be willing to

00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:47,250
be ‑‑ rehire former employees who performed well and left on good terms. Remember, we

00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:53,450
don't burn bridges. If a company is facing a talent shortage, it's critical for the company

00:25:53,450 --> 00:26:00,580
to give every employee a reason to want to return. Now you have people out there who

00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:09,090
can serve as brand ambassadors for a lifetime. If you decide to boomerang back, be prepared. Re‑introduce

00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:17,020
yourself and reset their expectations about you and reset your expectations about everyone

00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:22,510
you have worked with prior. And above all, be positive. The company culture might have

00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:27,560
completely changed in your absence, so be ready to be positive about it and go with

00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:32,350
the flow.  We've reached the end of our quitting journey,

00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:38,270
and I hope I have inspired you. I want to remind you of one very specific idea. You

00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:43,210
only get one life. Do you often find yourself daydreaming that you were living a different

00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:47,840
life? Do you know what it would take in order to live that dream? Especially when it comes

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:55,130
to the personal question of career happiness? Practicing career courage makes the difference between

00:26:55,130 --> 00:27:01,190
an exciting and fulfilling career and one where your greatest talents are underutilized.

00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:05,720
Be brave. Just because quit something a little scary doesn't mean it's not a positive move

00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:11,130
for you. Bravery involves knowing what is important to you. None of these things come

00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:19,289
without experience. Trust in yourself. When it is time to quit, I want you to quit with

00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:26,130
finesse, purpose, grace, and professionalism. Thank you. 

00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:27,800
[ Applause ]

00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:40,020
So, this is kind of an odd talk to have a Q&A. I can certainly take questions, but

00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:44,909
I also thought if anybody had any fun quitting stories or anything, that would be very cool

00:27:44,909 --> 00:27:50,120
to share. I don't know if we have a microphone. I should have asked that prior. Does anybody

00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,169
have any questions? Is anybody going to quit their job? Yes!

00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,010
>> How do you balance the two weeks' notice when your health, physical, mental is impacted

00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,890
by the job.  >> So this is something that actually happened

00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:59,960
with me before.  >> Can you repeat the question? 

00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:08,150
>> Oh yes. How do you balance the two‑week notice if your health, mental state is not

00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:13,250
great and you want to make that transition smoothly, but you're not in a good place? I

00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:17,370
have actually had this situation in the past and this is an excellent question. That two

00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:24,550
weeks' notice doesn't have to be full‑time. What I did one time is I cut my hours instead of

00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:31,429
eight hours a day, I cut to three. I basically ‑‑ they had a successor in place. And so what

00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:36,039
I did is I gave the options to the successor and said I will be available during these

00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:41,090
hours. Otherwise, I'm taking time off so that I can decompress and really be ready for that

00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:47,919
next job. One mistake that I have done in the past is given two weeks' notice, had a

00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,220
weekend, and then went immediately into the new job. So one thing I should note, too,

00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:57,520
if you are able, and this is only if you have the privilege of being able to do this, but

00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:02,370
take a little bit of extra time so you can reset and really jump into that job at full

00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:06,190
health.  >> [ Inaudible Question ]

00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:08,941
>> So that's a really good question. I'm going to repeat what he said. He said he

00:29:08,941 --> 00:29:15,529
was working with a company in order to join as a new employee, and the employer would

00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:20,620
have been fine with him taking two weeks, but the recruiter fudged it so he would be

00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:24,140
brought on immediately. And perhaps that was because of a bonus that the recruiter

00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:31,490
would have gotten if you join right away.  I had a situation with a recruiter where I

00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:37,520
was getting hired into a company and they were going to partner me. So, I said I want

00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:43,590
to meet this person. I want to sit down and have coffee and make sure I will vibe with

00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:48,500
them because it was going to be such a one‑on‑one situation and the recruiter said absolutely

00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:54,840
not. I ended up still taking the job and luckily I got along with the developer very

00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:00,520
well and I mentioned that story to them and they were like oh. We had no idea that the

00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:05,440
recruiter told you that. So, that's a very good piece of advice as well. If a recruiter

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,270
tells you something that doesn't quite vibe with what you think you will get from that

00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:13,280
employer, definitely question it. Sometimes it's a misunderstanding. 

00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,299
>> [ Inaudible Question ]

00:30:14,299 --> 00:30:19,040
>> Who was raised is don't let your current employer pressure you into staying any longer

00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:25,330
than you feel is acceptable. A good thing to note as well is you can set up a contracting

00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:29,559
gig with your current employer so you're being compensated. If you find that your current

00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:33,700
employer is constantly hounding you for information and things they should be able to figure out

00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:37,950
themselves, because remember, we put together such wonderful documentation. Everything

00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:43,050
is documented. But if they are constantly trying to get free work from you, set up a

00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:48,429
contracting situation or cut it off. You have to be clear, and that goes back to setting

00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:54,590
boundaries, and making sure when you're done, you're done. Bridge is still in tact, but

00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,590
making that line clear. Yes?  >> [ Inaudible Question ]

00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,590
>> That's a really good question. So, one thing that I recommend is make sure that you

00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,590
know at least one person at your new workplace before you go there. But if that's not possible,

00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,590
and that absolutely can happen, you want to immediately set a meeting with your boss and

00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,590
you want to write out everything that you expected to happen and what's not happening. It

00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,590
might be that you were hired to bring in to help change the culture and they didn't tell

00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,590
you that. And so if that's true, then you have a lot of autonomy there to be able to

00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,590
make decisions and make that work environment better. But if they actually expect you to

00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,590
come into an environment and just take it, then you might need to start the process again

00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,590
of boomeranging back to your last employer if it really was a great opportunity, or you

00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,590
might need to go find a new job. Good question. Yes.  >>

00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,590
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,590
>>> Absolutely. That's a good question. So, if you don't want to put that on your resume,

00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,590
you could declare it as a sabbatical where you spent some time to really work on personal

00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,590
projects and things like that. So, you could make it look good. If you change jobs within

00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,590
a month, you want to explain that. But I think honesty is always the best policy. So,

00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,590
those recruiters are going to understand that you might have evidenced up at a place that

00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,590
wasn't great. You don't want to bad mouth the company, because you never know who knows. But

00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,590
I think having a private conversation saying here's the deal in case you question it. I

00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:14,590
would address it up front and just not cross your fingers that they don't catch it on your

00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,590
resume. I don't think anybody really sits on linked in and makes sure that you don't

00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,590
have any career gaps. Because with, like ‑‑ they can. But with things like boot camps

00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,590
and sabbaticals, it's bound to happen that you will have some gaps in there. But certainly

00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,590
address it early on. For sure. Good question. Anyone else? 

00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,590
>> [ Inaudible Question ]

00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,590
>> Such a good question. We're in a situation where a manager has had their day ruined because

00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,590
one of their favorite employees has come into their office and told them they are quitting. What

00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,590
I like to do as a manager is you want to step into the shoes of that employee for at least

00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,590
one day during the time that they're transitioning out to make sure that you fully understand

00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,429
what's going on. In a lot of situations you will see they discover this employee has had

00:31:25,429 --> 00:31:30,410
too much responsibility and maybe their job needs to be cut into two. Or they don't have

00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:36,169
enough responsibility and they may consider not hiring a new person to fill that role. I

00:31:36,169 --> 00:31:39,861
think you want to have a Frank conversation, and that's different than the exit conversation. The

00:31:39,861 --> 00:31:48,909
exit interview is official and documented. You want to have an honest lunch or coffee with

00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:57,370
the manager. Their goal is to retain the key talent that's on their team. Teams can

00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:02,760
be a wolf pack. So, you know, a new person might come into the team, the wolf pack doesn't

00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,860
like them. They'll force them out. You want to make sure that's not the situation, because

00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:11,669
then you're dealing with a toxic team. So, not only talking to the key people that are

00:32:11,669 --> 00:32:15,070
leaving the job, but you also want to talk to the people they were interacting with as

00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:19,960
well and make sure you get ahead of it. I have worked at many companies that when someone

00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:24,980
quits, you don't speak of that person again, or that person becomes the person that everything

00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,950
gets blamed on. You want to not necessarily celebrate it, but, you want to make sure that

00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,470
your team is wishing that person well and that it's a positive environment. You certainly

00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,470
don't want to tell one of your teammates to go pack up the desk during the conversation

00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,470
with them. Good question. Anything else.  >> [ Inaudible Question ]

00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:31,470
>> I have a friend who just did this. She just pulled this off, which was amazing to

00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,470
me. It was part of her employment contract that she would get to keep her vacation time. Most

00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,470
employers that I've interacted with will compensate you for the vacation time that you don't take. I

00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,470
think you give them that as an option. Either you get to take that time and you stay on

00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,470
the payroll of they need to compensate you out for the time. I have seen that certainly

00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,470
with layoffs. If you decide that you want to take your vacation time right away, and

00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:39,260
likely you have already booked and are doing things, just understand that you are not ‑‑

00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,260
you are just as accessible as an employee when you were going to take that vacation

00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,580
as an employee than when you're someone who is going to quit. Make sure that you're disengaging

00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:46,520
and you don't feel you need to suck up to your current employer in order to make things

00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,649
nice. Yes?  >> [ Off mic ].

00:32:47,649 --> 00:32:49,919
>> Awesome. Thank you for that.  >> [ Off mic ].

00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,799
>> Awesome. Thank you for that. Very cool. Okay. Anyone else? Okay. Thank you guys so much. I really

00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:56,230
appreciate you coming here today, and enjoy the lightning talks.
