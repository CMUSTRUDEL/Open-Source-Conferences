	RubyConf 2019 - Tales of the Ruby Grimoire by Brandon Weaver

There are arts best left unspoken, dark magics left forgotten and locked away in the deepest vaults of the Ruby language, lest they be seen by mortal eyes not ready for the horrors inside.

That is, until a particularly curious Lemur named Red happened to open it.

Journey with Red into the Tales of the Ruby Grimoire, through parts of the language not meant for the faint of heart. There is great power here, but that power comes at a cost. Are you willing to pay it?
