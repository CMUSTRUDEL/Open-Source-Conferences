	RubyConf 2019 - Ruby ate my DSL! by Daniel Azuma

DSLs (Domain-Specific Languages) are fun to design, but it's easy to forget that they are still "Just Ruby." If users of your DSL can mix in Ruby code... any Ruby code... you can bet they will, and it's all too easy for that to go awry. In this session, you'll encounter examples of how seemingly innocuous Ruby code can make a DSL go disastrously wrong, and you’ll learn techniques you can use to harden your DSL against the cleverness of your users. If you’re writing, or even thinking of writing a DSL, this talk is for you.
