>> Standby while I do all this.

00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,330
Speak among yourselves.

00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,330
Actually, let's do this while I get started.

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,330
Who tell me again, who is this their first RubyConf.

00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:17,330
Raise your hand if you have been to a RubyConf before.

00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:18,330
This is a trick from my childhood.

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,330
Look around.

00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,330
And find someone whose hand is not up and reach out and shake it.

00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,330
And introduce yourself.

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,330
Do that and I'll be right back.

00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,330
The only problem with that is it's really hard to get you back.

00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:24,330
So, come back.

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,330
So, my talk really just barely fits in my time slot.

00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:26,330
I first want to thank the sponsors.

00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,590
This couldn't happen unless we have those sponsors.

00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:31,720
[ Applause ] You know, how many times this week have you

00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,989
been told if you have a problem talk to someone in a red shirt?

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:35,329
All right?

00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:39,390
If you haven't talked to someone in a red shirt yet, before you leave today, find one

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,180
of them and shake their hand and thank them.

00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,120
They do a lot of work to make these conferences happen.

00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:52,330
[ Applause ] And I've been sitting here all week watching

00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,020
that...

00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,420
>> CAPTIONER: Hi!

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,520
>> Let's thank Stacey.

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,220
Yay.

00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,619
All right.

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:14,420
So, here I am.

00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,310
It's so unlikely that I would be here.

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,750
I mean, I've been so incredibly lucky.

00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,080
It's astonishing.

00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,650
What about you?

00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,000
Are you lucky?

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,160
Yeah?

00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,940
Fortune smiling on you?

00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:37,200
Do you think as I do when I think about how I drove when I was 16 that I am lucky to be

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,370
alive?

00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,070
Look how well everything turned out?

00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,730
Or perhaps maybe not so much.

00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,090
Maybe you're unlucky.

00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:50,350
Maybe you were born under an evil sign, dragging that bad luck around you like the flu and

00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,330
infecting everyone with it.

00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:56,090
If you're unlucky, I have good news for you.

00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,720
You can hack luck.

00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:06,673
This guy's name is Richard Wiseman and he did a ten year study.

00:02:06,673 --> 00:02:11,480
He solicited volunteers who thought of themselves as lucky or unlucky and he tried to figure

00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,819
out what differentiated those two groups.

00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:20,730
He found there's four components to luck.

00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,370
The first one is that lucky people pay attention.

00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,460
They're like not caught up in their own stuff.

00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,350
So, they're looking around at the world.

00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,610
They see opportunities for luck.

00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,040
The next one is that they're open to experience.

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,370
They're listening to their intuition.

00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,020
The third one, this is sort of weirdly self reverential.

00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,120
They assume they're going to be lucky.

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,650
There's a way in which they practice luck in their heads.

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,900
And finally, this one is more vague.

00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:56,050
Lucky people tend to interpret the things that happen to them as if they were lucky.

00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,000
All right?

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,041
The first time I heard about this research was a talk that Sarah May gave at a conference

00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:03,140
many years ago.

00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:07,819
And right after that talk, my partner and I went to Spain and took a self guided bike

00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:09,110
tour.

00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:15,980
And it turned out that the directions were really bad.

00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:20,290
And every day, like at the end of the day, we would have ridden 60 or 80 kilometers,

00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:25,722
dark and raining, and we would be looking for our hotel and we would look at each other

00:03:25,722 --> 00:03:27,860
and say well, at least we're improving our luck.

00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,380
It made the whole trip better.

00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,300
It was amazing how the difference in perspective changed.

00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,620
Here they are.

00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:44,280
Taken together this list suggests that you can make your own luck.

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,629
Now, Wiseman after he identified these four things, he took the unlucky people and taught

00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:52,680
them and they reported being luckier later.

00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,730
All right?

00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,020
And so I don't know.

00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,660
Maybe you're already making your own luck.

00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,250
Certainly it's true that you're lucky to be here.

00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,650
Like think about that.

00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,910
How did you get to be in this room today?

00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,519
I mean, first of all, somebody paid.

00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:12,890
Like you got time off work, hotel, you're eating I'm assuming.

00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,140
Right?

00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:18,470
As a group, we programmers are amazingly lucky.

00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,599
I have some data this is 2017 data.

00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:24,370
All of my data, I'm really sorry.

00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,740
It's mostly right.

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,490
It's hard to get good, precise data about the things I'm about to talk about.

00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:38,069
I went in a data set from 2017 and I arbitrarily selected some categories of programmer ish

00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,650
jobs.

00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:46,940
I took everything that had the word computer and programmer in it and I threw away training

00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,479
jobs and operating jobs and repairing jobs.

00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:56,819
And I was left with a subset where the categories totalled 2.3 million people.

00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:05,389
And the data set showed that the median income in 2017 across all those jobs was $85,000.

00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:07,370
I think this is an underreporting.

00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:12,680
If you look at more recent data, you'll see numbers like the median income for programmers

00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:18,740
is more like $100,000, if you're a system dev, maybe $110,000.

00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:27,599
So, I will take some liberties with the number and round it up to $93,000 as a median.

00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:39,659
Does anybody in here know the median income of the average worker in the United States?

00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:45,339
You're making or you probably will make on average three times the salary of the average

00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:46,729
worker in the U.S.

00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:51,250
And so I picked this 2017 data set because they broke it out by gender.

00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,250
Let's do that.

00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,860
Don't be alarmed.

00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,960
Just relax.

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,009
[ Laughter ] All right.

00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:06,219
So, that 2.3 million, about 1,700,000 men and 600,000 women.

00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:11,129
I'm quite sure it's reported this way because at the bureau of labor and statistics they

00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:14,610
only have two radial buttons.

00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:22,029
If we believe that 390 out of every 100,000 humans is non binary, the number probably

00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:25,710
looks like this.

00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:32,800
I realize that you can barely see the color on the chart, but 9,000 people is a lot of

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,509
people, and they deserve their own radio button.

00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:39,659
Like fix that.

00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:46,839
[ Applause ] So if we turn this into percents, you get

00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:47,839
that.

00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,050
And I have some I made up some numbers for this conference.

00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,050
All right.

00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,860
I got data right before it was sold out.

00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,699
And here's what it looked like.

00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:57,149
I'm going to go back and forth.

00:06:57,149 --> 00:07:02,879
Notice that women despite their enormous efforts and improvements they have made over the years,

00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:09,610
the number of women go down, but the number of people that's the people that those "they"

00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,610
as their pronoun.

00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,879
I had to make up a bunch about the data.

00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:20,199
A lot of people didn't answer that question, so I distributed the non answers in the proportion

00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:24,840
to male/female and I assumed that everyone who said "they" was in the non binary category.

00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:31,399
It could be wrong, but it's something.

00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,399
That's gender.

00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:34,080
Let's look at ethnicity.

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,899
This is 2019 data.

00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:39,930
Wait for it.

00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,639
I'm sure you're shocked.

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,899
So, this is overall, and it makes things look more diverse than they are.

00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:51,169
The really big companies, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Twitter, they're more like

00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:55,520
56%white and 37% Asian.

00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,539
So, some of the companies that have big influence are less diverse than the group we have here

00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:02,819
as a whole.

00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:07,339
So I have income data.

00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:11,520
The median income for men, remember?

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:24,059
For men, it's 87 and for women it's 79.

00:08:24,059 --> 00:08:29,199
In computer programming, women make about 90%of the average salary of men.

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,270
Which is way better.

00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:38,500
The actual median across all jobs is women make about 80 cents on the dollar compared

00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,150
to men.

00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:48,140
Out in the normal world across all jobs, women hold about half of the jobs and they only

00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,000
hold 25%of the programming jobs.

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,130
So, we're making more money, but there are fewer women.

00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,020
So, that's glass half full.

00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:00,190
Since I have all of the data, I couldn't resist putting it on a Google spreadsheet and figure

00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,790
out who got what piece of the pie.

00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,730
So, that chart looks like this.

00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:11,240
So, the men, they only represent like 75%of the people, but they get more money because

00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,150
they make more money.

00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:20,790
So, if you start putting ethnicity on here, it turns out that white people get about 50%of

00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,280
all the money paid to programmers.

00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:29,770
If you add Asians in, these two categories account for 80%of all the money.

00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,300
That's the key to the other colors.

00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,350
They have such a small part of the pie that I didn't have room to put the percentages

00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,350
on the chart.

00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,350
All right.

00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,280
So, now you have all of that data.

00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,760
This is just information.

00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,970
This is truth.

00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:46,360
And you have to ask yourself, who are the winners and losers here?

00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,440
And again, don't freak out.

00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,960
I'm not picking on you.

00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,460
But here's the question I ask myself.

00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:57,500
If you were an alien and you moved to earth and were gonna take a programming job, what

00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,610
demographic category would you choose?

00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:06,050
You'd be a white guy!

00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,140
Right?

00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:11,810
So we know from Wiseman's research that you can improve your luck, but you're pretty much

00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:14,160
stuck with your demographic.

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,290
That's just a fact.

00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,700
All right.

00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:24,310
If you happen to have been born into one of those higher paying demographics, lucky you.

00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:27,430
But speaking of born, let's talk about where you were born.

00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:31,230
Turns out your neighborhood matters a lot.

00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:37,500
This guy, Raj Chetty, he's a microeconomist at Harvard and studies a thing called social

00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,310
mobility, which is how likely it is you will move up in income category relative to your

00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,650
parents.

00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:51,220
He founded opportunity insights, and they have this amazing mapping tool.

00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,220
Here's what they did.

00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:57,080
They took they got data for 20 million people.

00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:05,870
They got income tax returns and census data and something

00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,800
called the American community survey data.

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:16,140
This is people born in the late 70s and early 80s so mid 30s to early 40s right now.

00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:22,890
They got data about them and their parents and they made this enormous mapping tool.

00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:30,990
And what this tool does is it maps data back to the census track where you were born.

00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:35,780
And you can there's a million drop downs and check boxes here so you can look at all kinds

00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:40,570
of things that were true about places where people were born and find out the effect that

00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,690
that has on how they are doing now.

00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:46,980
For example, there are places in the United States where two neighborhoods are really

00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,920
close together that have similar demographics and the outcomes for the children that were

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,040
born in those neighborhoods are very different today.

00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,480
This is just the main home page.

00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:05,190
Up in the right hand corner it shows current household income for people of any race or

00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,550
income level sorry.

00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:13,790
Any gender or race based on all parental incomes back 30 years ago.

00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:19,820
The colors on the map, the warm colors represent lower incomes and the cool colors represent

00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,050
higher incomes.

00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:25,480
And they found what you can tell just by looking at this map, the main front page of their

00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:31,150
website, there's differences in the United States across regions about how well things

00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,900
turn out for the kids born there later.

00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,780
The south, as always, takes it on the chin.

00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,260
This is Nashville.

00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,590
This is where we're standing right now.

00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:49,240
In the center of the country as you get up high, the colors are tend to darker blue,

00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,180
except there's two spots in South Dakota where outcomes for kids who were born there in the

00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,420
70s and 80s are poor.

00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,690
Can you explain that?

00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,070
Indian reservations.

00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,070
Yeah.

00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,140
You're doomed.

00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,520
All right?

00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,950
You're just doomed if you grow up in those environments.

00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:10,650
I'm going to zoom in on Los Angeles for a minute.

00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:11,940
This is current household income.

00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,990
Let me back up.

00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:18,960
This is household income for children of low income parents, current household income for

00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,200
children born back then to low income parents.

00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,910
As you zoom in, there's a lot of granularity.

00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:31,010
The census tracts are 4,250 people on average.

00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,160
That's how big the neighborhoods are.

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,269
I'm going to zoom in more.

00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:42,790
This is the incarceration rate of black male children born to the lowest income parents.

00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,970
This is the Watts neighborhood.

00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:46,800
That's the census track.

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,880
This is Compton.

00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,310
These census tracks, I'm going to zoom in more.

00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:59,080
These tracks have similar demographics and similar numbers of black men and 2.5 miles

00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,090
apart.

00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:09,870
The incarceration rate is 44%and here it's 6.2%.

00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:15,000
These neighborhoods are alike demographically and close together.

00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,900
The difference in outcomes seems like it must be related to some feature of the neighborhoods

00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,420
rather than some quality of the people.

00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:32,791
So, the promise of America, the dream is that with hard work, you can succeed even if you

00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,620
come from nothing.

00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,300
How often do you think this dream is achieved?

00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,460
Chetty knows.

00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,360
He calculated the numbers.

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,660
The chance of you rising from the bottom level of income in the United States to the top

00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,010
is 7.5%.

00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,820
And you can see, that's an average.

00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,470
If you're born in the upper Midwest, it's more like 14 or 15.

00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:58,130
If you're born in the south, it's more like 4 or 5.

00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:02,980
And there are places in the south like the southeast where I'm from, Atlanta and Charlotte,

00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,860
they have been on an enormous boom over the last 20 years.

00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,460
Wages have gone up.

00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,940
They have had economic success.

00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:17,080
And yet the outcomes for children born to low income parents in those places are abysmal.

00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:21,770
So what is it about your neighborhood?

00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:25,060
It turns out that they can figure this out.

00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,670
Neighborhoods where and some of it is counter intuitive.

00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:32,410
Neighborhoods where people are segregated by income and race have worse outcomes for

00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,660
children.

00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:40,320
If you separate people, if you segregation hurts outcomes for people who are gonna pay

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,990
the taxes later that will finance your social security.

00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,630
Think about that.

00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:51,010
It also turns out that two that neighborhoods here's this.

00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:54,110
Actually, let me read this to you.

00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:57,510
Neighborhoods where most families have two parents do better.

00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,860
Now, it is not the condition of having two parents.

00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,000
Let me be quick to say that.

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,060
It doesn't matter whether you individually have one or two parents, it's about your neighborhood.

00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:12,180
If the whole neighborhood is full of one parent families, then outcome are worse for children.

00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:18,920
Good schools matter, and outcomes are better in neighborhoods where they have more social

00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,920
capital.

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,710
It's where people know each other and they will help you if you have trouble paying the

00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,210
rent or whatever.

00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,210
All right.

00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:33,110
So, Chetty estimates that if a low income family could move at birth from neighborhood

00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:41,350
in the lowest area of upward mobility to a higher one, just across town in many cases,

00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:48,440
that the average lifetime earnings of that child would go up $206,000.

00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,361
Some cities are so convinced by this research, right now in Detroit and Seattle, they're

00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:54,760
running experiments where they're doing just that.

00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:59,900
They are taking people who have section 8 vouchers and overcoming the obstacles that

00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:09,550
keep those folks from moving to higher opportunity neighborhoods.

00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,890
This map is radical.

00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,689
If you get in there, you will never leave.

00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:17,100
If you are thinking about moving in your town, you should look at the Chetty map and find

00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:23,899
out what neighborhoods are best for children, because it makes a difference.

00:17:23,899 --> 00:17:27,589
Neighborhoods matter, but Chetty found out that they don't matter for everybody in the

00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,779
same way.

00:17:28,779 --> 00:17:35,340
He compared black boys and white boys growing up on the same blocks where parents earn similar

00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,039
incomes.

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:42,580
The black men have a lower chance of achieving upward mobility.

00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:47,970
Black sons of affluent black families have a much greater chance of achieving downward

00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:48,970
mobility.

00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:55,200
Chetty describes that he says that white men, white families are on a ladder of prosperity

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,490
and black men are on a treadmill; it's easy to fall off.

00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:07,779
So, the neighborhood that you grow up in has a lot to do with how you turn out and your

00:18:07,779 --> 00:18:15,039
ability it has maybe more effect on your ability to be successful than your parents.

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:25,820
But despite that, race and gender play a strong role that's hard to overcome.

00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,610
Here's where I grew up.

00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:33,529
This is Randolph Drive in Parkersburg, West Virginia.

00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:39,610
My dyslexic father got tired of sitting in the back of class not being able to read and

00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,639
he quit going to school.

00:18:41,639 --> 00:18:45,529
The truant officer told him he had to.

00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:48,679
When he refused to, they didn't want to put him in jail or make him go to school, so they

00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:53,559
lied about his age and let him join the army.

00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:57,330
He was at boot camp where he met my mom.

00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,929
She grew up on a farm.

00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:01,899
He was apparently a smart ass.

00:19:01,899 --> 00:19:03,179
I don't know what happened.

00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:04,900
They tried to protect him.

00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:11,480
The army thinks he's older than he is, but they knew he was underage.

00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:17,130
He got orders to ship out, so he and my mom got engaged and he went to Korea.

00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,260
He was fighting in Korea when he was 15 years old.

00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:28,720
When he got back, he and my mom got married and they moved back to his hometown, Parkersburg.

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,860
He drove a bread truck, got a GED and became an apprentice mechanic.

00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:43,520
That was like 30 a week or $130 a month.

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,820
He was paid $140 additional a month on the GI bill.

00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:53,210
They paid for him to apprentice to learn a skill that would get a good job.

00:19:53,210 --> 00:20:02,450
When he became a real employee, his pay only went up $10 more a month.

00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:07,970
He joined the union and they bought this house.

00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:13,289
The interest rate was initially 8%, but after he had worked for a couple of years in Parkersburg,

00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:20,139
they had a workplace program where they would buy your mortgage and lend the money back

00:20:20,139 --> 00:20:21,639
to you at a lower rate.

00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:26,389
I just couldn't believe it when he told me this.

00:20:26,389 --> 00:20:28,549
It's inconceivable now.

00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:35,320
That was the bargain that businesses had to their communities and employees.

00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,600
So the mortgage, when that happened, his interest rate was cut in half.

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:46,230
So, I lived in this house for the first 17 years of my life.

00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:49,179
Here's the chatty map of Parkersburg.

00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:51,369
I grew up right there.

00:20:51,369 --> 00:20:56,029
So, that this is the current household income for all female children born there in the

00:20:56,029 --> 00:20:58,200
late 70s and early 80s.

00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:04,559
That light orangish color is about $40,000 a year, which means I'm doing great relative

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,539
to the other women who grew up in this place.

00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:10,090
I have worked hard.

00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,659
It is true.

00:21:11,659 --> 00:21:19,679
But it feels like my efforts and natural good nature just aren't enough to explain my success.

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:25,049
My parents, relative to their parents, were really successful and their gradual movement

00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:31,190
up the income distribution ladder started with buying that first house.

00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:36,299
And the history of American housing explains why it's super tough to get ahead today.

00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:44,269
Owning a house can be the difference between acquiring wealth and being stuck in poverty.

00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:47,890
It's about you and about the generations that follow you.

00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:53,860
Property ownership is a wealth generating thing over generations.

00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:58,679
You can buy something in an up and coming neighborhood, you sell it for a profit, rinse

00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:02,100
and repeat, and eventually it turns into real money.

00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:09,739
There's a huge gap in homeownership by race, and this has deep running historical roots.

00:22:09,739 --> 00:22:16,139
In 1865, president Lincoln divided up the land owned by former slave owners and he granted

00:22:16,139 --> 00:22:18,919
slaves 40 acre plots.

00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:24,130
A year later, president Johnson overturned this program and gave that land right back

00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,840
to the whites.

00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,049
Now we're having talk about impeachment.

00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:32,590
You know that fourth guy whose name they mention when they say presidents that have been impeached?

00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:37,669
It's Johnson, and he got impeached over this issue.

00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:41,899
Over the next couple of decades, few blacks accumulated property.

00:22:41,899 --> 00:22:44,009
Most couldn't afford to buy it outright.

00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:50,239
A mortgage required 50 or 60%down and the balance was due in one to three years.

00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:52,100
Yeah.

00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:56,989
So a few generations or a few decades later right before the big depression, there was

00:22:56,989 --> 00:23:01,080
a big boom and bust in housing in America.

00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:08,929
And most blacks at that time we're not even a generation past the end of the civil war.

00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,389
Most blacks at that time still did not own property.

00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:15,700
At the height of the great depression, the national Realtors association started arguing

00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,739
that the federal government should get into housing.

00:23:19,739 --> 00:23:24,950
As a stimulus to the federal economy, that's what happened.

00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:29,989
They wanted to encourage private homeownership and they did that by standardizing housing

00:23:29,989 --> 00:23:32,840
and providing mortgage insurance.

00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:38,389
So, because they were operating at scale, they could drive down costs.

00:23:38,389 --> 00:23:43,990
And what happened was now that lenders are insured against loss, they cut the prevailing

00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:49,410
interest rates in half and started lending up to 90%of the values of homes.

00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:54,919
So, by 1939 with the advent of the federally insured mortgages, it became cheaper in the

00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:58,739
United States to buy than to rent.

00:23:58,739 --> 00:24:03,500
Unfortunately these federal programs were based on three assumptions.

00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,440
People could be divided by race.

00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:11,240
Only white communities could maintain property values.

00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:17,590
And that segregation by race was necessary to protect these values.

00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:21,779
Something called the federal homeowners loan corporation created maps where they would

00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:23,720
grade neighborhoods.

00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:31,809
Here's the map for where I live in Durham, North Carolina.

00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:34,210
This is from 1937.

00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:35,379
It's color coded.

00:24:35,379 --> 00:24:40,929
Areas in green green, of course.

00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:44,669
Graded A. They're for whites only.

00:24:44,669 --> 00:24:51,369
If it had somebody Jewish in it, they were going to be B or C, blue or yellow.

00:24:51,369 --> 00:24:53,160
They were considered risky.

00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:58,929
A neighborhood with anyone black in it was graded D, no matter what economic level the

00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:00,759
inhabitants had.

00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:01,759
These were direct quotes.

00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:06,799
These neighborhoods were considered worthless or likely to decline in value and no loans

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,279
could be made for purchasing or upgrading.

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,759
All right?

00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:17,570
So on our own maps, what lenders would do is take the D graded neighborhoods and they

00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:23,369
would outline them in red ink, and this is where the term "red lining" came from.

00:25:23,369 --> 00:25:29,640
Realtors were not permitted to sell houses to blacks in white neighborhoods because the

00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,519
mortgages were federally insured and they were afraid the property values would go down.

00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:40,090
Blacks were unable to get loans to buy houses in the neighborhoods they wanted to live.

00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:48,049
I told you it was cheaper to buy than to rent, but blacks are forced into only renting houses.

00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:54,950
I know that for some of you 1937 might seem like an inconceivably distant time.

00:25:54,950 --> 00:26:03,409
My dad was born in 1932, and I talked to him on the phone last week this is right now.

00:26:03,409 --> 00:26:04,409
Okay.

00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:07,360
I'm gonna show you a few more things.

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,820
I'm just stunned by all of this.

00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:16,899
The archive contains the paperwork that was written down by the people who did these gradings.

00:26:16,899 --> 00:26:18,419
Let's look at A2.

00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:20,799
Gently rolling.

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:24,379
Plenty of infrastructure.

00:26:24,379 --> 00:26:27,960
No detrimental things.

00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,320
This is near Duke university in Durham.

00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,600
They're making the top salary is like $8,000 a year.

00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,019
And these questions are just astonishing.

00:26:37,019 --> 00:26:40,609
Foreign born none, negro, none.

00:26:40,609 --> 00:26:41,609
Infiltration?

00:26:41,609 --> 00:26:42,609
What is that?

00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:45,679
You get infiltrated by the enemy.

00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,519
Infiltration, none.

00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:49,179
No families on relief.

00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:52,749
All homes in good repair.

00:26:52,749 --> 00:26:55,039
90%are owned.

00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,070
Plenty of mortgage money.

00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:02,320
Signed by Leon Powell, May 21, 1937.

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,169
Let's look at D6.

00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:06,169
Rolling.

00:27:06,169 --> 00:27:07,169
Okay.

00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:08,730
Not so bad.

00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:09,730
Yeah.

00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:10,919
There's railroad tracks.

00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:13,330
People have good jobs.

00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:18,470
The top salaries here are really not terrible compared to what the professors at Duke university

00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,669
are making.

00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:21,669
Foreign born, none.

00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:22,669
Negro, yes.

00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:23,730
Of course we need to know the percent.

00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:24,730
Infiltration.

00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:27,850
Now we know what this means.

00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:30,629
Many relief families.

00:27:30,629 --> 00:27:32,940
Many poor, but some fair housing.

00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,460
Only 15%of the people own.

00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:39,869
There are no mortgage funds...

00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:46,570
So the federal housing administration and the VA adopt the HOLC's rules and they grant

00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:51,440
loans only to buyers whose homes are located in stable and desirable areas.

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:57,659
And a single black person living on your block could get your neighborhood red lined, which

00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:01,039
meant all the whites were super interested in keeping their neighborhoods segregated

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:06,110
because they wanted people to get mortgages to buy houses in that neighborhood.

00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:10,619
Neighborhoods are strictly segregated and it starts at this time and we did it.

00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:11,619
Us.

00:28:11,619 --> 00:28:13,240
The government.

00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:18,109
What happens is that whites get on the path of homeownership and prosperity, but you cannot

00:28:18,109 --> 00:28:20,889
buy a house if you're black.

00:28:20,889 --> 00:28:25,399
Here's that map super imposed over today's Google map of Durham.

00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:27,970
And those grades?

00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:30,649
They echo down the decades till today.

00:28:30,649 --> 00:28:32,399
Here's the Chetty map.

00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:41,129
This is current household income for children of parents with low incomes.

00:28:41,129 --> 00:28:44,679
Here there are two other factors that happened in Durham.

00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:54,979
In the '60s, a big project put a highway through a thriving black downtown and destroyed it.

00:28:54,979 --> 00:28:58,249
I drive on that highway all the time and I never thought about it.

00:28:58,249 --> 00:29:05,850
There's another rant about urban renewal that I will not get into right now.

00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:10,509
Schools in the south were desegregated and the way that the whites in Durham dealt with

00:29:10,509 --> 00:29:15,590
that is they made separate schooling systems for the city and the county.

00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,750
So, the whites could move to the county.

00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:20,940
There was white flight which changed the demographics some.

00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:26,249
So, in places where it doesn't map up to the 1937 stuff, neighborhoods were destroyed and

00:29:26,249 --> 00:29:29,820
whites moved out.

00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:36,659
Despite those changes, here's today's income levels in the neighborhoods based on those

00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:38,149
1937 maps.

00:29:38,149 --> 00:29:39,639
All right?

00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:43,940
85%of the people who live in neighborhoods that were graded A are in the middle to upper

00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,489
level income brackets.

00:29:45,489 --> 00:29:52,269
And as we go down, all right.

00:29:52,269 --> 00:29:56,159
Here's race.

00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:07,889
The areas that were graded A in 1937 are 15%minority.

00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:12,390
It was unbelievable to me.

00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:16,781
That section of the Chetty map is Durham.

00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:18,649
That's Chapel Hill.

00:30:18,649 --> 00:30:24,299
Here's Raleigh, the capital of North Carolina.

00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:26,880
Here's a suburb called Cary.

00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,110
You can probably guess who lives where.

00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:37,320
Of course I live right there.

00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,639
Where the aliens would choose.

00:30:39,639 --> 00:30:44,429
So, outside of my college years, I have almost never rented.

00:30:44,429 --> 00:30:46,499
In 1980, I bought this house.

00:30:46,499 --> 00:30:50,159
And then I bought this house.

00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,400
I loved this house.

00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,760
And then this was I moved to Durham.

00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,369
That was in Tallahassee where I went to college.

00:30:56,369 --> 00:30:57,369
This is Durham.

00:30:57,369 --> 00:30:59,899
My house was behind that tree.

00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:05,970
You can't make the Google maps driver get a good shot of your house.

00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:11,419
I lived in that house, and then I moved to western Colorado.

00:31:11,419 --> 00:31:19,120
Then when I moved back east, this was my house on Welkin court.

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,690
Finally I wanted my own real house, so I had one custom built.

00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:27,269
I got a lot and got a construction loan.

00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:36,299
My house is not the monstrous house on the right, but it's at the end of that driveway.

00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:40,039
My house is way back there.

00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:43,999
This picture was actually taken in 2007, a month after we moved in.

00:31:43,999 --> 00:31:47,470
So, you can a little bit see, but probably can't tell in the picture.

00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:53,419
You can see there's a solar collector on the roof, because I have solar hot water.

00:31:53,419 --> 00:31:57,279
I was told that I was not allowed to show you those pictures because my house proud

00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,099
partner wanted it to look better.

00:31:59,099 --> 00:32:00,899
So, here are modern photos.

00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:04,320
You can see the plantings have grown up.

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,940
If you walk up my driveway, there's the garden.

00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,720
I'm responsible for none of this.

00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,979
There's the garden.

00:32:10,979 --> 00:32:14,679
And if you walk up, you can see the beehive and the obligatory Subaru.

00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:20,330
And if you go closer, this is a close up shot of my house.

00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:22,889
It is awesome and beautiful.

00:32:22,889 --> 00:32:28,590
I'm actually getting more panels put on the roof now so my utilities are about to go to

00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,590
zero.

00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,710
The south walls are full of windows.

00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:34,840
It's the perfect house.

00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:39,379
It's in a co housing community, so it's an absolutely great neighborhood.

00:32:39,379 --> 00:32:42,720
I am lucky to have it.

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,090
And part of the reason I have it was because of the equity I earned over the years in the

00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,389
other houses.

00:32:48,389 --> 00:32:54,110
So, if neighborhoods have a lot to do with outcomes but you can't pick your neighborhood

00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:59,129
and owning property is a path to wealth but you can't buy a house, well you don't get

00:32:59,129 --> 00:33:00,279
to have this.

00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:03,279
And that sucks.

00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:07,419
And have to admit, I kinda hate knowing all this.

00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:10,109
I have been enormously successful.

00:33:10,109 --> 00:33:14,529
I was happy when I could think of myself as hard working and a bit lucky.

00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:19,409
But once I started examining the source of my good fortune, I found that a scary proportion

00:33:19,409 --> 00:33:29,019
of it might originate from biases in the system rather than justly earned by my efforts.

00:33:29,019 --> 00:33:32,340
Everything I told you about has been baked in before I was born so I could kind of let

00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,789
myself off the hook.

00:33:34,789 --> 00:33:36,690
But research?

00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:38,599
Dang it!

00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:42,340
So now I have some context to understand a few things that have happened in my lifetime.

00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:47,029
I'm going to talk to you just about four of them.

00:33:47,029 --> 00:33:49,620
Like this.

00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:56,509
How is it that now .1% of the people in the United States own more than the bottom 80%?

00:33:56,509 --> 00:34:00,109
What about this?

00:34:00,109 --> 00:34:05,869
It's inconceivable to me that 400 people owe more than $150 million.

00:34:05,869 --> 00:34:15,990
When did we become more like China and Russia than France and great Britain.

00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:24,750
I feel like the question we need to ask is what happened in 1980?

00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:30,910
This is an idea, a political idea that the market is better at fixing things than the

00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:31,910
government.

00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:32,990
Now this idea is non partisan.

00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:34,740
I want to emphasize that.

00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,740
Right?

00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:41,790
It's been held as a truth under a number of presidents of multiple political parties.

00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:47,230
But I can say now after 40 years of the neoliberalism experiment, there's a lot of data showing

00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:50,879
it has been a disaster for the United States.

00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:56,429
This woman has a new book called "Unbound" which goes through the data in terrifyingly

00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:59,060
readable detail.

00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:05,160
The contention is that markets will self regulate if left to themselves.

00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,930
That unmanaged markets are both fair and more efficient than managed ones.

00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:17,180
And Boushey argues and has data to show that some inefficient unmanaged markets are bad

00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,690
for everyone at every level of wealth.

00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:23,790
It's easy to turn managed markets into unmanaged ones.

00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:27,440
You just have to privatize stuff and let people buy it.

00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:33,350
The problem with that is, it should surprise no one, though it's easy to do, it's very

00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:35,080
hard to take back.

00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:41,030
What happens is those unmanaged markets created super rich elites and those super rich elites

00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:46,820
are quite happy with the current system just as it is.

00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:50,280
They now have the power to keep it this way.

00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,320
Over the last 40 years, a number of things that matter to the majority of us have gone

00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,280
significantly downhill.

00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:01,230
There are far too many examples of this, and I'm going mention just four.

00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:06,390
I'm a class of 75, the product of an excellent K 12 education.

00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,970
My success today started there.

00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:10,020
I went to this high school.

00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,320
It's on the national register of historic places.

00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,030
You could take French, Latin, German, or Spanish.

00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:19,190
They had a world class suite of AP courses.

00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:24,210
I took advance calculus and sang in the best A Capella choir in the United States.

00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:27,060
Those days are gone.

00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:37,410
This is a map where places fall relative to the median of funding for schools.

00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:42,190
You may or may not know that schools are primarily funded through property taxes.

00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:44,750
And we already went through the whole property thing.

00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:51,780
You can imagine that it is inevitable that places where people have not been allowed

00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:55,720
to accumulate wealth have poor schools.

00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:01,850
In Durham, like I said earlier, the city county divide, when schools are desegregated, it

00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:07,990
concentrated poor people in the city and everybody who could afford to buy a house moved to the

00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:10,600
county, so the schools were terrible.

00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,960
I think I have time.

00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,900
My partner does educational evaluation.

00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:22,020
And she was recently in southern Louisiana interviewing teachers about a funding program.

00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,900
So, she was like evaluating a grant.

00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,100
It was raining.

00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:32,640
And they were in a room where the number of drips were causing the buckets to fill up

00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,750
so fast that they had to be emptied during the interview.

00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:40,160
The principal was so embarrassed that they moved them to another room.

00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:46,150
The feature of the other room wasn't that it was dry, it was just that the leaks were

00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,150
slower.

00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,960
They didn't have to empty the buckets.

00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,330
Those kids don't have a chance.

00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:53,830
All right.

00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:55,090
Wages.

00:37:55,090 --> 00:38:01,400
If you break the unions, workers don't have a power workers no longer have the power to

00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,080
bargain for fair wages.

00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,990
This is reflected in minimum wage.

00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:10,990
On this graph, the dark purple is the actual dollar amount of the minimum wage.

00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:15,120
The light purple is its value in today's dollars.

00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,120
Lucky me.

00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:20,330
That's the last time I made minimum wage.

00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:25,100
That's about $10.80 in today's dollars.

00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:31,110
The living wage in Durham is $12.15.

00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:35,130
Two adults making minimum wage would be getting by.

00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:37,430
This is not enough.

00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:41,390
How about health care?

00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:48,720
Canada, which has regulated health care, spends half as much per capita as we do.

00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:53,750
Almost one in ten people in the United States don't even have health insurance.

00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:58,390
Two years ago, my aforementioned partner was diagnosed with breast cancer.

00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:05,660
In that year, we spent, the two of us on premiums, deductibles and co pays spent $30,000 out

00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:10,980
of pocket for treatment that cost about $100,000.

00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:16,720
Remember that the average the median income in the United States is $31,000.

00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,450
Two thirds of all bankruptcies today in the United States are related to medical problems

00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:25,240
either because of outright costs or because of lost wages.

00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,640
Next, yeah.

00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:31,300
I bet this affects some of you still.

00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:35,130
It's hard to get a good job without an education.

00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:41,230
When you start when you quit funding public colleges, what happens is costs go up and

00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:43,810
seats there are fewer seats.

00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:46,020
And so getting into those colleges is harder.

00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:51,280
At that point, you get privatization of schools, which means you get for profit colleges and

00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,660
students borrowing enormous amounts of money.

00:39:54,660 --> 00:40:00,400
That money is, by the way, insured by your tax dollars against default.

00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,640
A well educated population improves life for everyone, but getting a degree today often

00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,020
means taking on crippling debt.

00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:13,600
I borrowed money when I was in school back in 1978.

00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,600
It was a real amount.

00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,600
It mattered.

00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,160
It was so small that I don't even remember it now.

00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,970
I paid it off over a time period that I can't even recall.

00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:26,050
All I can tell you is I bought a house in 1980 when I was paying on that student loan,

00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:28,240
so it couldn't have been that bad.

00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:33,930
Today, almost a quarter of the people a quarter of the adults under 60 in the United States

00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:38,830
have some form of student loan debt and they're paying that debt rather than buying property

00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:42,580
and accumulating wealth.

00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:47,130
So the history of housing in America makes it clear that the dream was never available

00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:48,200
to everyone.

00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:53,040
But over the last 40 years, it has moved out of reach for almost anyone.

00:40:53,040 --> 00:41:00,890
We have increasingly become a society of winners and losers, and the winners I practiced this

00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:05,340
name so many times and I knew I would screw it up.

00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,740
Anand writes, "winner take all."

00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:14,860
The elite, many of them are in tech.

00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:22,090
The super rich have piles of money, and with piles of something, you begin to believe that

00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:25,300
you deserve it, that you earned it.

00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:30,390
If you're super rich, you must also be super capable and super smart and super good at

00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:31,390
everything.

00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:37,050
And it becomes easy, maybe even necessary to discount the enormous role played by luck

00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:40,000
and opportunity in your success.

00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:47,020
This, by the way, is how a guy like Howard Schultz, the CEO of Starbucks decides that

00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:53,580
coffee thing turned out so well, I'll just be president.

00:41:53,580 --> 00:42:02,610
Folks in the top tier donate sums of money to charitable organizations.

00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:07,700
But generally they don't use the power and influence to champion systemic change that

00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,200
would turn have notes into haves.

00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:14,950
It is suggested that we don't need the rich to fund special programs to give teachers

00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:16,390
extra pay.

00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:23,660
Instead we need them to fund programs to teach those teachers how to organize.

00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:27,680
Public education funding is broken and the people whose job it is to do it know how to

00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,700
fix it and they're the people who should be in charge of that.

00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:36,750
The super rich are fine with doing good but resist the idea that they should instead do

00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:39,430
less harm.

00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:44,170
We have the powerful fighting to change the world in ways that essentially keep it the

00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:48,970
same or possibly make it worse.

00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:54,540
There's been a huge pour shift in America in my lifetime.

00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:58,080
Are we ready to hand over the future to the elite?

00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:02,920
One supposedly world changing initiative at a time?

00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:10,350
Or is meaningful democracy in which we all potentially have a voice worth fighting for?

00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:13,230
I'm almost done.

00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:17,970
I can't help but wonder if you're relieved.

00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:23,420
I promise you my original intent was to make a cheerful talk about how lucky I am.

00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,670
But look what I found out.

00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:29,330
I picked up the rock.

00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:37,580
I was following this line from all of this information that I showed you, many things

00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:45,060
I haven't even talked to you about, I could hear myself saying, "it's not my fault.

00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:49,940
It wasn't me that caused this."

00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:55,160
The truth is that I am a woman of a certain age, which means in real life that I am someone

00:43:55,160 --> 00:44:03,770
to whom you could legitimately say, "Okay, boomer," and I thought that I was just hard

00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:05,120
working and lucky.

00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:10,670
But it turns out that for my entire life, I have been surfing what may be the final

00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:15,210
crest of the last wave of the American dream.

00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:19,280
I didn't act to turn this into a place where a few people make piles of money and lots

00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:30,970
of folks get thrown into jail, get evicted, lose everything if they get sick and live

00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:36,680
in a world that is both drowning and on fire.

00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,540
I didn't act to do it.

00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:44,850
But I stood by and let it happen.

00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:52,420
I feel the need to beg your most humble pardon for the world we're leaving you.

00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:53,480
Sorry...

00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:57,770
And it wasn't your fault.

00:44:57,770 --> 00:44:59,390
But it's on you to fix it.

00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:03,980
So, what should you do?

00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:05,850
First of all, pay attention to your complicity.

00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:08,260
It's a frickin' eye opener.

00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:09,820
Own it.

00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,390
Admit it.

00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:13,740
Next, give back.

00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,560
I have upped my charitable giving.

00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:18,050
You've got money, give some away.

00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:20,940
Do the best tech you can.

00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:26,780
These things are all working on the symptoms.

00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:28,230
We need to work on the cause.

00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:30,530
You got to think bigger.

00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:38,320
We need solutions that are public, Democratic, universal, and institutional.

00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:42,580
If you were born after 1980, which many of you were, you probably don't remember a time

00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:45,410
when government was well thought of.

00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:49,550
You spent your whole life there was an ad campaign, you have been listening to the neoliberals

00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:53,840
quote Ronald Reagan saying the scariest words in the English language is I'm from the federal

00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:58,780
government and I'm here to help.

00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:02,530
There are much scarier things.

00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:06,640
In a democracy, you are the government.

00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,900
We need a tax code that fixes the wealth gap and saves the middle class.

00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:14,700
We need federal housing programs that give everyone a shot at ownership.

00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:21,710
We need to deal with our history as a slave nation and think about reparations.

00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:28,940
We need empowered workers that can bring balance to this low road form of capitalism, and we

00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:33,310
need to stop climate change.

00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:40,320
You are the smartest and the brightest and the best.

00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,990
And the most amply rewarded.

00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:48,980
I just you more than anyone to transform the system into something that works for us all.

00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,730
And this is not gonna happen by itself.

00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:53,329
So, you need to get to work.

00:46:53,329 --> 00:46:53,730
