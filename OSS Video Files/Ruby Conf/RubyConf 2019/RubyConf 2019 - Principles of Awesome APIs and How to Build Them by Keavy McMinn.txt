	RubyConf 2019 - Principles of Awesome APIs and How to Build Them by Keavy McMinn

We know the theory of what makes for a good API: it should be consistent, stable, and well documented. However, when we struggle to put good principles into practice, the API becomes difficult for your teammates and frustrating for your users. So, how do we pragmatically implement APIs in line with good principles? In particular, how do we get a bundle of engineers to do this together?

This is a talk for those curious about designing, building, and maintaining modern APIs. We’ll look at specific tooling and strategies to help improve and maintain the quality, consistency, and stability of your API. You’ll learn how to proactively make improvements to these areas, and how to make it easier to shepherd API development in your company.
