	RubyConf 2019 - Sorbet: A type checker for Ruby 3 you can use today! by Jake Zimmerman & Dmitry Petrashko

In June we open-sourced Sorbet, a fast, powerful type checker designed for Ruby. In the 6 months since, tons of things have improved! We’ve built quality editor tools like jump-to-def and seen many contributions from a growing community. Within Stripe, we've used Sorbet to drive code quality via measurable, concrete indicators.

We’ll share these improvements and give an update on our collaboration with Matz and the Ruby 3 Types working group. Suitable for anyone using Ruby—no familiarity with Sorbet needed! Come follow in the footsteps of the many companies already using Sorbet.
