>> How are you all doing? How was your morning? [ Applause ]

00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:14,650
Oh my gosh, here we are. All right. Okay. So, here's what I'm gonna do. This is my last

00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:15,842
bit of encouragement. If you in the back, I know many of you have stubbornly stapled

00:00:15,842 --> 00:00:16,842
your butt to the chair, but if you haven't done that yet and you're willing to move forward,

00:00:16,842 --> 00:00:17,842
that's totally cool. You're not guaranteed to be called on for anything. I know that's

00:00:17,842 --> 00:00:18,842
your number one fear. I will not call on you for anything.

00:00:18,842 --> 00:00:19,842
[ Laughter ] Okay. So, all right. So, here is where we're

00:00:19,842 --> 00:00:20,842
at. So, we are basically at time. So, I want to introduce the team to my right, your left.

00:00:20,842 --> 00:00:21,842
So, this is third coast comedy. They're based here right in Nashville. We brought them because

00:00:21,842 --> 00:00:22,842
we thought it would be a lot of fun to have an improv troupe come here and entertain you

00:00:22,842 --> 00:00:23,842
all and engage with you for a little bit, about half an hour or so. So, without further

00:00:23,842 --> 00:00:24,842
ado, I would like to introduce third coast comedy.

00:00:24,842 --> 00:00:25,842
[ Applause ]

00:00:25,842 --> 00:00:28,890
>> Thank you so much for coming out and seeing us today. We are going to be doing improv,

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,880
which means everything you're about to see for the next half hour is going to be completely

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,090
made up on the spot with the help of your suggestions. So, we'll be coming to you throughout

00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:41,010
the afternoon for those suggestions. On the count of three, I want to get to know each

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:47,079
other better. Everyone shout your name out on the count of three. One, two, three. Fantastic.

00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:53,659
Hello, Phil. I think I heard that. Allison, tell us about the first thing we will be doing.

00:00:53,659 --> 00:01:00,670
>> Let me get a round of applause from anyone who has seen a play before. How many of you

00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:08,030
have seen a play? Awesome, awesome. And how about a round of applause for anyone who has

00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,560
actually written a play before. All right. Cool!

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:19,490
>> Got em! >> Sweet! What was the name of your play?

00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:23,010
It was a long time ago. That's a great name. [ Laughter ]

00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:28,430
So, what we're going to do today is we're actually going to write a play. The but first

00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:34,670
thing's first, we have to get our improvisers out of here. So, I need one person to stand

00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:39,490
up and go outside with our improvisers that we're going to send out to make sure they

00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:43,700
can't hear what we're talking about. So, on the count of three, we're going to tell our

00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,190
improvisers to get out of here. Ready? One, two, three.

00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:51,760
Get out of here! >> It's like a long road...

00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:57,630
So if I could have one person step outside and make sure they don't hear what we're talking

00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,610
about. >> We got one.

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:07,270
>> Perfect. So, I'm gonna need some suggestions from y'all once they leave. So, what I need

00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:21,010
first is some of your favorite song lyrics. So, for instance, mine would be hit me baby

00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:28,260
one more time. Or oops I did it again. So shout out some of your favorite song lyrics.

00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:43,780
Twist and shout. Pour some sugar on me. Okay. Say that again, sir? Confusion will be my

00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:55,519
epitaph? What? Okay. And how about some of your favorite movie quotes like I'll be back

00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:03,010
or you can't handle the truth. >> Hold on to your butts!

00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:08,110
>> Hold on to your butts. There's a beverage here, man.

00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:15,299
>> The dude abides. >> One more. Say that again? You with the

00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:22,209
glasses? Aim for the bushes? Aim for the bushes. Excellent. Y'all are doing great. So, what

00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:28,959
I now need are some physical activities like something that you want to see our improvisers

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:41,049
do, like doing burpees or high fiving or... chopping wood. Okay. But, we want like some

00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:46,499
sort of emotion to go with chopping wood. So, how would you not normally chop wood?

00:03:46,499 --> 00:03:51,590
What's an emotion? Romantically chopping wood. Excellent. All right!

00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:59,169
So give me another physical activity you'd like to see them do. Roller skate? Did you

00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:08,599
say roller skate? Random cascades? Round house kicks! Okay. Awesome. So, how do we want to

00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:14,749
see them do these? What emotion? Curiously. Okay. Very good. Curiously doing roundhouse

00:04:14,749 --> 00:04:22,040
kicks. How about one more physical activity? Mowing the lawn. And what's the emotion that

00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:30,970
we want to see them do that? Sadly mowing the lawn. Awesome. All right. So, let's bring

00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,300
our improvisers back in here.

00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,900
One, two, three. Come back in here! Excellent. Yeah yeah. Give them a round of applause.

00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:52,520
[ Applause ] The last thing I need from y'all is a title

00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,460
of this play that's never been written before. What's the title of this play.

00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:06,919
>> Can we hear it for Ann? Verify we didn't hear anything. Let's hear it for Ann, everyone!

00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:07,919
[ Applause ]

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:13,189
>> It was a long time ago. Thank you very much.

00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:19,099
[ Laughter ] Everyone, I now give you the opening and closing

00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:27,919
of "It was a long time ago...." >> It's good to see you after all of these

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,050
years. >> I suppose it is.

00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:36,710
>> You look the exact same as the night I broke your heart.

00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:45,930
>> Thank you. I've worked very hard. >> Let me see the back of your head. Sorry.

00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:52,560
That was too >> What's gotten into you? We don't have that

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,621
kind of relationship. >> I have been getting more physical. You

00:05:56,621 --> 00:06:01,050
didn't like me when we were together. I have been taking karate.

00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,451
>> Twist and shout. Twist and shout. >> Okay. High ya. Is what that you want?

00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:15,149
>> It is what I want. >> Well, I still want a baby! I mean, pour

00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:22,069
some sugar on me. >> No! No. I gave you up. I quit you, and

00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:25,310
I can't have you back. >> All right. Don't twist it. I broke your

00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:31,910
heart. >> Aim for the bushes, buster!

00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,020
>> Is this what you want? You want me to kiss your vegetation?

00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,690
>> That's right. >> Oh yeah?

00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:43,490
>> That's right. >> Okay. I'm gonna take care of all your vegetation.

00:06:43,490 --> 00:07:00,099
>> What are you doing? What are you doing?! [ Laughter ]

00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:01,099
[ Crying... ] [ Applause ]

00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:04,530
>> All right! We've got you guys have been hearing a lot of keynotes and stuff with experts.

00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:10,490
We've got a panel of experts here that we've brought to this conference to answer any questions

00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:16,620
you have about anything in life. This is your chance to ask and receive those answers. We've

00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,370
got three amazing panelists today. I'm gonna let them introduce themselves before we start

00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:23,179
the Q&A. So, if you could tell us a bit about yourself.

00:07:23,179 --> 00:07:29,179
>> Sure. I am Kyle Williams. I'm a mid 2000s block buster manager.

00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:50,199
>> My name is Edith. I collect Faberge eggs. >> My name's Wyatt. I just finished my sophomore

00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:59,100
year at ball state. Go balls. I've just finished dropping out of econ and I finished one semester

00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,770
of CSS, and I think I'm going to drop that, too.

00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:08,591
>> Let's hear it for our panel of experts. Who has a question they've always wanted to

00:08:08,591 --> 00:08:15,139
know the answer to, like what is the meaning of life? What happens after death? Or...

00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:17,220
>> Who is God? >> Who is God. We'll start with the first

00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,999
expert over here. Who is God? >> Sure, um, well, a number of different Gods.

00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:28,180
Morgan Freeman has often played a lot of God characters. But really, I'm gonna have to

00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:34,500
say God is the big budget companies and studios that are sort of taking over. I don't want

00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,580
to go on a rant about independent movies, but I think they're playing God with a lot

00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:53,310
of their takeover of artistic endeavor. >> Thank you. Great answer. Yes. Edith, is

00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,170
that right? >> Chanel.

00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,949
>> Fantastic. And Wyatt?

00:08:57,949 --> 00:09:05,470
>> This has been beaten into me, Adam Dithers, the founding father of pike. He was the first

00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:11,360
one to create can test banks, and that has been the savior unto us all ever since.

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,800
>> Fantastic. A good answer. Does anyone have any relationship advice they need or any personal

00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,770
life advice? Yes. >> Yeah, I just want to know which machine

00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:28,680
to use to impress the most ladies when I go to the gym.

00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,950
>> What machine to use to impress the most ladies when you go to the gym, a question

00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:39,570
we all want to know the answer to. >> I'm gonna speculate on what a gym is here

00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,779
really quick. [ Laughter ]

00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:45,410
I've seen those ellipticals and they seem like a lot of fun. But if we're getting to

00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:51,670
the best machine, it's Blu Ray, these days, folks. You've got to go...

00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:58,749
>> Edith? >> And Wyatt?

00:09:58,749 --> 00:10:06,120
>> This is an excellent question. Thank you so much for asking it. If you were trying

00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:12,370
to get the biggest, you should go for the if you're trying to impress the ladies, the

00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:18,420
biggest machine that is easiest. Leg press. Ten times out of ten.

00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:24,220
>> We've got time for one or two more. Any other questions? Thanksgiving is coming up.

00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,499
Any questions about Thanksgiving or family or holidays? Yes, sir?

00:10:28,499 --> 00:10:35,590
>> I have two teenagers, like what the fuck? [ Laughter ]

00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:42,579
>> I've got two teenagers, like what the fuck? >> Yeah, they just don't seem to appreciate

00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:46,370
anything any more, do they? You know? They just want everything instantly and in the

00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:51,740
palm of their hands and they don't know how to spend time walking up and down aisles really

00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:57,900
selecting one or two things that they really want to examine for two days at a time, you

00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,560
know? [ Laughter ]

00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,240
>> Boarding school. >> Yep.

00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:11,330
>> Yeah, I totally feel you on that one, man. Last week my girlfriend, Daphne told me we

00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:15,570
were about to have two teenagers and I too was like what the fuck?

00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,570
[ Applause ]

00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:25,620
>> Let's have it for our panel of experts. >> For the next thing that we would like to

00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:31,140
do for you, we are going to need two volunteers from out there amongst all of you. Do I have

00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:36,570
any two volunteers? You will not have to say anything. Keep that in mind. I see one here

00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:41,360
in the middle. Let's give a round of applause. And I see another in the middle. And we will

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,070
clap as they are coming to the stage, and I have two performers that will be performing

00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:50,730
with us. And we'll keep the clapping going. It's taking a little while to get down here.

00:11:50,730 --> 00:12:01,329
Hello, and your name is? Dion. And what is your name? Monica. Monica and Dion. All right.

00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:11,431
Well, Monica, you will be pair with Luke, and you will be paired with Allison. They

00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:15,341
will not be able to move their own bodies. They can speak. They will do all of their

00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:19,300
own speaking but they cannot physically move their bodies. If they need to move their arms,

00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:24,660
you will do that for them and they will keep that position until you feel they need to

00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:30,500
go somewhere else. If they need to walk, you will do so by tapping the back of their legs.

00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:37,260
Two taps, two taps. If you need to make them back up, back them up this way. And to be

00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,009
clear, you've got to move everything. So, if they have to look at each other, we're

00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:47,620
going to move Luke's head this way and move it back. Very good. And yes. Please be gentle

00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:53,459
with them. We have shows this weekend. Other than that, may I have your consent? Shake

00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:59,240
hands. Consent here? Very good. And so the last thing we need to get this scene going

00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,350
is can I get a relationship that's not family, so not brother and sister?

00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:08,640
>> Student teacher. >> A student and teacher. Thank you.

00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:24,040
>> Ah. You're not doing so well. >> Yeah. I kind of just stopped trying.

00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,800
>> I can tell. Everything >> I'm keeping myself guarded. I don't want

00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,589
too much knowledge at one time. >> Well

00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:37,249
>> Knowledge is dangerous. >> Knowledge is also ope.

00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:40,500
>> Knowledge is what? >> Knowledge is ow power.

00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:48,420
>> Look at you. You're so frail. You're the smartest person I know and I don't know if

00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:54,920
I want to be like you. There I said it! I can't even bear to look at you right now.

00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,459
>> I'm 107! >> Yeah. I don't want to live that long.

00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:06,459
>> Well, I don't either. I have been trying to end it for 47 years.

00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:16,970
>> Let me help you. Please. It's the one thing I did learn is how to end a life... in your

00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:24,089
biology class, you've made me kill 17 frogs. I get it! I'm gonna put you in a big mason

00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:29,352
jar. >> That's what I want. Just for everybody

00:14:29,352 --> 00:14:36,250
>> I have a mason jar right here that's just the size! It's gonna be maybe a little bigger.

00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:44,670
But I'll smush you in there. Oh, I found a bigger one! Oh, I found the one.

00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,470
>> I'm too afraid to look. >> Take a glance. Ope. You're almost inside

00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:51,899
the mason jar. Oh my. >> Oh, it's like a cage. A clear cage.

00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:55,250
>> It's a glass cage. >> I just want to dive right in.

00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,649
>> All right, I got you! [ Applause ]

00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:14,709
>> Let's hear it for our volunteers! All right, for this next piece, we need two volunteers

00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:20,490
that are willing to let us use your phone. We will be reading one text thread, and one

00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:24,910
text thread only, and we will be reading it out loud, but we will not go to any other

00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:30,890
text threads. Does anyone have a group text message thread or a good, juicy text message

00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:36,100
thread? Once you pull it up, we will not go to anything else on your phone, but we will

00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:42,589
be reading those texts on this stage. He's got his phone out. What other reason could

00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:49,850
you have your phone out? Let's hear it for this gentleman. You got it pulled up here?

00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:55,470
Okay! We're gonna do you have one that has a little bit more than one text on it?

00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:02,990
[ Laughter ] is Can we read German? We'll try it. While he's

00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:07,940
pulling up a German yes. Thank you, sir. >> All right. You've got it pulled up to the

00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:12,769
one thread? We will not go anywhere else. We have the German thread coming. Here's a

00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:19,779
thread for you. Keep that one moving. All right. Is this in German?

00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:25,600
>> Let me check... no! >> All right. We'll figure it out.

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,019
>> Do something. >> Yep. Sure is. There's the German phone.

00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:38,560
We've never done it in another language. She is only speak in German, and Mike can only

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,170
say the messages on his phone, and Bill is free to say whatever he would like to say

00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:47,649
in this scene. So, their lines are coming from the phone, Bill's lines are coming from

00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:57,170
his brain. What is a non geographical location. Like a subway platform or an attic? A saloon!

00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:06,740
Saloon. Thank you. >> Howdy there partner.

00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:13,429
>> It looks like my 40th birthday party will be happening Saturday evening, December 21st.

00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:23,809
>> 40th birthday party, Saturday evening. >> 25.

00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:30,419
>> 21st. >> [ Speaking German ]

00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:41,380
>> We don't get too many German speakers around these parts. How are you, partner?

00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:49,110
>> [ Speaking German ]. >> Glad. Glad. You've got to come!

00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:55,270
>> Okay. So, are we just gonna ignore that maybe I could have been invited to the party

00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,379
or that we could have a party right here right now.

00:17:57,379 --> 00:18:01,530
>> Love you, love you. >> Thank you, thank you. Is it so hard to

00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:06,220
give your bartender a little appreciation now and then?

00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:12,940
>> [ Speaking German ]. >> I think we're out of that, to be honest.

00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:21,340
I can get you a pilsner. >> [ Speaking German ].

00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:28,960
>> Are you guys gonna be up in portland in the area around Christmas time?

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:36,159
>> [ Yelling German ]. >> You've got to come.

00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:40,940
>> You're talking about the westword territory, aren't you? I heard that they got gold in

00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:45,640
them there hills. >> Home in Portland, safe and sound.

00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:54,750
>> Gold, hitting it rich, ditching this old saloon life. I want to relax on a pine tree.

00:18:54,750 --> 00:19:01,690
>> [ Speaking German ]. >> Yeah. A pine tree.

00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:12,010
>> You have got to come! >> Let's hear it for our team! Thank you so

00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:19,809
much, volunteers! >> All right. So, for this next piece, we

00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:24,710
we need another two volunteers, again, nothing scary. Just two volunteers to come up and

00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:33,550
help our actors with their next scene... I see one hand in the back, and I see another

00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:37,370
one. >> Let's hear it for the volunteers.

00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,370
[ Applause ]

00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:43,800
>> Wait. I just realized that >> CAPTIONER: Don't mess with me.

00:19:43,800 --> 00:20:00,059
>> That's amazing. >> We've got Sarah over here. If you want

00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:07,000
to go to this microphone over here. And John? You will be at this mic right here. Bill and

00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,030
Luke are going to be doing a scene. During this scene, you guys can help them out by

00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:19,270
making sound effects. They can be anything. There is no wrong choice. But, like, for instance,

00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:24,710
if Luke were to say I'm going to open a coke, you might say...

00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:34,980
Very good. And if at any point, Allison or Mike get the inspiration to join in the fun,

00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:41,029
they may as well. Can I get a suggestion of a location that may roughly fit on the size

00:20:41,029 --> 00:21:01,259
of this stage? An airplane? Awesome. Thank you.

00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:16,960
>> Please be careful. My bag is already up there. And my dog is already up there... yeah.

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:25,470
That's a Yorkshire terrier. He hates to be pet. Really weird dog trait, but hates being

00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:37,289
pet. >> Soft ceiling. I'm used to it. Delta comfort

00:21:37,289 --> 00:21:40,150
section. >> Yeah. My favorite part about the comfort

00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:44,809
section >> I love their seat belts.

00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:49,789
>> You know when you're safe. >> Uh huh.

00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:56,290
>> I think I'm going to call for a little cocktail before we get started here. That's

00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,110
fun. >> Sorry.

00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:06,490
>> You can undo it and do it again. >> I think I'll have a little cocktail, too.

00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:13,430
It's 7:30 a.m. >> It's about time. We are about to fly delta.

00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:22,500
Admittedly in the comfort section. >> I'm sorry. Did you just break wind?

00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:29,490
>> You can't talk to delta employees. >> That was flagrant and needed a response.

00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:42,360
>> I'll show you how it's done. >> Sorry. I'm allergic to dogs. I forgot to

00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,370
tell you. [ Yelling ].

00:22:46,370 --> 00:23:00,010
>> My can of coke I was holding in my other hand! That was closed. Ah.

00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:09,330
>> That's okay. He loves coke. Hey, boy, here here here.

00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:11,519
>> My football I was carrying in my other hand.

00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:16,500
>> Let's hear it for our volunteers!

00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:25,220
>> All right. Ladies and gentlemen, we have one more piece planned for you this afternoon,

00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:29,320
and we're gonna mix things up. Is it gonna get weird if I talk into two microphones at

00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:37,390
once? Is this weird? Sounds cool. Visually weird. You know what? Let's just use ours.

00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:41,480
I don't think this goes very far. We have been doing improv for you and we will continue

00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,791
to do improvisation for you. But first we want to indulge what everybody's fantasy is,

00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:54,570
which is be a stand up comedian. We're going to make it happen, totally improvised and

00:23:54,570 --> 00:24:02,280
based on suggestions for you. We will come to you and get suggestions and then hit you

00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:15,180
with a one liner. Let's do a non sexual object, something like a spatula. Germany? Okay. I

00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:21,500
haven't often heard of Germany the object, but I'm curious to see what happens. Great.

00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,650
>> Germany. >> Yeah, Germany, yeah.

00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:32,580
>> 185 Germanys walk into a bar and the bartender serves them a couple drinks and they all ask,

00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:41,650
you got anything to munch? That's German, right?

00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:49,159
>> 185 Germanys walk into a bar. Everybody gets quiet and 185 Germans say we're very

00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:55,409
different now. >> 185 Germans and a girl named Lynn walk

00:24:55,409 --> 00:25:01,830
into a bar and the bartender serves them some really cold drinks and they all go brrr Lynn?

00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:16,270
>> With we get another suggestion of anything at all? Boats. Thank you.

00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:20,809
>> Boats. >> Mmmm mm...

00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:27,410
>> 185 boats walk into a bar and I might add that this is a very plane looking bar, because

00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:35,649
when they arrive, they are all immediately star bored. Ha ha ha.

00:25:35,649 --> 00:25:41,270
>> We're going to do it in the form of I like my blank like I I like my men and women like

00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:51,309
I like my blank. Any object? Another non sexual object? A poncho.

00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:59,029
>> I like my men just like I like my ponchos, all over me.

00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:05,610
>> I like my men like I like my ponchos, just save them for a rainy day.

00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:12,560
>> I like my women like I like my ponchos. My mom always reminds me, I should pack one.

00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:20,330
>> I like my women like I like my ponchos. I just pick one up at Walmart when I get there.

00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:26,299
>> Let's get an occupation you don't think we've heard for a while. Doctor or teacher?

00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:44,730
A boil? A boil. A boil... >> I like my men like I like my boils... I

00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:51,129
don't think I was gonna say 98 degrees, but I don't think that's boiling temperature.

00:26:51,129 --> 00:26:56,820
[ Laughter ] >> I like my women like I like my boils. I've

00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:03,140
never had one. >> I like my women like I like my boils. Very

00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:06,260
smart, very deep. Three layers, and hard to get rid of.

00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:16,889
>> Let's get another occupation or object. A chimney sweep.

00:27:16,889 --> 00:27:21,809
>> I like my men like I like my chimney sweeps. They're good at going up or down...

00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:27,529
[ Laughter ] >> I like my women like I like my chimney

00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:36,399
sweeps, Oliver me... >> I like my women like I like my chimney

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:46,330
sweeps British and born in the 1920s. >> Let's I think we got time for one more.

00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:49,179
Object or occupation. >> Web developer.

00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:53,900
>> Oh, we got to be careful. >> I like my men and women and those who don't

00:27:53,900 --> 00:28:02,760
identify just like I like my web identifiers, cool ass people!

00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:11,770
>> All right. I'm gonna go for it. I like my women like I like my web developers. They're

00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:32,041
cool with front end and back end. >> And that's our show. Thank you so much.

00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:33,041
Enjoy the rest of RubyConf.

00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:34,041
[ Applause ]

00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:35,580
>> Well, thank you all so very, very much for coming. Again, another round of applause
