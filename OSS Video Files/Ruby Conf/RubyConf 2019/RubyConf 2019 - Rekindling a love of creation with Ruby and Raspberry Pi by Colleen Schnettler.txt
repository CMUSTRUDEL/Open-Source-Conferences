	RubyConf 2019 - Rekindling a love of creation with Ruby and Raspberry Pi by Colleen Schnettler

Does your life and work as a software developer ever leave you feeling depleted? Have you lost your inspiration to create? Do you want to share your love of software and design with your children but don't know how? Well, fortunately if you already know Ruby it is a short leap to building physical devices with the Raspberry pi! This talk will give a detailed explanation on how to get started on the Pi with Ruby, and outline a few fun projects you can build with your children (or just yourself) to explore your love of software and hardware. This talk will also cover basic electronics (don't be scared of the breadboard), and show you how to build a whoopie cushion prank with some paper plates and your Pi. Leave feeling inspired to create something fun!
