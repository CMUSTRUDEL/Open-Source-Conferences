	RubyConf 2019 - Rekindling a love of creation with Ruby and Raspberry Pi by Colleen Schnettler

Does your life and work as a software developer ever leave you feeling depleted? Have you lost your inspiration to create? Do you want to share your love of software and design with your children but don't know how? Well, fortunately if you already know Ruby it is a short leap to building physical devices with the Raspberry pi! This talk will give a detailed explanation on how to get started on the Pi with Ruby, and outline a few fun projects you can build with your children (or just yourself) to explore your love of software and hardware. This talk will also cover basic electronics (don't be scared of the breadboard), and show you how to build a whoopie cushion prank with some paper plates and your Pi. Leave feeling inspired to create something fun!

[Music]

00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:18,570
hello everyone hello thank you sir very

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,930
loud thank you so much for coming to my

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,940
talk my name is Colleen schneller and I

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,820
am a Ruby on Rails developer and

00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,410
consultant you can find me on Twitter as

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,869
the Leaney burger

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,179
I run a rails consultancy called bitmap

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:35,670
design Pro tip don't name your

00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:38,399
consultancy bitmap designs because no

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:42,179
one can spell that and today I want to

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:45,359
talk to you about energy and happiness

00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:48,299
and creation we're also gonna talk a

00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:50,729
little bit about electronics and family

00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:52,920
so I'm going to attempt to cover the

00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:58,519
entire human emotional spectrum so wish

00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:01,049
me luck so I want everyone to think back

00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:02,879
think back about when you got into

00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:05,970
software development whether it was six

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,970
months ago or 20 years ago what brought

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,470
you into software development like

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:14,400
really take a minute and just think

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:17,850
about it so I have been thinking about

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,910
this question recently and some things

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:23,850
came to mind for me such as like

00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:26,630
creating something you know more

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:30,870
ambitious things like changing the world

00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:33,570
having control over my own destiny in my

00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:35,190
own career and of course you know making

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,370
money who was always important to me as

00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:40,350
well but I think the main reason I got

00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:44,520
into engineering we caught it was

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:46,230
because I really loved math and I've

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,650
always loved math that was really good

00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:51,630
at it and I was gonna be a math major

00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:53,280
but I discovered engineering and I

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,890
decided to become an engineer because I

00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:00,120
realized it seemed to be a better way to

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:03,120
kind of met mold physics and math and

00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:07,020
like practicality and actually build

00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:09,420
something so I went to Purdue University

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:12,200
and I studied Electrical Engineering and

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:15,659
I had a wonderful four years

00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:18,330
University and you know it was this

00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:21,450
amazing culture of like really believing

00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:23,489
we could change the world we were

00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:28,040
learning the skills that were gonna

00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:30,540
impact people all over the world and

00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,849
because we were software engineers like

00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:39,390
the things we do have a direct impact on

00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:44,099
mankind so I graduated college with all

00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:46,530
of my idealism and ambition and I got

00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:49,739
what was at the time my dream job and

00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:52,200
that was a job at NASA in the robotics

00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:55,019
laboratory so I was working in the

00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,859
robotics laboratory on actually the

00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:59,670
motors

00:02:55,859 --> 00:03:01,859
this is Robonaut which is a robot and um

00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:04,079
I was working in the lab on the motors

00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:06,359
that controlled the fingers this was

00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:11,940
like a really exciting fun place to be

00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:14,640
very research focused but you know there

00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,530
was this disconnect between what I

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,829
thought I would be doing as an engineer

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:21,930
and what I was actually doing at a very

00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:24,150
large organisation and so one of the

00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:26,489
reasons I really got into engineering

00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:29,069
was that scene in Apollo 13 the Tom

00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:31,139
Hanks movie there's this scene where the

00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:33,060
guys are up you know about to die and

00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:34,260
they get the engineers in a room and

00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,470
they're like you have to make this

00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:39,450
square peg fit into this round hole with

00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,889
this duct tape whatever it is I don't

00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,060
remember the details but it was

00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:45,269
something like that like you have this

00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:48,060
time constrain really exciting thing and

00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:50,519
it's gonna directly impact like the

00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,980
future and so that's the kind of thing I

00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,919
thought I'd be doing as an engineer like

00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,449
solving problems and and you know

00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:00,510
publishing that stuff and like putting

00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:03,000
that stuff out in the world and the

00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:07,220
thing about working for a very large

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,109
organization was I was unprepared for

00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,639
the level of bureaucracy and to be fair

00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:14,000
I was there at a very bad time because

00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:18,389
Columbia had crashed within a few years

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,770
so there was just a lot of meetings lots

00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:25,860
and lots of meetings and decision making

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,840
was very slow and it felt like as some

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:31,259
who wanted to build something and like

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,120
was excited it felt very very

00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:34,560
challenging to really make any progress

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,599
because you do something you'd have a

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,889
great idea and you'd have to like have

00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:44,340
five meetings you know to even get an OK

00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:47,340
you can try doing that so like my

00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:49,500
enthusiasm and like my idealism just

00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:52,740
kind of dimmed a little bit during my

00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:55,469
time there so let's fast forward to

00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,810
today like fifteen years later I'm sure

00:04:55,469 --> 00:05:02,250
like many of you my career has taken a

00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:06,270
many twists and many turns but now I'm a

00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:08,400
consultant as I mentioned and to me I'm

00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:09,960
living my dream again so my life has

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,969
changed and I have been able to find

00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,520
this career as a rails developer that

00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:17,009
really fits well into my life like I'm

00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,080
doing something I love I get to do it on

00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:22,080
my own time in a remote flexible

00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:25,319
environment it's great but I noticed

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,960
like about a year ago maybe I was really

00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:31,379
having a hard time tapping into that

00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:34,469
energy I had when I was 22 and you know

00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:36,270
maybe it's because I'm not 22 but um I'd

00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:38,400
like to believe that that's not the only

00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:41,580
reason you know life is different now

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,440
and it's busier and I have children but

00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:47,810
man I was just kind of feeling blah and

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:50,339
work and I missed that kind of like

00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:52,229
idealism like that energy to really do

00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:54,779
something like hopefully at some point

00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:56,520
in your career or your life you have

00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:59,400
been able to tap into like that energy

00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,409
of like the possibility of change and I

00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:05,610
just wasn't feeling it and I was really

00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:10,680
missing it and I think part of it might

00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:14,610
just be the like daily monotony a little

00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:17,060
bit of work and the frustration of

00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:20,099
meetings like the annoyance of tech debt

00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:22,379
or you know bad code boring work and

00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:24,089
everything else we have to do sometimes

00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:29,819
you know they call it work for a reason

00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:31,550
as engineers so that got me thinking why

00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:33,990
are so many software engineers engineers

00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:36,060
dealing with burnout and this is not a

00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,149
talk about burnout but I think this is

00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,840
kind of relevant to our discussion today

00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:41,790
so

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,110
I almost everyone I know in this field

00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:46,620
after they've been in it for a couple

00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:49,110
year years has dealt with some kind of

00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:52,380
burnout and it appears in different

00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:54,360
forms but ultimately I think one of the

00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,669
problems is a lack of enthusiasm like a

00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,160
lack of creativity and this lack of

00:06:56,669 --> 00:07:01,440
ability to just do something for fun in

00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:04,380
our field we have all of this pressure

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,900
to work all day and then to have a side

00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:09,120
project that we monetize and to have a

00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,290
blog and have a YouTube channel or

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,060
whatever it is I feel like there's a lot

00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:14,790
of pressure in our industry to work

00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:18,690
beyond like kind of a normal working a

00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:19,860
normal working day and you know so I do

00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:21,690
think some of that stress is

00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,600
self-created but you know it is what it

00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:27,630
is so I was trying to think of a fun way

00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:31,740
to like fight that and to rekindle that

00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:35,340
energy and so I decided that I wanted to

00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:37,200
just create something for fun no other

00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,180
reason I'm not going to sell it I'm not

00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,970
gonna do YouTube tutorials on it like

00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:45,660
it's just gonna be something fun like

00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:46,919
remember how to have fun and so I threw

00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,570
it out to my kids I have three children

00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:50,760
they're three six and eight and my

00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:54,570
eight-year-old has shown a real interest

00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:57,450
in robotics and and programming so I

00:07:54,570 --> 00:08:01,310
threw it out to my children and my son

00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:04,710
was like hey let's build a robot and I

00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:07,110
was like sure let's first get an LED

00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:09,660
blinking then we'll talk about building

00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:12,539
a robot but the cool thing about

00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,580
children if you have children you know

00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:18,720
this if you know children you know this

00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:21,270
they have this like like sense of like

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,760
nothing is impossible they just create

00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:25,860
things to create them without feeling

00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,810
the judgment we as adults feel they just

00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,700
build things they color things they're

00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:32,099
terrible they don't care they just put

00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:35,490
it out in the world and like that that

00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:40,349
lack of fear of failure is so inspiring

00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:42,779
to me so we decided we were going to

00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:46,320
first get an LED blinking but eventually

00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:48,450
work up to a robot and so I that's kind

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,070
of like a really fun idea to me I want

00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:52,709
to build it with a pie there are lots of

00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:53,730
amazing robotics kids out there they're

00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:55,590
pretty expensive

00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:57,000
some of them and i'm kind of cheap so i

00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:59,970
was like i don't know if i want to do

00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,650
that and i was really looking for like i

00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:04,410
didn't want someone to tell me else

00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:07,140
someone to tell me what to do i really

00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:09,780
wanted to just do what however i wanted

00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:11,730
and so that's kind of why we decided not

00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,720
to use a kit

00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,240
of course there's nothing wrong with

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,410
kits but that's the approach we took so

00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,220
if you want to get started with the

00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:21,870
Raspberry Pi this talk is going to give

00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,380
you kind of a step-by-step guide to

00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:26,520
getting started with the PI on Ruby

00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,110
so here are some like practical

00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,580
considerations I think when you're first

00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,780
starting you don't even know where to

00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,790
start like you don't even know what you

00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:36,300
need so you're gonna need a Raspberry Pi

00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:37,740
you can purchase those as a kit or you

00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,300
can just purchase them without a kit I

00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,180
have to say like I bought one of the

00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:44,280
really starter kits and it came with a

00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,050
switch which you can't really see but it

00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,700
has a switch on the power supply and

00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:49,380
that's really nice because if you're

00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,390
working with kids it's better than like

00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,700
having them unplug it and plug it in and

00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,960
you know electrocuting themselves so if

00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,210
you're gonna work with kids I highly

00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,040
recommend the five dollar switch I'm

00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,870
you're gonna need an SD card

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,580
you're gonna need Len like a various

00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:06,870
jumper wires and things they look like

00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:10,040
this you can see come see after but like

00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:12,690
Barry's jumper wires resistors LEDs

00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,250
alligator two pin clips and then the

00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:16,860
stepper motors so if you want to make

00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:19,620
something that moves stepper motors and

00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:21,120
then some bread boards and so you can

00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,020
get you can buy all that stuff in a kit

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,050
from Adafruit

00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:26,040
you can go to your local you know

00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,540
electronics store however you want to

00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:31,710
assemble your things is fine but this is

00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:33,240
a pretty good place to start and so the

00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:34,860
step 1 if you want to get started you've

00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,860
got a flash your SD card with raspbian

00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:41,010
if you are scared to flash your SD card

00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:43,290
you can actually buy the SD cards with

00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:45,870
something called noobs and ooo BS so

00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:47,550
it's pre-loaded on the card or like I

00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:50,370
said just buy an SD card you can flash

00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:54,180
it with raspbian which is the OS for the

00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:56,430
Raspberry Pi then once you've done that

00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:59,910
you've got actually install Ruby on your

00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:02,400
Raspberry Pi it comes pre

00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:04,770
preloaded one of them being Python but

00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,940
Ruby does not but it's just a computer

00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,790
like sometimes you forget you're like

00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,290
it's just a compute

00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,270
so it's just the way you would install

00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:12,460
it on you know your own computer and

00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:15,370
then I put this up here don't get

00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:16,270
distracted by how cool scratch is if you

00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,100
have children

00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:20,380
scratch is like a visual programming

00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,270
language and so we got this all set up

00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:24,160
in life I'm all excited to get to the

00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:25,720
electronics portion and my kids found

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,490
scratch and that's all they wanted to do

00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,540
was play with that so that is really

00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:31,360
cool

00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:33,610
highly recommend but you know we were

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,280
trying to focus a little more on on Ruby

00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:39,730
so this is what the download load page

00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:43,660
looks like for raspbian young to flash

00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:46,060
your SD card alright so step 2 so once

00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:48,070
you've purchased your stuff you flashed

00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:50,320
your SD card

00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:52,500
step 2 would be as I said to install

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,120
Ruby and make sure Ruby is working and

00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:58,660
so this was like the first for loop we

00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,160
did the first loop we did I put all my

00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:02,140
kids names in it and just ran it forever

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,530
and they thought that was really cool

00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:07,480
and so I I think they kind of started to

00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:09,220
see like there's this relationship

00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:14,500
between what I type in the computer and

00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:16,690
what it spits back out to me so let's

00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,520
talk a little bit about what we're gonna

00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:22,330
do next so we are gonna use electronics

00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,920
and I'm gonna give you a brief intro to

00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:26,710
electronics just in case it's been

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:29,770
awhile or you've never learned it so

00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:32,280
electronics current flows in one

00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:34,770
direction it flows from higher potential

00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:39,910
that's the plus means higher potential

00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:41,290
to lower potential and a circuit is you

00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:43,300
know you have to connect all of the

00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:48,820
conductive pieces so the electricity can

00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:52,480
flow so this would be a short circuit

00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:54,160
and that's bad so with you if you

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,180
connect as you can see here now your

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,410
battery it's like how you're not

00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,060
supposed to connect the battery

00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:59,650
terminals to each other right because

00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,000
it'll melt your battery so that's a

00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:02,620
short-circuit so when you're working

00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,820
with circuitry you kind of want to you

00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,410
want to make sure you always have

00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,390
something in line in your circuit so you

00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:11,140
don't accidentally create a

00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:13,180
short-circuit and a mini fire so

00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:15,700
breadboard so what is a breadboard

00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:17,530
I have my one breadboard hooked up here

00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,360
kind of looks like that I'll show you on

00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,910
the next slide so breadboard so they're

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,500
called

00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:24,610
red boards because before we had

00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,630
physical breadboards people used to take

00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:28,880
wooden bread boards that looked like

00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:30,770
that and like tape their circuits down

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,880
to create circuits so that's where the

00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:33,740
name comes from

00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,540
but in electronics this is what it looks

00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,760
like it's called a solderless breadboard

00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:39,230
and it's called a solderless breadboard

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,560
because the connections are made without

00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:45,110
soldering and the way these work is you

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,050
have a power rail which is this red rail

00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:50,060
right here red and you have a ground

00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:52,160
rail which is this blue rail and as you

00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,780
can see so this picture is what you know

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,540
you see from the front and if you took

00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:58,070
the back off of your breadboard this is

00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:00,770
what you would see and these are

00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:03,140
electrical connections so you have power

00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:04,820
which goes this way ground which goes

00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:06,740
this way and then you have all of your

00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:09,230
other connections which are going this

00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,330
way and that is really nice because that

00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:13,400
way you can take your PI you can plug

00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:16,610
power in here and then you have that

00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:20,510
power available anywhere on that rail to

00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:23,150
work it to work with your circuit so

00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:26,780
that's a breadboard so let's talk up a

00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:29,990
little bit about LEDs I'm sure I'm sure

00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:33,140
you're familiar with the term LED LED

00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:34,850
stands for light emitting diode and the

00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:37,190
reason I told you which way current can

00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:39,830
flow is because in an LED current can

00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:41,570
only flow in one direction so current

00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:43,580
flows from plus to minus the way the

00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:46,520
arrow is pointing that's a way current

00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:48,140
flows so the positive terminal is called

00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,270
the anode and the negative terminal is

00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,650
called the cathode and for the LED to

00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:53,420
work properly you have to put it in the

00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:55,010
right way if you put it in the wrong way

00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,960
don't worry about it just flip it around

00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:59,990
like it's not going to explode or

00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:04,190
anything but if it's not working try

00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:05,720
flipping it around so there's one thing

00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:07,100
that's missing if we're gonna hook up an

00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:10,910
LED there's still one thing that's

00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:14,510
missing in our circuit and that's a

00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:18,830
resistor and so a resistor is a device

00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:20,740
that resists the flow of current so

00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:23,810
practically what does that mean

00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:26,210
basically you are using your resistor to

00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:28,460
control the current in your circuit and

00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:30,350
that's important because devices have

00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:32,220
certain current ratings that they should

00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:37,210
not be exceeding

00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:39,460
so this is Ohm's law and voltage equals

00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:40,690
current times resistance so that is

00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:43,710
actually how you can go about

00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:45,880
calculating the size of your resistor

00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:47,500
here's an example of the circuit we're

00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,350
gonna be creating which is this which is

00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:52,780
our current limiting resistor our LED

00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:55,450
and our power source it's important to

00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:58,180
know on the PI that you can get 3.3 or 5

00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:00,100
volts so just be aware of which pin

00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:03,730
you're using because some are five in

00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:08,560
some number 3.3 so this is how you

00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:10,930
calculate the the value of the resistor

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,370
and this is like if you're interested in

00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:14,110
circuits and math if you're not

00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:16,510
interested don't worry about it it's not

00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:19,060
that important but the way this works is

00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:20,560
you have your source voltage which is vs

00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:23,170
which is coming from your raspberry pi

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,570
you have your forward voltage over your

00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:27,370
LED so you subtract that and then you

00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:29,500
divide by what you want your forward

00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:31,540
current to be now how do you know what

00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,310
you want your forward current to be you

00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:38,290
know because your LED is rated for a

00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:39,760
specific current so the truth is like it

00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:42,190
doesn't really matter just grab a

00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,750
resistor if it starts smoking like you

00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:48,970
picked the wrong one and grab another

00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:50,500
one that's how we do it practically so

00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:53,010
that's kind of my like brief

00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:55,540
introductions to circuitry in circuit

00:16:53,010 --> 00:17:01,360
this is what the Raspberry Pi pinout

00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:03,970
actually looks like and the way we

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,150
identify pins is we go across and down

00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:09,459
so it looks like this one two three four

00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:11,680
five six seven eight nine all the way

00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:13,540
down the board and there are two

00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,160
different ways to identify pin outs I

00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:17,670
mean this is the way I learned 15 years

00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:21,430
ago so this is the way I'm gonna do it

00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:22,990
so that's how you know what pin provides

00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:27,459
what voltage and whether it's an input

00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:30,460
pin or not so now that we know all about

00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:32,650
circuits and we have kind of an idea of

00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:36,880
how to hook it up let's go back to our

00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:39,010
circuit diagram one more time so we're

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,840
gonna hook our led up in series this is

00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:42,970
called series because they're right next

00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:46,040
to each other with our resistor and

00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:48,920
power supply so to do this

00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:54,680
we just did this that would turn on our

00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:57,080
LED we want to blink our LED so to blink

00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:59,150
our LED we have to control something

00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,560
else in this circuit and what we're

00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:03,590
going to control is we're gonna control

00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:05,780
this voltage right here and the way

00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:08,810
we're gonna do that is to use something

00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:11,720
called the GPIO pins so if we go back to

00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:13,880
our our pin out you can see there's

00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:17,060
several of these that are labeled GPIO

00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:19,910
GPIO GPIO that stands for general

00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:22,250
purpose input output that means the pins

00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:24,650
can be used for input or output and

00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:27,260
those pins are tied to the 3.3 volt rail

00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:30,020
so at when when they provide output they

00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:32,210
will provide 3.3 volts so we're gonna

00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:33,530
blink an LED so this is kind of what

00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:35,870
your circuit looks like and I have it

00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:37,130
set up here I know you can't see it but

00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:38,390
you can take a look after the talk if

00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:41,000
you like but you're completing your

00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:42,860
circuit and what they have and in this

00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,200
diagram it's ground is your resistor to

00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:47,900
your led to GPIO so you can see that

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,540
this is ground and this is the GPIO

00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:53,150
we're gonna control so by switching that

00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:55,040
GPIO high and low we're gonna provide

00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:57,020
power to our LED now we're gonna turn it

00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:00,620
off then we're gonna provide power and

00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:03,110
that will make our LED blink so to

00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:07,910
control in the GPIO I used a Ruby

00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:09,890
library called RPI GPIO and like as an

00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:11,930
aside if you've used the PI you've

00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:13,940
probably used Python on the PI um

00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:16,370
Python comes pre-loaded very popular and

00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,840
Python has a lot of libraries that kind

00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:20,180
of abstract all of this they probably

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,280
have like a blink led library like they

00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:24,200
just abstract all of this away so I

00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,270
really think there's like a fun benefit

00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,130
to learning how to control the GPIO s on

00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:29,960
your own because you can really

00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:31,730
understand the circuitry and really

00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:35,030
understand what it's doing but it is a

00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:37,310
little bit more work so this is the oh

00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:39,400
you can't see that so well sorry about

00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:42,380
the red this is a code I wrote and

00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:44,270
basically with this particular library

00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,010
and there are other libraries you have

00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:47,540
to set the numbering so as I said we're

00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,700
gonna go with the board numbering which

00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:52,700
is kind of the more traditional

00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:57,400
numbering scheme so I just set up pin 12

00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:59,270
as output initialized it low and then I

00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:04,340
said it high

00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:06,110
sleep said it low sleep and it blinks so

00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,460
hopefully you've made it that far and

00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:10,730
you're still interested you're still

00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:13,520
having fun with circuits and you're

00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:16,429
blinking an LED yeah so let's talk about

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,980
the second project and like I said I do

00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:20,090
have these projects set up so we can you

00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:22,010
know you can always take a look after

00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:24,020
the talk alright so let's look at talk

00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:27,050
about project 2 which was a whoopee

00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:28,340
cushion which is this it's connected to

00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:32,179
my PI right now but I'll try to hold it

00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:35,270
up this beautiful device is my whoopee

00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:37,760
cushion and this was fun cuz this was

00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:40,010
really the LED like the kids weren't too

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:43,160
excited about that but the whoopee

00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:44,929
cushion everyone was excited about and

00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,220
if you look at this as I show you how I

00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:49,220
made it you'll see that like it's really

00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:51,050
just a really big button so what you

00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:53,360
need to paper plates

00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:54,740
I recommend Chie net so they you know

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,090
expand a little better and they don't

00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:58,160
just fall in on each other and keep your

00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:00,860
button press the whole time alligator

00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,929
clips aluminium foil that's what we use

00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:06,460
for our conductive surface is aluminum

00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:11,059
foil so if I take this apart you'll see

00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:14,179
has aluminum foil in the middle and then

00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:16,550
you can put sponges like around the rim

00:21:14,179 --> 00:21:17,750
here to give it more bounce we tried

00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:20,510
that and we didn't really find it to be

00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:22,400
too effective so you're gonna connect

00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:23,929
one led so as you see I have conductive

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,280
surface conductive surface and then you

00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:27,710
can see there's a conductive surface

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,440
coming out right here conductive surface

00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:31,850
so when you put it together

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,350
don't put the conductive surfaces going

00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:35,570
out together that won't work

00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:37,880
so you have to put the conductive

00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:41,510
surfaces not touching and then you hook

00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:43,610
up alligator clips and it just makes

00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:45,220
like a really big button and so when

00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:48,320
someone sits on it or you depress it

00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:52,550
your two surfaces are going to touch and

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:56,900
you're going to close the circuit and

00:21:52,550 --> 00:22:03,440
this is the code I used umm yeah I have

00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:05,690
a folder now called farts so set up in

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,220
18 as input I pulled it up so there's

00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:09,320
two ways to do it you can start with it

00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:10,970
low and pull it high or you can start

00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,770
with it high and fill it low so it was

00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:13,040
just because I was doing this all on

00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,540
this

00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,610
Paes so those are the only pins I had

00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:20,060
available so you can just pull it up and

00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:23,240
then you have your farts and um then you

00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:26,630
know when when the pin goes low you play

00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:27,680
a fart sound and so this was really fun

00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:29,330
one of the things that's interesting

00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,310
here that sometimes I think is software

00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:33,500
developers we forget it's like you have

00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:36,050
to wait because like you're responding

00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:39,170
to a physical event it's not what we're

00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:40,640
used to so when I first coded this up I

00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:42,350
didn't have any sleep in there and it

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,400
was not syncing up properly and I

00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:45,350
couldn't figure it out it took a while

00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,270
do you remember like hardware is slower

00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:49,730
than we're used to so you've got to keep

00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:52,420
that in mind as you're making this and

00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:52,420
hopefully this

00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:07,030
that's hard to hear it's coming out oh

00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:10,770
well it makes a good fart sound so that

00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:10,770
was a very popular project in my house

00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:20,380
all right so I'd like to talk to you

00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:22,210
about the third project we worked on so

00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:24,670
if you are doing with this this with

00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:28,360
children or even yourself let's talk

00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:31,000
about managing expectations because kids

00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:33,040
these days have like robots at their

00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,800
house they have robots at their school

00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,960
we went to the library and our library

00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:40,870
has this robot just like because they're

00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,310
awesome and you get an iPad and you just

00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:45,010
like move your finger around and the

00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:46,420
robot follows your finger it's amazing

00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:51,060
so we go and my son's like can we build

00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:53,500
that I was like not today maybe someday

00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:55,120
but I think like one of the cool things

00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,010
about this project it really kind of

00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,260
gave my kids some perspective on things

00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:01,570
are hard you know like these robots are

00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:04,510
built by teams and teams of people so

00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:05,740
you know it's interesting what you can

00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:07,600
do at home so I would just recommend

00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:09,730
managing expectations when you go into

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,230
that ours will pale a little bit in

00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:16,960
comparison to what your children might

00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:18,640
be used to seeing at school so robot you

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,760
got to be able to move so the biggest

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:24,910
thing with movement is motors so I used

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,470
a stepper motor stepper motors are a

00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:28,000
little bit different than what you think

00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:29,950
of as more like your traditional DC

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,680
motors because you can program them to

00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:34,330
move in like tiny increments and the

00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:37,210
reason we chose to use a stepper motor

00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:38,230
is because they were $6 and I really

00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:41,080
didn't know how this was gonna turn out

00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:42,670
when we started this so um they're super

00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,830
cheap they come with their own driver

00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:47,530
board so that's the driver board and it

00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:49,870
comes they come packaged together and it

00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:51,820
gives you really precise control and I

00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:53,710
didn't know I had no idea what we were

00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:55,060
gonna be doing for the physical yet so I

00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:57,250
didn't know if we'd have an axle

00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,780
connecting the two wheels so I thought

00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:00,550
it was important to get precise control

00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:02,830
so our robot wasn't you know going off

00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:06,520
in all different directions so that's

00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:08,850
why I used a stepper motor and so I want

00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,450
to talk to you a little bit about

00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:13,480
stepping so

00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:16,600
Motors brief brief description of motors

00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:19,600
they have a magnetic core and then you

00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:21,910
are sending an electric current through

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,020
a coil and when you send an electric

00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:25,360
current through a coil you create a

00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:34,270
magnetic field that's what causes motors

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:36,340
to turn so if you look at this this

00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:39,910
animation which unfortunately isn't

00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:41,080
working at the moment there we go so if

00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:45,310
you look at this animation you can see

00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:47,080
in this animation how a coil is

00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:48,970
exercised okay I don't know why we call

00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,350
it exercised but we call it exercise

00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:52,990
when you send a current through it a

00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:55,180
coil is exercised it creates a magnetic

00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:57,010
field and that create that your

00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:59,320
permanent magnet field magnet in the

00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:01,000
middle turns right magnets are attracted

00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,280
and if you look over here you can

00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,170
actually see the stepping sequence this

00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:07,450
is called half-stepping there's a few

00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:10,150
different ways to do your stepping but

00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:12,070
basically in half-stepping you turn one

00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:13,960
on and then you turn two on and then you

00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:18,460
turn one on if i can get it to play

00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:20,800
again and then you turn one on and you

00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:25,540
turn two on so if you look over here you

00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:27,730
can see high low low low and then you

00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:29,440
have high high and low low so you can

00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:32,920
kind of see the pattern if you look over

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:35,200
here of how to do half stepping and so

00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:38,110
what that actually that pattern actually

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:41,200
looks like oh no it's gonna play again

00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:43,180
okay you can watch it again so red means

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,130
it's on so now you have two on now you

00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:47,680
have a prime on now you have a prime on

00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:50,520
and B prime on B prime on B prime and

00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,520
AAA on

00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:58,920
okay so this is what that sequence

00:26:56,550 --> 00:27:01,200
actually looks like if you were to put

00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,850
it in an array so just like we just saw

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:07,230
in the physical diagram and the last

00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:09,270
slide it's 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 then 2 on then

00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:11,370
this one on then these 2 on and you just

00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:15,000
go in that sequence and that is gonna

00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:17,850
cause your stepper motor to turn and

00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,360
each of these 4 values correspond to a

00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:24,090
specific pin on your stepper motor

00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:25,830
that's important so your stepper motor

00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:27,870
when you connect it it has four pins and

00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:33,780
each of these is going to correspond to

00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:37,290
a specific pin so let's look at how this

00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:39,510
works so my suggestion when you get this

00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:42,000
up and running is to first try to get

00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:44,070
one motor spinning and then once you

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,440
have one motor spinning you can try to

00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:49,350
get two motor spinning so here's what an

00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:53,730
initialize method might look like for

00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:56,430
two motors so what we have here is I

00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:59,850
have control pin and control pin 2

00:27:56,430 --> 00:28:01,230
because I have two motors and these are

00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:03,060
just GPIO pins that we were talking

00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:05,280
about talking about earlier these are

00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:08,460
our GPI opens and we have eight of them

00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:10,350
total cuz we have four per motor and

00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,990
we're just gonna set those pins up as

00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:15,000
output pins initialize low and they need

00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:17,220
to be output because we're driving the

00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,690
motors from the PI so if you think of

00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:21,060
the way like you're kind of sending

00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:23,940
you're coming from the PI to your motor

00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:28,350
and so you're gonna set them up you're

00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:31,290
gonna initialize them low and okay so

00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:34,050
two motors four pins so what we're

00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:36,870
looking up here is we have four pin zero

00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:41,520
to three set pin so here's kind of like

00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:43,530
some pseudocode for set pin and this

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:46,830
basically is going to take a pin and a

00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:49,380
value and set the pin to the value so

00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:52,650
and as I said we have four pins and as

00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:54,150
you see we have half step zero oh yeah

00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:56,070
here's a reminder of our sequence of

00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:58,410
what our sequence looked like what our

00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:00,330
sequence already looks like and here's

00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:02,730
our half step sequence again and there's

00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:04,890
eight so if you look back at this you

00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:07,500
can see we're doing four half step zero

00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:07,929
to seven for pin in zero to three and

00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:15,580
we're going to

00:29:07,929 --> 00:29:16,899
that each one of those pins and to sleep

00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,879
again with the sleeping we don't wanna

00:29:16,899 --> 00:29:20,649
forget the sleeping cuz we are moving a

00:29:18,879 --> 00:29:22,690
physical device so we have to wait a

00:29:20,649 --> 00:29:26,860
little bit of time to make sure the

00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:29,799
physical device can move okay so here is

00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:32,139
what go forward looks like for me and

00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:36,070
for one to make one complete revolution

00:29:32,139 --> 00:29:38,289
I have to go 512 steps with half

00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:40,720
stepping and that is gonna be determined

00:29:38,289 --> 00:29:42,070
based on your motor and that will be

00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,200
specked out in your motor so you should

00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:48,730
be able to find out information and so

00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:50,830
this is my go forward nothing we go zero

00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:53,470
to 511 and then we do our half steps and

00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:58,450
then we set each pin as we go through

00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:59,860
the loop alright so so now we have like

00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:03,909
if you think of where we are like we

00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:06,369
have motors that are spinning which is

00:30:03,909 --> 00:30:08,830
cool and we were trying to figure out

00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:11,559
how to put this in a physical device and

00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:12,879
at first we started with Legos and I'm

00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:15,429
sure there's a great way to do it with

00:30:12,879 --> 00:30:17,889
Legos but I wanted to glue the stepper

00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:20,860
motors to the Legos and my son was not

00:30:17,889 --> 00:30:23,320
having that so there was no gluing of

00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:25,059
Legos so the Legos didn't really work as

00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,610
I was having trouble like figuring out

00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:31,090
how to get the stepper motor attached to

00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:33,429
the Legos but we discovered Thingiverse

00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:35,200
and this is a super technical crowd so

00:30:33,429 --> 00:30:38,049
probably half of you have your own 3d

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,059
printers which would awesome we do not I

00:30:38,049 --> 00:30:42,549
have never used a 3d printer in my life

00:30:40,059 --> 00:30:46,360
and I discovered Thingiverse and it

00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:50,289
turns out my local library has a 3d

00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:51,639
printer so we we got a design and we

00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:53,559
didn't design this ourselves that's like

00:30:51,639 --> 00:30:54,879
step 2 of our process I'd love to learn

00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:58,600
how to do it but we did not have time

00:30:54,879 --> 00:30:59,950
for that so we got a design and we

00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,889
printed at the library for three dollars

00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:06,100
it was amazing and so that was really

00:31:02,889 --> 00:31:16,419
really exciting for everyone and this is

00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:18,999
our robot as you can see and and it goes

00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:19,859
it's a kit ready this is very

00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:21,500
overwhelming

00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:26,360
look how fast

00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:27,530
to go and you'll notice like this is

00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,390
kind of funny because you'll notice I

00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:32,000
still have it plugged in so I was

00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:34,640
running it off this battery pack here

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,650
but it just I mean it was just

00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,240
destroying the battery and it's an old

00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:41,450
battery pack and I probably should have

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,640
sprung for a new one so you know it's

00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:45,530
not exactly an overwhelmingly amazing

00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,660
experience but we built something

00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:50,180
ourselves that moved and we were really

00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:54,800
excited and the kids were really excited

00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:57,110
and it just kind of just felt fun and so

00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,550
I think that's really cool

00:31:57,110 --> 00:32:01,250
and I hope you learned a little bit

00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:03,650
about electronics and a little bit about

00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:05,390
the Raspberry Pi but like my goal was

00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:07,190
not necessarily to teach you how to

00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:09,110
build a robot although I'd love to talk

00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:10,640
about that my goal of this talk was just

00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:12,770
to like remind you how to have fun and

00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,350
remind you that at our heart most of us

00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:17,000
are creators and sometimes throughout

00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,500
the course of our lives and our days and

00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,510
our adult responsibilities like we

00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:22,520
forget to have fun and just create

00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:24,560
things so if you're looking for a fun

00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:27,350
project the Raspberry Pi is a really

00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:29,600
great device to get you up and started

00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:32,270
cheaply and quickly and you can create

00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:37,250
new things thank you very much

00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:44,660
