	RubyConf 2019 - A Static Type Analyzer of Untyped Ruby Code for Ruby 3 by Yusuke Endoh

Ruby 3 is planned to provide a toolchain for static analysis: (1) the standard type signature format for Ruby code, (2) a type analyzer to guess a signature of a non-signatured Ruby code, and (3) a type checker (such as Sorbet) to verify a code with its signature. In the talk, we present a candidate of (2), called Type Profiler, which aims to allow you not to write a signature manually. It abstractly runs a non-annotated Ruby code in "type" level, tries to find possible errors, and generates a type signature prototype for the code. We show some demos and development progress.
