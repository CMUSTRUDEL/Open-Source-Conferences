	RubyConf 2019 - Fun, Friendly Computer Science by Mercedes Bernard

Computer science concepts like Big O Notation, set theory, data structures, and principles of object-oriented programming sound intimidating, but they don’t have to be! This talk will dive into some fundamental computer science topics and debunk the myth that only ‘real’ programmers know CS.


Whether you are a code school grad, self-taught career switcher, or someone who, like me, didn't pay attention in night class, join me as we explore some computer science theory behind the code we write every day through fun illustrations and real-world examples.
