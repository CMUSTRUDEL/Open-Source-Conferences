	RubyConf2019 - Kill All Mutants! (Intro to Mutation Testing) by Dave Aronson

How good are your tests? Would they still pass if the tested code was changed much? If so, you may have a problem!

Mutation testing helps reveal these cases. It runs your unit tests, using many slightly altered versions of each method, called "mutants". If a mutant passes (or "survives") all of the method's tests, that implies certain flaws in your code, your tests, or both!

Come find out how to use this advanced technique to discover problems lurking in your code and/or tests.
