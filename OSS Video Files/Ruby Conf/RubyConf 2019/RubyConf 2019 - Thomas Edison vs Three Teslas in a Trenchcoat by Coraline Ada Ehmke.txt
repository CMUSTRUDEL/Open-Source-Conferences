	RubyConf 2019 - Thomas Edison vs Three Teslas in a Trenchcoat by Coraline Ada Ehmke

As a company grows, adopting new technologies becomes more complex, costly, and risky. But as developers we want to keep our skills up-to-date and are often drawn to the latest and hottest tools. So how can we effectively experiment with new technologies at work in a responsible way? This talk will recount the famously adversarial relationship between Thomas Edison and Nicola Tesla, and from their story we will learn ways to balance and exploit the tension between the boring and the new, the familiar and the shiny, the safe and the unknown.

Hi, everybody. Nice to see so many friends here, old and new. I am going to go ahead

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:20,279
and get started. I have seen the rumors on Twitter, and I can honestly tell you the answer

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:29,219
is no. I did not write this talk to win a bet. A bet that said I got a $500 steak dinner

00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:36,890
if I won. And to win, I had to figure out how to bring the story of the electrocution

00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:51,440
of an elephant to a Ruby conference. The elephant part is true. 

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,540
I have 25 years of software development experience. I'm currently serving as an architect at a company

00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:04,379
called Stitch Fix. We're in the lobby. I am co‑authoring a book called "The Compassionate

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:18,180
Coder." I am a troublemaker. I released the Hippocratic license, and I have also launched

00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:25,210
the ethical source definition. I am fighting to give us as developers control over how

00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:32,770
our software is being used.  If you're interested in the license, go to

00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:41,421
do no harm.dev. And if you're interested in the definition, ethicalsource.dev. I have

00:01:41,421 --> 00:01:49,030
a special tweet for you. If you tweet about this talk and @ mention me, you will be

00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:53,900
entered ‑‑ tweet something that you learned from the talk, I will pick the best answer

00:01:53,900 --> 00:02:00,299
and give you a giant Nikola tesla bobble head with a glow‑in‑the‑dark light bulb in

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:09,140
his hand.  Let's meet our heroes. Thomas Alva Edison

00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:15,740
born 1847, an American inventor accredited with the invention of the phonograph, motion

00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:29,140
picture camera and first practical light bulb. He is what I call a direct current fanboy. 

00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:34,060
Edison invested the money that he made from his early patents into what he called the

00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:40,980
Invention Factory, which is a facility in Menlo Park, New Jersey, staffed with engineers,

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:49,870
mechanics, and machinists. His first patent was for an electrographic vote recorder in

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:54,670
1869. The problem he was trying to solve is that voting in the legislature takes a

00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:01,090
long time. So, he thought he could improve it with automation. A man named Dewitt Roberts

00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:09,250
bought the patent for $100 and tried to sell it to Washington, but they were not in favor

00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,980
of making the voting process any more efficient than it was, because they wanted to make time

00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:20,540
for wheeling and dealing and filibustering. So, young Edison's vote recorder was sent to the

00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:28,040
political graveyard.  Nikola tesla, born 1856 studied engineering

00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:34,440
and physics, but dropped out like me, and died penniless in obscurity in New York. He

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:46,120
was Rediscovered in the 90s.  He worked from various labs around New York

00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,970
through the 1890s through the 1900s, and this is a photograph of a lab he built in Colorado

00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:59,780
Springs in 1899 to study the conductive Power of low‑pressure air. He was trying to invent

00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:09,900
a way to send power through the air. Tesla applied for his first patent in 1884, immediately

00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:17,870
after leaving Edison's company and founding the tesla light manufacturing company. We're

00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:23,622
gonna talk a little bit about the war of the currents, but to get there, we need to understand

00:04:23,622 --> 00:04:30,030
something called a generator.  In 1831, Michael Faraday discovered the operating

00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:38,809
principle of electromagnetic generators. Faraday's law is that force is generated in an electric

00:04:38,809 --> 00:04:47,689
conductor ‑‑ a wire moving through a magnetic field. He build the first electromagnetic

00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:54,090
generator using a copper disk rotating through the poles of a magnet. And it produced a

00:04:54,090 --> 00:05:10,240
small DC voltage. That same year, a man named ‑‑ generating more current, but his generator

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,599
was AC, and that was considered a major flaw at the time. 

00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:20,490
William Cook and Charles Wheatstone were a pair of inventories who made their name with

00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:26,479
improvements to the telegraph. They made an improvement in generators by replacing

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:34,990
a permanent magnet with a battery powered electromagnet. By the 1860s, this kind of

00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:40,419
generator was common.  The first practical generator capable of powering

00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:47,469
electric devices was called the Gramme machine. It with us created by ZT Gramme, a Belgium inventor,

00:05:47,469 --> 00:06:02,139
and he started selling them in 1870s. A demonstration took place at the 1878 Paris expedition. The

00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:07,199
world was waking up to the potential of electric power. 

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:13,900
Which brings us to the war of the currents. Edison stubbornly held on to the idea that direct

00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:19,099
current was the best way to deliver electrical power to the world, while tesla believed in

00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:27,250
the superiority of alternating current and the war raged for nearly 20 years. 

00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:32,860
The first large‑scale power station in America was Edison's pearl street station in New York

00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:40,139
City, which began operating in 1882. The station had six 200 horsepower dynamos powered

00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:49,509
by steam engines. It was located in a commercial district and supplied electricity to customers,

00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:59,050
powering lamps. But Edison's generators were inefficient and couldn't deliver power over

00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:05,039
distances of more than a few city blocks. In order to light New York City with Edison's

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:11,740
generators, there would have to be a power station every five or six blocks. In 1884,

00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:18,539
at the suggestion of a friend, Edison hired tesla to improve his DC generators and offered

00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:27,540
a reward of $50,000, which in modern terms, is about $1.2 million. Even though tesla

00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:34,789
thought that DC generators had no future, he needed the work. And he did, in fact,

00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:40,419
improve DC generators significantly. When he went to claim his reward, Edison laughed

00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:46,689
at him and said my friend, you don't understand American humor. I never intended to give

00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:53,639
you $50,000 for this work.  Tesla was devastated, and he had to resort

00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,520
to digging ditches and doing odd jobs to raise enough money to start his own company, tesla

00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,949
electric light manufacturing.  He tried to come up with a better way of generating

00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:10,669
alternate current, and he developed a steam power generator. Steam was forced through

00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:15,319
the bottom of the oscillator and rushed out through a series of ports which pushed a piston. And

00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:26,089
the magnet vibrated, producing an alternating magnetic field. This induced alternating

00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:35,180
current in the wire coils and did away with the complicated parts of the steam engine

00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:40,149
generator, but no one was interested in his invention. 

00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:48,829
But tesla's invention was saved from obscurity when engineers at Westinghouse electric invited

00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:57,199
tesla to participate in the 1893 exhibition in Chicago where they had space devoted to

00:08:57,199 --> 00:09:07,930
electrical exhibits. It was a key event in the history of AC power, demonstrating to

00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:13,940
the American public the viability and safety of AC. 

00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:26,190
By 1902, 61%of generating capacity was AC. AC was really good at delivering power over long

00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:31,060
distances, so it was possible to connect to different stations and balance the load between

00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:40,520
them. The war of the currents was won through a partnership between tesla and George Westinghouse. Edison,

00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:46,779
who finally admitted defeat, shifted his focus to other inventions. Today the world consumes

00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:56,630
an estimated 157.5petawatt‑hours of power, and electricity is responsible for 10%of the

00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:04,930
world's GDP.  I mentioned at the beginning an elephant. There's

00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:09,680
a term in French that I'm not going to attempt to pronounce, literally translated, it means

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:18,160
the spirit of a staircase. In 1773, the French philosopher was at a dinner party, and someone

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,170
insulted him and it left him speechless and ruined his whole night. When he finally left

00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:29,450
to go home, he was going down the stairs and he came up with a perfect retort. And he

00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:33,930
was so frustrated because he thought if I thought of this an hour ago, I could have

00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:41,009
saved my evening and made a good point and defended myself. So, Edison had one of these

00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:50,379
spirit of the staircase moments, too. He demonstrated this in a 1903 film called electrocuting

00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:55,650
the elephant. He had been experimenting with electricity as a humane way to put animals

00:10:55,650 --> 00:11:05,771
down. It was generally accepted by the animal rights activists at the time. This was Topsy,

00:11:05,771 --> 00:11:13,310
a circus elephant and something of a problem child. He killed a spectator at the circus,

00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:23,000
but he deserved it. He put out a cigar on her trunk and she attacked him. Topsy had

00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,040
also attacked several handlers, and the circuit decided she was too much of a liability and

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:35,439
they decided to put her down. The event was captured and released by the Edison film company

00:11:35,439 --> 00:11:41,699
as a 74‑second silent film in 1903, and interestingly, this was the first time that

00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:46,980
death was captured on film on any kind of camera. 

00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:52,990
Edison's film shows the unitization of Topsy in an under‑construction fairground in Coney

00:11:52,990 --> 00:12:04,730
island. Edison was clear about the fact that AC current was used to electrocute the elephant. He

00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:14,550
could not let it go. The fact is if you have to murder an elephant publicly to make a point,

00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:21,810
you're likely on the wrong side of whatever it is you're trying to argue. 

00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:28,040
Both Edison and tesla are portrayed in history as lone geniuses turning out invention after

00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:34,709
invention, but this wasn't really true. In fact, the notion of genius is a relatively

00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:41,279
new concept that comes from the enlightenment of the 18th century. In previous centuries,

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:48,339
invention was acknowledged as a collaborative process that built on historical work of precedent ‑‑

00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:54,500
historical precedent by other scientists. But when the first copyright law was enacted,

00:12:54,500 --> 00:13:01,589
it gave credence to inventories being the owners of the ideas. 

00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:15,430
There is a book "shakes peer's ghost writers," the cult of genius emerged. There's lots

00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:21,840
of evidence that Shakespeare borrowed from poets and play writes, but he's held up an

00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:32,970
as example of natural genius. In his book, the power of two, Joshua Shenk explores the

00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:40,329
rule of partnership and collaboration. Successful collaboration extends beyond widely acknowledged

00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:50,579
duos like the Wright brothers or the Curys.  In 

00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:55,809
some cases these relationships are collaborative and in others they are adversarial, but they

00:13:55,809 --> 00:14:03,199
always have an undeniable interpersonal component. Edison, as I mentioned, got started making improvements

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:13,319
to telegraphs. He had his invention factory. And the physicists and machinists and mechanical

00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:18,540
engineers who worked at the invention factory were called muckers. And it was the muckers

00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:25,620
who were responsible to generating the hundreds of patents that are credited to Edison. The

00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,490
muckers didn't enjoy wide commercial success for their inventions at first. They quickly

00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:36,499
discovered that when they tied an invention to Edison's name, the audience responded better,

00:14:36,499 --> 00:14:42,100
because the audience liked the idea of a lone genius working and turning out the technological

00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:53,259
marvels. Francis Jehl even wrote that Edison is, in truth, a collective noun. 

00:14:53,259 --> 00:15:00,809
Tesla worked solo for a lot of his career, and he failed to meet with success. He needed

00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:09,339
the support and business acumen of men like Westinghouse. There are other examples of

00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:15,329
collaboration throughout history. We have Allen Turing, but he would not have been successful

00:15:15,329 --> 00:15:25,329
if not for the dozens of uncredited women who worked to decode German encryption. Ada

00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:39,809
Lovelace needed her partner. And Steve jobs relied heavily on his partnership with Steve

00:15:39,809 --> 00:15:47,579
Wozniak. The conclusion that Shenk came to is that working relationships are the fundamental

00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:52,839
engine of the creative process.  What does all of this have to do with software

00:15:52,839 --> 00:16:03,639
development? In a paper called human cumulative culture, at the university of saint Andrews,

00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:11,100
they explore the unambiguously cumulative character of complex human advancement. The

00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:18,119
paper describes how the transmission of knowledge gives more complex than what they could alone. Leading

00:16:18,119 --> 00:16:26,589
to a ratcheting effect on technology capabilities. The authors argue that understanding the progress

00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:33,360
of human endeavors is only possible through looking at social processes. And they describe

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,339
something called pro‑social behaviors. There's a broad range of altruistic and reciprocal

00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:45,209
social processes that follow social behavior. They are defined as voluntary actions intended

00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:52,559
to benefit other individuals or society as a whole, and examples include altruism, obeying

00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:59,089
rules, acting on our values, and most importantly, practicing empathy. 

00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:04,230
As developers, we feel good about our code when it's new. And with the exception of

00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:10,079
test‑driven developer enthusiasts, we may be less enthusiastic about things like writing

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:16,510
tests, writing documentation, writing proof that our code actually works. And this is

00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:23,040
evidenced by the hundreds of thousands of empty read‑mes on GitHub. 

00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:28,929
But if you're part of a project that is innovative and beneficial to society, that helps you

00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:39,840
get through the boring work. Successful software requires collaboration with many people including

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:46,399
end users. Even in the open‑source world where we're often motivated by satisfying

00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:50,950
a need that we ourselves have, projects don't often have success without the assistance

00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:56,220
of other people collaborating in the code base, writing documentation, giving talks,

00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:02,270
or even writing books.  I believe that each and every one of us alternates

00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:08,250
on a spectrum between the raw creative power of tesla and the practical and methodical

00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:24,000
approach of Edison. So, which one are you?  A tesla developer prefers to work alone without

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,130
interruption. And they are really good at solving complex problems in many a really

00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:34,670
creative way. They may not like writing tests or documentation, and they work in bursts

00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:40,380
of energy followed by long periods of low productivity. 

00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:45,520
The Edison developer, on the other hand, loves pair programming and may apply architectural

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:51,059
patterns to their work. They write comprehensive issue descriptions and they produce work at

00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:56,330
a steady velocity.  So when you ask yourself where you fall on

00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:03,160
the Edison tesla scale, you may aspire to be more like one or the other. Or you may

00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:09,419
recognize that you move between these extremes in different situations. And that's actually

00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:16,100
the ideal. The best developers I know oscillate between Tesla and Edison as the situation

00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:23,880
demands to solve the problem at hand.  But if you identify more with Edison or more

00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,159
with Tesla, there are different strategies you can employ to emphasize your strengths

00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:34,960
and work around your weaknesses. Edison was a practical man, really good at execution,

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:42,340
but also very resistant to change. If you're an Edison, make use of your practical tendencies,

00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:48,090
learn from your failures, embrace team work, but don't fight against radical ideas. Work

00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:53,649
to make those ideas successful.  Tesla was one of the world's most creative

00:19:53,649 --> 00:19:59,830
problem‑solvers, and he was knocked down by convention. But he was very naive. If

00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:05,460
you're a Tesla, don't let people tell you that your idea won't work or that it's impractical. Find

00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:12,059
a way. Believe in yourself, even when no one else does. And most importantly, figure

00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:20,240
out a way to build partnerships to make your ideas take shape and change the world. 

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:27,490
We all generally work at companies with established technology platforms. We have a standard stack

00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:33,200
that we work in. But sometimes we're attracted to new frameworks or new technologies or new

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:39,840
languages. We can bring those into our workplace. How do we do this in a responsible way? How do

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:46,570
we build our own Invention Factory? There are three main aspects to innovating responsibly

00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:52,060
with technologies in a workplace. You want to evaluate the need for technology, test

00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:58,870
it through experimentation, and follow a decision‑making matrix to make sure it's adopted. First off,

00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:04,510
evaluating the need.  There are six primary questions that we ask

00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:11,250
ourselves. Ask yourself why is this new problem a priority? What does ‑‑ what's different

00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:18,440
about what you're facing now compared to what you faced when your stack was first chosen? And

00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,440
tie it to a business need. If you can't tie it to a business need, you're not likely to

00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:30,100
get buy‑in from stakeholders. Be very clear about why your current approach is not working,

00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:34,480
why isn't the stack that you've been using forever or the language that you've been using

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:41,880
forever unable to solve the problem at hand?  And be very clear about having exhausted the

00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:51,950
possibilities of working with your existing technology. And think about what has changed. 

00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:56,519
Think about what kind of effort is needed to solve the new problem. There are two categories

00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:04,080
of effort that you can divide into. One effort is a strengthening effort, which means investing

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,799
time and energy to make an older technology do something new through re‑engineering

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:14,390
or process changes. Sometimes the efforts pay off, but sometimes you end up being like

00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:21,529
Edison trying to improve the DC generator. It can be a lost cause. 

00:22:21,529 --> 00:22:27,070
Growth efforts involve using new technologies to solve a problem. But growth efforts may

00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:32,419
fail if clear parameters are not established up front. You can end up like Tesla making

00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:41,380
inventions that were unwanted.  To help us at Stitch Fix understand when to

00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:52,929
bring in new technology, I created the new technology matrix. Ease of adoption, we'll

00:22:52,929 --> 00:22:57,850
start with. And that encompasses a number of considerations. Does the new technology

00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:03,909
fit within our existing processes? Will it be easy for other developers to learn to use

00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:09,059
it effectively? Is there good documentation? Is there prior art that we can learn from? Are

00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:15,409
people averse to the questions on stack overflow? Is it more flexible than current stools? Does

00:23:15,409 --> 00:23:20,721
it have a strong security story? Have we considered the overall cost of adopting the

00:23:20,721 --> 00:23:27,550
new technology?  Usefulness can be determined with more questions. Does

00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:34,410
the technology enhance the performance of our teams? Positively impact stability, performance,

00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:40,581
and reliability? Is it well‑maintained? Does it have an active user base? Does it solve

00:23:40,581 --> 00:23:43,520
the problem more effectively than our current tool set? 

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:51,539
We can use this matrix to guide our decision‑making process. In the first quadrant, reject, this

00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:57,070
is where technologies that are difficult to adopt and provide a limited utility fall. And

00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:04,289
you can reject those outright. Easy to adopt solutions that maybe are limited in capacity

00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:09,799
aren't likely to be adopted, but they can be really useful to play with. That creates

00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:14,220
learning opportunities that can help us gain a new perspective on a problem that we're

00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:19,269
trying to solve.  Technologies that are useful but difficult

00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:24,519
to adopt fall into the wait category. They may be candidates for future adoption once

00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:31,179
the technology matures to the point that tooling and training exists to make onboarding easier. 

00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:36,279
And finally in the explore quadrant, solutions that are easy to adopt and accommodate a wide

00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:44,320
range of use cases. Technologies like this can move into the next phase, which is experimentation. 

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:50,279
To inform and guide the evolution of our solutions in a framework of pragmatic innovation and

00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:55,590
creativity, we sometimes experiment with new ways of doing things. And we should do so

00:24:55,590 --> 00:25:00,840
responsibly. So, what are the characteristics of a responsible experiment? First of all,

00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:05,100
make sure that you can clearly state what the problem is. If you can't state what the

00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:11,600
problem is in a sentence or two, you probably don't understand it sufficiently. 

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,690
When you're conducting your experiment, you want to make sure that it has minimal impact

00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:20,639
on other systems. For example, if you have a service oriented architecture, and you want

00:25:20,639 --> 00:25:26,600
to experiment, you don't want to have to change every other service that might be talking

00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:31,899
to your service to support protobof. You want to limit that footprint. That ties into

00:25:31,899 --> 00:25:39,289
establishing boundaries. You want to be sure you're testing exactly what needs to be tested. You

00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:44,179
want to establish clear success criteria up front. It's possible that during the course

00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:50,139
of the experiment, you fall in love with this new technology and you lose sight of the pragmatic

00:25:50,139 --> 00:25:54,809
approach that is probably going to be most successful. 

00:25:54,809 --> 00:26:01,510
You want to constrain the time and costs time box. And make sure that whatever you do can

00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:07,929
be rolled back quickly. If you're on a deadline, that's not the time to experiment. 

00:26:07,929 --> 00:26:13,050
The best engineering cultures empower us as engineers. They give us flexibility in the

00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:18,350
way that we go about solving problems. But sometimes what we want to change has impact

00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:23,470
outside of our immediate situation. We have to be careful and thoughtful about how other

00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:31,690
engineers will be affected. And for this, we can use the responsible, accountable, consulted,

00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:37,820
and informed. So, the first thing to do is identify the scope of the change you're trying

00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:41,210
to make.  If it only affects your team, that's a limited

00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:47,299
scope and it's a little bit easier. The person responsible is you or whoever you're pairing

00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:53,929
with. Your manager is accountable, and maybe that is in collaboration with other senior

00:26:53,929 --> 00:27:00,440
engineers. You want to consult other members of your team. And it might make sense to

00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:05,210
inform other engineers on other teams about what you're doing. They may have a similar

00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:12,289
problem and may be very interested to see what you learn from your experiment. 

00:27:12,289 --> 00:27:16,000
If you're making a larger change that will affect your entire engineering organization,

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:24,170
there's an entire set of decision‑makers. The people responsible is you and a small team

00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:32,169
of engineers that you're working from, preferably taken from different teams across your organization. Those

00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:37,860
teams have managers and senior engineers who are accountable. And you want to make sure

00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:42,919
that you consult with senior engineers across the org and also think about the impact of

00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:49,039
your change on ops and security.  And you want to make sure that you're informing

00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,890
the broader engineering organization about everything that you're doing, because it's

00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:58,480
going to impact them.  One thing that I struggle with personally

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:05,380
is I feel a need to drive the consensus. I want everyone to agree that what I'm proposing

00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:11,440
is the best possible solution to a problem. But I'm often wrong. So, I want to get feedback

00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:17,180
from other people to validate my experiments, to validate my instinct about how to solve

00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:24,309
the problem. And that sometimes can lead to a problem where if I don't have full consensus,

00:28:24,309 --> 00:28:30,330
if everybody isn't fully on board, I might think that my idea isn't a good one. But

00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:35,909
as engineers, we are empowered with a certain level of decision‑making. Don't be afraid

00:28:35,909 --> 00:28:41,659
to make decisions, even if everyone doesn't agree. 

00:28:41,659 --> 00:28:49,169
Final thoughts. We can't just be an Edison or just be a Tesla if we want to be successful. We

00:28:49,169 --> 00:28:56,010
have to find a balance. If we stubbornly hold on to our own ideas and ignore evidence

00:28:56,010 --> 00:29:02,289
to the contrary, we might find ourselves left behind like Edison during the current wars. But

00:29:02,289 --> 00:29:07,380
if we don't partner with people who complement our ingenuity, we might end up spending our

00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:14,690
lives and work hours building things that nobody really wants. Tesla solved impossible

00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:21,789
problems and Edisons make solutions practical. And the best developers oscillate between these

00:29:21,789 --> 00:29:29,710
two extremes. If you're wondering if I'm more of a Tesla or Edison, that's on my left

00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:40,090
shoulder. Nikola Tesla with devil horns and on the right hand side, Ada Lovelace. 

00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:46,570
This was condensed from a blog post that I wrote, and you can find it on my blog. I

00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:54,880
want to thank you for being my audience today. And point out that I have a ton of stickers up

00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,230
here, so please come up and grab one. If you have questions for me, come up and ask

00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:06,700
them. You can find me on Twitter or on my website [ listed on slide ]. 

00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:11,760
If you're interested in ethical open source, check out ethicalsource.dev. I'm also setting

00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,970
up a birds of a feather to talk about ethics brought to the open world. Thank you.
