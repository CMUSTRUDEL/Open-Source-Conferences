>> How are you all doing? This is good! All right. Now, you may have seen what a little

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:14,710
bit about what is about to happen. This is 100% planned. Everybody is fully prepared

00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:15,710
and ready to do this. There is no randomness in any way shape or form. Don't you worry.

00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:16,710
Just to give you a brief run down of how this works, and like Sandi said, what would Sandi

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:17,710
do? She would tell you all to move as far forward as you would like. So your involvement

00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:18,710
is great. Past about three or four rows, as a presenter, we can't see you. Don't worry.

00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:19,710
None of you will be asked to volunteer. So, feel free to move forward if you would like.

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:20,710
Here's the deal about how ignite roulette works. If you're not familiar, an ignite talk

00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:28,230
is a relatively simple recipe. It's a set amount of time, a set number of slides, and

00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,740
they auto advance every increment of time, 15 seconds if it is five minutes long. In

00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:40,810
a traditional ignite, what will happen is the presenter will have rehearsed it and done

00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:46,660
it and it keeps them from running over time and it's a set amount of time. We're doing

00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:52,260
that a little different today. So, today, it's a roulette. Meaning, everyone you're

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,699
about to see up on my right has never seen the slides. They have no idea what's gonna

00:00:57,699 --> 00:01:02,540
happen behind them. Or in this case, in front of them. And there's a couple of things I'm

00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:09,100
going to need your help for. So, when I bring up our first guest for today, our first contestant,

00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,360
because they are, of course, competing for the ultimate prize, the one that I haven't

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,200
quite told you all about yet. But the ultimate prize, but today you are all going to be the

00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:26,500
evaluator and judge of our contestant today. I have selected and have had volunteers to

00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:34,250
give us their time today. Some are seasoned speakers and others are brand new. I'm hoping

00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:39,380
for your total and unended support. Will I have your support and will you give all the

00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:45,310
love to them? [ Applause ]

00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:50,420
Now there's one final requirement. Number one is when I call each of them up individually,

00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,439
we need the biggest round of applause ever, and of course, any good presentation will

00:01:54,439 --> 00:02:01,600
end with a standing ovation. Right? It'll end with a standing ovation. Correct? Excellent!

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:08,350
Help him! All right. So, let's practice this. Standing

00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:13,600
ovation. It has ended. [ Cheers and Applause ]

00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:20,350
Louder, louder. Let us hear it! [ Cheers and Applause ]

00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:28,000
You may sit. So, for our first contestant for today, you may or may not have seen him

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,860
before, but you probably have, because he's one of the organizers. I would like to introduce

00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:43,640
our first contestant, Evan Phoenix. Where are you?

00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,220
[ Applause ] Evan, this is your mic. You're welcome to

00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:53,750
keep it on the stand or keep it with you. It's coming off the stand!

00:02:53,750 --> 00:03:01,750
>> Or should I like... >> However you like. Down in front of you,

00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,351
Evan, as you are well aware, this is a confidence monitor. So, you will see the slides that

00:03:06,351 --> 00:03:13,870
are happening behind you. You cannot stop talking for more than five seconds. All right?

00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:18,890
The slides are going to auto advance every ten seconds, but he is also unaware of what

00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:25,200
the subject is, so I need help from you. First, I want you to tell me, give me a place, a

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,980
location in your home or office. Bathroom. We've got the bathroom. Now from somebody

00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,310
else, I want you to give me one of your biggest frustrations in the bathroom.

00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:41,380
[ Laughter ] And it can't be foul. Out of shampoo. So,

00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:46,520
we have in the bathroom and out of shampoo. Evan's requirement is that he has to integrate

00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:54,540
both things into that. This will be about being in the bathroom and out of shampoo.

00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:04,319
>> So I'm in the desert. Is this not it? >> And go!

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:15,750
>> I should be talking? So those times when I find myself in the bathroom, and you know,

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,570
when the bathroom is slick, you get in the tub and it feels like you just slide across

00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:27,530
the tub, like you can hover right across in the tub, and sometimes you're going across

00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:32,900
and you're thinking you know what? I should get that shampoo, but it's so slippery and

00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:38,900
you're like I'm flying like a crazy person across there. And I get to the end of the

00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:44,550
bathtub and I pick up the shampoo and I find it's empty, and I think to myself, well, road

00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:50,129
trip time. So I've got this empty shampoo bottle in hand,

00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:54,830
all ready to go and I think to myself, I'm going to have to go out. How do I want to

00:04:54,830 --> 00:05:04,990
present myself? Do I want to be a kitten or alligator. So, what does my foot order look

00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:12,139
like? I'm going to be riding with my friends to the store to get more shampoo. So, on the

00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:18,620
way there, I'm thinking you know what? They're going to be worried. Because if my feet smell

00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:27,840
and we're going on this quad copter trike bike and my feet smell, that's dangerous,

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,770
right? [ Laughter ]

00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,569
And what's gonna happen is we're going to be riding along and we're going to see a sign

00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:41,819
and we have no idea what this sign means and we're gonna skip it because it doesn't make

00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:47,081
any sense and we're going to go right to the fundamentals of programming our bike, because

00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:57,469
we've got shampoo. It's empty, and I've got wet, yucky hair. And so...

00:05:57,469 --> 00:06:02,919
Sometimes when you're riding along, trying to get shampoo, everything is going wrong

00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:10,050
around you. You've got sewing machines and UPS things. Everything is wrong. But you get

00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:17,999
to the store and you think to yourself, finally something's going right. Because you realize

00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:25,499
sleep related injuries? You realize that again, you're finding yourself amidst graphs that

00:06:25,499 --> 00:06:27,770
make no sense. [ Laughter ]

00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:31,319
And you know, you have been having this conversation with your friends about all of these interesting

00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:36,710
graphs that you find at the drugstore. For instance, this one. But you find friends at

00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:42,629
the drugstore also. And you say sir, your hair is luscious. What shampoo do you use?

00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:48,789
Because I'm out. I am fresh out of shampoo. And you say I did see this man on the way

00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:54,930
here and he was carrying a sewing machine. I don't want his hair. Your hair is much better

00:06:54,930 --> 00:07:00,099
than his hair. And I don't even know where to go with this one.

00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:10,600
So what we're gonna do is I tell him what shampoo I hate coming to this store. I need

00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:16,379
a lot of shampoo. What's the biggest shampoo that you have here? I'm going to give you

00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:22,819
some gauges. And the gauges are whether or not I can find this spoon in the empire state

00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:31,520
building. That's the gauge. Right? So it needs to be very large. And as we leave, we've gotten

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,189
our giant shampoo. And as we're leaving we find out that sometimes hover bikes really

00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:44,419
are the way to get your shampoo. >> Thank you so much, Evan!

00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:50,469
[ Cheers and Applause ]

00:07:50,469 --> 00:08:02,689
Just so good. I feel compelled. This is amazing. Okay. All right. So, that is a tough act to

00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:10,430
follow, if I don't say so myself. So, our next contestant for today is somebody that

00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:16,469
was a willing and able volunteer. I would like to introduce them here in just a moment,

00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:22,229
once I make sure that I have all the information about them in my hands...

00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:33,469
Wherever you went today in my hands. There! Okay. Our next contestant for today is a dazed

00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:38,469
java engineer who recently joined the Rubyist world after a tour teaching computer science.

00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:44,279
I would like to introduce to the stage Sarah Jackson. Where are you? Sarah Jackson to the

00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:53,680
stage! [ Applause ]

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,211
All right, Sarah Jackson, I need some help from you the audience. So, the thing I have

00:08:58,211 --> 00:09:07,690
for you is give me a common workplace injury. Dungeons and dragons is common workplace injury.

00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:15,060
Dungeons and dragons. Okay. And give me a fruit. A banana. So, dungeons and dragons

00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:22,230
and bananas. So, if you could, Sarah, here, if you could give us your compelling and irresistible

00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:33,090
talk on dungeons and dragons and bananas. >> How can't you resist? I was at work and

00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:38,250
as we all know, you know, there are bad DMs and good DMs, but I was at work and there

00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:45,490
was a bad DM, and he had this dog that he would always bring to our sessions. It was

00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:50,260
after work, right? And this dog loved bananas. I tell you what, this dog would eat bananas

00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:56,520
and it would make your head explode. So, you know, as work, you know, the common workplace

00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:02,451
injuries, maybe you get hurt at the water cooler, maybe you get attacked by legos. Maybe

00:10:02,451 --> 00:10:11,170
you get get attacked by other things. You know what is not common? Dogs eating bananas.

00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:22,970
Maneuvering themselves under their chair after a dungeons and dragons session. They will

00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:32,680
far bombs everywhere. Bananas have potassium, and you have to be wary of that potassium

00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:40,700
near your monitors. You might roundhouse kick them to the skies. I hear potassium is probably

00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:46,370
the, you know, good in sandwiches. This kid seems to like them. We've got methods for

00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:52,430
that. But potassium, that will just shoot you over!

00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:57,010
Cats don't have this problem. Cats, adorable. Weight lifting, don't need the bananas, don't

00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:05,570
need the potassium. My DM is thinking man, I'm a dog person. This girl's a cat person.

00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:14,030
What the heck? I'm going to sabotage her every game by feeding my dog bananas. So...

00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:20,420
[ Laughter ] The economy of our class in this session went

00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:26,610
up linearly according to height. And as you see, I'm short, so I had to dance my way through

00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:33,970
as you know with a halfling I don't make a lot of money. What's the difference? If I

00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:39,070
can't read and if I can use a phone, what's the difference? Pen and paper versus people,

00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:45,740
laptop playing D & D? There's a big whale in the room, right? Because even when we're

00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:50,490
connecting on the computer through Google chat or whatever to play dungeons and dragons,

00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:55,350
it's not the team work that you get when you all get into a room together and someone says

00:11:55,350 --> 00:12:03,170
hey, does anyone have a quarter? I want to get a Mountain Dew? So, in California they

00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:07,300
don't have this problem because they don't drink Mountain Dew. They drink tea and sparkling

00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:15,330
water. And I'm the only one who fantasizes about jumping into a pool full of Jell O while

00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:20,510
playing dungeons and dragons and avoiding the dog who is farting bananas everywhere.

00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:35,480
This is a picture of me. And we have this donkey who is just laughing at me. That's

00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:41,910
the wizard. He turned himself into that. But the dog is still there every session. Somehow

00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:47,690
we make it through. We are so happy. We're so pleased as a group to have succeeded at

00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:55,260
our campaign! And every session, it's been a few years, but David, master class man is

00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:00,090
here. And he would fail to write bubble sort on a whiteboard. I don't blame him. I would

00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:06,139
too. He doesn't do riddles. But thank you. And don't feed your dogs those bananas.

00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:10,389
[ Cheers and Applause ]

00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:18,000
>> Fantastic! Fantastic. Oh my gosh. Sarah, that is just masterful, if I don't say so

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,150
myself. Well, geez, here we are. I mean, the time is ticking down. But worry not, friends,

00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:30,690
worry not. Because our next contestant is a strong and valiant competitor. This individual

00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:36,810
is one that is known for speaking often on topics such as the humanity, the humaneness

00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:40,490
of development. This is an individual who has recently discovered his ability to grow

00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:48,110
a great beard. I would like to introduce you to Ernie Miller.

00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:55,470
>> That's gonna be hard to follow. That's gonna be really hard to follow.

00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:04,010
>> So Ernie is going to need a couple of prompts if you don't mind. Take that away. A couple

00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:08,740
of prompts if you don't mind. So, the first prompt I'm going to ask from all of you is

00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:16,340
can you give me an object in your house? Shoes. Very good. Shoes. Now, give me the biggest

00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:26,480
problem with shoes? Laces! Shoes and their laces. Ernie, if you could, give us your compelling

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,180
presentation on shoes and the problem with laces.

00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:34,970
>> I'm happy to. You know, when I was younger, I had some shoes that had no laces. Velcro

00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:39,750
was in for a time, in case you forget. And I really do think if we could get back to

00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:46,780
the world where Velcro was the go to, what we would find if we didn't have laces, we

00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:52,490
would have a lot more order in our lives. I file like everything would be so organized.

00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:58,100
Really, if you could leave them in your fridge, realistically, the laces would be fine there.

00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:05,570
You don't need them. Tape would serve as a great alternative in a pinch, I suppose. You

00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:10,140
know, none of these individuals have laces on their shoes as far as I can tell. Then

00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:15,790
again, I do seem to remember that that clown does, in fact, have laces. There is a lot

00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:24,030
of synergy to be had between all of the items we have discussed so far.

00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:27,940
So I think ultimately these folks, they're living a care free life. They're living their

00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:34,140
best life. They can walk around with their phone. They're not going to trip. No laces.

00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:40,880
You know? I have to go on about this topic for five minutes. And I'm just not quite sure

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:46,790
what it's going to do. But I know I can stay silent for five seconds, which is great, because,

00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:53,301
if I can remain silent for five seconds, I can just do this. Right, so anyway, here's

00:15:53,301 --> 00:15:58,090
some folks who have absolutely been able to spend a lot of time enjoying carefree shoe

00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:02,620
free living. I think there's probably a beach in their future. And you can't really wear

00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:07,980
shoes on the beach. It just doesn't work at all. Also, I do find that you want something

00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,930
that will secure your shoes very well, because you want to protect yourself from angry light

00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:19,350
bulbs. They're very dangerous. I really just kind of feel like this is one of those things

00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:24,270
that's gonna just hit me in the head later that I didn't have anything to say about that.

00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:29,940
I do think I can poll some Australians. Do any Australians agree with me about the detriment

00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:37,250
of laces right now? Any Australians in the audience? Yes! All right. You'll notice here

00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:42,510
the gentleman on the right has no laces. He's wearing some loafers. The creature on the

00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:47,890
left has no shoes so avoiding the lace problem all together. Laces are irrelevant in a situation

00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:53,840
like this because your feet are tiny and where are you walking? Nowhere. You don't need them.

00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:59,900
This is some items you can use in lieu of laces if you want to. You can quickly tie

00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:06,280
the cables up around the shoe in whatever fashion you might imagine. Kids really don't

00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:16,270
eat enough dirt, and by dirt, I mean new ideas about how to be. And honestly, you probably

00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:26,880
aren't gonna believe this. That slide, um, really, that shade of green? Anyway.

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:33,850
I'm from Kentucky. And I might note that I have dined at Harlan Sander's wife's dinner

00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:42,059
house. They didn't wear laces there either. This is what my laces look like after I walk

00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:50,220
around all day. I do need a book to teach me. I would feel a lot better about myself.

00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,350
And I think that's really what this is about. You got to boost yourself. Thank you. This

00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,419
has been fantastic, everybody. [ Cheers and Applause ]

00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:09,450
>> Ernie, my gosh! Ernie! This is exceptional. Oh! I mean, my gosh. Just, I cannot begin

00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:15,410
to tell you just how much of a problem this is presenting to me. I mean, really friends.

00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:19,700
Really. Well, here we are. Here we are. We've got

00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:26,970
another two opportunities here and another couple of volunteers, but do any of you have

00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:33,870
anything that you would like to really speak on today? Brittany does. Then Brittany, come

00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:37,919
on down, if you would. Let's give a hand for Brittany. She's got a compelling presentation

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,119
she would like to share. This is exceptional. Brittany, please. Please.

00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:50,090
>> I hope I won't regret this. >> Regret this? Please. I don't know what

00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:56,360
you could possibly regret. But for Brittany, if you could, Brittany, do you have a topic

00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,029
that you would like to talk about today? >> I was hoping I could talk a little bit

00:19:00,029 --> 00:19:07,970
about teletubbies. >> Hold on. I have your presentation here.

00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:25,129
In that case, if you could. >> My favorite teletubby is TinkyWinky. In

00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:31,870
the beginning of the show, they frolic in this beautiful meadow. And Lala comes out

00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:37,230
and greets everyone and is really excited. Especially Dave Franco, who is apparently

00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:48,100
in stock photos these days. And then the beautiful sun baby comes out and advertises to children

00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:53,750
some new things. The teletubbies have these screens in their bellies and sometimes babies

00:19:53,750 --> 00:20:00,629
will be eating tacos. I don't know why. I'm obviously wearing very large pants today,

00:20:00,629 --> 00:20:06,350
so I don't know why this slide is here, but it's okay. This man, though, is not wearing

00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:14,369
any pants and he also likes the teletubbies. And this is actually from a cut educational

00:20:14,369 --> 00:20:18,220
film that was in the middle of one of the episodes. The Brits were not happy about it

00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:24,330
and 82% of children were scarred when they first saw it so they had to delete that episode.

00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:31,950
And in later broadcasts, they replace it with an educational film about cows that live in

00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:39,820
the sea. They are a rare breed of cow. And Mr. T polled 5% of British children, and 100%

00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:48,480
of those children loved it. So, we actually know that spaniels are the

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:54,559
dog of royalties, however, cats believe that they are. And where are teletubbies from?

00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:03,740
A monarchy. When you watch the Teletubbies, the number of brain cells that you have decreases

00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:10,850
over time, which is why your children are drones after they watch it.

00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:17,549
That's why there's been a surge of toilet thefts in the united kingdom since 1995. Sometimes,

00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:24,710
though, all four of the Teletubbies like to get on that thing that I don't know how to

00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:31,159
spell and go towards the beautiful sun. I can't say that word. Oikophobia, there I did

00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:38,600
it. An irrational fear of household appliances. 90% of injuries in in children are due to

00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:49,080
them trying to take televisions and put them into their own bellies. The Teletubbies are

00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:58,559
sometimes confused with the wiggles, which are an Australian kiddy rock group. The wiggles

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:03,749
do not dress up like animals, but they sing a lot of songs about animals. So, mothers

00:22:03,749 --> 00:22:07,380
who are fans of the wiggles because they think they're hot show up in weird costumes. It's

00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:16,860
a thing. Make your choice, though. Which do you prefer? The wiggles or the Teletubbies?

00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:24,529
Teletubbies! Yes. So, the next time you're watching, remember that it could be worse.

00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:34,019
You could be kicked in the butt by the wiggles or attacked by a shark. And remember, never

00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:39,169
assume that you can put a monitor in your belly. I know this might come as a shock to

00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:45,179
some children's television shows, but we've learned enough from the beautiful British

00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:52,219
television program, the Teletubbies. [ Cheers and Applause ]

00:22:52,219 --> 00:22:57,950
>> Huge round of applause. Oh my gosh, a huge round of applause. I mean, fantastic. Fantastic.

00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:05,200
Fantastic. This is exceptional. Well, here we are. We're in the last and final of all

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:11,159
of our contestants. So, if I could, I'd like to bring up a particular individual that I

00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:17,070
am really looking forward to. I feel like of all the things this individual is just

00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:23,700
the captivating nature of what they have to say, the flow, just the thread that they bring

00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,379
and tie things together is masterful. So, I think you should hold this individual to

00:23:27,379 --> 00:23:34,759
higher esteem and higher regard and higher expectation level than anyone else. So, I

00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:44,100
would now like to introduce our last and final. And this is an individual by the name of Brandon

00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:49,830
weaver. Brandon Weaver. [ Applause ]

00:23:49,830 --> 00:24:00,149
Brandon, please. Brandon, I'm so glad you could join us today

00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:15,879
as the closing keynote at the ignite roulette, this is just jimany criolas. From the back,

00:24:15,879 --> 00:24:35,149
give me the title of your favorite talk this conference. Louder! Say it louder. Don't?

00:24:35,149 --> 00:24:40,849
Did you catch that? >> Yes, it's the cream of the crop.

00:24:40,849 --> 00:24:45,330
>> Of course it is. Very good. Well then, for our last and final keynote presentation

00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:50,069
in ignite roulette, Brandon, if you could, please.

00:24:50,069 --> 00:24:54,889
>> Yes. Sorbet. I love all the stuff that Stripe has been doing with Sorbet. It's such

00:24:54,889 --> 00:25:02,619
a magnificent concept. You get to talk about this because I have done some reading. Honestly,

00:25:02,619 --> 00:25:07,940
it's a grave mistake to put me on stage with any type of things I can make puns about,

00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:12,750
because that's probably what I'm going to do, because that's how I earn my stripes.

00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:17,279
And of course, I have a lot of accidents when I do these type of things, as you can already

00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:23,700
see me going at this microphone. Don't put me near staplers or fires, because life is

00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:30,309
like a potato. It's a spud. It's appealing. It fries. It's everything!

00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:35,940
But, after this, we'll have to jet. We'll have to go back home and it's so sad that

00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:40,200
we don't have time to talk about Sorbet and the magnificent work that Stripe is doing,

00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:47,669
and I work at a competitor. The three Ws, I believe and I'm hoping that RubyConf can

00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:53,059
be in Wisconsin next year so we can actually have this conversation. But there will be

00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:56,330
an accident on the way here. Somebody will be late. Hopefully somebody's car doesn't

00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:01,200
catch on fire. That happened one year. Do you remember that one? No. So.

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:10,049
Oh my, are we going there? No, no, no. Lee that alone. Leave that alone. Okay. We're

00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:18,059
leaving that W alone. Okay. Maybe we are going there in a different way. See in he got a

00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:25,630
stripe, just not the type he was expecting. It takes a great deal of wisdom to put something

00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:30,519
like this together, and especially a great deal of wisdom to work with static typing.

00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:36,830
It's a great pickle to solve and think about. How in the world do you make something like

00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:42,539
that work is fascinating. Just absolutely incredible. I mean, I would

00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:47,919
love to meat the people that are working on this, because there's a lot at steak to work

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:58,360
with this. I honestly just fall for them all the time! It's a parachute of all things.

00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:04,289
I hope that there's no catches here... Because the hemorrhoid cream sales per capita

00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:11,499
after this happens will be off the charts... what happened to Russia? Geez! Okay.

00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:18,049
New strategy, new strategy, ignoring Russia. That terrifies me. Good lord! Static typing.

00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:22,920
We're going to go with RBS files that will take a little bit of work, because the universe

00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:27,769
is constructed from elements produced by a massive explosion caused by microwaving a

00:27:27,769 --> 00:27:34,269
can of Pepsi. I kind of want to try that now. I'm more of a coke person. I have a feeling

00:27:34,269 --> 00:27:41,070
I'm going to have to book it off stage afterwards, because this talk has been very well grounded

00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:46,700
in Ruby. Quite eloquent. Yeah. You're probably want to get those looked at for the hemorrhoids,

00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:53,429
but we will ignore that because that slide is disturbing me. It's a recurring dream of

00:27:53,429 --> 00:27:59,869
mine, the gorilla in the room. Why do you keep bringing these slides up? It's cruel.

00:27:59,869 --> 00:28:06,259
It's a bit of a stretch up here, though, isn't it?

00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:12,929
I like doing poses. Poses are fun. But, back to Sorbet. See, I'm distractable, and I need

00:28:12,929 --> 00:28:18,539
an uplifting talk about this. Because the wait is over, static typing is in Ruby, and

00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:28,739
we will get it in 3.0. Greet my fist, thou artless toad spotted wench. Shakespearean.

00:28:28,739 --> 00:28:35,139
I'm honestly not sure what to do with this. But thank you. Thank you all.

00:28:35,139 --> 00:28:40,419
[ Cheers and Applause ]

00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:45,200
>> So thank you so much. If I can have all five of our contestants up real quick. Please

00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:53,450
welcome them to the stage! All five of our contestants. Very good! All right. If we could,

00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:57,769
let's determine our winner for today. Our winner for today, and this is gonna be done

00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:05,009
by applause. So, if you could, applause for our winner today. So, first, well, not in

00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:11,500
order, but if I could hear it for Evan Phoenix. [ Applause ]

00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,869
And next on our list was Sarah!

00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:20,410
[ Applause ] And Ernie Miller.

00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:30,330
If I could hear it for Brittany! And if I could for Brandon. Very good. I think

00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:34,519
you're all winners in my mind. So, thank you so much for coming. I'll send you something

00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:39,049
very, very nice. All right. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. All right!

00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:45,400
Well, here we are. Our time has run out. But if I could, I'll go to this mic if it's all

00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:52,460
right. Maybe. There we are. All right. So, I want to thank all of you so very, very,

00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:56,609
very much for coming to the last three days of the plenary. I hope that you had a phenomenal

00:29:56,609 --> 00:30:02,529
time in these short 30 minutes that we had as a group. Now, my name is Adam Cuppy, I

00:30:02,529 --> 00:30:08,789
look a little like that on the internet. I am happy to be part of your welcoming committee

00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:13,559
into the community. A raise of hands if this is your first Ruby conference that you have

00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:18,330
ever attended. Fantastic. I want you to keep your hand up if you feel like you've been

00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:24,710
welcomed into the community well. Fantastic. A round of applause for that.

00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:30,980
[ Applause ] Well, thank you so very much again. Like I

00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:35,120
said, my name is Adam Cuppy, and I need to give a big thanks to not only the organizers

00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:40,679
but to the team that I'm a part of. I'm from a company called Zeal. We build software with

00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:46,510
teams all over the country. They helped me put a lot of work into making all of this

00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:51,830
possible, mostly by letting me do what I'm doing today. I need to give a big thank you

00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:55,960
to all of them. If you're watching, great. Otherwise I hope you have the opportunity

00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,799
to do that later. Last but not least, you are gonna see on the

00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:05,750
survey that there's a question related to how well you felt kind of going into the afternoon.

00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:13,600
If you didn't know, a big part of this is to make sure that you're catapolted with energy,

00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,809
because that will affect the speakers. Your feedback is essential, not just to that question,

00:31:18,809 --> 00:31:23,780
but the whole thing. I know surveys, you might get them a lot, but please take the time.

00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:32,350
It does help. Otherwise there's a lot of hunting and pecking and guessing in the dark. Thank

00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:36,919
you so much for being around and entertaining me to let me entertain you. Have a wonderful

00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:41,230
