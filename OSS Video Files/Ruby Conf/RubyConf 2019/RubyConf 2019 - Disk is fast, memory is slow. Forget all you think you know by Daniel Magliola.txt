Adding metrics to your code should effectively have no impact on performance.


When we were recently tasked with doing that in multi-process Ruby servers, we ran into an interesting challenge: could we aggregate our numbers across processes without blowing our target of just one microsecond of overhead?



The months of work that followed had us looking into C extensions, segfault dumps, memory maps, syscall timings, and pretty much everything we could think of to try and achieve our objective.



In the process, we found some very counter-intuitive performance results that I'd like to share with you.
