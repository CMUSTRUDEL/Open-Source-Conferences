thank you for having me here so my name

00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,810
is Renee Devore's knee and you all

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,640
noticed I'm a girl in fact according

00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:30,800
some research he's probably the first

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,770
thing you noticed about me the second

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,120
was probably my rice white I'm not going

00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,440
to say much about that but I am going to

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,809
talk about the fact that I'm a girl I'm

00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,269
an independent consultant I do Ruby on

00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:44,000
Rails development in Seattle and I'm

00:00:41,269 --> 00:00:46,489
going to talk to you about who's why for

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,559
you so this is a common phrase that I've

00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:50,510
heard bandied about and I've been asked

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,920
him have you ever been you know asked

00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,960
this at a conference and the answer is

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,170
yes I have been asked who you here with

00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,460
and this was what was implied so what am

00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,689
I going to talk to you about today I'm

00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:03,799
going to talk to you about why I'm

00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:06,260
talking to you and what what our problem

00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:07,970
is as I see it I'm gonna tell you some

00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,850
stories I've got a little data but

00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:12,439
really i'm here to tell you some stories

00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:14,720
and I'm gonna talk to you about what we

00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:16,790
can do about it and and why you should

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,409
care hopefully you'll get that all right

00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:23,630
so Who am I here are some titles a lot

00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:26,869
of which I've had recently and they are

00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:31,390
titles that are not usually on a woman a

00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:34,960
CTO engineer developer entrepreneur and

00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:36,950
here are some other titles that I have

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,829
my hobbies have a bit of an adrenaline

00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:41,780
junkie i've recently gotten too big

00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:43,009
mountain climbing and i'm very

00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,560
interested in the history of it i think

00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:48,920
i've grabbed every book out there on

00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:51,679
Everest k2 and anna poorna and I'd love

00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,749
to talk to you about that offline but

00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:55,249
you know I've also tried to look into

00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:58,700
the history of women in mountaineering

00:01:55,249 --> 00:02:00,590
and I there's anecdotes here and there

00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,749
you hear about women out there when I'm

00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,549
out in the mountain I'm frequently the

00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:06,020
only one I'm frequently like with a

00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:09,200
small group of people or the only people

00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:12,350
in you know miles and miles but um you

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,870
know it's I have hobbies and I do work

00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:17,470
in fields whether or not a lot of women

00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:20,120
and so what does that resulted in um

00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,860
alright so interruption number one

00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,510
implies that there's an eruption number

00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,760
two and there's not so I was going to

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:28,480
have us all kind of stand up and do

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,099
something but I'm not for saving time

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,670
this has got to do this in 20 minutes so

00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:32,810
I'm in a book

00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,040
I'm just going to tell you what I was

00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:35,840
going to have everybody do so I was

00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,980
gonna have everybody get up and have all

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,349
the people that were wearing glasses

00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:41,900
come over here I'll people that are not

00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:43,580
wearing glasses get over here and so

00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,410
what I was going to talk about is when

00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:49,370
I'm not wearing contacts and the privacy

00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:51,080
of my home I wear glasses and I fight

00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,970
glasses for a long time I'm blind as a

00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,730
bat without them and something I've

00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:58,040
found happens when you're a room with or

00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:00,319
a sleepover or whatever other people

00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,760
with glasses you somehow end up talking

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:06,800
about it and switching glasses and and

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,080
inevitably somebody goes oh my god how

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,430
do you see these declaring the winner of

00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:15,049
a game I like to call how blind are you

00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,220
so this happens and what I was going to

00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:19,040
have people do if we were all standing

00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:21,110
and separated by glasses I had a plant

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,940
in the audience who was gonna go over

00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:25,069
she was wearing glasses she's gonna go

00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,870
over the group without glasses and I was

00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:28,760
gonna say hey you know what she can no

00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:30,920
longer play the game there's nobody in

00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,959
that group that has any glasses on she

00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,940
can't do this so she's got to find

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,010
something else in common with that group

00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:39,920
and that's gonna be a big theme i'ma

00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:42,380
talk to you about is commonality humans

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,390
were social we're very social we want to

00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:46,489
hang out with people like us with a

00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,260
similar background when you go into a

00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:51,260
room of people you don't know anybody

00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,579
you tend to gravitate towards those you

00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,680
think you're going to get along with and

00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:57,019
you make sometimes really snap judgments

00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,790
about who those people are I think we

00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:01,040
did a little bit and The Improv of the

00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:03,920
first day yesterday where you know you

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,170
judge people right you think about who

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,620
do I have what the most in common with

00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:12,170
so when I go into a room of developers I

00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:14,180
have I have development experience I

00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:16,430
have something in common with them I can

00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:19,340
make that assumption but there's usually

00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:24,979
not another girl in that room frequently

00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:26,600
so keep this in mind commonality I will

00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:29,000
get back to that so I am going to talk a

00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:32,539
little bit about some numbers and these

00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,870
are numbers from 2009 about the

00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:38,780
workforce in America and broken down by

00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:41,659
gender so there's actually a majority of

00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:44,539
women in our workforce today these these

00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:44,849
numbers are from 09 but it's trended so

00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:47,159
it

00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:52,830
current there are currently more women

00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:54,479
working than men ok so in July of 2010

00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:56,459
about a year ago the Atlantic Monthly

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,580
published an article that was called the

00:04:56,459 --> 00:05:03,029
end of men and it talked about the

00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,379
changing US economy and how it's heading

00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:08,339
towards kind of a service oriented

00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:11,069
economy and this dominance of women

00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:12,419
being employed over men and there was

00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:14,939
some really interesting points in there

00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:17,490
one of which i'll point out i'd suggest

00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:20,519
go read the article was interesting was

00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:22,800
that parents are seeing for their young

00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:25,229
girls a lot more opportunity for young

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,599
girls in the workforce today and they

00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:29,159
kind of extrapolate it on that so i saw

00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:30,689
this and was like wow that's that's

00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:34,309
pretty cool so there should be more

00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:37,279
women you know working with me right no

00:05:34,309 --> 00:05:40,559
this is computer science and information

00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:43,409
technology fields I've brevi ated its CS

00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:46,949
fields as twenty five percent women huh

00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:48,749
so these are kind of extrapolated down

00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:50,939
from what they call STEM fields science

00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:53,999
technology engineering and math which

00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:56,490
are gearing towards most of them are

00:05:53,999 --> 00:05:58,110
actually fifty percent better a little

00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,240
worse but around that number and

00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:03,209
computers anything having to do with

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,300
computers computer engineering this is

00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:11,909
the number its twenty five percent so

00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:15,269
okay not a lot of women and so one of

00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:17,099
those things the num titles I had up

00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:19,769
there with CTO I do a lot with the

00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:22,860
startup community all of us we're all

00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:24,959
developers we work in a CS related field

00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:28,879
so that first number probably applies to

00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:31,469
everybody at the field we are all in and

00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:35,069
most of us are a good number of us work

00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:37,579
with startups VC funded startups the

00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:42,149
number of VC funded startups with

00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:46,169
founding women eight percent yeah the

00:06:42,149 --> 00:06:49,229
end of men is not here ok so I can talk

00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:51,719
to you a lot about numbers and regale

00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:53,490
you with the you know statistics and

00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:56,819
whatnot and try and make the point that

00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:58,710
way but I've seen a number of people

00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:02,340
touch on this issue a lot of

00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:04,920
a lot of men at conferences one great

00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:07,410
talk is erin o'brien who she gave a talk

00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,820
it's got a true v comp and she's

00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:11,550
actually talking with me I diversity

00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:14,310
panel at my Rocky Mountain Ruby and a

00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:18,120
couple weeks and she's not a developer

00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:20,310
so I've seen talks and people address

00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,070
this issue who aren't female developers

00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:24,780
so that's really why I'm here is I'm a

00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,970
female developer I've had these

00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,190
experiences i'm in your community i'm

00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:32,700
going to tell you what it's like so the

00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:34,740
next couple of slides are anecdotes they

00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,900
are all true they have all happened to

00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,970
me and they've all happened in the Ruby

00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,200
and startup community except one I put

00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,480
it in because it's funny and I'll tell

00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,800
you which one it is but so I'm going to

00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,710
go through these anecdotes and I've

00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:49,890
borrowed from my favorite cartoon as a

00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:51,540
kid was Animaniacs so anybody as a kid

00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:55,050
or even as an adult who's watching

00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:57,330
animaniacs great all right so there was

00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:01,740
a segment my favorite segments that was

00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:04,680
called good I'd be a bad idea so I've

00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:10,050
put my anecdotes which are true into

00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:15,450
this format and here we go good idea bad

00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:17,610
idea good idea alright so we're

00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:19,950
professional attire to work this is a

00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:22,140
shirt available on Ruby threads I have

00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:30,240
it I think it's great we've seen a lot

00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:32,190
of women he Swan that idea all right so

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,140
now you think I'm exaggerating okay

00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:37,710
she's she's talked it up for the talk

00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:41,040
the Darth Vader shirt that is the actual

00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:43,440
t-shirt worn on the first day of work by

00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:47,310
a colleague of mine his very first day

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:50,490
of work yeah so I'm gonna skip a little

00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:53,760
bit ahead and say why should you care he

00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:55,620
is known in my head as Pia shirt man do

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,200
you really want to be known as his shirt

00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,000
man you know many hoops he had to Jos go

00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,160
through with me so that I would give him

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,010
any kind of respect after this really

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,170
first day of work and that's the shirt

00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:09,380
you pick

00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:11,810
okay also I have two shirts up there

00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,490
about a year later he was promoted and

00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:15,980
the week of his promotion he came in

00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:18,740
this work with a shirt that had hardcore

00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,089
porn on it I did not put hardcore porn

00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:23,510
on their I don't want Kobe to have to

00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:25,820
publish that however actual point of

00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:29,060
view real life pictures in color on his

00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:35,870
shirt so I'm going to continue on not

00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:38,360
exaggerating all right I like getting

00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:41,060
compliments on my code if I do he'll

00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:45,980
give me some feedback on the great that

00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:48,589
idea belapur cometh compliment the dope

00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:51,589
on a diet yes this happened oh you're

00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:57,190
looking great really at work somebody I

00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:57,190
don't really know guy Thanks good idea

00:09:57,459 --> 00:10:03,589
all right yeah its work I push code all

00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,810
the time you know you want to talk to me

00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:07,040
about that or my ideas on there I think

00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:09,019
that's good in a professional

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,160
environment the the point i'm going to

00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:12,230
make about all of this is kind of

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,699
professionalism and having that level of

00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:15,890
professionalism when were in the office

00:10:13,699 --> 00:10:17,660
interacting with each other at the bar

00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:20,050
even at a conference kind of your own

00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:26,149
your own career on the line there

00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:27,529
professionalism the office that idea it

00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:29,420
was built for a third degree about her

00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:31,730
new boyfriend yeah I got a new boyfriend

00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:34,220
and that was like half an hour

00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:35,600
conversation like well I put an end to

00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,880
it but I was like really you're gonna

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,589
grope me on this like I barely get

00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,019
feedback about the code i push you don't

00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:44,360
know what I do every day and and this is

00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:46,940
what sure to ask you though also I think

00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,130
there was a somebody put a thing out

00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:51,529
there saying if anybody can get a naked

00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:54,730
man into a talk at ruby conference so I

00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:54,730
think someone else be a drink

00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:04,800
use professional language okay so this

00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:06,960
one was not actually from the Ruby

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,870
community in startup world this was at a

00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:12,980
big corporation I was consulting for but

00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:16,230
it's too funny i knew that idea i

00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:26,040
actually got this line in an email who's

00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:28,200
your sequel daddy really good idea usual

00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:31,440
istic taste test data this is like from

00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:35,190
scaffold i just threw it in there Kyle's

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,680
works but I did I can try the example

00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:40,580
but this I actually ran across this in

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,560
code I changed it as soon as I saw it

00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:46,770
don't do that think about what you're

00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:49,890
you're writing so there is a problem it

00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:52,080
exists in our community there are some

00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:53,400
things we can do to fix it but it's here

00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,550
just because you work for a small

00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:58,380
company or you're in a really great open

00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,480
source community like Ruby community it

00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:03,810
does not mean it doesn't happen here we

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,460
need to be more aware of it so booking

00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:08,250
why should you care you don't want to be

00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:10,380
known as penis shirt men I'm going to

00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:12,630
briefly talk about we want our

00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:14,310
development team space to be smarter

00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:17,700
more innovative there's some interesting

00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:20,880
research out there that says more women

00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:23,910
on the team has a kind of group higher

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,860
IQ not full women teams but having more

00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,570
women on the team something about social

00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,340
interactions I'm gonna let you go how to

00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:34,470
read the article and i'll refer to it

00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:36,630
cuz i got a book through more diversity

00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:38,700
on the team I think innovation really

00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:40,590
comes people with different backgrounds

00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:44,010
on the team different ideas different

00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:46,080
opinions from yourself some kind of you

00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:48,089
know differences you can talk about

00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,880
those you have more to kind of bring to

00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:53,430
the table you know either specialties

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:57,360
and different languages which I also

00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:59,250
talked about OSS community I think these

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,230
are kind of the gold standards of the

00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:03,360
OSS community and what we should strive

00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:06,000
for being inclusive collaborative and

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,810
innovative my opinion is that in that

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,550
order I think that gives us the best

00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:13,550
innovations we can talk about that more

00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:19,410
vulnerable all right so we are all

00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:21,210
developers I know personally myself when

00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:23,550
I write code I put a little piece of

00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:26,310
myself in there I take pride in my work

00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:29,040
and open sourcing things putting your

00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:30,900
code out there to have other people look

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,330
at it I think all of us in that route in

00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,950
the room understand that vulnerability

00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,510
you put it out there you're making

00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:39,360
yourself vulnerable we work in a

00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:41,400
vulnerable in this industry it is a

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,920
creative process and when you open

00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:46,230
source and put your code out there

00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:48,860
you're making yourself vulnerable my

00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:50,820
point here is keep in mind that there's

00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,080
there's maybe some additional

00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,090
vulnerabilities and an additional

00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:57,240
baggage that some of us bring to the

00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:59,070
table that aren't always there that

00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,740
always excuse me that aren't always as

00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:04,350
obvious as what we all experience in

00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:08,220
terms of our ability that's my point

00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:11,010
about open source what can you do all

00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:13,710
right so I snagged the slide from Palo

00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:17,150
who I saw at conferencia rails this year

00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:21,210
he was talking about Java and Ruby and

00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:23,280
kind of different tools for the job two

00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:26,430
things he did well one thing in general

00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:29,750
he did through his talk was he talked

00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:32,670
about an aeronautical engineer and

00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:37,680
developer and referred to both as she

00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:40,320
and her using the female pronouns which

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,450
stood out to me as a woman it spoke to

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,160
me I talked to a bit about it afterwards

00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:46,500
um it seemed like he was really

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,510
practicing what he preached he was aware

00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,250
of an issue thank God he made himself

00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:53,010
and maybe some people in the audience a

00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:55,050
little uncomfortable by doing that but

00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:58,290
it was an acknowledgement and kind of a

00:14:55,050 --> 00:15:00,600
reach out which I appreciated and think

00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:03,270
generalist you know if I told you all

00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,070
sub grade seven programming languages in

00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:06,420
the seven or eight weeks do a little

00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,920
Erlang programming it'll make you a

00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,570
better programmer you probably wouldn't

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:13,710
argue with me if I told you go read a

00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:16,530
feminist blog which I will later okay or

00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:19,050
you know I invite the woman on your team

00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:20,880
if there is one to pair with you or even

00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:22,860
a business analyst if she's the only

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,690
woman in your office to come and write a

00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,190
cucumber test with you it'll make you a

00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,930
better programmer you might argue with

00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:31,620
me why

00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:35,000
thing think outside the box of it all

00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:40,529
right so one thing stop apologizing um

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:43,470
you know there's a sorry type all right

00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:45,870
move on learn from it you know I threw a

00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:47,970
minute one t-shirt not everybody knows

00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:50,279
what that means and but you know what

00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:52,080
you go to your everybody's talking about

00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:54,120
Oh minutes one minute one okay so you go

00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,649
google it secretly you pretend and then

00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,540
he goes google it secretly and you find

00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:58,920
out you know if I tell you hey you know

00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,350
what you said something sexist or

00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,420
offensive to me do you go google it do

00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:06,360
you go ask me later do you figure out

00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:10,140
what the what the issue was think about

00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:16,800
that next time alright so break down

00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:18,630
barriers mentor encourage and teach do a

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,959
railsbridge if there's a woman on your

00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:23,820
team work with her and courage her if

00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:26,070
there's some kind of minority in your

00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:28,920
workplace that you can reach out to do

00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:30,420
it just make the effort railsbridge is

00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,700
an excellent program to get more women

00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:35,850
into computer science you do not have to

00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:39,360
be a woman to teach at it or to t8 or to

00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:41,390
have that mentorship just do it you'll

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,920
learn something it's a great way of

00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:47,400
improving your own skills is to reach

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,910
out and and take that initiative alright

00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:52,380
so my my two big points where

00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:54,660
commonality think about the things that

00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:56,220
you have in common with who you work

00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,200
with and maybe some of the things that

00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:02,310
you don't have in common find out more

00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:04,920
about them learn and realize that you

00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:08,550
know not everybody is the same as you

00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:10,679
and just be aware and that vulnerability

00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:12,900
that we all have I think we work in a

00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:15,929
vulnerable industry I think what we do

00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:19,230
makes us vulnerable and remember that

00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:21,750
kind of extra baggage that we have when

00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:25,140
we interact in certain certain instances

00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:28,309
either male female or black white or

00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:30,450
poor rich there's a lot of that that we

00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:32,460
can't acknowledge we can't talk about

00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:35,820
and kind of you know everything is

00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:38,820
hunky-dory it's not think about it in

00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:40,710
second alright so I wanted to throw

00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,280
these up that's an excellent suggestion

00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:43,530
mrs.

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,420
triggs but one of them perhaps one of

00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:48,120
the many here would like to make it this

00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:53,640
still happens be aware funny cartoon

00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:57,090
it's unfortunately true you tend to be

00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:59,880
the stereotype the the one in the room

00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:01,260
representing everyone i am kind of put

00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,450
myself out there and speaking for all

00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:06,180
women which I might get yelled at I by

00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:08,070
not we'll see but you know just remember

00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:09,390
that this exists in you sometimes make

00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:12,350
snap judgments about a whole community

00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:16,410
but you shouldn't I get uncomfortable

00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:17,670
let's see this was my awful bullet point

00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:21,750
slide that was really just did I say

00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:25,440
everything I wanted to say be less blind

00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:27,780
out there there's skip ahead my

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,210
resources the very first one I have up

00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:33,060
there is actually an article about race

00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:36,000
he meant mentions gender in there but it

00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:37,410
was I thought a really excellent article

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,350
that i would say asked all of you go

00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:43,500
read and it was don't be colorblind

00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:46,050
don't be gender blind nobody else to the

00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:49,290
room is we all see it we all notice it

00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:53,400
you know I'm a woman I can't hide that

00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:55,650
from you acknowledge it be aware and

00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,330
stop saying you know oh I treat

00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:02,550
everybody the same we are different

00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:05,430
think about that so geeked feminism we

00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:07,440
wiki there's a resources for allies i

00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:09,210
would suggest go out take a look if

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,490
anything I've said is resonated with you

00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:12,960
go take a look just see what people are

00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:14,070
saying you don't have to join the

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,810
conversation you don't even have to

00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,400
acknowledge you can clear your browser

00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:20,340
history and never acknowledge what you

00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,230
went there but go check it out see see

00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:24,360
what the conversation is about see if

00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:27,740
there's something that resonates with

00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:31,100
you you'll learn something I guarantee

00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:34,470
um women write about this all the time

00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:36,510
we share these things on dev chicks with

00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:38,790
each other and sometimes we don't bring

00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:41,640
them to the broader community and you

00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:43,830
it's like putting the onus on on men in

00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,050
the room to go look well I'm putting the

00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:47,700
onus on you go look it's out there we

00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:49,350
talk about these things you could

00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,520
probably you may even find something

00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:52,620
that you've done on there and be like

00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,180
whoa that's not what I meant but you

00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,190
never had that opportunity to have the

00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:58,940
conversation

00:19:55,190 --> 00:20:01,400
so go look and there's lots of

00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:03,350
statistics about this I studied

00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:06,920
economics in college along with computer

00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:10,490
science and physics so I do a lot of a

00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:12,410
lot of non women's type things and and

00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:14,420
I'm always interested in data and

00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:17,210
statistics there's lots out there that

00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:20,110
hinted the problem and Tim really wanted

00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:20,110
to say something so Merlin

00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,820
thank you Tim I thank you

00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:10,039
brighter planet is a cloud-based

00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:12,919
computation platform so we provide an

00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:14,509
API for developers to build complex

00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:16,820
scientific calculations into their

00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:18,200
applications pretty easily one big

00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:21,320
client we have is MasterCard

00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:24,139
international and they have a

00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:26,269
partnership with us where users of

00:21:24,139 --> 00:21:27,769
corporate cards who charge things like

00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:30,889
flights and hotel rooms onto their

00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:33,860
corporate card all those pieces of data

00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:36,909
go into a big database and we go in and

00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:38,840
using all those details calculate the

00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:40,490
environmental impact of all those

00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,679
different activities and put that

00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:44,330
information back in a database so the

00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:45,799
users of these corporate cards can use

00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:47,899
that information for making energy

00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:50,139
efficiency adjustments and corporate

00:21:47,899 --> 00:21:50,139
reporting

00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,780
