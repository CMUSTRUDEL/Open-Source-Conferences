coming to the country and they all go

00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:29,390

00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:45,080
personal to me there's a big in small

00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:48,169

00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:53,419
skinny butt crack rocks and then you

00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,790
listen to what is basically these little

00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:58,550
kids were broken city you might have one

00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:01,460

basketball player that's all that

00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:11,090
difficult out and you know someone that

00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:13,520
you no harm i'm a nervousness well but

00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:15,950
guess what you know what is on learn

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,200
what I've done and my cat success is

00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,970
actually working and I don't have to

00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,800
worry about for my next patients coming

00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:24,650
from or where I'm going to live

00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,150
today I don't work out that we're trying

00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:28,099
to move the negative stereotypes and

00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,870
actually being smart and one of the

00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:31,639
reasons happens is because we have to

00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,800
impress people and I'm going to get all

00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:37,280
romantic with guys but if you oppress

00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,720
people they are actually taught that you

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,460
know what success is not a good thing

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:45,370
because we are so we all won't fail so I

00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,960
want to ask everyone what we've been

00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:49,789

little bit of history was hard I always

told myself actually just two more top

00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:10,200
spice thai wounded I won't feel the top

00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:18,780
talks where I at each kind of than this

00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:21,390
now what I'm going to do an excellent

00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:23,880
for everyone do was talk like Bob Harper

00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:26,370
flash your girls Compton talk where he

00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,680
had good boss they just walked around a

00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:31,940
spot on the stage you're going on going

00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:37,740
home wherever I wanted to Devil's child

00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:39,600

there are also always going to do is

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,190
talk where it's like an ass so this talk

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,860
actually does have five acts and we are

00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:49,650
an act number three and it's kind of

00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,810
reflected with hood and the reason I'm

00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:53,460
talking about this is on I know just be

00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:57,570
recording and I want to be able to show

00:11:53,460 --> 00:12:00,750
that people but hey its own like me get

00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:03,480
on stage and ramble 25-30 minutes so

00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:07,620
that's made my mom's my head here I just

00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:10,110
still grow it better not having so I

00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:12,810
wouldn't stop this story without me cuz

00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:18,060
I'm actually bramwell's from come and

00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:20,480
you guys so I started off with 11 feet

00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:23,010
of three might work on puter grades

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,130
maybe you might know about his other

00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:29,010
name scratch faces anyone you're having

00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:31,290
crashing yeah yes I brought a copy

00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:34,380
wannabes and I have to give it up to my

00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:35,930
father II he was great for when he grew

00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,420
up he actually wants to

00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:41,860
16 live out of age because he figured

00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:44,570
killing people in rice paddies saturday

00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:47,810
so he's like in LA just call computer

00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:50,420
thing is pretty going now any idea if I

00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:52,279
don't you agree so I offered that

00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:55,190
actually I've scored up important to

00:12:52,279 --> 00:13:00,440
drive up some one single side of it then

00:12:55,190 --> 00:13:04,070
we got a thousand GL anyone visiting I'm

00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:07,190
tandy 1000 TL was an eight to eighty six

00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:14,180
because I got was a TL and it had left

00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:16,730
line come on things out and you know the

00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:19,339
first thing I did because he wanted

00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:25,940
morden burning with our first

00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:28,010
programming language was wrong see I'm

00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:29,959
going to see if I prefer inland and the

00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:32,180
reason why my father spent all this

00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:34,550
money on programming things are these

00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:36,410
books they came in like blue book one

00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:42,950
for two weeks I'd love to see I thought

00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:45,800
this programming wow I love this so ever

00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:47,690
um understanding see and getting

00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,640
impacted understanding see and really

00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:53,150
being able to use it I learn a second

00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:55,640
language I think I don't probably most a

00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:58,310
blow-by-blow I'm going to see this is

00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:01,130
probably the eighties see the patch out

00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:05,360
though I could do that almost somewhere

00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:08,180
any any success I hired a copy of boring

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:12,410
plasma and I actually started writing

00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:15,020
games and the reason why i love them to

00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:19,339
bits I don't let the key change you back

00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:22,810
earlier a blue title area so is this a

00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:25,370
little special about what about this so

00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:27,820
we were little bit I'm not only twenty

00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:30,520

do they fit in tables holes so I did and

00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:03,149
actually scored between 71 s 18 you know

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,790
kids to understand the significance of

00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:08,850
this mr. essence because they realize

00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:11,040

00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,030
piece of an answer wrong you know

00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:27,750
working at home in ATT this is a

00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:30,390
synthesis living it's me because at this

00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:33,480
time back to the 90 we knew the tests

00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:35,429
were they were clear bodies against

00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,470
minorities we knew this because we

00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:40,500
actually sleep different health problems

00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:45,179

book stops you're seeing excellent

00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:34,870
program class is awful but I hope you

00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:36,430
know the whole time I was writing this

00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:39,130
people were telling me crying you don't

00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:40,990

to use it makes it easy for others of

00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:22,760
elvers and teens become a curry and so

00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:26,360
rails project but it's a certain kind of

00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,980
idiots royal in berkeley but we need to

00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:31,100
learn to realize something one size

00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:32,840
doesn't fit all dirt inventions are your

00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,080
conventions but they're not the best

00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:38,000
inventions for me so a month is x

00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,890
 one sale of something of

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,350
commission that I guess the convention

00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:45,710
that we light now I'm skinny controller

00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:50,420
that allowed to actually had talked I

00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:52,250
don't talk about that models and so I

00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:55,520
thinking that white photography is

00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:56,960
Minnesota strange so we all kind of

00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,780
controller and we have a controller

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:04,010
could bring of math and like a house out

00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:07,700
here and in for the uninitiated kind in

00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:10,520
a rural house so with this count done

00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:15,170
with this book is on what this message

00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:17,090
does actually does is milk a nap so to

00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:20,059
the tab would I mean I need to be

00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:23,929
destiny we find our cow and then we

00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:26,870
house get a milking machine and then if

00:22:23,929 --> 00:22:28,940
we can milk a cow milk machines out of

00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:31,990
Twitter and you said it was it was not

00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:35,210
but if not exists for one and one no

00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:40,250
well the homes hitting our ball first

00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:42,800
game controller um fat model says well

00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:46,040
once we still everything she can't put

00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:49,320
in the controller this is the moment and

00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:52,800
literally so here's got away here's

00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:54,210
another minute why don't the model or

00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:59,450
the controller never need to know about

00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:59,450
movement it just says how build yourself

00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:04,020
and now the control to remove this

00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:07,410
little bit of Madison to this very

00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:09,030
simplest of all along but now just tell

00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:12,000
the cow to milk itself and if the cow

00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:17,900
milk it sells it will actually work with

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:22,230
the tri stash so why is this important

00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:25,380
low hot Marlon he creative solid in

00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:30,030
those interesting videos of space and

00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:32,550
that all this and create above solid in

00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:34,590
the Solomon Solomon had a really clear

00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:37,620
emerald ahead but one thing he always

00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:40,679
says is what I've been doing fellow we

00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:43,890
tell no mass there are two original

00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:46,710
example we were asking about milking

00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:53,910
process did I love you don't do that

00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:57,990
just tell hey Cal you so that one hey

00:23:53,910 --> 00:24:01,170
topic oh no good topic ism your business

00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:03,570
thoughts are so effective ok so back to

00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:05,309
your of better your models versus your

00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:06,690
controllers people like to take all the

00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:09,090
fun out of their controllers and put it

00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:11,550
into very heavy bomber lenses don't do

00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:14,040
that Jeroboam carriles models could

00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:15,630
actually showing eat the physical models

00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:18,120
should only be the code that actually

00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:21,120
interacts with the actual persistence or

00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:24,870
Aquarians of your of your business

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,910
pocket everything else can go another

00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:28,920
directory I'm actually a start-up a

00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:34,320
little tough personal Twitter months ago

00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:35,970
and my consensus is Catholic so I want

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,460
to get to the session at six minutes and

00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:40,710
I have like 20 more spies thank you guys

00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:44,580
for a very good painter but um so I've

00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:46,800
been coming for over 20 years and i'm

00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:50,280
home the list when you're still items of

00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:52,050
how to be an awesome so first thing i

00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:54,100
want to tell all you kids and up guys

00:24:52,050 --> 00:25:00,500
we're going to me

00:24:54,100 --> 00:25:02,270
night and it takes time intelligence is

00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,549
everyone in here in this room is

00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:07,669
probably highly intelligent but take out

00:25:04,549 --> 00:25:10,190
the DMV turn that wisdom line that you

00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:12,140
need to understand right wrong test

00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:15,830
takes long time the only gate with

00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:19,220
experience another thing is the actor me

00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:23,950
the reason for the slide we're really

00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:27,049
controversy with the Guardian versus rvm

00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:29,750
the army and the new one is Annie hat

00:25:27,049 --> 00:25:32,570
it's me but it doesn't mean we hop

00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:36,140
things just beginning to make both exist

00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:38,480
in their own little silos without any

00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:42,860
person in his women understand Gertie

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:45,980
hats are your he has another place is

00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:47,929
actual knowledge this goes to all the

00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:52,100
governors who thinks that they can

00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:54,620
program was than us and especially with

00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:56,990
the rise of the packages 50 chef and

00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:58,640
puppet here so there's a little bit of

00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:00,789
knowledge required that those it's

00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,140
actually being able to understand

00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:05,870
Russian stats and you can't just code

00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:08,750
your way around that question everything

00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:11,150
loudly in public hyper-v Twitter's all

00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:15,370
the time ulysse in the answer you in

00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:15,370
touch with read how start somewhere and

00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:22,220
then society's ills might differ that's

00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:25,100
fine but the way you make sure take the

00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:27,740
skill to be curves a lesson never enact

00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:31,370
revenge revenge make you eat bigger

00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:34,580
tonight a lot of things don't forget if

00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:35,900
there are other sparking love it we as

00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,909
developers in to think that our

00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,710
solutions are great and they are great

00:26:37,909 --> 00:26:41,630
because you're smart we build realize

00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:47,690
that sometimes there are other smart

00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:51,200
ways do anything anyone here really into

00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:54,890
machinery and religion you bite into

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:57,200
okay hoping to might have been cheap and

00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:59,210
the Bible says be humble and meek as a

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,320
development can be mean you can't be

00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:04,679
submissive you can be humble and say

00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:09,120
that's a great job good Rick knows this

00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:13,019
you have to get gas developer so I spent

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:15,330
quite a code so what we like to do is in

00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:17,730
our in our in our field as we have all

00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:22,110
of our successes are built on other

00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:25,710
people's successes so however she has to

00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:30,710
sport but we'll just say that it is good

00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:34,019
stuff of you is all it is a function of

00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:36,480
good stuff from others plus your engine

00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:38,549
ingenuity I'm actually I really do

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,919
believe this that all of our successes

00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:43,500
are built on other types of successes

00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:45,299
and always think I acknowledge that and

00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,789
we never cut constantly need to tell

00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:49,379
ourselves hey you know I need to do well

00:27:47,789 --> 00:27:51,690
they're going to accept that bounty

00:27:49,379 --> 00:27:54,480
better next time we need to brace your

00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:56,490
new books of young guys realize one day

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,750
your get married packages that you're

00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:06,450
not going to be able to of the sources

00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:07,980
12 anymore because if you work for

00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:09,990
companies to have a business side

00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:12,570
realize what they fight about you too

00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:13,559
because your code does not mean she were

00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:18,389
bringing the only things to the table

00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:21,750
they bring stuff to hope he's happy of

00:28:18,389 --> 00:28:26,029
the cave yourself if you think your best

00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:29,159
log you're probably best lock no one

00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:31,019
learns I'm gonna find a shape of a lot

00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:33,480
of us imagine that is going to kill all

00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:35,340
of us yeah Shay's hug Nicholas I decide

00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,220
is one of the get out of the attention

00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:40,889
now let's do this I actually break bones

00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:43,620
the papers reminder take a different

00:28:40,889 --> 00:28:45,410
change thought I right where I was do it

00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:47,720
I certainly and put it happening

00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:49,880
I get a long line of where I was going

00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:52,700
somehow to ash trees let's come up to my

00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:56,690
hat I'll keep looking pretty support

00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:59,360
solutions crucial people are singing

00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:02,600
come out from to speed if I understood

00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:05,300
right up here they help fires fire what

00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:08,410
we did was not the word of the Lord it

00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:12,080
was made up loose ends and look around

00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:19,390
that what you understand that exclusive

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:24,380
people are not very smart yeah dry dry

00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:28,100
is something we will attempt to achieve

00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:31,070
it is not something that we do we know

00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:33,530
that because something being drivers

00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:36,040
like having dries probably giving up

00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:40,220
things like Eastern ease of use or

00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:43,910
ability I could take a look my my talk

00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:47,360
just because one thing they're river is

00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:50,510
rooftops and off it all finishes Ruby

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:53,210
sucks at doing things in fats will you

00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:55,730
stop some things that need triple about

00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:57,800
things like tonight we didn't remember

00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:59,600
that it really is good at what it is

00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:03,770
good at but there are other solutions

00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:06,860
for elevates in next class Bobby trust

00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:08,780
Christmas I guess I closed practice the

00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:13,390
wisdom trust always trust your instincts

00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:15,620
and over 20 is ok power and this is me

00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:17,990
my love these pictures have put much

00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:19,100
like twice so then you guys there's no

00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:25,940
moon when you're missing or anything

00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:30,850
like that look I have nice in the second

00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:30,850
I guess is pretty low so thanks guys and

00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:38,500
