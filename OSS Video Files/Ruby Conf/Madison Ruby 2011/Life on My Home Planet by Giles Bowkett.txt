super brief intro my talk is called life

00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:22,080
on my home planet and if you read the

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,880
description and you happen to be

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,590
particularly cynical you might have

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,110
thought with a talk title and

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,390
description like this Giles could be

00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:32,040
talking about anything and he might in

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,270
fact have written the description before

00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,670
he decided what he was going to talk

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:39,930
about unfortunately that would be

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:42,270
exactly correct however fortunately the

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:45,180
weirdest randomest thing in the talk

00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,380
description is that I said you know one

00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,079
of the questions I'm going to talk about

00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:51,120
is do you need a goat if you're trying

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,210
to get to the moon and that actually

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,700
random crazy part is the part that I'm

00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,140
serious about that I knew what I was

00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,550
going to say about so I'm actually going

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,399
to talk to you a little bit about

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,530
writing a goat to the moon and before I

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,100
do that I want to explain where it comes

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:11,399
from so this is Mel Gibson and Danny

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,990
Glover and the concept of writing ago to

00:01:11,399 --> 00:01:16,200
the moon actually came up in a Twitter

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:19,410
discussion about Mel Gibson and someone

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,720
was saying Mel Gibson's insane alright

00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:24,240
and there are a lot of people who agree

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,069
with this point of view and in it you

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,649
know there are many reasons he has these

00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:32,459
allegations against him of homophobia

00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:35,340
racism sexism anti-semitism domestic

00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:37,830
violence and general lunacy however I

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,770
had the counter argument that you can

00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:43,380
actually admire wha Mel Gibson anyway

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:46,590
because he put together this hit movie

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,840
which was in Mayan alright and he put

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,179
together this hit movie The Passion of

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,060
the Christ which was in Aramaic Latin

00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:57,119
and Hebrew right now these languages

00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:00,660
making a movie is hard okay making a hit

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,880
movie is hard making a hit movie using

00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,410
languages that are no longer spoken to

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,649
anywhere on the face of the planet is

00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:08,910
just crazy it's ridiculous that's like

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:10,890
saying it's not enough that I'm going to

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,870
fly to the moon I'm also going to do it

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:17,190
riding on the back of a goat for no

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:19,800
reason so the thing is Mel Gibson might

00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:23,010
be crazy I am certainly not saying Mel

00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,379
Guzman is not crazy I'm not saying he is

00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,040
either but I'm saying whether crazy or

00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:28,319
not you

00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,519
you know admire the fact that he makes

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:34,890
these incredible things happen and this

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:38,340
reminds me of a really good book called

00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:41,189
purple cow and the basic idea of this

00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,379
book is in the tagline transform your

00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:45,659
business by being remarkable and it

00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:48,359
basically the idea of the book is that

00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:51,750
the only marketing worth a damn is being

00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:54,000
worth talking about and I read this book

00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,519
at about the same time that I read this

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,099
book but my job went to India and all I

00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:03,959
got was this lousy book by Chad Fowler

00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:05,730
and I haven't read the new edition but

00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,709
he rewrote the book and republished it

00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:08,939
under the passionate programmer so if

00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:10,650
you're if you're like wow this is a good

00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:12,329
talk I should check out this book it's

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,560
actually easier to find this version

00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:15,750
because that version is no longer in

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,760
print I don't actually get along with

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:23,040
this guy in person but this is a really

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:25,200
good book some of you know exactly how

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,870
much I don't get along with them but it

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,180
really is a very good book and it's

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:32,040
about how one of the best ways to you

00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,139
know have a good career as a programmer

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,359
is to create good stuff that people like

00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:38,159
right so I'm going to talk about my

00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:40,049
goats which are basically based on a

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,849
combination of the chat Fowler thing

00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:44,819
which is that if you want to have a good

00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:46,470
career create cool stuff and the purple

00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:48,419
cow thing which is that you should

00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:51,599
create really really interesting stuff

00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:54,479
is the massive paraphrase so my goats

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,340
first goat is Archaeopteryx which I

00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,310
sometimes just refer to as arcs because

00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:02,659
people can figure out how to spell it

00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:07,440
here is a quick demo if I can find it

00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:08,970
this is some music software right and

00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:14,040
this is what we were soundchecking

00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:22,289
earlier right it's a it's a drum machine

00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:26,220
basically so let's see I have to do this

00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:29,960
while looking behind me uh basically

00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,960
this is what you do you run it

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:45,590
and you get a drum and bass what you can

00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:54,560
do is actually change the code when you

00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:57,620
do okay so you can make that more

00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:16,400
interesting by changing this to around

00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:20,360
the number 10 so now what it's doing is

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:24,550
it's feeding a random number into the

00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:28,729
code which says how many drums do i play

00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:36,250
and i'll swing this on a second if you

00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:40,039
do this it introduces a lot more rent

00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:46,460
and you get like much sparser but much

00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:49,880
more varied rhythms so that's how it

00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:54,590
works and let me just come in here thank

00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:58,909
you thank you thank you very much

00:05:54,590 --> 00:06:02,210
alright so that's that's what it is and

00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:04,460
the real name is Archaeopteryx and it's

00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:06,680
based on this this thing here this

00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,719
software drum machine is actually based

00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,099
on a very very old model of drum

00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:12,080
machines and I don't mean an old model

00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:14,060
as in like a model car but like an old

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,460
conceptual model this was created in

00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:19,099
like the late 70s and people are still

00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:21,860
creating software drum machines based on

00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:24,800
the same idea let me show you a real

00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:27,770
basic intro to how this works if I come

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,319
back in here right and say I'm going to

00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:33,009
create a really simple drum beat right

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,840
I'll start here with the bass drum right

00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:37,729
so you say I want it to play on the one

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,110
and I want it to play on the nine and

00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:42,950
that's at a 16 beats right so it goes

00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:47,780
like that

00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:53,660
and so you want to have the snare drum

00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:56,120
play on the 5 and the 13 now goes like

00:06:53,660 --> 00:07:00,620
that or you could you can shake it up a

00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:06,560
bit this and then for you you'd also

00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:11,600
like a hi-hat in there here's a high hat

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:15,290
so you do like this the hi-hat right so

00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:18,370
that's how it works now the reason I

00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:22,670
showed you that case you're wondering is

00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:26,930
to clarify how this model works right

00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:29,540
this grid at the bottom represents the

00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:31,430
beats for a particular drum so when you

00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:33,590
create this thing you're adding up these

00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,050
different rows what you're actually

00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:39,830
doing is setting up a matrix of three

00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:42,380
drums of 16 beats so the way this

00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,970
actually works it has ten drums so

00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:47,180
you're actually creating a matrix of 10

00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:49,490
drones by 16 beats right and obviously

00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:52,610
these are on/off switches right so this

00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:54,410
is a matrix of billions but you what my

00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:58,190
code basically does is it changes it to

00:07:54,410 --> 00:08:01,070
a matrix of floats so here instead of

00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:03,290
just yes and no you can say yes no and

00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:05,030
maybe right and then if you have a

00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:07,430
random number generator which gives you

00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:11,060
a number between 0 and 1 these represent

00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:12,860
the percentage probabilities right 0 0.5

00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,230
and one point 0 is effectively

00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,480
equivalent to zero percent fifty percent

00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:19,130
and one hundred percent so the way

00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,870
Archaeopteryx handles that I don't know

00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:23,240
if you can see this with the the colors

00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:25,370
but it represents it as an array of

00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,560
arrays right cuz it's a two-dimensional

00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:29,720
matrix so an array of arrays is a very

00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:33,110
intuitive way to do that and these

00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:36,440
probabilities are all floats that you

00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:39,530
know describe the percentage right so

00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:42,919
for one of the high hats I want it often

00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:44,780
to play on this is a eighth note pairs

00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:47,690
I'm sorry sixteenth note pairs and

00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:52,180
there's eight of them in a measure of 16

00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:56,060
beats right so eighty-five percent on

00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:56,660
the first half thirty-five percent on

00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,759
the second

00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:02,060
f means that you're very much going to

00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:03,709
you're very likely to hear like like

00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:07,519
that and then the little ones in between

00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:09,949
are like sometimes happen right so you

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,139
create this array of arrays and then you

00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:14,449
go through the MIDI note numbers which

00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:17,269
is basically MIDI is just a way that you

00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:20,569
can assign note numbers to particular

00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:23,209
sounds in your software and you create

00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:25,519
drum objects in Archaeopteryx which is

00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:28,490
basically just a thing that sends a MIDI

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,949
message to the music software and you

00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:33,410
populate it with these what I'm doing

00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:36,829
here with the L is it's basically lambda

00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:38,990
uh which gives you a closure and it

00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:40,790
really just allows you to use Ruby as if

00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,829
it were JavaScript because you can now

00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:44,269
add a method and put it anywhere you

00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:48,399
want on the object because these are

00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:50,870
just an ER accessors basically and then

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,089
probabilities gets the probabilities of

00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:55,699
the MIDI note number so each drum now

00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:58,310
knows what its probabilities are so

00:09:55,699 --> 00:10:01,370
that's just a way to assign this grid of

00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:03,889
floats now I want to talk for a second

00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:04,850
about porn there was this horrible thing

00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:08,269
that happened in the Ruby community

00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:11,269
where a while ago someone showed a bunch

00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:12,740
of porn slides in a talk and there was

00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:14,779
this controversy and the guy was like

00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:17,360
well you know porn doesn't necessarily

00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:18,920
demean women and nobody seems to explain

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,040
to him that you know we all knew that

00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,930
and the objection was not that porn in

00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,899
theory to means women but the particular

00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:29,089
point he showed did and I feel as if I

00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:30,649
have some culpability there because I

00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:32,959
have in the past shown pictures of

00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:34,990
good-looking women for no reason in the

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,819
middle of talks other than the fact that

00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:40,550
people when you see them in you know

00:10:37,819 --> 00:10:42,980
images cause your brain to pay attention

00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:45,980
and I frequently exploit that as well as

00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:49,730
images of food images of terrifying

00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:50,779
animals and so on and so forth so I did

00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:52,699
throw a good-looking women their

00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:54,980
presentation for no reason but I want to

00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:56,839
point out she is in fact a scientist who

00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:59,600
was published in academic journals when

00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:02,629
she was still in high school and also I

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,529
threw in some George Clooney uh for the

00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:08,550
ladies

00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:10,290
but to further demonstrate that porn

00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,790
does not necessarily demean women I'm

00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:16,589
going to show you some porn which does

00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:18,660
not this porn only demeans camels all

00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:21,809
right there are no women demeaned by

00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:25,949
this porn right this porn is demeaning

00:11:21,809 --> 00:11:28,499
to rhinos and elephants but not human

00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:31,170
women this porn is also demeaning to

00:11:28,499 --> 00:11:33,120
rhinos and elephants unfortunately this

00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:36,120
porn is demeaning to everyone who sees

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,949
it which means it is demeaning to women

00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,889
but it's demeaning to women and men

00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:43,350
equally which i think is important now

00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:45,569
to you know to get you over the trauma

00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:51,930
of what you just witnessed here's a

00:11:45,569 --> 00:11:53,879
puppy thank you uh and some more

00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:55,709
cuteness although this is a bunny so

00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,480
it's kind of horrible because you know

00:11:55,709 --> 00:12:01,529
something that's adorable could still

00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:03,749
grow up to molest a chicken anyway so we

00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:06,110
created a grid of floats right and we

00:12:03,749 --> 00:12:09,139
populate it with these drum objects we

00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:12,240
then hand it off to this thing called

00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:18,259
generate beads which actually includes a

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:22,139
recursive lambda which is much more

00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:24,449
precise than the sounds so basically

00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:26,790
here's the code you've got this method

00:12:24,449 --> 00:12:31,470
in it's called generate beats later on

00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:34,889
it passes you know to MIDI timer at just

00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:36,720
says later on invoke some code and the

00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:38,730
code that it says to invoke is this here

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:43,740
lambda generate beats it basically just

00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:46,170
scheduled itself for later replay I'm

00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:49,559
hiding something off-screen in this tidy

00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:50,850
code because if you look here you can

00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:53,040
see that this block of code actually

00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:56,459
includes a little bit else and that

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:59,160
little bit else is evil timer offset WTF

00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:01,980
I'll talk about more about later anyway

00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:04,319
this code is on github I want to talk

00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,269
also about another goat and hopefully

00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:09,089
I've got time this goat is named

00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:11,220
Wheatley named after a character from a

00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:13,430
video game called portal 2 where you

00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,890
play this character and

00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:19,640
you eventually faced Whitley I'm sorry

00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:23,000
Wheatley it's too late now I guess what

00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:25,910
else the cake is a lie here he is in the

00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,200
part where he kills you i actually used

00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:31,070
wheatley as the name of the character

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:34,250
because he is an AI but he's also an

00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:36,170
idiot and i liked this idea of a robot

00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:40,100
idiot and that's basically what Wheatley

00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:42,680
the programming thing is so Wheatley

00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,690
started life as Towelie talons the

00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:47,089
library I created in 2008 tally keeps

00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:49,070
your coat dry and what it does is

00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:51,649
analyze this legacy code it goes through

00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:53,600
Ruby code and it I cyl eights duplicate

00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:56,600
methods and it can also do very very

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,760
primitive repetition detection but it is

00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:02,600
extremely primitive and extremely slow

00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:05,810
then just this last year I think 2011

00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:09,050
know last year 2010 I got really really

00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:11,870
annoyed at these ridiculous blog comment

00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:14,089
things that interpreted any tweet that

00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:17,120
mentioned your blog post as a comment on

00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:18,680
that blog post and spams your blog with

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,800
all these ridiculous tweets that are

00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:23,750
just retweet we retweet retweet and i

00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,320
created a similarity detector for blog

00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:29,660
comments in JavaScript and I was like oh

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,160
this is really fast so is like okay cool

00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,680
yeah I just kind of discovered it by

00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,200
accident so I discovered how to make

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,000
tally fast but I didn't want to rewrite

00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,190
tally because it was like an old project

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,990
I wanted to start over so I give it a

00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,670
new name and one of the reasons is I

00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:45,230
didn't want to analyze Ruby at that time

00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:47,390
I had a bunch of JavaScript I had to

00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:50,390
deal with so Wheatley is a library for

00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:52,100
automating JavaScript repair and if you

00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:54,890
feed it to pieces of JavaScript which

00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:58,270
are equal write this function foo return

00:14:54,890 --> 00:15:01,160
true function foo return true it can say

00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:03,890
ok the parse trees of these two

00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:06,820
functions are identical and it can give

00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:09,800
you that parse tree which is basically

00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:11,839
underneath you know the language when

00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,329
Ruby goes through or your JavaScript

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,850
interpreter goes through it parses your

00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:19,490
language out into a parse tree and then

00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:21,920
turns those into instructions and this

00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:24,440
thing is written in Ruby it gets the

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,200
parse tree from a library called Johnson

00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:30,260
which ties into spider monkey

00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:32,000
which is a sea JavaScript interpreter we

00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:34,280
talked about monkeys earlier this is a

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,770
spider monkey riding a goat which is not

00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,470
what they do all the time but if case

00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:41,630
you've forgotten what monkeys look like

00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:44,450
when Wheatley finds the two pieces of

00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:45,860
JavaScript identical it says that they

00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:49,370
have one hundred percent similarity

00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:52,220
right parse 30 similarity parse tree one

00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:55,070
should equal one hundred percent and it

00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:57,110
does now say you've got this where this

00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:59,990
has three tokens now I'm sorry for

00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:03,320
tokens as as a parse tree would

00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:08,510
understand it right function foo return

00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:10,580
true function bar return true so in each

00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:12,320
of those there is only one token which

00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:14,000
is not equal to all the other tokens and

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,950
the other thing so therefore that's

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,200
seventy-five percent and if you ask

00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:21,230
Wheatley it'll say parse tree similarity

00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:23,270
to parse tree is 75 it gives you an

00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:25,040
arbitrary percentage the code for that

00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:27,500
is actually incredibly simple this whole

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,230
thing is built on arrays right so it

00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:32,600
just says it calculates the intersection

00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:34,850
with the other tree turns it into a

00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,460
float multiplies it by 100 you know

00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:40,250
divides it by the other sighs and turns

00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:44,660
it back into an integer now you can also

00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:46,400
get absolute numbers going back to

00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:49,460
purely identical JavaScript here

00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,830
function foo return true twice it'll say

00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:55,340
that the parse tree token diff with the

00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:56,930
other parse tree should equal 0 and I

00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,040
call it a token death because when

00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,990
you're dealing with a parse tree you're

00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,100
dealing with a set of tokens and you

00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:04,880
just want to know what the difference is

00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:07,280
in numbers all right so here obviously

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,020
the token diff is one right so when you

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,079
run the specs parse tree token diff

00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:14,540
parse tree one should equal one so it

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,970
can count and again the code is actually

00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:19,400
really really simple the code that gets

00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:21,890
into the JavaScript can be quite hairy

00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:25,010
but the actual comparison here is again

00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:27,079
just arrays against other arrays so it's

00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:30,230
it's really very easy to understand it's

00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:32,300
just array subtraction really now this

00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:36,020
is the good you can also extract

00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:37,600
similar code blocks ignore this next

00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:39,820
picture

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,039
if you have this highly similar

00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:45,520
JavaScript right console.log foo and

00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:47,770
console.log bar you can ask it for

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,110
echoes it can tell you that two sections

00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:53,289
are highly similar to one another so you

00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:57,429
say show me the parse tree echoes with a

00:17:53,289 --> 00:18:00,039
maximum token death of one it'll say the

00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:02,020
first section of the parse tree has this

00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:05,380
array of echoes which only contains the

00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:06,700
second section of the parse tree and you

00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,630
know likewise if you give it something

00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:12,669
like this console.log foo bar and Baz

00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:16,090
it'll say the first section of the parse

00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:18,280
tree over here par30 has this array of

00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:21,280
echoes which are parse tree one and poss

00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:24,400
32 and you can do that with an arbitrary

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,230
number of tokens and actually I don't

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,799
remember if I ever implemented the

00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:31,990
percentages version but it's actually

00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:33,640
pretty easy to figure out and I call

00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:37,059
this echoes because it's like the tree

00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:39,010
is echoed elsewhere within it now here's

00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:41,470
the code for echoes and you can see it's

00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:42,850
a bit more complicated than the the

00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:44,919
other methods and that's because once

00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:46,510
you get in here you're dealing with some

00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:49,960
more complicated stuff I think it might

00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:53,230
be recursive but to be honest with you I

00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,669
forgot how it works I was in the cafe

00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,960
putting the presentation together for

00:18:54,669 --> 00:19:01,990
this and I looked at that method and I'm

00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:03,970
just like oh yeah oh no so i invite you

00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:09,730
to find out how my code works and tell

00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:11,799
me only like 10 12 lines it's actually

00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:14,190
easy to figure out it took a while to

00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:16,480
write but it's pretty easy to read

00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:17,950
anyway here's an innocent chipmunk

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,480
although he looks like he's getting

00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:22,390
ready for a date so he might not be that

00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:26,650
innocent and here is a horrified a

00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:30,280
hedgehog and yes moving on here is some

00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:32,860
highly similar JavaScript so Wheatley

00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:36,070
can also extract the variant tokens

00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:40,750
let's go back one here has console.log

00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:42,669
foo console.log bar right so you can say

00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:44,919
what are the variant tokens and variant

00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:46,809
tokens should equal foo and bar and you

00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:48,850
can also ask for the invariant tokens

00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:50,950
which is what tokens in those to parse

00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:53,320
trees are identical and

00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:56,020
give you that as an array now wheatley

00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:58,420
also extends johnson johnson is really

00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:00,550
cool but it can only parse javascript it

00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:02,290
can't reassemble javascript and the

00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:05,430
parse tree that it gives you cannot

00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:08,590
actually be edited so wheatley re ads

00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:11,560
well it it has a johnson translator

00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:13,090
module that gives that functionality to

00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:16,030
johnson which you can then use to

00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:18,550
actually construct javascript parse

00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:21,400
trees that can be rewritten although i

00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:23,920
have to tell you it's quite hacky but it

00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:26,740
works this enables Wheatley to add

00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:29,200
function calls replace literals with

00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:31,330
variables and create wrapper functions

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,890
and if we zoom out on this one weekly

00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,990
create wrapper code function should

00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:36,400
equal refactored we see this which is

00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:38,920
kind of like we at least claim to fame

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,230
it can do an ultra simple refactor

00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:43,030
namely creating a wrapper function

00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:45,910
here's the code it says console.log foo

00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:48,730
here's the refactored function as diff

00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:53,470
qwerty is console.log qwerty then it

00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:56,140
calls as the foo so it extracts the code

00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:58,450
pulls out the literal creates a wrapper

00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:00,640
function and you could use this for

00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:03,070
instance if you had a lot of code which

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,370
called console dot log in production

00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:09,100
because IE various versions of ie will

00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:11,830
barf and go nuts if you use console dot

00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:15,160
log so what you do is you run this and

00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:17,110
then you fix that wrapper function but

00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:19,420
it'll automatically you know create

00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:21,130
these here now this is a

00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:23,200
proof-of-concept refactoring it would

00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:26,010
actually require a bit more work to use

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,150
a great deal the code is on github a

00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:29,290
little more about this I only have eight

00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:31,720
minutes left so I'm going to kind of

00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:35,230
hurry the code which generates new

00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:37,210
javascript is as I said quite involved

00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:40,420
and if you're looking to get your github

00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:42,490
on this is a place to start it could use

00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:44,830
some cleaning up also the variable

00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:46,510
naming is clearly idiotic as different

00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:48,550
QWERTY are not good variable names I

00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:50,830
have not figured out a way to automate

00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:53,410
variable naming although I do have a

00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:55,840
wild-eyed idea to consider I also want

00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:57,910
to look at cosine similarity sim hashing

00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,170
and if I were to do it over which this

00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:01,330
is the second time I've done it so I

00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:04,120
might if I were to do it over I might

00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:06,640
do it in CoffeeScript instead using JSON

00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:08,700
but all told I'm actually pretty happy

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,960
with Wheatley it's a very good goat

00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,510
although both these projects probably

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,700
look extremely experimental i actually

00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:17,830
used parts of Wheatley and a companion

00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:21,640
project that I have an open source yet

00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:23,500
to find easy refactoring points in a

00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,110
legacy JavaScript code base of over

00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:28,210
14,000 lines factor was fourteen

00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:29,680
thousand five hundred fifty one it would

00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:32,440
take a very very long time to go through

00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:34,750
that kind of code by hand and reading

00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:37,180
bad code is depressing it was also able

00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:41,650
to auto-generate some very simple code

00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:44,560
fixes just a tiny bit and legacy code is

00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:47,050
tedious and repetitive tedious

00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:49,090
repetitive tasks are why we have these

00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:52,000
boxes in the first place you know

00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:53,940
programs are hard to hire but certain

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,140
types of tedious repetitive programming

00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:58,750
programmers are actually easy to write

00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:00,970
so I am actually firmly of the opinion

00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:03,880
that hackers should not do repetitive

00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:06,340
tasks I believe hackers should write new

00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:11,290
hackers to do those repetitive tasks for

00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:13,000
them it is the circle of life now

00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:16,540
earlier I mentioned programmers

00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,700
self-promotion and you know in the

00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:20,140
context of this stuff I came out with

00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,870
this whole thing about how to build a

00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:25,780
goat unfortunately I didn't time the

00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:29,080
length of this presentation so although

00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:30,520
I do go into how to build a goat I'm not

00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,650
actually sure I'll be able to go through

00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:36,250
i will give you the first you know the

00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:38,290
first core of how it works building a

00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,790
project like this is a gamble it's an

00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:41,530
experiment you don't know for sure if

00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:44,590
it's going to work there are four things

00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:47,560
you need to know when to hold them when

00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:52,150
to fold them when to walk away and when

00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:53,980
to run there's there's more to it but I

00:23:52,150 --> 00:24:00,190
really I've got six minutes left on this

00:23:53,980 --> 00:24:01,870
timer so say what all right all right

00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:05,470
well the first thing is to do

00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:07,510
substantial research okay these this is

00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:09,520
a list of books and stuff that I did to

00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:11,710
like learn about music right these are

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,730
only the good ones that I remember I've

00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:15,980
got books waiting on my eye

00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:18,590
and to be read I got this one here which

00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:21,020
is a music theory phd's thesis on

00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:23,000
Detroit techno and this this was written

00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:25,640
by a guy who wrote a I code that can

00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,890
write up orchestras in fact this is his

00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,320
second thing his first one would write

00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:34,670
orchestras in the style of arbitrary

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:36,740
composers and when orchestras refused to

00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:39,350
answer i can write orchestras can write

00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:41,960
classical music orchestras refused to

00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:43,820
play his music in the style of various

00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,040
composers because they were outraged

00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:48,230
that he could do that and they found it

00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:51,380
sacrilegious so he wrote this new thing

00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:53,660
which does orchestral music in the style

00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:56,300
of you know hybrid style of various

00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:59,210
composers he likes and they still refuse

00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:01,760
to play it but that that's another thing

00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:03,020
and then again you know here's a whole

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,300
bunch of stuff that I've been you know

00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:07,160
reading on AI I'm going to do another

00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:09,800
version of this talk I like an hour-long

00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:11,750
version and put it on my blog so i can

00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,920
go into more detail there the long story

00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,180
short is that if you're going to try and

00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,770
do something you know genuinely

00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:18,350
remarkable you're going to have to do

00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:20,420
your homework right and correspondingly

00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:22,370
you need to choose something you care

00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:24,380
about it should be obvious but to a lot

00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:25,940
of people it isn't the obvious reason is

00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,050
you're going to be doing it a lot so you

00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,540
need to have something you'll have

00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:31,880
energy to look at consider the idea of

00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:34,460
rock star programmers right there's kind

00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,840
of a silly idea in many ways but one

00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:37,850
thing that's kind of cool about rock

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:41,930
stars is they have to like memorize all

00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:43,220
this stuff with guitars rehearsing the

00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:45,410
other thing is that in the world of

00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:47,240
programmers a rock star is a specialist

00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:49,730
like here this is a great rock star this

00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:53,360
is jeremy ashkenaz create a CoffeeScript

00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:55,550
backbone.js underscored ijs this is a

00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,310
specialist in making JavaScript suck

00:25:55,550 --> 00:26:01,760
less and obviously it takes a lot of

00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:03,800
energy the other thing is you're going

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,030
to learn a lot about it you wanted to be

00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,760
the kind of information you will be

00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:09,710
happy to have inside your brain this is

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:13,430
Alan Perlis one of the sort of great

00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:17,600
like early opinion hammers about

00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:19,190
programming actually the folder i filed

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,960
him under was code profits when I was

00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:22,910
putting this together and he said this

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,680
you think you know when you can learn

00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:28,380
are more sure when you can write even

00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:31,680
or when you can teach but certain when

00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:35,010
you can program alright and well here's

00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:37,080
a story i'll just skip but if this is

00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:39,000
true that you're only certain that you

00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:41,460
know something when you can program a

00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,680
computer to do it then to automate

00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:46,350
something is to study it and indeed to

00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,910
some degree to master it so you choose

00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:50,460
something you care about because you

00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:52,230
will master it right and building

00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:55,410
Archaeopteryx certainly made me a better

00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:57,450
musician writing code which analyzes

00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:59,610
ruby made me better analyzing ruby

00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:01,470
writing code which analyzes javascript

00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:03,630
made me better at javascript and of

00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:06,060
course the meta thing that I'm going

00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:09,120
into here is AI which is actually the

00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:14,010
study of like decisions and automating

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:15,840
decision making hmmm Oh many years ago I

00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:18,210
grew disillusioned with technology I

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,840
learned how to do this this is a video

00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:20,840
graphics

00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:26,540
basically I wanted to like make film and

00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:28,610
music and I was just like very

00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,990
frustrated with code for a while so I

00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:31,580
learned how to do all this stuff and

00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:34,280
parts of it actually done with

00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:37,130
JavaScript as surprising as that may be

00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:41,540
and later I actually went and did some

00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:43,460
animation in Ruby this is SVG animated

00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:46,700
in Ruby it just creates like a very long

00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:49,100
series of sgv SVG documents and then

00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:51,710
there's some Java that turns these SVG's

00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:54,140
into JPEGs you can just import those

00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:57,080
series of JPEGs and animation software

00:27:54,140 --> 00:28:00,850
all the animations already done you can

00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,850
find that on the github xin on my blog

00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,180
let's see I got a minute and a half I

00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:07,370
don't know how good this going to be

00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:09,170
next step in building a goat this is

00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:12,410
very important give yourself permission

00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:15,950
to it up so the ipad was basically

00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:17,750
designed in 1968 at xerox parc by this

00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:21,170
guy who was holding up a prototype it

00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:23,690
was called the dynabook now when when

00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:25,610
steve jobs announced the iphone this guy

00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:27,050
was right there at the conference and

00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:28,700
when he got off the stage he asked him

00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:30,890
you know what do you think and he said

00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,990
make the screen 5 inches by 8 inches and

00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:34,550
you'll rule the world so that's

00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:36,590
basically what he did the interesting

00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:38,600
thing is Apple was working on this for a

00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:40,700
long time Apple knew about the dynabook

00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,920
this was made when Steve Jobs was not at

00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,630
Apple but the engineers were still very

00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:47,390
interested in creating a dynabook and

00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:49,420
you can actually look at this this is a

00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:52,670
very very similar notes application

00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:55,220
running on an apple newton to the one

00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:58,130
running on the iphone and i'm sure there

00:28:55,220 --> 00:29:00,260
was some diehard engineer at apple when

00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:03,340
the iphone was made who thought yeah

00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:07,130
we've made a half-assed dynabook awesome

00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:08,750
right and you know it continues right

00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:13,190
this is actually like a long tradition

00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:19,160
in Apple um let's see let's see ok so

00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:21,830
the ipod ipad yeah all this stuff this

00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:23,270
is jim cameron quote the guy in the film

00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:25,340
director if you set your goals

00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:27,230
ridiculously high and it's a failure you

00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:28,820
will fail above everyone else's success

00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:31,010
this is the guy who made avatar

00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:32,659
Terminator 2 so if you look at the

00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:35,149
iphone or the ipad as if

00:29:32,659 --> 00:29:37,759
dynabook right it's still an amazing

00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:39,440
success as a phone and this is what

00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:42,919
people are saying about the ipad right

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:46,099
limited i oh no USB no flash why the app

00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:49,279
ipad will fail there's a whole genre of

00:29:46,099 --> 00:29:52,759
why the app had will fail right it

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:54,320
up do it wrong this is this is where you

00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:56,539
you know this is why you should do

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,070
things wrong because if you set out to

00:29:56,539 --> 00:30:01,549
do something awesome and you do it wrong

00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:03,619
it's still going to be awesome and in

00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:05,539
keeping with this this code is copied

00:30:03,619 --> 00:30:07,849
from a flash tutorial and then melded

00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:09,590
with code from a ruby book and I did the

00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:11,659
flash tutorial wrong and the Ruby

00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:15,289
tutorial wrong and it's still turned out

00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:19,279
pretty cool this here I was talking

00:30:15,289 --> 00:30:22,460
about before evil timer offset WTF right

00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:26,090
does this look like good code this is

00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:27,769
not good code right just just forget I'm

00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:29,720
standing up here in front of you if I

00:30:27,769 --> 00:30:32,269
have a variable named evil timer offset

00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:34,759
WTF that's not good code now we all know

00:30:32,269 --> 00:30:37,220
what WTF stands for but it's still not

00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:38,389
good to see it in there all right and if

00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:40,460
you if you're going through the code

00:30:38,389 --> 00:30:42,979
with a WTF stamped it's just not how

00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:45,349
things should be this is a solar here

00:30:42,979 --> 00:30:48,200
wheatley replace literal with variable

00:30:45,349 --> 00:30:51,009
the actual code for replaced literal

00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:55,669
with variable has this comment it says

00:30:51,009 --> 00:30:57,950
to do I find comments like that

00:30:55,669 --> 00:31:01,429
in my code from time to time fix me

00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:05,479
stoned not actually informative or you

00:31:01,429 --> 00:31:06,889
know def WTF WTF comment WTF and you

00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:11,330
look at the file that you're editing and

00:31:06,889 --> 00:31:14,720
it's in the folder WTF and you're like

00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:17,269
what was I doing but the funny thing is

00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,909
is like one of the things that made this

00:31:17,269 --> 00:31:22,580
habit of you know cursing variable names

00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:24,859
worse with me and you know encourage me

00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:26,899
in this naughtiness was working with

00:31:24,859 --> 00:31:28,669
terrific programmers because they

00:31:26,899 --> 00:31:30,499
complain about their own code all the

00:31:28,669 --> 00:31:33,229
freaking time and the funny thing about

00:31:30,499 --> 00:31:36,229
this code is it may have motivated the

00:31:33,229 --> 00:31:38,749
creation of this gem right this gem is a

00:31:36,229 --> 00:31:41,960
much better way of handling MIDI which I

00:31:38,749 --> 00:31:44,330
may rebuild Archaeopteryx on top of now

00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,830
again I went all out like promoting

00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:47,450
Archaeopteryx and went to every

00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,830
conference so I was like oh I'm going to

00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:50,659
prompt myself as a programmer it's

00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:52,880
important and also I was like wow this

00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:54,620
is awesome everybody needs to see it now

00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,659
the funny thing is that may have

00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:58,309
inspired the creation of that other gem

00:31:56,659 --> 00:32:00,409
right someone might have been like wow

00:31:58,309 --> 00:32:02,330
there's all this attention on this thing

00:32:00,409 --> 00:32:03,860
I'm going to look at it oh my god how

00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:05,539
did you get all this you know promotion

00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:07,370
out of such crappy code I'll build

00:32:05,539 --> 00:32:09,169
something better that may have happened

00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:11,090
with that gem I just showed you I know

00:32:09,169 --> 00:32:14,299
for a fact it happened with this gem

00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:16,429
right and that is actually awesome right

00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:18,470
Ben blinding saw the code for how

00:32:16,429 --> 00:32:21,919
Archaeopteryx handles MIDI and thought

00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:24,139
no oh no it should be much cleaner and

00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:26,090
so he made it cleaner he really rebuilt

00:32:24,139 --> 00:32:27,710
the foundation and then I just you know

00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:29,960
moved Archaeopteryx over to sit on that

00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:32,990
foundation and this is the magic of open

00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:34,519
source all right if you create code and

00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:37,010
share your code in your enthusiasm

00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:41,049
people will respond and that's a great

00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:43,130
thing here is a kitten cuddling a lizard

00:32:41,049 --> 00:32:44,240
we don't know what they got up to when

00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:45,980
we're not looking but it doesn't matter

00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,740
because I don't have any any pictures of

00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:53,059
that one I am now out of time should I

00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:54,980
keep going yes okay so Archaeopteryx

00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:58,340
being did not prevent it from

00:32:54,980 --> 00:33:00,500
being awesome right so moral the story

00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:02,779
is to give yourself permission to

00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:04,909
it up make projects and make them bad

00:33:02,779 --> 00:33:07,490
just because later on they will become

00:33:04,909 --> 00:33:09,889
good the next step last step is to do it

00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:15,679
over and over again this is not how I

00:33:09,889 --> 00:33:17,360
mean I created tally in 2008 that was of

00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,909
course code to prevent don't you know

00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:23,539
don't repeat yourself this was Wheatley

00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:27,500
2011 also code to enforce don't repeat

00:33:23,539 --> 00:33:31,880
yourself I croak code which is enforcing

00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:35,240
don't repeat yourself twice I'm showing

00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:37,309
you this slide twice right do repeat

00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:41,000
yourself right don't repeat yourself as

00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:43,220
a great role a rule for code it's good

00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,470
for computers it's not good for humans

00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:47,330
if you actually read up on the human

00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:49,480
brain and how it works repeating

00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:51,679
yourself is key to getting good at stuff

00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,510
also when you repeat yourself you're

00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,980
going to do it slightly differently

00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:56,720
right if you think back the other

00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,890
version of this slide the colors were

00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,440
inverted

00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:02,210
this guy is probably we're probably not

00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:06,260
looking at the first motorcycle he ever

00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:08,780
built all right you will come up with

00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:10,460
variations when you rebuild stuff that

00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:13,040
you're really interested in and it's

00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:16,370
worth doing consider Archaeopteryx I

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:18,290
went to all the conferences in 2008 talk

00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:20,810
about it but I actually built an earlier

00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:22,190
version in 2006 which ran on a

00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:25,370
completely different framework of

00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:28,280
continuations in chaos math and this is

00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:30,730
actually a very old email from 2006

00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:33,710
about how is going to show it off at the

00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:35,899
Albuquerque user group which I did and

00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:39,919
it was built on this which I don't have

00:34:35,899 --> 00:34:41,659
time to explain so do substantial

00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:43,610
research choose something you care about

00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:45,140
giving yourself permission to it up

00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:47,270
and do it over and over and over and

00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:49,899
over and over again yeah because I might

00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:51,950
do another one of these in 2012 and

00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:55,429
it'll probably be better than the first

00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:59,120
two also public service announcement

00:34:55,429 --> 00:35:00,950
animals are perverts this is three cats

00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,780
getting it on at the same time and

00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:04,640
compared to all the other perverted

00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:06,050
animal pictures I showed you they're

00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:09,620
coming out ahead of everybody because

00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:11,090
they're all the same species anywho and

00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:14,660
you don't even want to see the picture I

00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:16,340
found of the elephant orgy there are

00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:18,590
really happens there if it had been

00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:21,470
people it would be illegal to even look

00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:24,770
at the picture it was unbelievable I was

00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:27,500
horrified and you this is who I am Giles

00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:30,290
boquete and please google me and follow

00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:33,050
me on Twitter Giles goat boy I actually

00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:35,120
chose the name long before I came up

00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:37,160
with the proposal theme or whatever the

00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,600
presentation theme but obviously if

00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:45,370
you're interested in goats i'm all about

00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:45,370
goats but not that way thank you

00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:52,470
brighter planet is a cloud-based

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:55,349
computation platform so we provide an

00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:56,940
API for developers to build complex

00:35:55,349 --> 00:35:59,490
scientific calculations into their

00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:02,040
applications pretty easily one big klein

00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:05,480
we have is MasterCard international and

00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:08,190
they have a partnership with us where

00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:10,109
users of corporate cards who charge

00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:12,869
things like flights and hotel rooms onto

00:36:10,109 --> 00:36:15,839
their corporate card all those pieces of

00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:18,720
data go into a big database and we go in

00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:21,270
and using all those details calculate

00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,950
the environmental impact of all those

00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:25,140
different activities and put that

00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:26,790
information back in a database so the

00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:28,079
users of these corporate cards can use

00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:30,359
that information for making energy

00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,599
efficiency adjustments and corporate

00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:32,599
reporting
