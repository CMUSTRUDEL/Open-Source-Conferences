I worked with ROH for several years too

00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:28,239
many in fact but at hash Roget and he

00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:31,419
has a pretty nifty little script for

00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:33,129
getting your environment setup so

00:00:31,419 --> 00:00:38,580
there's near flawless as long as you do

00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:42,250
things away row does things yes so it's

00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:44,620
it's really handy and he's going to quit

00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,900
go through his script don't worry if you

00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:49,869
don't catch all the details if you want

00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:52,000
to have your machine setup like row

00:00:49,869 --> 00:00:53,920
would set it up which would be pretty

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,949
much the way that everybody at hash

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,839
record would have done it then stop in

00:00:56,949 --> 00:01:01,030
the return of studio until noon today

00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:03,879
he's going to be in there and helping

00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:05,530
you through your installs if you have

00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:07,420
any questions you have something that's

00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:10,290
misbehaving or whatever come down talk

00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:13,270
to row and he'll try and help you

00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,909
without further ado are you ready yes

00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:18,810
okay without further ado well hey Leo

00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,810

been a Linux sis at min a software

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:48,750
engineer and tall for a longest time

00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:51,600
that's my Twitter my email if you want

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,039
to email me it's my blog which is

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,899
important because at the end of this

00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:58,050
you'll you'll need to go to a blog post

00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,630
to kind of follow how to install stuff

00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:03,780
if you want to follow what I'm saying my

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:07,319
github a few things here and that's it

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:20,810
for me now pay attention lights down

00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:20,810
please maybe in turkey chili

00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:35,379
medium crab bisque I didn't get any

00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,379
bread just forget it let it go

00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:41,900
excuse me I think you forgot my bread

00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:43,700
bread do dollars extra good Alice me

00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:48,310
everyone in front of me got free bread

00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:51,580
you want bread yes please three dollars

00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,580
nothing for you

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,000
so you may be wondering what does that

00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:09,740
have to do with anything absolutely

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,570
nothing except for it kind of resembles

00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:14,910
the first title of the talk and in the

00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:17,550
second whatever no pseudo for you so

00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:20,490
let's dive right in it today our mission

00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:28,290
is and they're supposed to be sound

00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:30,360
there but there's no sense near perfect

00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:33,090
without an environment you seek out

00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,430
cases for sudo to boldly go where no

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,740
developer has gone before not really

00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:39,750
well you may learn some more stuff on

00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,920
the way but here we go now let's dive

00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,470
right in it because I really don't have

00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:48,330
much time left so too does have its

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:50,190
place pseudo multi-user environment you

00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:53,970
know when you're running stuff like this

00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:56,550
you'll see when fry the user runs

00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:58,950
without pseudo it just says that route

00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:01,380
rent I command but when you use sudo

00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:03,210
kind of live some accounting and stuff

00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:07,770
so it has some it has its place it

00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:10,110
allows you to install trustworthy tools

00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:18,989
and stuff like that so the question is

00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:20,100
why no suitor so this is you pseudo

00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:21,960
really doesn't have a place in your

00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,030
development environment first of all

00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:27,960
most of us use OS 10 and a boom tube and

00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:32,670
they have their default password they

00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:35,370
don't even say it for the root so this

00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:36,990
forces us to use weak passwords and you

00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,250
know pseudo can mess you up if it's

00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,320
something that you don't let me come

00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:43,860
you're you're really messing with stuff

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,960
at the system level so it installs gems

00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,340
on your system environment and it's not

00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:52,710
compatible with our vm which we're about

00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:57,480
to talk to about in a second so here it

00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:59,670
is debian this is one of the things that

00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,250
it's kind of missing right Devin and I

00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:05,220
able to have appt gen to have for it

00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:07,860
which is awesome I love portage in

00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:11,129
Michael is then we have nothing really

00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:16,860
and don't tell me Mac boards because

00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:19,919
you know I know exactly so this was

00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:24,139
truly the missing package manager for 40

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:27,209
s then if you who here uses homebrew oh

00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:33,209
I'm preaching to the choir then alright

00:05:27,209 --> 00:05:37,349
I'm done I'll out of here anyway

00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:40,110
homebrew pretty cool stuff the needed

00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:41,879
goodies though for ubuntu debian you

00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:44,719
need you know curl bison build-essential

00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:49,169
and white stuff for outstanding xcode

00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:53,009
misspelled boo oh well and then home

00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:59,330
brew I'm from botany them who here uses

00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:59,330
game who here doesn't use them all right

00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:07,610
you need to go firefox and chrome and

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:13,860
then whatever you know my secret

00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:17,009
Cassandra you know a text file you know

00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,479
whatever else so the biggest thing is

00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:20,909
this with what I kind of wanted to rush

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,550
to get to this part is our vm r vm has

00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:27,149
really made it very very easy easy for

00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:31,439
me when i'm building a library to test

00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:32,909
it in different Ruby Ruby versions right

00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,279
so what it is its temporal reversion

00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:39,300
manager it's a command line tool and it

00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:41,069
solves multiple Ruby's interpreters it

00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,289
manages this is the biggest part to me

00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:48,379
managing the sets of gems for ruby

00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:52,769
version you can run stuff over each

00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:55,019
version of Ruby which is great this

00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:58,619
right here is what happens when you jen

00:06:55,019 --> 00:07:03,959
is sudo gem install is actually from

00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:06,420
somebody's computer yeah I know don't

00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:11,400
stare at it

00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:13,470
ah so when you have stuff have stuff

00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,060
like that like you know four different

00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:18,120
rails persons and like dating all the

00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:20,940
way back to I don't know how one point

00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:24,350
two point six so the cool thing about

00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:29,160
our VM is that it isolates all the gems

00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:32,700
you can do it perversion right so so you

00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,990
can have on a project you can you can

00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,870
say well this part is going to have this

00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:38,580
gem set right but even even on top of

00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:41,700
that you can say this version is going

00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:43,890
to have this gem set right and you can

00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:48,740
run commands like this which will say

00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:48,740
hey just run my specs on 186 and 192

00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,310
1864 this is an example right which I

00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:57,330
normally would do any demo but I don't

00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:59,760
have time for them and 186 the array

00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:02,060
count array didn't have count so you

00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:07,050
couldn't say I read out mean count right

00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:09,630
but after it won't 187 and above then it

00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:11,130
does it's in there but that kind of bid

00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,990
me one time then I was like you know

00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:16,190
what this is perfect for that because

00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:19,730
they would have picked it up right

00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:22,230
everything is in its own little dot r vm

00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:24,590
hierarchy so you can just blow it away

00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:28,430
and then start over so it's pretty cool

00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:33,630
again do you guys have any questions

00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:38,160
good the idea is that I'm gonna be in

00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:40,830
the room where we have lunch / connect

00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:44,220
our computers to the cables yes coffee

00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:46,650
and so if you want to just come hang out

00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:53,100
we can kind of walk through what I do

00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:56,220
hey Josh so if I hadn't seen you yes are

00:08:53,100 --> 00:09:01,980
you using yourselves are you using thin

00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:03,870
stuff I know you and I we should talk

00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,660
yeah definitely cooler stuff you can do

00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:08,090
so that the binary

00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:10,340
version seeking that use the version of

00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:12,680
our site finer you want if you're using

00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:14,390
that bumbler there's a little hat right

00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:19,120
oh yeah yeah yeah and we do use bundler

00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:22,400
with all this stuff so again the blog

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,410
that the remote come that's where have

00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:29,660
all these most of the stuff is just like

00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:35,000
installing how to do it um yes the very

00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:37,970
very modest and humble the install and

00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:44,270
then my name and then you'll find it the

00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:46,130
end first foremost engine yard is a

00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:48,140
support of the Ruby community we also

00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:50,390
are a provider of cloud services and

00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,220
those cloud services are supported so

00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:54,350
the idea behind Engine Yard is that if

00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,490
you have an open source technology and

00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:57,080
you need people to actually help you

00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:59,180
scale it and support it when you deploy

00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,860
you can come to engine yard and so we

00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,050
can provide services that go around and

00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:05,480
make languages like Ruby and frameworks

00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:07,070
like rails or padrino more effective for

00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,820
use and for actual deployment in

00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,820
production scenarios

00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:17,949
