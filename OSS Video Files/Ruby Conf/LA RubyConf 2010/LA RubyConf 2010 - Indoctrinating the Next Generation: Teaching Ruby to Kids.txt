	00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:23,410
so I'm here to talk to you today about

00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:25,000
teaching this is not an overly technical

00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:31,830
talk this is more of a pep rally

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,830
actually I'm Sarah Mae

00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,730
I am a software engineer at pivotal labs

00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:42,430
but this talk is actually about what I

00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:44,320
do in my spare time I somehow I found

00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:47,440
myself doing a lot of teaching so I

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,300
figure I must like it I guess in San

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,949
Francisco I do a lot of workshops for

00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:54,010
adults I've started doing workshops for

00:00:50,949 --> 00:00:56,640
kids and I thought a lot about what it

00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,690
is that it takes to make a good teacher

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,190
so I'm here today to convert you all

00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:06,100
into teachers so why might you want to

00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:08,229
learn how to teach programming well and

00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,670
why did the main reason that I decided I

00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:11,920
wanted to do it is because I realized

00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:15,030
that most people who teach programming

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,370
have no idea what they're doing

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,690
and it's really important for someone

00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,370
who teaches programming I think in

00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:23,070
particular more than other subjects to

00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:25,110
be a pract of practicing programmer

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,520
right not someone who just knows about

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,160
programming and maybe did it once 10

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:33,600
years ago but someone who's doing it you

00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:35,370
know more or less full-time because the

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,420
main thing about about teaching in the

00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,830
main way that you're effective in

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,750
teaching is if you're excited about what

00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:42,870
you're doing and I'm really lucky to

00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:45,510
really love what I do and I really want

00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:48,840
to convey that to people because I think

00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:51,290
that a lot of times people they you know

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,150
they learn about programming by via

00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:55,440
someone who's just giving them lesson

00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:58,100
plans out of a book and it just doesn't

00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,390
work very well and I also think that

00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,729
programming is going to be a much more

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,140
important skill in the next maybe 10 to

00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:07,470
15 years so I think it's important to

00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,220
start with kids programming you know 10

00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,649
years ago

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,959
or maybe you know 15 years ago 20 years

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,940
ago typing was a different skill than

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,470
literacy these days you can't really be

00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,300
literate without knowing how to type so

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,980
they kind of merged and I think that

00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,940
programming is approaching that category

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,790
I think we're getting to the point where

00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,940
the bar is low enough to get started the

00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:29,070
languages are sufficiently English like

00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:30,930
that you know being able to hack away at

00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:34,150
software is going to become part of

00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:36,190
basic life skills

00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:39,180
so why should you teach in particular

00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:41,349
well let's get this one out of the way

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,159
everyone knows about that one very

00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:43,299
rewarding

00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:47,230
that's why teachers don't get paid

00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:49,569
anything but the more important I think

00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:52,540
is that teaching leads to learning for

00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:54,430
the teacher every time I do a talk I

00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,540
learned something about what it is that

00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:58,030
I'm talking about even if it's something

00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,230
that I thought previously maybe that I

00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:03,310
thought I understood pretty well I

00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:04,750
always learned something and for the

00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,459
workshops that I do in San Francisco for

00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:09,370
adults we teach a really really basic

00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:12,940
rails application this application is

00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:14,590
you know two models one Association a

00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,090
couple of scaffolded views but every

00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:19,629
time I teach that app to somebody I

00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:22,569
learned something about it the last time

00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:24,159
I taught it someone was like so why did

00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:26,170
the instance variables this you declare

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,640
in the controller why are they available

00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,379
in the views I thought action view and

00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,780
action controller was separate class

00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:35,220
trees and I was like that's a really

00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:37,900
good point I don't know let's look it up

00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,250
it's just really basic stuff that people

00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,959
who are beginners will come in and ask

00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,069
you and you're like oh that's a really

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,909
good point

00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:49,129
so teaching for me was it was very

00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:51,709
mysterious for a while I kind of was

00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:54,019
like well I have a C s degree I don't

00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:55,760
have any training and education or

00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:58,010
instructional design and I really don't

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,799
understand what it takes to be able to

00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:03,620
convey information to someone in a way

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,390
that they find exciting but what I

00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,659
discovered is this really not that hard

00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:09,650
if you kind of apply a lot of the same

00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:12,409
techniques that you using your regular

00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:14,120
development so I would argue that you

00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:16,910
actually already have all of the tools

00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,199
you might need and you already use all

00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,340
the techniques you might need but you

00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:21,910
just use them to a different end

00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:26,900
currently you use them to make software

00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:29,690
so does this look familiar at all set

00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:32,000
goals form a plan expect to adapt short

00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:34,370
iterations continuous deployment sounds

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,599
a lot like making software it's

00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,800
basically the same set of steps you have

00:04:35,599 --> 00:04:38,949
to do if you're going to be a successful

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,949
teacher

00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:43,070
so the first thing is is goals and this

00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,300
is really important so this is something

00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,030
that a lot of people don't do when they

00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:49,040
sit down to teach somebody programming

00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:50,420
you need to have a goal that is specific

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,560
immediate measurable achievable most

00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,940
obvious think about that just means is

00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,580
you need something that expresses like

00:04:52,940 --> 00:05:01,750
here's exactly why I am doing this so

00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:03,620
here's a an example of a bad goal

00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,570
whether you could argue whether or not

00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,860
this is achievable it's certainly not

00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:10,640
measurable in the short-term it's not

00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:14,330
immediate this is not gonna work this is

00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:16,190
similarly not a good goal to have it's

00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:18,510
vague it's like what is interested mean

00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:20,790
what am i you know

00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:24,900
so so here's an example whenever argue

00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:26,070
is a better goal you have something that

00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,640
you can look and be like okay is she

00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:31,790
gonna do this or not let's find out

00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:35,660
there's another one works pretty well

00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:35,660
here's one that I've heard a lot

00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:48,019
so most of this time most this comes

00:05:46,369 --> 00:05:51,159
from people who have much younger kids

00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:53,119
but so here's where we're running into

00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:54,319
differences between teaching kids and

00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,609
teaching adults right so a lot of the

00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:56,989
stuff I've talked about so far and a lot

00:05:55,609 --> 00:05:58,309
of stuff in the rest of presentation it

00:05:56,989 --> 00:06:00,019
applies equally well whether you're

00:05:58,309 --> 00:06:01,759
teaching adults or kids but when you're

00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:03,799
teaching kids you really have to have a

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,519
different set of goals in general your

00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:09,499
goal has to be I want this kid to like

00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:12,259
get super excited about what software

00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:14,089
can do so that when they get the

00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:16,789
intellectual capacity to understand some

00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:19,549
of the more concrete and and maybe

00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:21,259
difficult issues in programming they'll

00:06:19,549 --> 00:06:23,629
have this overriding excitement that

00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:25,900
will sort of ease that any difficulties

00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:28,150
that they run into

00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,860
so and another one that you might be

00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,930
useful it'd be as if you're working with

00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,730
a group of kids who's just you know a

00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:36,040
lot of people end up doing like computer

00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:38,380
classes after school or whatever like I

00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,820
a good goal for that is like I want them

00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:43,060
to leave excited about what they can

00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:46,000
build and with sufficient tools support

00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:47,410
to keep exploring on their own very

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,170
important

00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:51,430
so now that you've got goals basically

00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:53,410
you just have to come up with a plan

00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,510
like a lesson plan I gave a talk with

00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:56,890
this title at rubyconf in November and I

00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,840
actually spent most of my time focusing

00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:00,760
on here's a lesson plan that came up

00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:04,600
with specifically using Ruby and shoes

00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:06,790
for high schoolers and between then and

00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,740
now I realized that that's the easy part

00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,840
of teaching that coming up with

00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,880
something you know coming up with a set

00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:16,300
of steps to go through and a plan and

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,830
some code and you know breaking it up

00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,240
into little pieces that's kind of the

00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:22,990
easy part there's a lot of resources on

00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:26,350
the web so you know there's a lot of

00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:28,500
like C so there are some tools that are

00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,500
useful

00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:32,219
choose Hackney hack I've been working on

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,219
something called small Ruby which is a

00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:36,539
logo implementation and I just realized

00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:40,199
that now that I've mentioned it public I

00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:42,210
should probably put it on github but the

00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:43,469
idea is you know keep your goals in mind

00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:46,110
right everything you do has to be driven

00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:48,960
by what your goals are and there's a lot

00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:50,219
of tools that you can use with Ruby so

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,559
if you look at the the tools that I've

00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:54,779
mentioned they're pretty much all visual

00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:56,969
they pretty much all are interactive and

00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:58,800
I've worked with kids of different ages

00:07:56,969 --> 00:07:59,849
and different genders and this seems to

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,800
be pretty much true across the board

00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:04,379
that if they're if they see something

00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,180
that is visual that they can write code

00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:09,539
and like a window pops up that is super

00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:11,309
exciting and you know if they if it asks

00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:12,899
them a question and they can type in an

00:08:11,309 --> 00:08:19,039
answer also super exciting

00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:23,099
so in summary IRB compelling for adults

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:25,589
maybe so

00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:27,029
so the plan that you come up with I'll

00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:28,559
just give you a couple of pointers so

00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:30,029
install all of the tools that you might

00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:31,110
use on all of the computers that the

00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:33,000
kids have access to you right you want

00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:36,149
to make it easy for them to explore on

00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,339
their own you want to start small you

00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:41,190
want to start with something that's

00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:43,589
pretty straightforward and there's a lot

00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:46,199
of resources online for programming

00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:48,540
lesson plans I think there are much

00:08:46,199 --> 00:08:50,100
fewer resources that talk about you know

00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:55,230
how you actually teach which is why I

00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:58,639
did this talk so in terms of what you

00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:01,500
actually want to do when you're teaching

00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,610
short iterations are very very important

00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,310
and what this means is that you want to

00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:08,100
have little steps of maybe 15 minutes or

00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:09,660
eight or less each that each have some

00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,319
kind of visual change to the program

00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,319
that you're writing

00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:17,269
and the other really important thing

00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:20,779
when you're doing this is listen to your

00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:23,199
customer your students your student and

00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:27,139
specifically what I'm talking about is

00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:30,019
you come up with a plan and then don't

00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:31,549
be afraid to change it right so when I

00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:34,519
was doing this thing with shoes with

00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:36,169
high schoolers I had one step early on

00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:37,730
that was like okay we're gonna change

00:09:36,169 --> 00:09:40,339
the background color of the window by

00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,449
adding an attribute to the window and I

00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:42,709
was like okay and then we'll move on

00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:45,040
we'll do something else but they were

00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:48,499
super excited about changing the color

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,239
and I was like okay all right so let's

00:09:48,499 --> 00:09:51,980
look for other colors that we can do and

00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:53,839
then so shoes has this list of named

00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:55,819
colors right like you know and they have

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,220
some weird ones like tomato and you know

00:09:55,819 --> 00:09:59,720
clam bisque and rude stuff like that so

00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,889
we went around and we you know we went

00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,329
through we went through them and we

00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:04,419
tried colors that we could come up with

00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:06,290
until we found one that didn't exist

00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:08,480
which was I think they came up with

00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:10,850
periwinkle did not exist and so we

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,609
actually then spent 20 minutes talking

00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:15,709
about RGB and how colors are composed

00:10:13,609 --> 00:10:16,999
and how you can make a custom color and

00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:19,609
then they experimented it until they

00:10:16,999 --> 00:10:21,919
found an RGB combination that was

00:10:19,609 --> 00:10:23,929
similar periwinkle and then we made a

00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:25,519
method called periwinkle that had this

00:10:23,929 --> 00:10:28,429
RGB values in it and all this was

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,169
something that I had not planned but it

00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:32,539
was the kids loved it it was really

00:10:30,169 --> 00:10:34,279
exciting and I think it's important to

00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:36,829
just be aware of like okay I've got this

00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:38,449
plan but I need to get feedback from my

00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:40,459
students as I'm going along and we need

00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:41,860
to you know not be afraid to follow what

00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:43,630
they're interested in

00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,280
so don't stick to a plan because it's

00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:46,960
the plan okay a lot of the worst

00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,980
teachers in the world do this right

00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,360
they've got a plan they've got an

00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,470
outline they're gonna hit all those

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,620
points and they're gonna go through them

00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:55,060
one by one

00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,190
don't worry about finishing is the next

00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:59,140
thing like get as far as you can get in

00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,790
the time that you have your goal is not

00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:03,460
to leave them with a finished product

00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:07,540
but leave them with enough tools and

00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:11,110
interests to keep going and look for the

00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:12,880
moments that are with you know someone

00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:15,730
who's a teacher told me they call them

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,870
teachable moments where you know you're

00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,940
you're looking at something you're like

00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:20,320
oh so it's a good example of this is

00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,700
when we're doing the RGB stuff I'm like

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,020
oh I wasn't then you talked about how

00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,970
colors are composed when you're

00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:27,580
programming on a screen and the pixels

00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:29,710
and different types of ways that you can

00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,810
compose a color but you know that was

00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:33,310
interesting it was good to talk about

00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:36,370
and finally look for signs that they've

00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:39,700
turned off right this is a I think as

00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:41,590
programmers in general programmers have

00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,450
the reputation of being a little bit

00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:46,510
socially clueless and maybe missing

00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:48,550
social cues on the other hand I gave a

00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:50,670
talk at the Southern California Linux

00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:53,290
Expo yesterday and I was reminded that

00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:55,210
Ruby developers on the whole are very

00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:58,720
socially capable among technical groups

00:11:55,210 --> 00:12:00,750
in general and I'll just leave it at

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,750
that

00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:05,040
but and that's part of the reason why I

00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:08,610
think that people who are Ruby

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,620
developers may be actually predisposed

00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:11,880
to being good teachers right they people

00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,980
who are Ruby developers tend to have

00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:17,790
maybe well develop social skills

00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:19,500
relative to other engineers and well as

00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:21,180
Sarah alavés climbing the car on the way

00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,620
over that one of her friends says the

00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:26,850
Ruby is the programming language for

00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:30,870
extra Hertz hmm maybe extroverts among

00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:33,470
programmers but yeah so watch for those

00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,470
social kids

00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:37,610
so when I talk about continuous

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,440
deployment basically what I mean here is

00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,300
that it is getting good at teaching

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,640
takes practice right the first time you

00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:46,550
try it with someone things aren't going

00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,810
to work things are gonna be clunky but

00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:50,900
it's a skill it's a skill you can learn

00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:52,100
right and just like programming the

00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,510
first time you try it there's gonna be

00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,400
rough edges there's going to be things

00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:57,080
that don't work so take all the

00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,110
opportunities you can to teach somebody

00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,920
something and there's a lot of

00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:03,230
opportunities to do this that you might

00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,510
not consider teaching but which actually

00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:06,980
I think are so there's the basics

00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:08,720
there's like you know talks the meet up

00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,860
pair programming actually I think one of

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,300
the reasons it works really well is

00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:14,030
because you are continuously teaching

00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,800
and learning simultaneously which makes

00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:18,860
it a very powerful experience for both

00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,870
people in the pair there's always summer

00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:22,090
camps and so on that need volunteers to

00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:25,270
teach programming and they're usually

00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:27,170
very very grateful if you offer to do so

00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:29,120
there's a project I've been working on

00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:31,850
called National Lab Day which matches

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,860
teachers up with scientists who want to

00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:36,050
help in their classroom you can check

00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,490
that out and if you're in San Francisco

00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,930
I always need teachers for the

00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:42,320
introductory rails workshops that I

00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:44,000
teach and they are as I said a very

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,180
straightforward and easy curriculum to

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,180
follow

00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,260
and basically I think the most important

00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:52,920
thing to think about when you're

00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:54,870
considering teaching is expect sometimes

00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,340
it's not going to work right there's

00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:58,770
gonna be kids you can't reach there's

00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:00,960
gonna be you know good lesson plans that

00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:04,110
you try that they just totally miss the

00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:05,760
mark but it's important to just keep

00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,740
doing it and the more you do it the

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,040
better you get at it it's kind of a

00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:13,279
virtuous cycle same way programming is

00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:15,620
so let me sum up

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:20,210
you should teach

00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:21,529
you can teach and agile is more for more

00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:23,270
than just development right there's a

00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:25,310
lot of ways to apply agile principles to

00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:27,560
other things I think teaching is one of

00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:31,790
those things that possibly needs it more

00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:33,280
than other areas and finally practice a

00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:36,240
lot

00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,240
any questions

00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,209
yes

00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:46,389
yeah

00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:48,009
so question was teaching shoes versus

00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:50,739
teaching rails I think it's important to

00:14:48,009 --> 00:14:53,739
pick something that is achievable in the

00:14:50,739 --> 00:14:55,419
timeframe that you have for a high

00:14:53,739 --> 00:14:56,649
school or I was teaching high schoolers

00:14:55,419 --> 00:15:00,069
when I was doing this and I only had

00:14:56,649 --> 00:15:03,939
half a day and if we only have three

00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:06,009
hours together if we're lucky then I'm

00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:07,149
not gonna have enough time to really go

00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:08,799
through all of the files that rails

00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:10,599
generates and talk about the complexity

00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,699
of MVC and a rails app and deployment

00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:14,199
and and I think I can do it in a day

00:15:12,699 --> 00:15:17,349
actually but I don't think I can do it

00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:19,539
in half a day so I know Sarah Ellen is

00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:21,669
working on a curriculum for middle

00:15:19,539 --> 00:15:24,459
schoolers using Sinatra just one option

00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:26,199
because making a web app actually really

00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:27,879
is compelling if you talk to kids and

00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:29,019
you explain what a web app is because

00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:31,089
usually they're not really aware that

00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:34,119
like Facebook is a web app and Twitter

00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:37,329
is a web app yeah and then they're like

00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:38,769
oh yeah I want to do one of those so

00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:41,949
that's usually you know web apps are

00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:43,689
very compelling I think that they add a

00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:45,729
lot of overhead and complexity in terms

00:15:43,689 --> 00:15:48,129
of just the deployment and setup that

00:15:45,729 --> 00:15:50,189
you know some older kids may be able to

00:15:48,129 --> 00:15:53,229
handle younger kids maybe not so much

00:15:50,189 --> 00:15:56,139
there are four young it's actually I

00:15:53,229 --> 00:15:57,609
like shoes or Hackney hack hockey hacks

00:15:56,139 --> 00:16:00,129
actually seen some activity in the last

00:15:57,609 --> 00:16:01,989
month or so after being somewhat

00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:03,609
moribund for a while which is kind of

00:16:01,989 --> 00:16:08,379
exciting that was one of wise projects

00:16:03,609 --> 00:16:10,179
along with shoes so and I think that you

00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:12,489
know Ruby I think is a great first

00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:14,049
language for anybody right kids adults

00:16:12,489 --> 00:16:15,879
doesn't matter I think it's a great

00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:17,709
first programming language it's just

00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:19,809
close enough to English that it's not

00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:21,339
that hard to you know it doesn't have a

00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:24,519
lot of the overhead of something like

00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:27,170
Java or even PHP any sort of C

00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:29,519
descendant language right

00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:31,470
so yeah there's there's quite a few

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,730
tools out there and it depends on the

00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:35,220
length of time you have to spend with

00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:36,959
the kids how old they are maybe your own

00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,220
expertise because I think it's very

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,379
important to be excited about what

00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:43,139
you're teaching so if something is like

00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:45,959
you know it doesn't matter how wonderful

00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:48,060
Visual Basic is for kids I I would have

00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:49,259
a hard time teaching it to somebody so

00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,699
you know pick something that you're

00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:52,710
excited about and that'll that'll

00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:55,710
translate

00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:55,710
