	00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:10,120
I was at the speaker dinner the other

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,039
night and the one of the gentlemen at

00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:15,610
the dinner that I met or the other

00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:17,140
speaker was talking to me about so what

00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,210
is your talk and I gave him the title

00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,400
and he goes yeah what is this shiny

00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,080
object right so I forget that context

00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,660
the terminology is a little different

00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,240
here in Europe so raise your hand if you

00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,980
understand what shiny objects are okay

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,100
good so I don't have to explain too much

00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:36,100
but in the context of this talk in the

00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,420
US you know we have this term I don't

00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,260
know if it's probably similar here

00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,300
silver bullet

00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:42,250
all right Solutions I don't use that

00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,809
because of obvious reasons in the US

00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,670
there's a little sensitivity to things

00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:49,260
these days

00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:51,730
so yeah shiny objects are just basically

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,350
solutions to problems that we all want

00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,870
to believe in right to help us when

00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:57,609
we're desperate for the most part so

00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:00,309
today's talk was going to be centered

00:00:57,609 --> 00:01:01,300
around that so before I get into that

00:01:00,309 --> 00:01:03,129
I'm gonna share a little bit of

00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,289
information about myself my name is

00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:08,470
angel Yvetta I'm a developer advocate

00:01:05,289 --> 00:01:10,090
for circle CI and as a developer

00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,770
advocate I love coming to these

00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,770
conferences and speaking to people like

00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:16,660
yourselves I think I spoke to a lot of

00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:18,399
you at this conference and learned

00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,500
learning about how you use technology

00:01:18,399 --> 00:01:23,470
and bring that back to my team so that

00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:26,800
we can build better tools right but this

00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:28,330
also enables me to you know share

00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,819
information about how we're using

00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:33,910
technology at that circle and and and

00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:36,280
vice versa if anyone wants to reach out

00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:38,319
to me please feel free to hit me up on

00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,910
Twitter these days I travel a lot so

00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:42,390
it's the best way to kind of get my

00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:45,369
attention I really not into email so

00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:49,660
please just feel free to hit me up I do

00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:52,030
respond yeah so let me talk about a bit

00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:54,970
about my experience as a developer when

00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:56,979
I started out my career I was working in

00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:59,110
the United States Air Force a US Air

00:01:56,979 --> 00:02:01,479
Force Space Command which is now the

00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:03,670
space force all right they merged that I

00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:06,610
don't know if you saw the the new

00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:07,929
uniforms we used to wear these blue like

00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:09,250
make simply flight suits like the

00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:12,610
astronauts when I was used to go to work

00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:15,580
now it's camouflage I'm like what like

00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:18,010
this isn't it space dark should act

00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,550
right anyway I hope they changed it to a

00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,860
black

00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:23,170
like cool flight suit but when I started

00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,880
my career you know I was young I learned

00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,890
to program professionally in the federal

00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,930
government and this was in the 90s so

00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:31,030
there was no like internet the way we

00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:33,520
know it today when I developed code it

00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:35,800
was siloed on my own on a Windows

00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,990
machine usually and then when I was done

00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,880
you know compiling my release they would

00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:42,220
go on a floppy disk or a zip drive

00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:46,090
remember those anybody remember the zip

00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:47,590
drives Nancy anyway so it was the 90s or

00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,570
we would burn it to a CD right and then

00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:52,420
walk down the hall to the data center so

00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:54,100
this was on Cape Canaveral so we're

00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:56,560
launching rockets and I'm working at

00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:58,600
NASA and I'm going in to this data

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,820
center and this security everywhere and

00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,680
knock on the door and it's the system

00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:05,410
and administrators right all in one room

00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,910
in the air-conditioned data center and

00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:09,190
they're like alright who the hell are

00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:12,660
you you know like I have some software

00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:14,590
to the release it's like do tomorrow

00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,420
give me that and they close the door

00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:18,610
right shut to throw in my face but I've

00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,290
always been a curious developer right so

00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,450
I consider myself a developer with

00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:24,760
operational tendencies and the reason is

00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:25,959
when I was younger I was like I'm

00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,700
writing this code I'm spending a lot of

00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,400
time in it and then all I hear back from

00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,350
the operators were a your doesn't

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,530
work right it's broken

00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:38,020
and here's a log file on the unded CD or

00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:40,030
the the floppy right and yeah that

00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:42,310
really pissed me off because I wanted to

00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,900
know how what the next steps were for my

00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:47,200
software it's like you're sending into a

00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,800
void so when I started going into the

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,780
ops center

00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,459
I was just persistent kept going kept

00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,200
going and eventually they realized like

00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:56,680
oh this guy just cares right he's a

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,330
developer that actually cares so I guess

00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,209
it's kind of I was doing DevOps before

00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:04,870
the term DevOps became you know

00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:07,240
normalized today and what I did learn

00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:09,010
though was as I was talking to the

00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,959
system administrators they started

00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,820
realizing that like I cared and then

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,950
they started giving me root access or

00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,330
pseudo access to servers right so that

00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,400
could help them deploy and we actually

00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:21,370
started working together as development

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,620
teams right and operations teams and I

00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:27,030
learned so much and throughout my career

00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:29,380
ever since then I was literally working

00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,090
every job I went as a developer I

00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,080
consider myself a developer to this day

00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:34,870
but

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,180
I would sit in a you know development

00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,470
team writing software and I would go and

00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,210
deploy it and help the system

00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,919
administrators deploy this software

00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,840
after a while they were like hey why

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,689
don't you just work with us as a

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,330
developer so you know I lived both sides

00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:50,860
of the house and it was it was really

00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,930
enlightening all most of my career was

00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:55,750
like that and today I want to share

00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:57,879
story about my experience working on a

00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,710
really really good team of developers

00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:02,639
very experienced and a really really

00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:06,250
good team of experienced operators and

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:10,120
tell you how we experience a shiny

00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:13,330
object moment together so yeah like I

00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,099
said I was working with the team and we

00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:18,069
had really strong developers really

00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:19,750
strong ops people DBAs write really good

00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:22,180
team cohesive so a lot of folks were a

00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:24,310
little mature they understood how to

00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:27,819
communicate with each other it was a

00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:32,110
really strong team and we were asked to

00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:34,689
build a new UI for some features that

00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:37,569
the customers wanted and we were excited

00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:40,270
to build it I was working on the front

00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:44,830
end team building out these new features

00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:46,509
and back then you know we we were using

00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:48,909
SQL databases so everything was kind of

00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:50,680
a flat structure and at that point we

00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:53,620
had to build a hierarchical model so

00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,810
obviously Jason writes a fit these new

00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,789
frameworks that were coming out and

00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:59,319
people were using them and it just made

00:05:57,789 --> 00:06:01,569
our lives easier right the data was

00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:04,629
structured really nicely we wanted to

00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:06,039
modernize a bunch of things but there

00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:09,729
was a problem I don't know if anyone

00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:11,680
ever you know worked with relational

00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:13,539
data models and then try to make them

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,979
nested in hierarchy right I think I had

00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:17,710
a couple conversations with some folks

00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:19,900
yesterday about this and it was really

00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,580
hard like we had a link table after link

00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,800
table after link table things were

00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,629
slowing down index is really just total

00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,430
trash right it was horrible

00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:30,039
we were really frustrated and trying to

00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:32,289
come up with solution for this I mean we

00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:34,029
were reading books by calc oh I don't

00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:36,430
know if anybody read that book about SQL

00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:39,909
and and basically mapping you know

00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:43,360
hierarchy structures it was a mess so I

00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:45,370
was on my own working with an open

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,919
source project called MongoDB

00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:53,100
Wow this is amazing anybody here ever

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:57,100
here anybody use manga you love it

00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:59,320
awesome listen I saw that little head

00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,520
shake but anyway yeah I was like this is

00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,970
great right the data is already

00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:06,250
structured we just submitted as it is it

00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:09,220
persists as it lies and bringing it back

00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:12,100
and forth between the the system the

00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:14,620
service it was great the problem was it

00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,479
was still kind of new the technology

00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:19,810
right and a lot of folks didn't know

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,460
about it how the how to use it right

00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,970
yeah they didn't understand we didn't

00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:26,680
understand the complexities behind that

00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:28,900
but we didn't care we were so desperate

00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,850
that you know when I showed it to the

00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,889
team they were just falling over this

00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,840
like wow this is the solution so you

00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:37,360
know whatever Silver Bullet it's awesome

00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,010
and I'm like yeah but nobody knows it

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:44,350
that's all right we'll figure it out

00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:46,449
yeah as we all do right so we agreed the

00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:48,100
ops side and then the development teams

00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:49,300
we were like okay this is the solution

00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,970
let's move forward

00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,410
management signed off on it and we began

00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:55,810
to work right we started building out

00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:58,389
the infrastructure the operational teams

00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:01,450
were building out clusters they were you

00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:02,830
know creating the our capabilities h.a

00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:04,780
making sure everything's you know

00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:09,099
failing over all that stuff those are

00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:12,010
the easy parts for the for that team so

00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:15,490
again no MongoDB experience right and I

00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:18,010
was the guy driving this which I was

00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:20,919
just learning it myself but we were all

00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:22,810
excited about this new product and using

00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:27,849
it in our in our in our development

00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:29,500
process so we quickly built the minimal

00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:32,169
Viable Product pitch that's everybody

00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:34,719
showed it they signed off on it and then

00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:37,209
we you know built out the the legit

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,719
release for for the application based on

00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:43,300
the MongoDB cluster and we did you know

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,160
we made quick work of that we actually

00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,980
finished it about a month ahead of time

00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:50,410
roughly and you know everyone was happy

00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:52,029
management was like excited about it our

00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:54,510
customers were excited and we were super

00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:56,920
super happy about deploying this thing

00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:58,640
again customers were super happy you

00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,399
know and they started using it right

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:04,010
immediately and we saw huge you know

00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:06,250
peaks and and spikes and and didn't they

00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:09,800
never they never went down it was just

00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:11,360
kept going up ascending so we're like I

00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:18,829
said we were super proud ourselves life

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:19,399
was hey we were just ecstatic until 90

00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:23,180
days

00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:25,820
fast-forward yeah I'm bump right

00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:28,519
that starts kicking over clusters or you

00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,620
know Nagios is just blowing up alerts

00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:34,940
everywhere we're seeing hi this

00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:37,790
thrashing memories just peak CPUs peaked

00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,200
it's just a disaster so services are

00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,720
failing we're getting customers are

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,810
calling hey I'm timing out and nothing's

00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,910
happening and like I said we were a good

00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:48,620
team we went and started troubleshooting

00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,180
mode right put our hats on start looking

00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,100
at logs start looking at all the details

00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:57,529
and we quickly figured out what was

00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:59,570
going on the volume was about 15 million

00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:02,510
records in MongoDB they call them

00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:04,490
documents and you would think yeah this

00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:06,589
should handle this no frogs we had tons

00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:09,079
of beefy machines behind this right and

00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:11,360
we really just befuddled like what's

00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:14,269
going on and when we started doing a

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:19,430
deeper dive into this of course my

00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:21,589
queries were it's terrible I didn't

00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:23,449
understand what was going till I looked

00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:25,339
at like you know online start looking at

00:10:23,449 --> 00:10:27,050
we called they were really

00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:30,110
generous in helping us but pretty much

00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:31,300
the queries are garbage indexing on on

00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:34,940
the wrong things

00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:36,260
and if you really boil it down what had

00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:38,510
happened was I don't know if you all

00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:41,120
know this but MongoDB is non-relational

00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:43,100
so that means all the normalization that

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,980
we were used to that I was used to

00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:48,290
I was recreating that inside of MongoDB

00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:51,800
which is by the way never never ever

00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:55,279
ever try to do that hey don't do it it

00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,750
doesn't work I don't care if you think

00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:01,519
you got a hack for it it's not going to

00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:03,649
work right and we also so yeah so we

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,180
discovered what was going on and we

00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:07,339
quickly realized right to get to recover

00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,839
the system we decided to do some math

00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:11,180
and said all right well it was working

00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:11,990
up until 15 million records so let's

00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,149
take the

00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:16,880
least use or in at least access records

00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:18,770
move them over temporarily into a kind

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,120
of cold storage so that the system would

00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:22,430
recover as soon as we did that right

00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,839
moved over however many records boom the

00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,520
system was back up and running we didn't

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,740
have to reboot a server literally it

00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,839
just started working and then we got to

00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:32,300
work on a solution right for a permanent

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,610
solution for this but the damage had

00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:37,010
already been done and our customers had

00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:39,890
experienced you know the this outage and

00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:41,630
it was terrible right the organization

00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:45,500
that I worked for and our customers lost

00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:47,089
a lot of time and money and this was the

00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,339
thing that hurt me the most was to make

00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:52,550
our team I lost all of our street cred

00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:55,040
right literally we were just in shatters

00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:57,050
I heard we were just it was inconsolable

00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,529
we were very disappointed in ourselves

00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:01,790
so everybody familiar with the term hot

00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:04,670
wash or postmortem

00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:06,560
right we like said we were professionals

00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:08,990
we conducted a post-mortem trying to

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,110
analyze what had happened and then fix

00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:13,550
the solutions come up with ways to not

00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:16,640
happen that make this happen again right

00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:20,240
so of course very bad programming query

00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:22,399
these are all obvious but one of the

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,170
other things we discovered was we were

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,020
so confident that you know we were just

00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:28,730
neglected any kind of testing we were

00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:31,100
like yeah this works it worked and you

00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:32,420
know it's typical when your developer

00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,730
and you it works on your local machine

00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:37,640
and everything's cool but when you start

00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:38,990
adding volume to it and it's you don't

00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,420
test anything we didn't do any load

00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,100
testing nothing so that was a big

00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,750
mistake

00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:47,300
and obviously right we didn't properly

00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:50,630
vet the technology we didn't understand

00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:54,200
Mongo's capabilities and we were totally

00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:56,329
in the dark on how to actually manage it

00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,980
radiant's a configurate manager and then

00:12:56,329 --> 00:13:00,320
also write the data schemas that we were

00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:05,899
doing that I was doing they were totally

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:07,940
off so that's the story about my

00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:09,380
experience and my shiny object though

00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,959
our site management moment with MongoDB

00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:13,160
and now I'm gonna talk about a little

00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:15,050
bit of things and this might be obvious

00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,660
to you but I'm gonna share them anyway

00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:20,750
so let's talk about avoiding those

00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:23,089
situations number one don't believe the

00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:24,910
hype right so if you find that your team

00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:26,830
is so arrogant

00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:29,950
and complacent there's a problem right

00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:31,570
start addressing that I don't care you

00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:33,250
know it may be just one person that

00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:34,990
reveals that way but it's okay to voice

00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,420
your opinion and start getting your

00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:39,940
team's to like understand hey I think

00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:42,120
we're getting over ours our skis here

00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:45,370
you know we're a little bit complacent

00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,530
and just be on the lookout for you know

00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:49,240
that kind of complacency because it's

00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:51,730
it's a problem and it it just

00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,430
degenerates the team in the culture from

00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,840
there obviously thoroughly vet unit

00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:58,390
technologies right understand the

00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:01,210
capabilities like with me in my example

00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:03,550
I didn't understand the non-relational

00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:05,950
know relational database schemas right I

00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:07,720
didn't understand that you couldn't do

00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:09,760
linked tables or you shouldn't do the

00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,980
linked tables within this this platform

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:15,340
because it's not built for that now

00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:19,120
today I think MongoDB has has actually

00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:22,360
added like atomic transactions and

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,010
there's also a relational components now

00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,930
that you could actually implement but

00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:29,350
back then right this was very early a

00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:30,550
early stage for that for the product but

00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:32,830
again you know thoroughly vetted

00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:36,100
technology understand just look past the

00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:37,780
the the marketing material does that

00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,520
kind of got me to is like oh you don't

00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,160
this is the fastest database for any

00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:45,100
kind of web app oh yeah I like that

00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:47,290
don't believe it or at least you know do

00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,760
your due diligence I definitely

00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,710
recommend with all the technology today

00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,270
we have like dr. woo I just sat through

00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:54,520
Joel's talk today you have docker

00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:56,260
containers right stand stuff up in those

00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:59,080
environments and then that also actually

00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:00,730
helps you to equalize right yeah your

00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,710
development environment and also you can

00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,970
equalize your staging environments you

00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,800
can equalize your production

00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:08,170
environments to a degree right

00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:12,550
it's Dockers don't let it become your

00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:14,170
shiny object but it can it can also it

00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,520
could work and help your teams kind of

00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:18,130
you know work through their software

00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,860
development problems I've actually you

00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:22,720
know at Circle CI we use docker all the

00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:24,310
time and it's it's really great for our

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,170
development teams and it you know and

00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:29,170
you literally helps us deploy

00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:30,730
applications quicker so yeah start you

00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:32,470
know looking for technologies that

00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:35,760
everyone can understand and share and

00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:38,220
there's a low barrier of entry as well

00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,710
one of the things that we did was

00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:44,940
protocol right SOPs everybody have SOPs

00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:46,650
region I know okay and the next slides

00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,290
for you guys that but basically with

00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:51,150
protocol right and SOPs it just helps

00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:53,760
you document what you're doing in your

00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:55,830
processes in your operations meaning if

00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,630
you bring a new person on board right to

00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:00,780
do some work then you want to give them

00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:01,830
these documentation like standard

00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,660
operating procedures so that it

00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:06,720
standardizes and it brings consistent

00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:10,650
consistency to your your operations and

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:16,260
also it lends itself to also being a

00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:18,750
very very let me say it takes dictates

00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:21,480
all of your processes now what they will

00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:23,100
say about SOPs is if you have them make

00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,500
sure you iterate over them because what

00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,220
worked yesterday will not work tomorrow

00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,350
right

00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:30,000
always I have a rule when I was managing

00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:31,920
teams I was like live we have to look at

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,120
our stuff every 30 days if there's a

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,340
change we're using a new technology

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,530
let's update the documentation right and

00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,940
it also keeps management off your back a

00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:40,500
lot of times if you're working with big

00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,270
companies these days you need to have

00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,950
that documentation they want to see it

00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:45,180
so if you're a start-up and you're

00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:47,190
thinking you're gonna go work for Google

00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:50,190
with Google or a bank or whatever big

00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:52,590
corporation this documentation just do

00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:54,330
the work upfront get it done maintain it

00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:56,670
because you're gonna need to every year

00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:59,520
annually certify things remember that

00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:03,030
big piece of advice I can give you you

00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:05,250
don't have SOPs please start building

00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:07,290
them like I said the benefits are the

00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:10,350
consistency right so you're literally

00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:12,510
documenting how you do business in a

00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:14,340
technical way you can even automate them

00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:15,870
these days right like I don't care if

00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:18,180
you just stick a document up in github

00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:21,210
and have a version you know a version

00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:23,940
control just build something I see this

00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:25,980
in a lot of like startups new teams that

00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:28,440
are within organization sometimes big

00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,750
companies will start like a research and

00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,580
development type team and these folks

00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,680
don't build any kind of documentation

00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:37,950
and next thing you know they're you know

00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:39,750
it's a year in and have to build up all

00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:41,910
this kind of stuff it just started off

00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:44,130
the bat doing it you know and that

00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:45,960
you'll get into a flow and then your

00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:47,640
culture will kind of evolve around that

00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,500
and that's one of the best pieces of

00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,170
advice I can give you to avoid like

00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:54,410
shiny object syndrome

00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:55,549
and don't set and forget one of the

00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:58,280
things that we did was when we

00:17:55,549 --> 00:18:00,440
implemented MongoDB was yeah the teams

00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,059
like said we were very complacent and we

00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,770
set this thing we never know but it was

00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:07,010
actually monitoring it we just had now

00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:12,080
you say hey if you hit a threshold kick

00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:13,250
off an alert which cost us so I'm gonna

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,290
switch it up a little bit here so

00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:18,320
obviously right technology isn't about

00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:22,880
is about people it helps our lives right

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:25,160
it brings convenience for us lets us do

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:30,410
things consistently and in a stable

00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:32,690
manner and when you have people involved

00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:36,559
that usually means there's a culture

00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:40,250
right forming and cultures are things

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:45,080
that you know generate attitudes and and

00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:47,450
and help people kind of form bonds and

00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,530
it it also brings people together in a

00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:51,440
sense that you know you can work

00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:53,540
together sort of for a certain goal no

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,370
I'm gonna talk about everybody into this

00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:57,110
guy's I'm from New Jersey by the way so

00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:58,940
I had to make the reference for Jersey

00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:01,820
this is Tony Soprano from The Sopranos

00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:03,590
show yeah all right so I'm gonna talk

00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:06,500
about managers and some of the traits of

00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:08,570
management that you know if you are a

00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:11,630
manager maybe just refresh you a little

00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:14,750
bit and we'll talk about individuals as

00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:17,660
well so I'll talk about my styled

00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:20,480
management a long time ago I coined this

00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:22,250
phrase sudu management and the reason

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,380
why I call this we do management is when

00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:26,419
I joined teams as a manager and when I

00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:28,580
used to manage people I would tell them

00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:30,559
look I am a peer I'm a colleague right

00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:33,830
while we're doing the day-to-day work

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:35,720
let's you know share the wealth and I

00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:37,910
would pitch in where I could not when I

00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,140
needed to do managerial things and you

00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:41,360
know I tell them hey I'm gonna shoot her

00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:43,250
up and handle the HR stuff handle

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,799
conflict resolution whatever it was that

00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:47,299
was going on to that day and then I exit

00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:50,419
gracefully and go back to work with them

00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:53,299
right what I found with this style of

00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:54,350
management it helps with folks giving

00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:56,870
them kind of knocking down those

00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:59,929
intimidation barriers right so it gives

00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:02,390
them a sense of ownership and I've been

00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:04,760
doing this about 15 years with this kind

00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:07,190
of style and I really enjoy and

00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:10,040
folks you know I get a lot of I used to

00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:11,750
get a lot of work out of people and they

00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:14,000
felt really good about you know the work

00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:15,500
and they said they owned their their

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,530
their piece of work I didn't feel like

00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,820
oh he's the manager or this person's

00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:21,380
that right it just broke down all those

00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,850
intimidation barriers and they saw that

00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,410
and it's the old mill to everything

00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:26,300
right it's a lead by example

00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:30,110
for the most part but with a little

00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:33,980
twist right so again as a manager always

00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:36,560
empower your people you want them to own

00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:39,260
their their decisions right a lot of

00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:41,830
times when I even to this day sometimes

00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:44,090
I see it when I'm working with partners

00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:45,560
some managers are telling their people

00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,420
you know like oh you got a check with

00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,310
Jim or this and that I didn't run my

00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:51,290
shop that way I was just like look if

00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:53,450
you're interested in doing this own it

00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:55,070
build it and then share it with the with

00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:56,990
the with the team and let's make

00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:58,940
decisions based on on you know what

00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:00,500
you're showing us and a lot of times we

00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:03,140
would improve on those ideas and they

00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,730
were really good ideas and we had a

00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:09,020
culture of you know basically

00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:12,590
empowerment this is really important I

00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:14,930
work for a CI CD company but you know is

00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:17,510
the reason why I work there and because

00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:19,130
I believe in this as developers right

00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:21,290
we're always failing and that's a good

00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:24,050
thing because you understand how your

00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:25,370
system right you start forming the way

00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,900
your system is going to work processes

00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:29,930
you understand your limitations you

00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:31,940
understand when things are failing all

00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:34,880
right that's great now I need to find a

00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:37,310
solution for that right and it's okay to

00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:41,270
fail that's how we learn that's how

00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:44,740
things get better mentoring is really

00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:48,440
important you should always foster a

00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:53,210
culture of mentorship you know empower

00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:55,310
your subordinates to feel comfortable to

00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:57,020
come to you for things that you know

00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:58,520
you're an expert in and if you're not an

00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:01,270
expert in something find someone who can

00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:07,250
mentor them it's a really important

00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:09,050
growing contribution right this is

00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:11,120
something I struggled with quite a bit

00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:13,670
and making those hard choices sometimes

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,050
you know you really like your team you

00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:17,720
really like the personalities on your

00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:18,860
team but sometimes they've I think we

00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,200
all outgrow

00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:23,240
right our jobs and our roles and when it

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,399
comes to that managers you know you have

00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:27,049
that personal connection you're doing

00:22:25,399 --> 00:22:28,490
more damage by keeping people who are

00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:30,919
not really fitting in or not

00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:33,620
contributing and you don't have to fire

00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:36,049
them you can you know recommend them to

00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:37,610
another unit a team or whatever then

00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:39,890
sometimes you do have to fire them and

00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:41,929
and that's okay like I have I had an

00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:44,809
experience where I had a person working

00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:46,909
for me and you know I was paying him

00:22:44,809 --> 00:22:49,070
certain amount of money and I was really

00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:50,539
conflicted about firing this person but

00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:53,120
he was dragging the team down

00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:56,169
and I was that finally I had to I had to

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:58,880
make that choice when I let him go he

00:22:56,169 --> 00:23:01,460
reached out to me about thirty days

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,580
later he was angry right but I let him

00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:06,289
go as gracefully as I could and he says

00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:08,690
yeah yeah by the way thanks for firing

00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:10,730
me and I thought oh boy here we go

00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:12,620
that was the the subject line thanks for

00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:16,250
firing me and then I read the message

00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:19,279
and it was like I'm making like you know

00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:21,740
I think he got like a 60% raise right so

00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:24,380
and he was much happier right so he was

00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:26,929
is actually a thank-you letter which you

00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:28,669
know again it'll work out if that's the

00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:30,649
the worst-case scenario but definitely

00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:33,950
if you got to make decisions make them

00:23:30,649 --> 00:23:36,230
and you know don't look back so let's

00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:40,070
talk about individuals right like us all

00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:43,580
of us you're not a manager yeah

00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:46,000
don't have this attitude I hear this

00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:49,250
quite more often than I'd like

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,019
like I said this is a way for you to

00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,700
level up so if you're an individual and

00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:54,769
you know you feel like oh well that's

00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:57,559
not my job I think that's a terrible

00:23:54,769 --> 00:23:59,779
attitude they have it's it's

00:23:57,559 --> 00:24:01,789
self-defeating number one number two it

00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:03,860
doesn't bode well with your colleagues

00:24:01,789 --> 00:24:06,769
either right like and then that also

00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:09,260
creates these toxic cultures that I've

00:24:06,769 --> 00:24:12,710
worked in in many companies and

00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:14,779
organizations so yeah you know try to

00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:16,909
level up and understand that you are

00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:18,409
contributor on a team and and that

00:24:16,909 --> 00:24:20,750
affects the culture when you're you know

00:24:18,409 --> 00:24:22,880
we all get frustrated I get it but

00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,799
sometimes when you're just consistently

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,200
take a break maybe you need a vacation

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,520
or talk to your colleagues be like hey

00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,680
look I don't know I can't handle this

00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:35,440
it's okay you'll be fine

00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:37,540
this is a really annoying one when

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,090
someone points something out and in a

00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:40,270
pull request with no solution to it all

00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:42,760
right

00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:44,560
don't do that if you have a solution if

00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:46,720
you point out yeah this is broken have

00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:49,210
some you know even if it's not the right

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,280
solution have some ideas it's okay put

00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:52,720
yourself out there no one's gonna be

00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,610
laughing at you right you're

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,050
contributing and you're offering up and

00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:59,320
you're being you know you're showing a

00:24:56,050 --> 00:25:02,410
little bit about your your knowledge in

00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,970
things just don't leave it broken and

00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:05,770
and sitting there for someone else to

00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:07,750
repair right or team up with someone

00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:09,250
sometimes that's what I do is I work

00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:12,580
with someone that I know hey he knows

00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:14,950
about kubernetes or or you know docker

00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:17,140
and we work together and we build out

00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:20,200
solutions for like some serious problems

00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:25,180
that we have anybody ever get one of

00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:28,780
these yeah I used to give them out for

00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:30,850
like candy back in the day but yeah if

00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:33,640
you're a mentee or someone you know

00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:36,670
you're under someone's wing have respect

00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:39,100
for their time put the work in because I

00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:41,800
always say this job as a developer it's

00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:44,320
90 percent learning in my opinion right

00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,060
and then the 10 percent is doing so

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,800
you're constantly learning things are

00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:51,070
changing we're a PHP obviously you have

00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:53,560
25 years now right it's changed a lot

00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:56,440
from when I started and then you have a

00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:58,960
ton of different avenues that it went

00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,520
down but at the you know it just shows

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,230
that technology's constant it's gonna

00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:06,100
change all the time so we're constantly

00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:08,410
learning and as a mentee right if you're

00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:10,600
being mentee that mentored you know put

00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:11,980
in a but I would say on average like 20

00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,390
minutes if you don't figure something on

00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:16,180
20 mins didn't reach out to your mentors

00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:17,920
or someone else I used to get folks that

00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:20,650
didn't you know I'm like did you look at

00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:24,130
it did you even like read no come on

00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:25,480
right so help yourself and and again

00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:29,710
it's another way to level up in your

00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:32,020
skills so yeah I have a hard time with

00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:33,430
this I still struggle with this so I'm

00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:35,460
always looking for ways to improve my

00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:37,120
listening skills meaning you know

00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,860
sometimes you're in a meeting

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,300
things are you're excited because you

00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:42,610
have an idea maybe someone sparks an

00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,420
idea when they're speaking and then I

00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:45,370
just jump

00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:47,140
it's it's it's not a good it's not a

00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:49,030
good look you know not a good fit so I

00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:51,190
struggle with this my advice to you is

00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:53,170
all to just sit back let the people

00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:56,710
finish their thoughts and then you know

00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:57,570
add your own no matter how wrong they

00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:00,460
are

00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:01,990
and when you disagree you know be polite

00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:05,410
and say well I have a different

00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:06,670
perspective and and such I know it's

00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:09,960
engineer sometimes we're a little short

00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:13,480
with each other let's not do that oh

00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:15,250
sorry and then the last I think this is

00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,320
one last tip here's a learn how to

00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:19,270
communicate just like that example I

00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:21,850
shared with you when I read that subject

00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:25,300
line right like hey thanks for firing me

00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:27,760
I was reading way too much into I was

00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:31,180
thinking like Oh either this guy's gonna

00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,800
piss me off or this is gonna be like I

00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:34,930
just thought negatively right right off

00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,490
the bat and literally when I opened it

00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:38,230
read it yeah everyone started crying

00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:40,090
like wow this is amazing I fired a guy

00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:43,930
and he's thanking me for it because

00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:48,460
right he made more money so like I would

00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:50,290
say don't infer any kind of emotion from

00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:52,900
text that's one of the things that it's

00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:54,820
sometimes you know we get we're in a bad

00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:57,460
mood and we read some text an email from

00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:59,440
someone and then we started kind of

00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:01,420
saying oh this person's bad if you feel

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,580
that way give them a call and say hey

00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:05,290
let's have a coffee and talk because I

00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:08,110
promise you most of the time it's gonna

00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:09,730
there's be no emotion to it there's the

00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:11,800
intentions that you thought was there is

00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:13,090
not even there and as you can tell you

00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,550
from experience I've done this so many

00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:16,350
times in my life I thought I'd share

00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:20,380
that with you

00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:24,070
so in summary tech problems are not tech

00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:27,700
problems right it's it's all about

00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:30,100
culture and we need to especially today

00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:32,410
in this day and age and it's as kumbaya

00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:34,510
and I'm gonna say it anyway we should

00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:36,790
all be respecting each other let's try

00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:38,860
to like have an open heart open mind and

00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:41,050
especially with our peers and colleagues

00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:42,700
right it's really important we spend

00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:44,890
more time with each other than we do

00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:47,080
with our families in most cases right

00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:49,210
and you don't have to love each other

00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:51,370
but I think you have to have a mutual

00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:54,340
respect and I just want to ask all of

00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:56,050
you right before you leave today to just

00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:57,850
drink some beer together but let's go

00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:59,950
move forward and leave here and

00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:03,549
better cultures together right let's get

00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:05,650
our people happy and and and enjoying

00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:07,480
the innovations that they bring that's

00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:09,280
that's like I said have a open heart

00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,410
open mind I think the world really needs

00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:13,720
it especially in this day and age yeah

00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:16,000
this is all I have thank you if anybody

00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:18,090
wants to reach out Twitter yeah thank

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,090
