Publication date: 2020-03-11
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2020
Description: 
	If you’re a junior developer who’s ever wondered if joining tech was a terrible idea, this is the talk for you! The road to success is often zigzaggy, and having emerged on the other side, I feel it’s my duty to pass on some hard-earned lessons.

	00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,319
uh hello

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,359
i'm hillary and i'm gonna be talking

00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,840
about what i learned my first year as a

00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,679
full-time developer

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,719
and i'm just gonna move my mouse over

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,720
here so this works

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,000
cool so i'm a software developer at 10

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,320
ford consulting in

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,400
madison wisconsin in the states it's a

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,840
very exciting state i'm sure everyone is

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,240
dying to go there uh and i tweet a lot

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,439
i'm on twitter

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,120
so about five years ago i

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,120
started my first programming internship

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,160
so i'd been programming as a kid

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,520
but literally no one told me that it

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,920
could be a job for a whole number of

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,840
reasons

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,239
we don't have time to get into so i

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,680
didn't pursue it in my studies or as a

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,559
career

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,079
but kind of fell into it through the

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,280
work that i was doing in journalism and

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,480
then realized i don't want to do the

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,920
journalism i just want to do the

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,640
programming

00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:01,199
and so switched careers got into tech

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,640
today i'm co-owner of and the second

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,479
most senior developer at the same

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,040
company where i started as an intern

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:09,119
which is pretty exciting so i just a

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,360
little gift for myself

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,799
uh so the idea with that is just you

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,759
know this talk is kind of aimed at folks

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,960
who are maybe feeling like

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,799
don't always feel like tech was the

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,840
right decision for them or are kind of

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,000
struggling

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,280
early in their career so this is just

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,560
going to illustrate that there is a

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,119
light at the end of the tunnel if you

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,799
are feeling like that

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,799
so okay i've been doing it for five

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,240
years at least in the states you know

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,400
where i am that feels kind of like i'm a

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,880
middle-aged programmer

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,200
so why am i giving a talk about being an

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,920
early career programmer

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,759
a couple of reasons so it's based on a

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,520
blog post that i wrote after my first

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,680
year so when i was all fresh in my mind

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,840
kind of what i was thinking at the time

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,960
and then i do a lot of mentoring not

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,799
only in the community

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,079
with students who are learning

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,000
programming and computer science

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,439
but also at my company we have an

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,799
internship program an apprenticeship

00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,600
program and we take on a lot of junior

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,040
developers

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,799
so constantly being around people who

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,000
are in that sort of early

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,479
career mindset so

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,560
before we get started i just want to

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,440
kind of pull the room a little bit

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,400
uh who here has ever thought everyone

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,400
knows more than i do

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,239
it's pretty much everyone uh this is

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,520
just too hard i will never get it

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,920
i should raise my hand for all of these

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,200
too by the way

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,080
everyone else seems to pick up things

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,080
faster than i do

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,440
and then maybe getting a job in tech was

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,440
a terrible idea

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,920
yes good i've got the right crowd

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,519
so pretty much everyone raised their

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,519
hand at least once

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,440
which is a good thing in the sense that

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,879
you're very basic

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,720
which if people don't know that

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,360
american's lying it just means you're

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,920
kind of

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,519
super typical you're average right every

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,440
student that i have mentored

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,800
and even myself when i was going through

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,400
my coding boot camp

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,400
everyone had those thoughts right it's

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,000
super common to feel like you are the

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,560
only one who is struggling or doesn't

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,040
know what you're doing

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,080
so this talk is kind of like how can we

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,080
sort of

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,920
change that mindset and reframe things

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,080
so that we don't have

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,599
at least as many days where we feel like

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,200
becoming a programmer was a terrible

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,040
idea

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,519
so we're going to look at four different

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,599
primary topics

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,879
and then room for questions at the end

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,159
too if people have any questions or just

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,879
want to do more of a group discussion

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,680
because we're kind of a smaller crowd

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,400
so first who here primarily does coding

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:42,640
for their job

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,840
pretty much everyone cool okay so

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,280
you're not the most important people in

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,040
tech right we are not the most important

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,200
people in tech and i think especially

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,080
in the states where you have this

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,480
paradigm

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,280
of you know silicon valley and the boy

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,280
genius

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,760
and work i mean there's all of this this

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,519
cultural build up to this idea that

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,959
programmers do everything and should get

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,640
all the respect and all the money and

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,400
all the accolades and everything

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,920
and that's just not true right this idea

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,560
of that i don't know if y'all use the

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,760
phrase like

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,959
rockstar or like a ninja coder like a

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,159
10x yeah i made that is pretty great

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,200
we talk about that a lot right and

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,040
there's been a lot of backlash

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,040
especially in the states about like

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,560
moving against that idea right of like

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,680
well we just put up with john because

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,360
he's such a good programmer

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,360
and they've actually done research

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,040
harvard business review did a study of

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,320
what they call superstar workers

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,160
and this wasn't just in tech this was

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,080
across all industries

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,160
they found that they actually cost

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,240
companies money which a lot of us

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,600
probably suspected but now we have like

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,040
the hard data to show it

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,880
there's a number of reasons for that one

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,400
they're overconfident so they're a lot

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,479
more likely to make mistakes and to not

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,479
catch them

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,160
more likely to break the rules and

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,600
sometimes breaking rules is good that's

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,919
how we innovate that's how we

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,000
we can improve it's how we iterate but

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,360
some rules are there for a reason and if

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,800
you're constantly breaking them and not

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,160
telling anyone and not having a reason

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,960
for why you're breaking them obviously

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,440
that just leads to chaos

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,560
and sure they might produce more lines

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,720
of code

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,880
but it's not as good of code and so in

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,479
the end it's just kind of a wash

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,160
and then the worst part this is i think

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,600
this is where in particular

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,880
they have that really uh that strong

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,639
causal negative effect

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,280
on a workplace is that their behavior is

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,039
infectious so

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,400
every people see them getting not only

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,840
getting away with these behaviors but

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,039
being praised for them getting raises

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,160
getting promotions people think well

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,759
that's what i need to do

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,960
to get ahead right especially again if

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,639
we're talking about people who are just

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,080
entering the industry

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,160
and maybe you don't know better and so

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,680
then everyone starts doing this and so

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,560
yeah you've got tons of code but it's

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,680
all terrible

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,160
you're not getting anything done and

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,360
everyone hates each other and

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,440
no one really wants to work that kind of

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,720
environment

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,800
so if we know what we're not supposed to

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,479
do right what they've shown actually

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,479
harms the business and what are the

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,639
things we should be doing

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,080
so not going rogue right working

00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,759
together collaborating with your

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,520
teammates talking things out being

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,600
really communicative

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,560
and then slow and steady so you know the

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,720
expression move fast and break things

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,080
maybe we shouldn't break so much maybe

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,639
we should move a little slower

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,240
and have a better product and then we're

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,360
not iterating to

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,600
you know when we're iterating we're not

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,560
fixing like explosions we're just fixing

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,160
small things then again right

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,960
collaborative not competitive

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,639
so not trying to out code everyone else

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,080
or get things done fast or

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,440
spending late nights getting there early

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,680
to get it done first and then everyone's

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,120
trying to scramble to like

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,039
reconfigure what they were doing to

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,560
match what you just did

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,400
working together so everyone's on the

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,520
same page and you're producing something

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,639
together instead of

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,639
competing with each other

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,319
so i love this quote this is from that

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,080
study from the harvard business review

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,479
converting a superstar worker to an

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,319
average worker enhances performance to a

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,199
much greater extent than replacing an

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,520
average worker

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,880
with a superstar worker so if you had a

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,880
company that was 10

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,319
you know those rock star coders and you

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,520
had a company that was 10 just like yeah

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,599
they're fine

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,039
but they perform about average the

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,919
average company would actually do way

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,919
better in the long term

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,039
so part of the reason for this is

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,039
because

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,199
unless you're like working for yourself

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,160
and the only person working on your

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,680
product

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,360
no programmer is working by themselves

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,720
right no one is an island there are tons

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,199
of people

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,160
that contribute to making good software

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,000
good websites

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,520
right and some of these people are also

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,919
programmers

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,479
but then again you know it's all about

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,319
how we work together right we can't just

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,000
do everything ourselves and expect it to

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,440
magically work there are a lot of

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,039
different roles that contribute to the

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,639
work that we do

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,000
that are just as vital to what we're

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,199
doing because we can't do without them

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,759
or we definitely can't do it as well

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,759
without them

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,639
and so kind of looking at this idea one

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,840
of the things that i

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,240
i think it's really important to focus

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,759
on especially earlier in career but also

00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,919
you know a lot of this is really good

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,680
reminders for me you know now being like

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,120
five years in

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,800
that i should still be doing this right

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,080
because you never you're always

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,599
finding opportunities to learn from

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,720
people around you and so the idea is

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,400
like

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,080
we had all of those different roles that

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,319
are contributing to the work we're doing

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,840
and even though they're not necessarily

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,759
programmers there's so much that you can

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,080
learn from those roles

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,440
so how do you learn where you are

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,840
questions to think about like who writes

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,240
the clearest documentation

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,759
who leaves the best feedback who finds

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,080
the most bugs during testing

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,199
you know one of the i think one of the

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,320
best days that i had in

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,399
the first year that i was a programmer

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,120
was just sitting with our qa analyst for

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,719
a day

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,320
and watching how she went through the

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,640
software

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,320
and that really changed how i did my own

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,440
testing before pushing it up to qa but

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,040
then even just how i thought about the

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,760
code questions that i wasn't asking at

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,200
the beginning

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,880
that saved me a lot of time in the long

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,480
run

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,000
who can tell you more about who you're

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,279
building the software for right again

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,680
that's going to inform decisions that we

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:58,320
make as programmers

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,440
what about design you know why are we

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,959
doing things a certain way

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,240
that might allow you actually building

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,959
the software to see things that the

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,959
designer didn't

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,200
and so that's kind of another idea right

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,760
is

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,120
especially if you're on a new project or

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,800
you maybe switch to a different

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,240
framework or a different language or add

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,600
a new company

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,040
you know you might feel like all you're

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,480
doing is playing catch-up and you're not

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,680
actually contributing anything but there

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,519
are a lot of ways that we could

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,320
contribute to our companies apart from

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:29,040
just writing code

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,240
so for example doing some research so we

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,200
have a new junior developer at my

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,320
company

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,000
and we had her research a

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,920
free you know how what was the best way

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,200
that we were going to integrate with

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,200
government data for a project

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,959
and this wasn't just like giving the

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,720
junior something to do so that we could

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,640
ignore her for a few days

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,440
right this was it ended up being a

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,279
really great decision because not only

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,959
did she look at this with fresh eyes and

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,279
pick one that

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,480
like did you know had the energy to do

00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,519
all that research instead of just saying

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,839
oh well this looks good enough we'll

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,920
just use that right she really wanted to

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,920
find the best one and then when it came

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,360
to implementing it

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,279
you know our seniors could kind of look

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,600
at the specs in the documentation

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,800
and really didn't need a lot of time to

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,880
get familiar with how it worked and be

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,720
able to integrate it

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,000
because she had done the research she

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,360
also could just like

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,880
hit the ground running and start working

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,000
with it instead of taking a few days to

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,399
look at something someone else had

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,079
picked

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,880
so that she could understand how to work

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,640
with it and how to use it

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,160
pairing on code reviews so this is one

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,240
of my favorite things that we do

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,600
is if you're a senior bring a junior on

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,720
to look at your code and pair through it

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,920
together in real time

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,079
because they're going to catch things

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,360
that you hadn't thought of because again

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,720
you know

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,079
that confidence right which isn't a bad

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,200
thing but you sit there like oh well you

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,920
know i know what i'm doing this is a

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,200
really simple

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,279
story or you know what have you like

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,640
like it's fine i just need someone to

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,480
look it over and then

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,959
they ask questions that you wouldn't

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,959
have thought of

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,399
improving in test suite so this is a

00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,399
huge one

00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,519
that you know not everybody likes

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,600
writing tests

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,800
tests are kind of important and it's a

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,839
good way for juniors

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,040
not only to learn about the importance

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,959
of writing tests but also become more

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,279
familiar with the code base

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,959
which can help later on adding the

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,279
documentation is always a huge thing

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,560
right that isn't directly coding related

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,519
and then assisting with qa because you

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,360
can never have enough testing

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,920
uh who here has heard the expression we

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,800
are not our users

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,640
couple people okay so uh i'm not

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,800
actually a php developer

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,920
i don't know any php i come from a ruby

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,800
and rails background and this is

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,320
something that

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,079
this phrase really permeates the ruby

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,760
and rails community we are not our users

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,000
you hear it all the time

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,519
and it's basically the idea that the

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,040
people who are using the products and

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,600
the software we're building are probably

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,839
not very similar to us of course

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,959
depending on what you're building right

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,680
so quick exercise who here has a name

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,839
with like

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,120
a quote unquote non-standard character

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:59,440
like a hyphen apostrophe accent

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,680
not that many people okay you are all

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:07,360
very lucky

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:10,399
because it is very very frustrating

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,760
one of my friends gives a talk

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,200
about this idea that we're not like

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,839
focused just on this idea that we're not

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,600
our users

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,320
and she starts it by saying the internet

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,800
hates the irish

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,160
because her last name is o'neill and

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,360
this is the same thing that happens

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,240
right and this might seem like oh it's

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,399
not that big a deal

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,920
just take the hyphen out but this has

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,880
caused some serious issues and this is

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,560
where

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,120
these are just examples where they have

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,200
the form has actually told me

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,480
what is wrong there are so many times

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,000
where the form just says something went

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,800
wrong it didn't work and it doesn't tell

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,800
me what it was

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,399
and when you're trying to like buy

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,760
something online

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,440
and you find out it was a hyphen it

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,000
wasn't you put your credit card in wrong

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,800
what you know it just it drives me up a

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,600
wall

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,560
but i think the worst example was when i

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,920
had this happen

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,440
to buy a flight they actually let me

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,920
fill out the form correctly but then

00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,279
when they

00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,519
saved the information they stripped out

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,040
the hyphen

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,120
you never know if they were placing it

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,440
with a space

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,680
or with a period or maybe they just

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:11,040
squish the two names together

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:13,360
and this was for a an airline ticket

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,880
but then i went to check in and i have i

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,079
have pre-check which is like the skip

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,720
security

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,000
certification thing in the states and my

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,040
pre-check name has my hyphen

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,760
because that's my legal name but it

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,959
didn't match

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,959
and so i couldn't check in and the

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,279
airline wanted me to pay like a 200

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,040
name change fee because they said i'd

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,480
put my name in incorrect i had to call

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,040
someone it was just like

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,399
a hot mess and it was really annoying

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,800
when all they had to do

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,480
was just accept my hyphen like this is

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,079
not a hard thing

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,839
but i bet a lot of us don't think about

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,560
it because if we don't have that

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,240
character

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,079
we're not encountering these situations

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,000
right so again this idea

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,120
like the people all the people who wrote

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,880
all of this software

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,160
were writing it for themselves and not

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,600
for me

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,920
and it's very frustrating uh who here is

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,519
a woman

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,639
hi friends so uh

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,040
lots of examples that we could give

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,360
about this right software that is

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,120
built by people who are not thinking

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,800
about us as their users

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,560
and it means that we literally can't use

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,959
it um right like

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,880
people who don't who aren't white tons

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,720
of examples this is one from the states

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,079
which is particularly egregious which is

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,360
software you know facial recognition

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,680
software that

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,240
assumes that people of color are

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,240
criminals

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,079
and this is this is not just like oh

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,720
that's really embarrassing they should

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,800
change that

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,800
this is being used by police departments

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,800
in the united states

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,320
like this is very serious repercussions

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,880
for people's lives

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,000
and all that it would have taken was

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,720
thinking about who's going to be the

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,120
user

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,720
having a more diverse team doing user

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,480
testing with more diverse audiences

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,920
taking the time to think about the fact

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,199
that the people writing this software

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,560
were probably not the people who are

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,560
going to be most impacted by it

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,199
so that's really great and depressing

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,279
but what do we do about it

00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,440
right like it's it's not that simple to

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,800
just have a more diverse staff

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,720
so there are a lot of ways that we can

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,839
think about this in our work

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,800
in more individually centric

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,480
so diverse staff obviously is one more

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,199
diverse user testing just doing user

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,600
testing

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,360
so we at ten forward where i work we

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,040
build a lot of software for startups

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,399
and tons of them don't even have budgets

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,680
for doing user testing

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,839
so there's so much of this that's just

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:31,600
getting missed we wrote an app

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:33,440
for um coaches

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,279
like personal trainers and then and the

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,360
folks who utilize their services like an

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,959
exercise app basically you can track

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,440
all of your data do a ton of different

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,240
things and the colors that the client

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,440
had picked out

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,320
were not did not match accessible

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,120
standards for color blindness

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,519
this is an app that primarily had or or

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,639
more than half of the users were men

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:59,440
who are more prone to color blindness

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,800
and if we hadn't caught that there would

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,480
have been a ton of people who just

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,000
wouldn't have been able to use that app

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,720
because they were using the colors for a

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,320
lot of

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,000
of metrics and like display that wasn't

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,639
just aesthetic

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,160
and so things like that right and user

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,440
testing would have caught that

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,360
or definitely would have given us a

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,880
better chance of test of catching it um

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,079
cross-cultural checklist so this is one

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,560
that i love to use for

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,399
forms so you can download i mean there's

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,720
a lot of free resources so it's just a

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,959
list of names from a bunch of different

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,240
cultures and countries and then you can

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,800
just automate it to run through your

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,720
forms

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,920
and it'll hit if ever there's a name

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,800
with a certain character that you're not

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,480
accounting for

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,160
that messes up your system device labs

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,399
and virtual machines so

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,839
testing on you know we did a project

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,600
that was for

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,079
is a job matching site specifically for

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,959
people who are or have been incarcerated

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,440
and have a very different technical

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,279
needs

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,560
than the general population so a lot of

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,600
them are in

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,120
um sort of interim homes between

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,600
prison and being out in the real world

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,240
they tend to have much older computers

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,559
right with older versions of internet

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,199
explorer and things like that

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,559
a lot of those folks are you know we

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,000
know from statistics are much more

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,880
likely to use a mobile device to look

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
for a job

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,280
and so thinking about all of these and

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,640
luckily the client that we were working

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,160
with was very aware of this had done a

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,439
lot of work in this area so they came to

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,919
us and said these are the things that we

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:27,520
need to think about

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,799
but if we hadn't had that knowledge you

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,559
know that that sort of

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,160
that deep knowledge and that um those

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,600
expectations up front

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,840
this software that was meant to solve a

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,360
very real problem in the states

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,080
wouldn't have been usable by a lot of

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,640
the people who needed it the most

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,520
and so we were able to ensure that it

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,440
was usable

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,200
through our device lab which has you

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,840
know a bunch of older phones that we

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,960
could test

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,960
the website on make sure everything

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,400
worked properly and then using virtual

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,919
machines to use older versions of

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,919
internet explorer and windows and all

00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,360
that kind of thing

00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,280
and then accessibility testing so i

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,520
mentioned the color blindness earlier

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,799
um you know there are just a lot of

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,840
things that

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,039
the average programmer doesn't encounter

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,760
in their daily life and so you don't

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,520
think about it

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,120
but it doesn't you know i think in the

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,120
states it's like one out of ten people

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,360
has some kind of disability and so

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,559
that's a lot of people so just something

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,840
that we need to think about and that's a

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,120
lot easier to think about when you do it

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,880
from the beginning right rather than

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,480
going and trying to retrofit an existing

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,080
product

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,559
and then localization is the last one so

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,679
this is one one of my current clients

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,880
is is an international company and the

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,799
software we're building is used by

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,320
international users and so

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,600
it has the the most robust localization

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,120
of any project that i've worked on and

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,400
i've learned a ton about localization

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,400
through this

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,240
um but even with us those things that we

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,240
didn't think about like the way that

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,600
numbers can affect nouns in different

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,799
languages and you know it's

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,880
and it's all really interesting right

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,160
like this isn't meant to be oh here's a

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,600
whole nother list of things that you

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,320
have to do with all that free time you

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,679
have right it's

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,400
really interesting and it makes your

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,520
product better and

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,799
it makes the work that you're doing

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,000
better and make sure that people can use

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,640
it which really is the whole point of

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,080
what we're doing

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,880
right so we want people to be using the

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,880
code that we're writing

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,799
so kind of along those lines right like

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,080
it's very unlikely that you're going to

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,919
be a php expert

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,200
and a localization expert and really

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,200
good at accessibility

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,799
and you can recognize colorblind you

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,280
know color issues right that's just not

00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,120
a thing

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,360
you're never going to know everything

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,760
and that's totally fine

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,559
right uh do people do rubber ducking is

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,960
that a

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,400
is that a thing here couple head nods

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,919
okay i'll explain for folks who might

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,080
not be familiar

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:38,559
um it's the idea of just

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,520
saying out loud what you're gonna do and

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,280
actually everyone

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,799
in our office has a little rubber duck

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,120
on their desk that are like little

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:47,200
dinosaur rubber ducks

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,480
and you just talk to it right say out

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,160
loud what you're trying to do

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,200
you hear it out loud and suddenly there

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,320
are things that make sense that you

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,520
didn't think about because you're too in

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,240
your own brain

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,360
to see it when you just look at the code

00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,080
so we're going to talk about what are

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,200
some of the ways

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,200
that we can clear our heads

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,720
so reframing your feelings when i was

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,799
doing research for this talk this is one

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,640
that i think has really stuck with me

00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:12,320
that is so applicable in in

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,720
lots of areas of your life not just with

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,480
coding and there's a psychotherapist dr

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,720
laurie nadal and she said

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,840
that frustration isn't an emotion like

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,720
we think about frustration the same way

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,760
we think about anger

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:27,760
sadness or but it's not an emotion

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:30,240
it's a distorted cognitive response

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,360
to a presupposition that we are entitled

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,799
to get what we want

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,480
in a particular moment so the idea that

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:39,679
we are frustrated because we feel

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,320
entitled to know something

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,400
and when i think about it like that at

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,480
least for me that's been super helpful

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,080
because i would get frustrated a lot my

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,960
first year

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,799
and just kind of taking a step back and

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,200
thinking like there is no reason

00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,919
i should know how to do this i've never

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,640
been taught

00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,840
or i haven't done it in four years or

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,440
you know everything's different than the

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,880
last time i did it

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,159
or maybe you know i didn't get enough

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,200
sleep last night like there's no reason

00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,280
that this should be easy right

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,799
programming is not easy

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,200
if programming were easy we wouldn't

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:14,000
have like a huge shortage of programmers

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,600
uh it's really hard and like that's okay

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,039
so we're not entitled to know things so

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,080
when i feel frustrated i try and sit and

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,600
think okay

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,039
why am i feeling this way there's no

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,840
reason i should know this like give

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,600
yourself a break right

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,120
going for a walk so studies have shown

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,880
that even a short walk

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,159
inside a building you don't even have to

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,520
be outside

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:36,320
we are more creative immediately

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,440
after a short walk so that can be a good

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,360
way to just take a pause

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,840
take a walk literally be more creative

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,520
and come back to the problem

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,280
switching to paper so some studies have

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:49,120
shown that we

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,640
retain we have a deeper understanding

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,120
of things and we retain the knowledge

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,679
better when we physically write it down

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,240
rather than typing it onto a laptop so i

00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,919
have

00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,120
a ton of post-its all over my desk and

00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,600
if i can't figure something out i just

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,520
sit there

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,360
and i write down what am i trying to do

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,799
what have i already done

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,600
like what isn't working cleaning your

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,440
desk

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:13,440
right rearranging your desk so just

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,960
changing up your environment can cause

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,320
us to think in different ways and see

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,880
problems in different lights than we did

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,440
before

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,919
and also if you have a very messy desk

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,400
which

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:26,159
i do uh cleaning your desk is a great

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:29,280
way to get rid of all those distractions

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,880
and then helping someone else so this

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,799
again we found that when we when we

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,120
behave in altruistic ways

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,159
it improves our mood it makes us feel

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,159
more valued

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,360
and that allows us to kind of again come

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,000
back to problems with the first

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,360
perspective

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,760
feeling better about ourselves which

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,039
means we're gonna those those pathways

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,480
and our brains are gonna work better

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,919
because we're not just sitting there

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,720
feeling angry and frustrating getting

00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,720
down on ourselves

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,320
but sometimes you just can't figure it

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,280
out right you've tried all these things

00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,400
you took a walk

00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,240
you took a break your desk is spotless

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,640
you still can't get it and that's also

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,080
fine so

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,679
going back again to the idea that no

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,720
programmer is an island right like use

00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,679
those in-house

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,360
experts to get the help that you need

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,600
but there are

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,520
more and less productive ways to try and

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,400
get help

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,760
so how do we ask for help i tend forward

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,840
i get like i said we have interns

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,720
apprentices

00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:27,200
juniors and there are times where

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,200
i get really annoyed with them for the

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,360
way that they ask for help

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,799
because it's i feel like it's it's just

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,240
wasting both of our time and it's not in

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,440
a way that's actually enabling them to

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,799
learn which is the whole point of them

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,640
being at the company

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,320
and so one of the other senior

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,880
developers and i put together

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,320
a blog post that's like literally how to

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,880
ask for help so what are the steps you

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,960
take

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,120
so the first step what are you trying to

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,000
do so this is like if you're posting in

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,360
suck or you come

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,480
over and talk to us in person you know

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,400
first thing i want to know is what are

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,440
you trying to do

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,080
what is the problem you're trying to

00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,760
solve what have you already tried

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,360
right because it doesn't do me any good

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,039
to offer a solution just have you go now

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,760
i tried that now i tried that no i tried

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,080
that i'm like whoa

00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,960
what haven't you tried right so what are

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,480
you trying to do

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,720
what have you already tried that didn't

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,720
work

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,600
is there anything you found when you

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,480
were doing your research looking at

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,080
stack overflow

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,000
anything you saw that you think might

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,520
work but you're not sure

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,039
or you don't want to break your computer

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,320
or you don't want to ruin your test data

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,520
so you just

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,799
you're a little hesitant to give it a

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,240
try but you thought well maybe this

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,080
would work right tell me what you what

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,360
you think might work

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,840
and then how would you like me to help

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,039
you and i think this is the biggest one

00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,960
are you on deadline

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:37,440
and you just need me to tell you what to

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,360
do because i can do that

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,400
do you have a few days and so really you

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,679
just kind of want to be pointed in the

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,799
right direction

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,559
you know do you want to pair on it if so

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,960
put something in the calendar let's make

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,799
it happen

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,360
and this comes into this idea of not

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,960
wanting to just give people the answer

00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,240
unless again that's what they really

00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,480
need but finding out

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,919
how can we enable you to get to the

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,919
solution that you want in the way that

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,440
you want

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,799
and this has been really successful for

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,080
us and it's also great to have it

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,600
written down because then when someone

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,159
does just post in slack like this isn't

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,640
working

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,080
i can just post a link to the blog and

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,080
be like well try again

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,080
that's not how we do it and so this is

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,760
this is a collaborative way for

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,279
them to ask their questions and for me

00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,679
to provide help

00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,799
but in the way that they want which i

00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,960
think is really important because i've

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,240
definitely been

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,760
in the position of the more junior

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,080
person and i ask for help and someone

00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,440
just

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,120
gives me the answer and i'm like well i

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,880
don't now i still have more questions

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,799
right like why does that work

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,400
you know have you done that before like

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:41,520
how do i implement this

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,000
and so then it's just it's just not it's

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,000
not giving

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,440
me what i actually need so this

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,720
framework has been really successful for

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,320
us and then

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,720
that's a link where you can find it

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,720
online

00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,799
so i think the kind of flip side of that

00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,919
is like

00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,520
there will always be things that you

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,559
don't know right pretty much anywhere

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,400
you work there's gonna be someone who

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,520
knows more than you

00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,039
but that doesn't mean you aren't

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,400
learning new things all the time and i

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,919
think it's really easy for everyone to

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,360
forget that no matter what stage of your

00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:13,120
career you're in

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:15,039
and it's really helpful for

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,200
i find for not only your own you know

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,880
sense of personal worth and value but

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,679
also the value you bring to the company

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,520
to

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:25,840
find ways to specifically track and

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,840
celebrate the growth that you do have

00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,840
so keeping a journal right maybe it's

00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,440
something private just for you

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,120
maybe you just have a word doc where you

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,559
throw things in and when you're feeling

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,600
bad or you feel like you can't figure

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,200
something out you have those

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,320
those doubts creeping in just go check

00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,440
that out and see like oh yeah that's

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,720
right like i didn't know how to do this

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,840
and now i do or

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,960
all of the things that you've learned

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,640
because you always know more than you

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,520
did the day before and it's easy to lose

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,520
track of that over time

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,720
if you want to do something a little

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,880
more public right you can document

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,480
things on a company or personal blog

00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,080
so the ten forward blog we've found

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,400
through our analytics that actually are

00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,000
far and aware most popular blog posts

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,159
are very simple like

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,360
how to do a thing so i started writing

00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,360
some of these when i was a junior for

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,200
the same reason right i wanted to

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,480
remember that i was learning things even

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,320
if it didn't feel like it a lot of the

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,159
time so we have like how to create a

00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,919
copy to clipboard button

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:17,760
or how do you integrate an array column

00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,200
with simple form which is the gem that

00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,200
we use in rails

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,480
like very simple things but things that

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,919
a lot of people don't know how to do or

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,120
that you don't do often and you forget

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,120
you don't have to memorize

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,880
and so even though those were things

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,240
that i felt like everyone else knew how

00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,919
to do

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,200
it really wasn't the case because like i

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,200
said those are some of our most popular

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,279
blog posts

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,360
tutoring or mentoring is a great way to

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,640
do this as well

00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,919
a lot of times you don't realize how

00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,679
much you know until you're trying to

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,799
explain it to someone else

00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,799
and so that can be a really good

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,000
confidence boost to help you make make

00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,679
yourself aware of

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
how far you have come since you first

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,000
started

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,279
and then speaking of local meetup which

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,559
i know speaking can be really scary for

00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:00,000
some people

00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:01,679
uh but i recommend giving it a try right

00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,080
especially if you're at a local user

00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,799
group

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,240
tends to be friendlier it's smaller and

00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,399
again that's a great way to

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,440
to share what you know and feel like

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,480
you're contributing more to the

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,640
community if that's something that

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:16,080
you're interested in

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,679
um the journal one in particular going

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,840
back to that for a second

00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,760
is really helpful if you're asking for a

00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,279
raise or a promotion

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,880
because you can just kind of reformat

00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,320
that and print it out and be like here

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,240
are all of the things that i learned and

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,760
did in the last six months or year

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,919
and it's just an evidence journal of

00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,360
everything that you've done

00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,640
i actually literally did that for my

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,919
last phrase i just printed out that

00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,159
document and

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:40,559
put it in front of my boss and got a

00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,559
promotion

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:47,600
uh and then the last one is about

00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,520
fitting in and so for some folks this

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,120
isn't going to be perhaps

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,559
as relevant but maybe something to think

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,919
about with co-workers who might be

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:57,840
feeling some of this

00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:59,360
so when i started at my company i was

00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,559
the only

00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:04,480
woman developer on the team and the only

00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,880
other woman at the company was part-time

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:10,240
office manager

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,120
and you know i was coming from a

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,520
different career

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,720
so i already had a lot of imposter

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,520
syndrome and feelings like you know

00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,120
again

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,559
should i even be in tech is this even

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,320
what i want to do

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,480
and then being the only woman and then

00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,399
also working with a lot of men who were

00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,640
more of the the sort of stereotypical

00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:28,159
like like one of my co-workers and i'm

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,720
not this is not a bad thing but one of

00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,960
my co-workers literally does laundry

00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,840
dumps the laundry basket from the dryer

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,679
on the floor and just picks up a t-shirt

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,880
until they're all gone and then he

00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,640
washes them

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,799
which works really great for him right

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:46,159
but like

00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:47,440
that's not how i operate um but that was

00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,520
that was the environment that i found

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,880
myself in right and it's it's kind of

00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,640
natural that you want to feel like you

00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,399
fit in you want to blend in

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,240
and so i realized one day that i had

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:59,200
worn like eight t-shirts

00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,480
in a row to work i only owned like 10 at

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,799
the time

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,159
uh and it was just sort of this wake-up

00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,960
call like why am i doing this like this

00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,320
isn't

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,679
this isn't how i like to dress this

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,840
isn't kind of how i want to present

00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,840
myself

00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,760
this is actually my office style it's

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,640
really cold here

00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,080
so i didn't do it today but like yeah

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,279
and i didn't look like any of my

00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,279
co-workers

00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:23,039
but that was fine right i was at a

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,760
company that was really

00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:27,600
positive and inclusive and embraced that

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:31,679
and i think it's really important

00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:34,159
um you know we talked earlier about

00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,760
how we are not our users right but there

00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,120
are ways that each of us can rep

00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,360
you know represents a different part of

00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,520
our users so whether we you know

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,720
grew up in poverty or we've lived in a

00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,240
bunch of different countries or maybe

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,760
english isn't our first language or we

00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,039
have a hyphen in our name

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,200
right there are different things that we

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,960
can all bring to help make our software

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,039
better and more inclusive and easier for

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,520
our users

00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,080
and so our voices matter right even if

00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,919
you are

00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,840
the lowest on the totem pole and you've

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,399
just started the company and literally

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,440
everyone knows more than you you still

00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:07,360
have things to offer

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,640
so you should use that voice right here

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,159
are some of the ways that you can do

00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,039
that

00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,840
uh office culture or environment is

00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,600
there anything that you see

00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,799
obviously this list really depends on

00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,159
the privilege that you have your company

00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,640
and how comfortable you feel saying

00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:19,840
things

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,039
and how you think that's going to be

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,039
perceived but we're going to get to that

00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:24,240
in a minute

00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,080
is there anything about the development

00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,360
process that could change right it's

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,559
easy for companies especially if they

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,919
haven't had new people come on for a

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,200
while or if you've been on a project for

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,559
a long time to just do things the way

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,559
we've always been doing them

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,240
but that's not necessarily the best way

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,919
right

00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,279
documentation is a huge one when i

00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,600
joined my company we had like

00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,480
nothing written down because everyone

00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,080
had been there forever

00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,480
and everyone just knew everything and

00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,240
they didn't need to write it down

00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,840
and then i joined and had no idea what's

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,960
going on so

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,039
we started doing a lot more

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,440
documentation

00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,720
bonding activities so we did what we

00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,279
called um

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,960
are you familiar with minecraft the

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:03,200
video game okay some head so

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,799
it's like a multiplayer like you're all

00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,840
in the same universe and you basically

00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:09,679
build things it's very fun we would do

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,120
minecraft or noon so every friday we

00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,399
will go for lunch as a company and the

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,480
friday afternoons we would all just play

00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:17,279
minecraft in the same world

00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:20,240
and it was really fun but that

00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:22,320
presupposed that you liked video games

00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,679
right and that's not even a gender thing

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,880
that's just

00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,559
it's a very specific thing that we did

00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,000
every time we really didn't have any

00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,919
other kind of bonding activity it was

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,919
just playing minecraft

00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,440
and so one of the things that i talked

00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,159
about like why don't we do other things

00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,240
like kind of

00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,679
change it up a little bit and i think

00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,960
that's been really useful and you don't

00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,640
have to like every activity

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,799
you know we did a we did a craft night

00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,240
we have a craft bar where you can get

00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:48,640
craft beer and craft cocktails and you

00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,640
literally craft things

00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,919
and we had two people who went who just

00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,200
got beer and didn't make a craft because

00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,080
they don't like crafts and like cool

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,440
that's great

00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,120
you know maybe the next one you're gonna

00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,720
like more but really just changing it up

00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,360
so that you're not being homogenous in

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:04,480
the things that you do

00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,840
uh workspace arrangement you know is is

00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,279
there a way that you can change things

00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,720
up in the physical office that's more

00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,919
conducive for people or again

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,679
just changing it for the sake of

00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:15,200
changing it so that you kind of rethink

00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,200
those patterns and create new ones

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:22,320
and then company swag is a big one

00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,799
so i was saying how there were only two

00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,519
women in my company when i first started

00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:29,360
and we order new shirts basically every

00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,039
year like on our anniversary

00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,960
and the first year i was there it was

00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:35,279
time to order new shirts

00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,799
and so i was put in charge of finding

00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,399
like the women's

00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,919
shirts which was good for me because i

00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,440
have a lot of opinions

00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,880
and then we ordered like men's shirts so

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,880
basically fitted and then more straight

00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,799
cut

00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,320
we got two different colors we had blue

00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:51,120
and gray

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,799
we only ordered blue in the traditional

00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,120
men's cut

00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,159
so i didn't get a blue shirt because no

00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,600
one thought about it

00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,880
it's like oh well it's just celery and

00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,919
sophia you know like they don't eat

00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,559
they're good with the gray and it was

00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,399
like

00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:04,240
that was really hurtful actually because

00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:06,399
i i wanted a blue shirt and the fact

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,919
that i wasn't even asked just made me

00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:09,359
feel very othered and like i wasn't a

00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:12,000
part of the company right like i was an

00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,000
afterthought

00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:18,960
so just things to think about right like

00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,960
i spoke up and i said this isn't cool

00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,720
i don't like this like we should change

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,079
this and we did

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,679
and everybody felt really bad about it

00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,280
they just hadn't thought about it so

00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,720
kind of looking for these

00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,720
again if you feel comfortable and if you

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,879
feel like it's not going to

00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,919
adversely affect your career i really

00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,599
encourage you to think about all of

00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:37,280
these things and how could i

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,760
find ways to improve what we're doing in

00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,760
our company

00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:42,639
and the kind of a good way to do this is

00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,119
to make it easy to say yes so this is

00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:47,119
something i think about a lot too

00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,639
and it's related to that list of how to

00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,679
ask for help right if someone came up to

00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,720
me and said this is what i'm trying to

00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,079
do this is what i've tried

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,079
here's what i need from you here's when

00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,720
i need it

00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,599
there's really no way for me to not help

00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,200
them

00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,280
even if i wanted to even if i'm super

00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,000
busy like they have made it really hard

00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,240
for me

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,520
to find an excuse to not help not that i

00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,400
wouldn't

00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,760
so this has also served me really well

00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,440
at my company it's like okay

00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,720
here's what i want to do i've thought of

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,920
the things that could go wrong here's

00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,680
how we can address those

00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,040
here are the benefits you know like like

00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,040
kind of over the top

00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,480
but making it really hard for my boss to

00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,440
say no when there's something that i

00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,440
want that i care about

00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:27,040
that being said if you are still hearing

00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,839
no

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,280
all the time for things that matter to

00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:33,040
you

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,480
you can explore other options right

00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,119
maybe you don't need to stay where you

00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,200
are

00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,320
uh has anyone seen the tv show the good

00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,800
place

00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,960
a couple people okay so don't put up

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,760
with

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,320
because it's not worth it um i looked it

00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,640
up

00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,920
as of 2018 there were 600 an estimated

00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,640
600 000 tech

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,760
job vacancies just in the uk and they

00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,280
predicted that was going to go up to

00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,400
like 800 000 by

00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:00,560
2020 right now um

00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,240
you can work remotely a lot more

00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,200
companies are offering full-time remotes

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,920
so you don't even have to work for a

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,079
company that's

00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,839
based here i don't know i guess i'm

00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,280
speaking more from a state's perspective

00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,599
where that's really common i'm not

00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,720
sure how common that is here but i know

00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:14,079
that there are still companies that do

00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,800
that right or work for a state's company

00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:18,160
that lists you work remotely

00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,359
and then this idea that every company is

00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,640
a tech company so

00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,240
i'm sure there are lots of people even

00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,680
in this room who don't work at like

00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,800
strictly tech companies

00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:30,160
right one of the biggest tech employers

00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,640
in madison is actually

00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,079
an insurance company and they call

00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,800
themselves a tech company

00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,520
but their primary product is insurance

00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,599
that they sell

00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,640
through software that tech people write

00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,079
so

00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,280
don't feel like you have to be pigeon

00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:47,119
holed at just being at a tech company

00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,880
and then for folks who do come from

00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:52,320
underrepresented groups or have

00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:54,160
have other you know parts of their

00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,920
experience that that are different you

00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,040
know like use that

00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,240
right um you know like i'm a woman and

00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,280
there are a lot of companies that

00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:05,359
really want to hire women and so i will

00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,640
definitely use that to my advantage

00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:09,359
as long as it's a company that's

00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:12,240
actually doing it in good faith which is

00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:13,520
hard to tell sometimes so yeah basically

00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,880
if you're working at a company then

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,440
supporting you

00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,400
constantly says no or you just every day

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,640
feel like

00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,520
you're either not learning or you're not

00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,520
valued like

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,480
find another job because it's not worth

00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,480
it right the burnout talk this morning

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,720
it's just not worth it find something

00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,720
else

00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,800
uh so yeah just you know go out there

00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,839
and

00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:41,839
be yourself and do your best and you got

00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:41,839
