Title: PHP, The Last True Open Source Language - Chris Tankersley - PHP UK 2020
Publication date: 2020-03-11
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2020
Description: 
	Open Source is one of the most powerful human concepts that has come out of the computer revolution. It is one of the key drivers of innovation to this day, despite being a core concept of computing back in the days of when large room-sized computers roamed the land. PHP was born out of the concept and ideals of open source software and is one of the most prevalent languages still in regular use. Why is that? What is so important about Open Source Software, PHP, and how does it affect you as a developer? Let me tell you a storyâ€¦

my name's Chris Tankersley as they said

00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:12,469
I have spent most of my computing career

00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:15,709
thinking about and using open source

00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:17,720
technology in various ways since I got

00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:20,270
my very first personal computer that I

00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,970
could actually keep in my room I've been

00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:25,400
playing with lots of technologies and

00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:28,970
learning and thinking about how

00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:33,500
open-source affects all of us throughout

00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:34,610
all of our stages of development and one

00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,010
thing that I've been thinking about a

00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:40,210
lot lately as I delve more into the

00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:43,219
history of open source technology is

00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:45,170
what it actually means to be truly open

00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:47,149
source there's a term being thrown

00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:50,359
around that we live in a post open

00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:53,059
source world and that to me is kind of

00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:55,670
sad because open source is something

00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:56,899
that's very important to us but when I

00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:59,629
sit down and I think about a lot of

00:00:56,899 --> 00:01:02,059
things one thing that kind of popped

00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:03,589
into my mind mostly because I do a lot

00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:07,090
of PHP I've been doing it for about 15

00:01:03,589 --> 00:01:11,600
years is that PHP is probably the last

00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:12,800
true open source language and because of

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,670
that it makes it one of the greatest

00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,980
languages that we have so I've written a

00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:21,770
lot of different languages my day to day

00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:27,200
job I do PHP but I've done Python Ruby

00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:29,270
go see see and many of them have some

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,140
great open source offerings and ideals

00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:36,370
that started all the way back in the

00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,650
early days of modern computing history

00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:45,410
PHP for me though has been one of the

00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:47,380
few that actually ask you the kind of

00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:49,460
issues that we have with many of the

00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:52,430
commercial software offerings that are

00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:54,620
there it doesn't think that we need a

00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:57,230
benevolent dictator like some other

00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:58,880
languages and it's been a language that

00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:01,760
hasn't been shackled by any sort of

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:06,830
corporate sales policy or any need to

00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:08,929
drive sales in any way it has been able

00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:13,210
to stand the test of time

00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:16,040
despite ridicule from many other groups

00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,490
slow development during our times of

00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,630
like pee

00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:24,200
p52 pH p53 and that long slog to get to

00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:26,420
five four and the sometimes

00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:31,130
controversial internals group that we

00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:34,250
have but a lot of this exists precisely

00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:36,590
because we adhere to these ideas of open

00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:39,070
source and a lot of the things that came

00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:45,380
from the early benefactors of computing

00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:47,120
so what makes PHP so special when other

00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,590
languages still seem to pop up and

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,680
flourish and kind of catch that

00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:54,950
spotlight that despite us powering over

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:58,190
80% of the internet that we just kind of

00:02:54,950 --> 00:03:00,440
seem to lack well for honestly for me

00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:04,370
what makes me think that PHP is gonna be

00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:09,350
here long into the future and what keeps

00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:12,260
us together is this community it's

00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:17,050
events like this with PHP UK which bring

00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:19,820
together people from all across Britain

00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:24,100
but all of the other conferences as well

00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:27,500
in the u.s. in mainland Europe in Asia

00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:30,890
it's all of the attendees here that help

00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,720
keep this community alive because even

00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:35,690
if we didn't have companies all of you

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:40,550
are developing software and keeping the

00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:43,550
community alive we're all here because

00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:47,660
of one central tenant of computing that

00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:52,010
has always existed and that is that all

00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:54,860
information should be free this is one

00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:58,400
of the founding ideas of early computing

00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:00,230
and when I say early computing I'm

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,000
actually talking about going all the way

00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:04,940
back to the early days of modern

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,340
computing in the 1950s when giant

00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:10,790
machines roamed entire floors of

00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:17,330
buildings and weren't contained in my

00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:22,810
pocket this idea was actually born out

00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:25,640
of a model rail club at MIT in the 1950s

00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:27,590
one group was actually tasked with

00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,230
designing the signals and the power

00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:32,450
layout for the model rail the

00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:34,430
ray'll sets that they had and if any of

00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:36,020
you have played with model trains you

00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:40,160
know that that stuff can get very very

00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:42,290
complicated back around this time MIT

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,680
basically had one large machine it was

00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:49,010
an IBM 704 and it took up a huge section

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,050
of one of their buildings but this

00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,910
machine was heavily restricted you

00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:55,220
basically designed your code on a bunch

00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:58,370
of punch cards brought it to a set of

00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:00,440
operators they would offer it to the 704

00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:02,480
and that eventually they would respond

00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,570
back with whatever happened as a

00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:07,610
developer you prayed to the 704 hoping

00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,330
that your program would run because if

00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:10,190
it blew up

00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:11,960
you might not know for a couple of days

00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:14,330
by the time the operators got around to

00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:18,200
actually running your software and then

00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:21,620
you going to pick up the results this

00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:25,340
all changed at about 1958 when this

00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:28,090
machine was loaned to MIT this was the T

00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:30,680
x0 or as they called it the tick so

00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:35,210
which is one of the first transistor

00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:36,980
based computers now this thing amazed a

00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:43,040
lot of those early computer hackers at

00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:44,840
MIT it didn't use punch cards at all it

00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,530
actually used paper tape which was

00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:51,530
really quick at the time to put code

00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:54,970
into but the big thing was it wasn't

00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:59,540
cloistered away like that big giant 704

00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:01,670
if you wanted to play with this you just

00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,640
signed up for computer time and you

00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:07,400
could sit in front of this terminal and

00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:11,120
this terminal was amazing it had 64 K of

00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:13,850
RAM which we all know the joke about 64

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:19,130
K of RAM but in 1958 that was actually a

00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:23,780
ton of memory it had a screen which was

00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:25,760
unheard of for most machines but the big

00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:28,490
thing for the hackers was that you could

00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:31,160
actually type your program up feed it

00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,820
into the computer in real time and if it

00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,280
blew up

00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:38,060
you could debug it right then and there

00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:40,010
there was no waiting like with PHP they

00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,590
got the instant satisfaction of writing

00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:43,970
a piece of code and seeing it execute in

00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:46,100
real time

00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:50,030
they just didn't have an f5 button to

00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:54,020
keep refreshing the browser there was

00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:56,960
one big problem though and that was that

00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:59,960
there was absolutely no software for

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:03,110
this when it was loaned to MIT

00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:05,200
it was here's some hardware we don't

00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:08,840
know what to do with this

00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:12,110
so the hackers at MIT did what they

00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:16,310
always do and that was they created

00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:18,910
whatever they needed most importantly

00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:23,120
though they shared amongst themselves

00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:27,430
everything that they created why would

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:30,020
you hide away information or programs or

00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:34,280
pieces of work that you've done from

00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:37,280
your friends your work family there was

00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:40,130
no need to if you wrote something that

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,200
solved a problem it was just kept in a

00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:44,810
common drawer with all of the rest of

00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,850
the software like some sort of analog

00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:50,300
stack overflow that they would copy and

00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:52,760
paste from but anybody was free to

00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,230
implement that code no one was going to

00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:58,720
say hey I wrote that don't use that

00:07:54,230 --> 00:08:02,900
that's mine they were encouraged to

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:07,370
actually hack their software to make it

00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:10,400
better to make it faster stronger more

00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:13,300
optimal and for many people especially

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,760
coming into computers during this time

00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:19,520
this was a passion for them the thrill

00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,600
of seeing how quickly and how many few

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,660
instructions they could get their

00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:26,750
software to run in and out of this

00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:28,930
environment developers created their own

00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:31,640
set of ethics

00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:34,280
now these ethics were partially based on

00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:38,180
the fundamental ideas of that tech model

00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:40,849
rail club but in true fashion they

00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:43,400
hacked those ideals to make much more

00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:46,970
sense in its in this burgeoning age of

00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,950
computers so the first one was access to

00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,570
computers and anything that might teach

00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,200
you something about the way the world

00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:55,430
works

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,520
should be unlimited and total always

00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:59,870
yield to the hands-on imperative

00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,300
one thing that was nice about the tick

00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:04,580
zero was that you could actually open it

00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,410
up and get your hands in there and

00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,690
figure out how it worked because there

00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:09,830
were no manuals they literally had to

00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:13,970
get their hands in the guts of this

00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:16,400
machine see how it was wired but that

00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:18,620
was something they loved they wanted to

00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,980
be able to tinker with break figure out

00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:24,440
how to fix things all information should

00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:27,680
be free there's no point in hiding

00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,930
information it will always get out but

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,950
we all benefit from this shared amount

00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:36,160
of knowledge mistrust authority and

00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:39,260
promote dissent decentralization if

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,440
someone owns something they can take

00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:44,510
that away from you if something can be

00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:48,260
taken away from you do you actually own

00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:51,530
it hackers should be judged by their

00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:55,130
hacking not criteria such as degrees age

00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:56,660
race sex or position you should be

00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,220
judged by your ability to sit at the

00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,560
computer and just see what happens and

00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:03,110
no one should be stopped from sitting at

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:07,010
that computer just because of who they

00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:09,860
are you can create art and beauty on a

00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:12,140
computer because even back in these

00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:14,090
early days they realize that computers

00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:17,390
weren't just machines to dump out

00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:20,240
payroll reports you can do a lot of

00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:22,640
things with these and computers can

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:26,360
change your life for the better you can

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,790
do anything you want on a computer and

00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,770
this has been true even all the way back

00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:33,230
then do you think about the computing

00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:34,280
power we have now but you look back at

00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:38,030
some of the things that people have

00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:39,590
developed in since the 60s it's amazing

00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:44,960
what we can do with even just a small

00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:48,740
amount of computing power but ultimately

00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:51,590
all information should be free was and

00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:54,370
is one of the most important ideas that

00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:57,440
drove these early computer programmers

00:10:54,370 --> 00:11:00,590
no one person controlled any of the

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,500
software no one person guided how any of

00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:05,090
this should work each developer came up

00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,790
with solutions for the problems that

00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:09,740
they had and they laid bare those

00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,670
solutions so that anyone else could

00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:14,390
benefit from it

00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:17,330
as new problems propped up they shared

00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:20,840
them and that was all there was to it

00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:22,490
there was no term for this yet but that

00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:25,280
was just how it worked there was no

00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:29,720
other mindset about software and it

00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:31,100
worked this way for a long time but a

00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,910
lot of this started to change in the

00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:36,710
1970s as computers shrank and moved into

00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:38,930
the home and engineers and programmers

00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:43,490
wanted to tinker with this stuff outside

00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:46,030
of work they banded together in various

00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:48,080
clubs to share their common interests

00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:50,630
nowadays we would probably just call

00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:53,420
them user groups but it's the same idea

00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:56,270
we like computers let's get together and

00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:59,870
talk about them we like PHP let's get

00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:01,070
together and talk about them in 1975 you

00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,590
had probably one of the most famous

00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:05,780
computer clubs the homebrew the homebrew

00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:09,170
Computer Club startup in Menlo Park

00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:10,790
California this specific Computer Club

00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:14,930
has been called out for many various

00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:15,920
reasons but I think it goes above one of

00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:18,170
the reasons that's important is because

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,960
of things above and beyond people like

00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:24,650
Steve Wozniak Steve Jobs and the Apple

00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:26,470
one computer that they developed it was

00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:28,880
actually also one of the birthplaces

00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:31,700
birthplaces I can't say that word

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:37,040
birthplace of the antithesis of early

00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:41,660
ideas in computer software this is the

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:45,080
Altair 8800 all information should be

00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:47,590
free kind of reared its head when this

00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:52,010
was demoed at Ricky's Hyatt House in

00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:53,630
Palo Alto California the Micro

00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:54,860
instrumentation and telemetry systems

00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:56,690
corporation or MIT's

00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,010
was giving a demo on this brand-new

00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:02,060
machine that they were gonna try to sell

00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:06,530
the developer or to developers but it

00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:09,110
made people incredibly angry why well ed

00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:10,730
Roberts who is quote-unquote the father

00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:13,010
of personal computing as he tried to

00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:15,950
help shrink these things down had

00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:19,190
decided not to give any sort of compiler

00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:21,230
away with this up until this point if

00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:24,110
you bought a hardware kit you got

00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:25,579
software to help build other software

00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,720
because they don't come with anything

00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:31,010
you have to build everything from

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:33,560
scratch but what MIT's decided to do was

00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:36,290
charge a premium to be able to just even

00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:38,750
make things for this machine you would

00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:41,540
have to buy the software by the compiler

00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:43,370
you would have to buy extra memory to be

00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:48,019
able to use this thing it was about an

00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:49,490
extra $500 on top of this cost and MIT's

00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:51,560
had decided we're gonna sell this at

00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:54,730
cost and make up all the money and

00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,730
additional add-ons

00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:03,670
all of a sudden software was something

00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:07,250
that was thought of as having a cost and

00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:09,050
being able to be sold before this time

00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:11,510
you mostly sold your time like I will

00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:12,740
pay you to build this most people just

00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:17,120
built things I have an altruistic

00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:20,410
fashion at the demo at Ricky's Hyatt

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:25,850
house however the paper tape demo of

00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:27,860
Altair basic mysteriously disappeared at

00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:32,170
the next homebrew computing Club however

00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:40,130
it reappeared with 49 other siblings in

00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:44,480
a mysterious cardboard box as it turns

00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:47,660
out the developer of Altair basic Bill

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,130
Gates General Partner of a small

00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:51,380
fledgling software development firm

00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:53,660
called Microsoft com

00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:55,880
it did have a - event which I thought

00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:58,269
was hilarious they actually had a

00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,980
royalty agreement set up with altair and

00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:05,390
for each copy of basic sold they would

00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:08,449
get a kickback after the theft and the

00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:09,790
subsequent copying of that tape he sent

00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:13,449
a letter to the homebrew Computer Club

00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:19,190
it was simply titled an open letter to

00:15:13,449 --> 00:15:21,380
hobbyists in there he said to me the

00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:24,890
most critical thing in the hobby market

00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:29,300
right now is the lack of good software

00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:31,240
courses books and software itself almost

00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,790
a year ago Paul Allen and myself

00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,890
expecting the hobby market to expand

00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:37,850
hired vonti David often developed Altair

00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:40,460
basic

00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:44,120
the feedback that we have gotten so far

00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:48,380
has been has all been positive two

00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:54,290
surprising things are apparent one most

00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:55,990
users never bought basic and 2 the

00:15:54,290 --> 00:16:02,030
amount of royalties we have received

00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:04,430
amounts to less than $2 per hour so

00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:06,080
thanks to the homebrew Computer Club we

00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:09,020
not only have amazing things like the

00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:11,210
Apple one but we also have one of the

00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:14,840
first documented cases of software

00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:16,820
piracy but the general idea that

00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:19,700
software is something that could be held

00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:22,540
back that software is something that I

00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:25,040
own and I'm just letting you own and

00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:31,790
that I can sell this as a physical

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:33,230
commodity parallel to this the 1970s

00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:37,430
also saw the development of the UNIX

00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:40,340
operating system the history of this one

00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:42,650
is very very interesting because it

00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:47,440
started based out of this idea from an

00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:51,010
antitrust case in 1958 against AT&T

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:54,410
because back then we even thought

00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:56,870
monopolies were bad so the government

00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:59,420
said AT&T you're not allowed to get into

00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:02,180
the computing business there was an

00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:04,550
extra hammer throat on that though where

00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:06,800
the government said any technology that

00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:10,579
AT&T develops that's not telephone

00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:14,689
related they have to license out for

00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:17,480
free to anyone who asks sounds a little

00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:18,770
bit like the GPL but not quite because

00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,839
it gets if it goes downhill from here

00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:22,310
real quick

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:26,030
but UNIX was actually really alluring

00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:27,709
for many reasons it was portable up till

00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:30,110
this point operating systems were

00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:33,650
developed for this specific machine and

00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:35,870
only ran on that machine it handled

00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:38,600
multiple users which is something that

00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:40,640
very few operating systems did up to

00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,650
this point they used a weird time

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:47,480
sharing system to get a lot of things

00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:49,480
done UNIX started out as a standard for

00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,800
how to develop an operating system and

00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,050
through the C library action

00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:56,480
we became its own full implement

00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:58,970
standard and people wanted to port that

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,950
to different machines and they could

00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:04,670
just ask for it and then they would port

00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:06,350
it Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie and

00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:10,520
the others who developed it shared this

00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:14,270
software out to everyone but then also

00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:16,970
took code back in from people because

00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:20,270
again for most programmers sharing

00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:23,450
knowledge is a natural part of what they

00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:25,190
do so if they put out UNIX and someone

00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:29,720
had a patch they would just gladly

00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:32,020
accept it in a weird way this starts to

00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:35,780
provide our permissive license structure

00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:38,260
but it also ended up dragging copyright

00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:40,970
into a lot of the code that we develop

00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:44,570
because after a while the antitrust case

00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:47,060
dropped off and eventually 18th he was

00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:49,760
allowed to start selling their non

00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:55,490
telephone technology and there were a

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:58,310
lot of UNIX users you eventually had to

00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:00,800
buy a license for UNIX which is

00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:03,860
something people had never done and it

00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:06,710
wasn't cheap but around this time you

00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:09,140
also had various different distributions

00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:10,460
of UNIX start to pop up one of the most

00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:14,030
popular was the berkeley software

00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:16,880
distribution or bsd so they released

00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:20,240
their own variant in 1978 but there was

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:23,960
a problem it contained code from AT&T

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:27,530
and 18t was not happy about that so if

00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:30,680
you wanted to use you use BSD you had to

00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:34,340
pay license to AT&T there was a slight

00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:37,490
hiccup though AT&T had code that they

00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:40,310
didn't own copyrights to either so there

00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:43,070
was a wonderful long drawn-out legal

00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:46,250
battle over how to handle this and it

00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:47,410
ended with as long as BSD pulls out and

00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:52,370
reimplemented

00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:55,390
they can stay around so the 70s not only

00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:57,970
brought us the idea of ownership it

00:19:55,390 --> 00:20:01,850
unfortunately dragged the idea of

00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:04,690
copyrights and made it something that we

00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,690
have to consider

00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:12,400
in the A's in the early 80s we saw

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,550
probably the last piece of open source

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:18,130
software pop up and that was through the

00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:21,340
good new toolset and its subsequent GPL

00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:23,830
licensing its aim was to give computer

00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:25,480
users the freedom and control in their

00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:29,080
use of computers and computing devices

00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:33,550
in a world that was slowly being closed

00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:34,690
in on with commercial software it wanted

00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:36,910
to do this by allowing people to

00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:38,890
collaboratively develop and provide that

00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:41,560
software based on some very specific

00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:45,070
freedoms and freedoms that needed to be

00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:46,690
granted to the software itself and those

00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:49,750
were that users were free to run the

00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:52,450
software to share it to copy it to

00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:55,800
distribute it to study it and most

00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:58,690
importantly modify it

00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:01,980
the new software guarantees these

00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:04,270
freedoms and rights in a legal manner

00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:06,670
because of commercial software was going

00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:09,550
to do it we needed to make sure that we

00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:12,400
had legal protections as well and it

00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:17,710
created a definition of free in the term

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:19,510
of freedom separate from cost so thanks

00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:24,090
to the GPL we saw the rise of many

00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:26,710
popular open-source programs like Linux

00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:31,150
which was released by Linus Torvalds in

00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:33,820
1991 he started that project as a hobby

00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:36,070
with no intention of it becoming any

00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,300
sort of commercial success and he just

00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:40,510
wanted to play with something on his own

00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:42,940
hardware but he put that source code out

00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:44,440
there for other people to see to help -

00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:47,320
maybe patch to see what they wanted to

00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,970
do with it now granted it was originally

00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,560
distributed with a what we would now

00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:52,030
call a non open-source license that

00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,790
basically just said you can't

00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:56,920
commercially distribute it but in 92 he

00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:59,560
switched to the GPL after deciding that

00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:01,300
the kernel itself wasn't enough for

00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,790
people you have to distribute other

00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,830
things along with it so the tool set was

00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:10,000
a great complement to the kernel that he

00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:11,860
was building so he adopted that now

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,620
today the GPL is actually on its third

00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:16,960
revision thanks to many legal cases and

00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,720
things and this continues

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,570
to this day to be one of the main

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,700
licenses and drivers behind open

00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:26,230
software development and making sure

00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,299
that developers can have their

00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:30,700
information and their software continued

00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:34,750
to be free even in the growing face of

00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:37,000
commercialization and that brings us

00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:42,460
actually to 1994 but there's no fun

00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:45,070
pictures for 94 but actually in 1994

00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:48,909
Rasmus lair Dorf actually created PHP

00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:51,070
itself which and used it internally

00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:54,039
which was basically just a bunch of CGI

00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:56,380
bindings to the C libraries he called it

00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:58,299
personal homepage tools and he added

00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:00,010
functionality to it as he needed it it

00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:03,340
started off as a way for him to track

00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:04,630
visitors but of to his resume but then

00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:08,559
eventually it expanded to having

00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:12,070
database integration and then in 1995 he

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:14,830
released that source code for PHP much

00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:16,480
like Linus he released that software

00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:18,970
with the intention that others would be

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,429
able to provide bug fixes and improve

00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:23,980
the overall language he had written

00:23:21,429 --> 00:23:26,700
something for himself but he saw this

00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:29,230
could probably help other people

00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:31,539
October 95 saw another rewrite of the

00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:34,240
code so they renamed it personal home

00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:37,840
page construction get by 96 it was

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,640
renamed again to PHP Fi but by then the

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:43,059
language had been evolved and iterated

00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:45,070
over time in 97 we probably saw the

00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:47,159
biggest rewrite to the engine which was

00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:50,350
done by Andy Gutman's and XIV zorroski

00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:54,460
they rewrote the underlying processor

00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:57,070
giving us PHP 3.0 and as we all know

00:23:54,460 --> 00:24:00,460
since about that time PHP has exploded

00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:04,450
in not only its usage but its feature

00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:06,549
set like I said today we still power

00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:10,210
more than 80% of the Internet and that

00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:12,309
is an amazing fact but none of this

00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:15,330
would have been possible if Rasmus has

00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:18,700
just decided to keep it on his server

00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:22,299
he gave it out for others to work with

00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:26,380
and in fact fairly quickly handed it

00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:29,380
over to the community he did not keep

00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:30,370
control of it like some other languages

00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,110
this

00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:35,740
something for all of us to share and

00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:37,480
enjoy and work with but he has never

00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:42,160
taken the mantle of benevolent dictator

00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:43,540
for life when he put out PHP however we

00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,910
didn't have a term of open source

00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:49,150
software that didn't come around till

00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:51,270
about 1998 when the cathedral and the

00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:54,640
bazaar was released which described

00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:59,080
Linux and the GPL and this open source

00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:03,700
revolution which oddly enough has always

00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:05,860
been here it has been the mainstay and

00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:08,170
the the wall to try to keep back

00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:09,790
commercial software because open-source

00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:12,490
software was the original idea with

00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:15,130
computing we didn't start off selling

00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:19,240
software we started off sharing the

00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:20,860
software and now thanks to that a lot of

00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,640
that we have the open source initiative

00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:26,620
which is a wonderful repository of

00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,840
various legal open source licenses

00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:30,550
because of commercial software is going

00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,679
to have their own licenses and use them

00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:36,160
in courts we need to have good legal

00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:38,380
protection as well if you're ever

00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:40,809
looking for a way to help out with open

00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:44,370
source look at working with the open

00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:44,370
source initiative and supporting them

00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:50,470
but if we take the sum total of history

00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:53,920
computed of open source history anyway

00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:58,300
and we look back at it and we think

00:25:53,920 --> 00:26:01,179
about PHP I think it embodies all of

00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:04,170
those original ideas that started so

00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:06,280
long ago access to computers and

00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:08,470
anything which might teach you something

00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:11,200
about the way it works should be

00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:13,600
unlimited in total always yield to the

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:17,710
hands-on imperative we thrive

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:20,050
specifically because we share that we

00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:22,360
put code out there that we have things

00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:24,580
like Composer and packages and that we

00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:26,880
can take code and modify it for us and

00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:28,870
give it back out to people

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,950
mistrust Authority and promote

00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:36,880
decentralisation we don't have any one

00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:39,730
person that can tell us what to do we

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,650
have an internal group and despite some

00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:43,810
of their problems sometimes and some of

00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:46,870
the drama that they have

00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:49,450
it works we have a wonderful RFC system

00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:53,080
and a wonderful voting system but in the

00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:56,160
end each person has one vote rasmus

00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:58,840
despite being the creator has one vote

00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:01,510
he is a single voice in a sea of other

00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:03,130
voices of people that commit their time

00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:05,860
to making this language better and

00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:08,040
anybody can work their way into that

00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:09,880
group fairly easily

00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:12,580
hackers should be judged by their

00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:16,570
hacking not criteria such as degrees age

00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:18,910
race sex or position I am NOT going to

00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:20,920
pretend that we are perfect with this we

00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:25,710
sometimes don't do a very good job with

00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:28,720
it but as a community we try really hard

00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:30,180
many conference organizers try to make

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,920
sure that their conferences are

00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:37,030
inclusive and diverse for as many people

00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:41,440
as possible we all know how hard Tec can

00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:45,070
be and as long as we are trying maybe

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:48,400
one day we can get there you can create

00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:51,220
art and beauty on a computer we can make

00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:53,830
wonderful things with PHP all the way

00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:55,780
from something that dumps out payroll to

00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:57,900
powering the font of human knowledge

00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:59,800
through the something like Wikipedia

00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,260
which may not be the most beautiful

00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:04,800
thing in the world but it is literally

00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:06,790
the font of human knowledge and

00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:09,700
computers can change your life for the

00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:13,750
better I would not be on the stage today

00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:15,970
if it was not for PHP I've done a lot of

00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:18,310
other languages but the PHP community

00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:21,700
has been one that has always been open

00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:23,380
and receptive and helpful it is opened

00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:26,430
doors for me in ways that I would not

00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:30,010
have imagined when I graduated college I

00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:31,570
have met many wonderful people that I

00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:36,490
still consider friends to this day

00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:38,590
and without PHP I honestly would

00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:43,200
probably be slogging it away in some

00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:48,730
corporate job but ultimately all

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:51,310
information should be free so as we go

00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:54,910
out to this conference I want everybody

00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:56,950
to keep this in mind take everything

00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:57,610
that you learn the couple of days that

00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:01,000
you are here

00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:02,920
take it back to work take it back to

00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,440
your kids take it back to your local

00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:08,770
user group stream it on Twitch write a

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:11,260
blog post take what you learn and make

00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:12,730
sure that it gets shared if you're

00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:14,799
talking someone to the hallway it's

00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:15,880
talking to someone in the hallway and it

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,549
sounds like they're having the same

00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:21,070
problem you had share your solution with

00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:23,250
them you might learn something but you

00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:28,030
might also help someone else

00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:31,540
so go out today share everything that

00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:34,480
you learn take the slides but remember

00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:38,160
all information should be free and as

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:41,669
the community we thrive on that ideal

00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,669
