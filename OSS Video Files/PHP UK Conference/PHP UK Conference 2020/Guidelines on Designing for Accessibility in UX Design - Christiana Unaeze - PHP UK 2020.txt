Title: Guidelines on Designing for Accessibility in UX Design - Christiana Unaeze - PHP UK 2020
Publication date: 2020-03-11
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2020
Description: 
	One main goal of great UX design is designing products that ANYONE can use. If you are not thinking about accessibility, then youâ€™re not thinking about the full user experience. Accessibility makes it possible for people with disabilities to understand and navigate well designed products.

my name is Christiana amazing and I am a

00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:14,090
user experience designer and

00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:17,330
accessibility consultants as well I have

00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:20,509
worked with multiple small and large

00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:22,310
businesses and within the last several

00:00:20,509 --> 00:00:26,419
years I have been mainly focused on

00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:28,369
working with government agencies and I'm

00:00:26,419 --> 00:00:31,460
currently with a government agency a

00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:34,310
federal agency in the United States

00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:38,140
dealing with public health information

00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:42,380
and our business is the dissemination of

00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:45,560
public health information matters being

00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:48,040
that we're government agency we have to

00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:51,430
focus a lot on adherence to very strict

00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:54,590
accessibility guidelines and regulations

00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:56,420
so on a day to day basis I work on

00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:59,650
different things I work on making

00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:02,600
documents compliant I also work on

00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:05,449
making multimedia content compliant

00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,490
before they go on the website and I also

00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:10,700
work with a lot of developers as well I

00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:12,860
test websites that we have to make sure

00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:16,760
that they're compliant I also test apps

00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:20,140
as well so I do a lot of that on a day

00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:23,000
to day basis and then in addition I also

00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:24,890
present a tech conferences and also

00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,580
speak in multiple panels in the United

00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:31,340
States and also work on training watch

00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:34,460
workshops so accessible E as well so

00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:37,159
that is why I am here today speaking to

00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:43,659
you all that's just a little bit about

00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:46,100
me and what I do on a regular basis so I

00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:48,820
will today I will briefly talk about

00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:51,740
what exactly is web accessibility and

00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:54,229
why you should have web accessibility in

00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:57,530
mind when you create code and design

00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:59,900
websites and apps I will talk about some

00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:03,350
of the various impairments that people

00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:06,710
experience and how it hinders them from

00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:10,670
accessing web content the assistive

00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:13,340
technologies that they use as well then

00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:15,290
I will talk about a web content

00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,090
accessibility guidelines and how this

00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:19,569
apply

00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:21,430
to the cold and the the websites and the

00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:23,379
apps that you develop these are

00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:26,920
guidelines that you know help make sure

00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:30,459
that you make your websites and apps

00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,660
accessible to people and then with

00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:34,000
dealing with some of those guidelines

00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:37,180
I'll talk about some of the overall or

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,420
some of the more general guidelines that

00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:43,420
deal with color do a contrast images and

00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:47,099
audio and multimedia as well as forms

00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:49,120
that we fill out online and then I will

00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:51,160
talk about some of the tools and

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,340
resources that are available for testing

00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:57,610
and how you can use these on during your

00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:00,610
workflow to make sure that your apps and

00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:05,799
websites are compliant and accessible to

00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:10,000
everyone so in talking about the

00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:12,190
internet and web content initially when

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,220
the internet first started we can kind

00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:17,230
of describe it as computers you know

00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:20,829
that passed a bunch of information

00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:23,200
packets back and forth but as we know

00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:26,500
that is no longer the case the internet

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:30,220
now is everywhere it allows us to have

00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:33,370
access to people across the globe you

00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:36,790
know everywhere it allows us to watch

00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:39,250
shows and shop from home you know and

00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:41,170
the comfort of your sofa you know so it

00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,810
has changed the way that we access

00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:45,700
information the way we understand

00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:48,459
information and the way that we use

00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:52,180
information but how often do you stop

00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:54,760
and think about people who have

00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:57,400
disabilities and how they access the

00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,480
Internet you know because just like

00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,150
everyone else

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,970
they are uses - they are consumers of

00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:08,380
information they also need products and

00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:10,680
services you know so having a website or

00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:15,389
having apps that have poor accessibility

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:18,250
does pose a barrier to them so the very

00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:21,099
basic description of web accessibility

00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:24,070
can be described as the practice of

00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:27,430
building digital content websites and

00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:29,990
apps that can be accessed and used by

00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:32,539
everyone including people with visual

00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:41,479
auditory speech or cognitive

00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:44,060
disabilities right so when you think

00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:48,380
about accessibility don't think about it

00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:52,039
as a specific state accessibility really

00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:54,500
is a process as technology evolves over

00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:58,520
time there will always be new challenges

00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:01,130
that come up that you you know need to

00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,949
take into account when building websites

00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:07,190
or when building apps it really is about

00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:10,340
the human experience because humans that

00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:13,729
I then I dynamic in nature you know and

00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:17,500
so you want to build in cold for the

00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:20,270
diverse set of users who will use the

00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,610
apps that you create or the websites

00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:26,060
that you develop you know the main thing

00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:29,660
about internet or about the web is about

00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:32,330
our interaction it has to do it depends

00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:34,940
heavily on what we can see what we can

00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:36,710
hear you know what you can say and you

00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:40,430
know what we can search especially with

00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:43,010
mobile devices so having the assumption

00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:46,400
that all of your users have all of their

00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:49,099
senses enabled at all times when they

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,940
utilize these websites or utilize these

00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:55,400
apps is basically ignoring a huge range

00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:57,909
of users who are not able to do so you

00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,740
know so you want to think of having an

00:05:57,909 --> 00:06:05,000
inclusive mentality when you are

00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:09,470
creating your webs your websites in apps

00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,199
and also it leads to better designs for

00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:14,210
everyone you know and it leads to a

00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:19,810
wider range of people being able to

00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:19,810
access you know what you create as well

00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:29,630
so quick show of hands how many people

00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:33,289
have ever had their arms in a cast okay

00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:37,610
how many people have ever had to use the

00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:40,159
computer while holding a baby okay how

00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:43,780
many people have ever had to use their

00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:46,180
cell phones out in the Sun

00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:48,190
that's almost everyone you know how many

00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:51,280
people have ever tried to watch a video

00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:54,160
well in a crowded environment or on the

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:58,360
train oh and the bus that's just about

00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,070
everyone so when you think about it most

00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,110
people think of disabilities or

00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:05,280
impairments or limitations as a

00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:08,740
permanent thing but that is not the case

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:12,070
oftentimes most people experience some

00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:15,490
form of impairment or limitation at some

00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:19,570
point in their life be it situational or

00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:22,090
temporal you know so these are some of

00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:25,000
the things that you know you need to

00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:27,610
keep in mind when developing your cold

00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,950
is you know you're not just developing

00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:32,020
some or thinking about excessively as

00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:34,930
something that only applies to people

00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:38,919
with permanent disabilities you that

00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:41,260
extends to other people as well that

00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:43,900
extends to a wide range of people via

00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:47,830
temporal or situational and how they

00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:50,650
access this information so basically to

00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:53,770
sum that up and solving one problem for

00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:56,710
a small set of people a small group of

00:07:53,770 --> 00:08:02,800
people you extend it to a wider variety

00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:07,630
of people so the one statistic that I

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:11,080
came across online is that about one in

00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:14,140
five people and that is about 20% of the

00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,900
population experience some sort of

00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:19,720
impairment when it comes to accessing

00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:22,990
the web or you know access and apps and

00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:25,990
if you think about it that's about 20%

00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:29,229
of the population that's about 20% of

00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:32,469
your potential audience that you will be

00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:35,260
eliminating if your apps and your

00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:37,479
websites or web content is not

00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:40,300
accessible so that is definitely

00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:43,300
something to keep in mind but in making

00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:45,310
your your websites accessible to a small

00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:48,100
group of people you really do extend

00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:51,270
that solution to a wider audience which

00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,270
is very important

00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:59,000
and another reason why you should design

00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:01,550
and code for accessibility is that it is

00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,890
good business it's good business

00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:07,010
practices you know like I mentioned

00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:09,260
earlier about one in five people on a

00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:12,320
daily basis experienced some form of

00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:15,860
permanent situational temporary you know

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:19,370
disability so making your websites more

00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:22,160
accessible it will lead to better search

00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:25,010
engine optimization and search engine

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,710
results it also encourages better code

00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:30,650
and practices you know which is is key

00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:33,080
especially if working in a team or you

00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:35,660
know developing an enterprise type

00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:39,080
software you know it also leads to

00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:41,930
faster download times for for users as

00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:45,880
well now another thing that a lot of

00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:50,210
people don't realize is that it also

00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:52,340
leads to reduced legal risk now just

00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:54,980
quick show of hands again how many

00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:56,930
people develop software for or you

00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:00,640
potentially market to government

00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:03,980
agencies myself okay or higher

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:07,940
institutions or education of learning

00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:15,160
schools okay or hospitals the military

00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:18,020
or how many people depend on government

00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:20,780
contracts as a huge portion of their

00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:23,900
business you know that we have a couple

00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:27,380
in here so one thing you may not realize

00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:30,350
is that because of that you are tied to

00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:32,930
your even more legally bound to ensure

00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:35,660
that your website and your apps are

00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:38,660
accessible because you might lose that

00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:44,120
government contract if they're not you

00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:47,150
know in 2019 there was an average of

00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,280
about ten a thousand and fifty-nine web

00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:51,770
accessibility lawsuits just within the

00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,570
first six months in the United States a

00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:57,230
current case that we have going on right

00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:59,420
now is Harvard University has been sued

00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:01,700
and they're going through that process

00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:05,110
of potentially losing millions of

00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:07,130
dollars because their online learning

00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:09,320
environment is not as

00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:12,050
able to students with disabilities and

00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:14,360
there are several other major

00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:16,970
corporations that are experiencing

00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,860
lawsuits right now because of that so

00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:21,710
you know these are the things you also

00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:23,600
kind of need to keep in mind as to why

00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:26,960
designing for accessibility it's very

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,300
important now when talking about some of

00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,190
the impairments that people face you

00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,710
know there multiple categories they

00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:36,200
include vision for a fully impaired

00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:36,800
partially impaired people who are color

00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,160
blind

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,680
we have hearing impairments we like the

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,840
deaf or hard of hearing we have physical

00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,270
impairments people who maybe are unable

00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:49,880
to use the mouse and have to depend on a

00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:53,690
keyboard and then we have cognitive on

00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:55,850
learning impairments as well so that can

00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:58,070
include memory loss or inability to

00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:59,450
focus you know so these are some of the

00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:02,240
things that you kind of need to keep in

00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:04,280
mind when you know coding the the

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,970
different kinds of impairments in how

00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:10,790
people with these impairments access the

00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:13,250
web so a lot of times they have to

00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:16,280
depend on assistive technology and

00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:19,640
basically assistive technology is any

00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:21,770
device software or equipment that helps

00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:25,160
people work around their challenges and

00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:27,140
promotes greater independence by

00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:30,460
allowing them to perform tasks they were

00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:33,950
not able to do so before so think of

00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:35,930
people who are color blind might need to

00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:38,390
depend on color blind glasses that's an

00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:41,150
assistive technology the use of

00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:44,510
captioning and audio we have voice apps

00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:48,110
like Alexa and another big one is the

00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:50,360
use of screen readers and magnifiers as

00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:53,510
well to allow people who have low vision

00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:58,010
to be able to read content and see

00:12:53,510 --> 00:13:01,670
content online so in dealing with that

00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:04,520
and how that applies to content that you

00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:07,730
create online we have the web

00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:10,670
accessibility web content accessibility

00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:14,150
guidelines develop their international

00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:17,270
recognized standards developed by w3c

00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:18,579
and the main principles for these

00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:21,699
guidelines are there

00:13:18,579 --> 00:13:23,799
your content has to be perceivable that

00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:27,489
means that has to do with the census

00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:29,709
that people use to access information

00:13:27,489 --> 00:13:31,980
online and how they what kind of

00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:35,619
difficulties they have with their census

00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:38,290
the next one is that your site has to be

00:13:35,619 --> 00:13:40,860
operable so this has to do with like

00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:43,689
motor skills and how people access the

00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:46,449
what tools they used to access the web

00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:48,989
if it's a keyboard or mounts you know

00:13:46,449 --> 00:13:51,850
then information has to be

00:13:48,989 --> 00:13:55,540
understandable as well so using simple

00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:57,869
and clear language on your sites and

00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:01,029
making sure that there are clear

00:13:57,869 --> 00:14:03,639
instructions as well and then finally

00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:06,069
your website has to be robust so that

00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:08,489
means you have to code in such a way

00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:12,759
that assistive technologies and

00:14:08,489 --> 00:14:17,980
third-party apps are able to access the

00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:21,220
contents that is on your site and these

00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:24,509
they go in really great detail on the

00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:29,079
WCAG website and that is also you know

00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:30,699
available online one thing to keep in

00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:33,069
mind with these guidelines that there

00:14:30,699 --> 00:14:36,730
are three main levels of conformance and

00:14:33,069 --> 00:14:39,160
that is level a which is at the very

00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:42,459
basic level your website has to meet

00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:44,619
level a guy on level a conformance so if

00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:46,449
with let's take video for example if

00:14:44,619 --> 00:14:48,429
we're talking about video at the very

00:14:46,449 --> 00:14:52,179
basic level you should have captions

00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:55,629
with the videos and then the level

00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:58,119
double a is usually the level that most

00:14:55,629 --> 00:15:00,970
businesses tend to ascribe to because it

00:14:58,119 --> 00:15:03,249
will keep you from a lot of lawsuits if

00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:05,410
you don't meet these guidelines so going

00:15:03,249 --> 00:15:07,329
back with video in addition to having

00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:10,509
captions you should also have a

00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:12,939
transcript available and then at the

00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:15,669
highest level which is the triple a

00:15:12,939 --> 00:15:18,129
level which is usually the most complex

00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:20,949
of the level you sure you can have some

00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:22,689
even on like sign language so the main

00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:26,110
thing with the levels the main thing to

00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:28,660
keep in mind is that each one builds on

00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:31,509
the other so the triple a level will

00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:32,080
have all three so if your website means

00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:34,330
triple

00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,580
for video that means you have captions

00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:39,340
you have transcript and you have like a

00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:41,680
sign language as well but for the most

00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:44,290
part that tends to be very difficult for

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,680
some size to achieve so usually if you

00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:51,040
try to refuse try for level double a

00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:54,850
conformance then a lot of times that

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:57,100
would be good so now in talking about

00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:59,590
some of the guidelines that apply to the

00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:02,080
content online one of the big things is

00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:04,660
the use of color color is everywhere as

00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,730
you can see it's a major form of

00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:09,250
communication and it's used to convey

00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:12,640
information and it is used to portray

00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:16,180
emotion as well however despite the

00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:18,100
abundant use of color everywhere there

00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:20,890
are some people who cannot perceive the

00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:23,920
full spectrum of color you know there

00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:25,660
are people who have color deficiencies

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,270
one of the most common ones is the

00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:30,280
red-green color deficiency if you're

00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:32,530
looking at this for someone who has a

00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,630
red ring color deficiency you probably

00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:37,690
see a v on the image on the left and

00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:40,660
then if you look at the image on the

00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:43,000
right it kind of shows how someone who

00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:45,730
is not able to perceive the full

00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,340
spectrum of color might see images so

00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:51,760
can you now imagine if you have a

00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:54,340
website where color is the main use of

00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:56,860
portraying information how people have

00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:59,050
difficulty with that you know

00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:01,930
so the key thing we use in color is

00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:05,680
color should not be used as the primary

00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:08,170
means of conveying information so how

00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:11,770
this applies to websites if you have

00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:14,980
error messages navigation items headings

00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:17,530
you know different things and you should

00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:19,449
not just depend on color to convey when

00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:22,030
there is something wrong or convey that

00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:25,360
information you should also use in

00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:29,650
addition to color additional like text

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:32,490
descriptions as well if you see the

00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:36,070
image that appear if you remove color

00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:37,450
from from your site your user should

00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:39,190
still be able to perceive the

00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:41,290
information and should still be able to

00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:43,330
navigate their way around and knowing

00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:46,289
there's an error somewhere or

00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:50,289
know when something has to change so a

00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:53,260
key thing too is to test your websites

00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:56,529
in grayscale mode so when you eliminate

00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:58,899
the use of color is is that information

00:17:56,529 --> 00:18:02,260
still portrayed accurately you know

00:17:58,899 --> 00:18:05,940
that's something that you should pay

00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,940
attention to you as well

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,909
now another guideline is the use of

00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:15,490
contrast earlier I asked you know how

00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:18,220
many of us use our cell phones outside

00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:21,730
in the Sun you know and that is just

00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:23,409
about everyone so can you imagine if the

00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:26,169
content that you are viewing on your

00:18:23,409 --> 00:18:28,720
cell phone does not have accurate

00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:31,630
contrast it will be very hard to read

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:36,700
the text you know and see some of the

00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:40,330
different images and stuff that are on

00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:43,450
your device so the rule for this to meet

00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:45,750
double a compliance your normal text

00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:49,929
should have four point five to one ratio

00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:53,940
while large text should have three point

00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:56,830
one ratio now I included an image on the

00:18:53,940 --> 00:19:01,120
right over here this is one of the tools

00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:02,649
that I used to test excessively online

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,840
it's called a wave tool I'm gonna go

00:19:02,649 --> 00:19:07,000
over that in just a little bit and as

00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:09,039
you can see it shows you know the

00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,690
content online this is a site that is

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:16,090
not passing the contrast checkers so

00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:19,029
it's showing you at the bottom here you

00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:21,460
know where there is problems with the

00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:24,789
text it didn't pass you know contrast

00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:27,370
check so this is also something that you

00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:31,320
need to check as you are testing your

00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:31,320
websites and apps as well

00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:39,760
now another guideline is for images and

00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:43,299
non-text elements this is also a big one

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:47,350
use of images is a very quick way to

00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:49,750
convey information we use images

00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:52,779
everywhere for different apps Instagram

00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:55,330
and Twitter and Facebook and uh there's

00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:56,540
practically every website has a lot of

00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,340
images now so

00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:00,980
can you imagine if you're not able to

00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:04,900
see those images or for someone who has

00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:08,110
difficulty vision sight difficulty

00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:10,300
images also apply to graphical referee

00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:14,270
representations like graphs charts

00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:17,030
infographics animations and graphical

00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:19,940
buttons as well so the big thing with

00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:23,060
ensuring that your images are accessible

00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:25,580
especially to like assistive technology

00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:28,400
you want to use good alt text and alt

00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:30,740
text or alternative text basically is

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,640
describing what is in your image and

00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:36,470
this is usually read by screen readers

00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:38,390
so a lot of times when I work with

00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:40,070
developers sometimes they'll have images

00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:42,920
and you'll say you know image of dog

00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:47,120
okay that doesn't really describe you

00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:50,090
know how that works it within the

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:52,130
context of the page so instead of saying

00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:55,790
something like image of dog it can say

00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:58,250
image of a guide dog at crossroads with

00:20:55,790 --> 00:21:01,250
you know this intersection so it makes

00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:03,890
it easier for the person who has to

00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:06,770
listen to that visual description able

00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:10,310
to understand and have a better idea of

00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:13,880
what is in that image now another thing

00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:16,550
too with images is that it makes it

00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:19,280
easier when you use appropriate alt text

00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:22,250
it makes it easier for that image to be

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:25,370
found online by search engines so think

00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:27,350
if you are a company and you're selling

00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:29,810
products and you have images of your

00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:32,360
products if you have very good alt text

00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:34,940
in the description of the images then

00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:36,980
Google is able to pull up those images

00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:39,410
when people are searching for relevant

00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:42,620
things related to the kind of products

00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:45,160
that you know you have so when you do

00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:47,750
Google search and you click on images

00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,970
how do you think those images come up

00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:52,070
it's how those images are described in

00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:54,140
the backgrounds that allows Google to

00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:56,810
pull up the appropriate kinds of images

00:21:54,140 --> 00:22:01,340
related to various searches so that also

00:21:56,810 --> 00:22:03,410
becomes you know very important as well

00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:07,970
when it comes to images in non-text

00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:09,740
elements now when it comes to audio in

00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:12,130
multimedia

00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:16,100
these are usually intended for people

00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:19,820
who cannot access the audio but you can

00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:22,070
view the content or you know like a lot

00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:23,720
of us you can want to watch a video but

00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:25,640
you don't necessarily want the audio

00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,590
that goes with it at the time maybe

00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,480
you're in a loud environment and you

00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:32,809
just want to be able to read to follow

00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:35,299
along captions become very important for

00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:37,190
that and basically captions are texts of

00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:40,460
the spoken word that are in the video

00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:43,730
content they can either be closed or

00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:46,549
open captions and you should always give

00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:50,779
read of your users the ability to turn

00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:52,669
them off or on another thing is you

00:22:50,779 --> 00:22:56,299
should users should always have the

00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:58,970
ability to exit the content when they

00:22:56,299 --> 00:23:00,850
want now another thing that I noticed a

00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:04,240
lot of the times is you'd have

00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:06,620
animations or videos that start

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,080
automatically when a page loads up and

00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,279
then you're trying to figure out okay

00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,720
where is this audio coming from

00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:13,820
especially when you have multiple

00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,470
windows open and you're like where's

00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:18,919
this audio coming from I don't want that

00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:24,649
so you should try not or you should not

00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:27,110
have audio that starts immediately with

00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:30,950
video especially like embedded videos or

00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:34,309
animations now captions are required for

00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:36,860
all pre-recorded media to meet the level

00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:39,559
a standard or a level a level of

00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:42,559
compliance and they're also required for

00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:48,070
live synchronized media contents to meet

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:48,070
additional double-a requirements as well

00:23:53,060 --> 00:24:00,220
now another thing to also keep in mind

00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:04,040
with audio and video is you want to have

00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:06,260
text transcripts text transcripts are

00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:10,190
simply the text version of all spoken

00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:14,030
word and important video content in in

00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:16,820
any audio so think of podcasts you

00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:19,760
should always have the text transcripts

00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:21,590
available they are very very useful

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,080
people both hearing and visual

00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:26,300
disabilities as well as people with

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:36,610
cognitive disabilities who might find it

00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:40,180
hard to watch video content as well and

00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:42,680
then also text transcripts make it easy

00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:44,900
make for the content to be searchable

00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:49,840
again to be able to be searched and

00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:49,840
indexed by search engines online

00:24:52,540 --> 00:25:00,140
so going back to sorry going back to

00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:02,450
captions another thing I wanted to

00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:07,400
mention is that how many people here can

00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:11,230
remember flash just about everyone now

00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:14,000
does anybody know why flash is no longer

00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:17,860
being utilized or one of the reasons why

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,860
flash is no longer being utilized

00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:29,900
well that is true too well know one of

00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:34,040
the big reasons why flash is no longer

00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:36,710
available is because flash flash content

00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:40,940
is not accessible to assistive

00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:43,220
technologies so you know using flash on

00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:46,850
your website will get you sued in this

00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:49,910
day and age because yes because because

00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:52,940
assistive technologies cannot access

00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:57,590
that you know contents that is on on

00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:59,360
flash video or flash content it was very

00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:02,000
difficult so that was one of the reasons

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:05,140
why in addition to being that not on the

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,140
iOS devices

00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,310
that is one of the reasons why I needed

00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:17,820
to go back because I had to mention that

00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:21,270
that's true okay so one of the

00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:24,810
guidelines to it has to do with visible

00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:29,250
order in focus now this has a lot to do

00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:32,160
with how people operate your site so if

00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:34,590
someone is using a keyboard only to

00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:37,200
access the site they have to be able to

00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:40,530
see where they are you know and have

00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:43,050
visible focus as they interact with the

00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:45,660
site so making sure the way that

00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:47,430
assistive technologies access

00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:49,170
information online is similar to the way

00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:51,330
we read so it goes from left to right

00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:54,540
top to bottom so you want to make sure

00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:57,840
that that order is in place as someone

00:26:54,540 --> 00:27:00,390
is going through your site and using say

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,580
a keyboard only to access your site so

00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:04,230
one thing that you can do is you can

00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:06,900
test your site with just using the

00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:09,660
keyboard to navigate and tabbing through

00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:11,520
your navigation to see if you are able

00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:16,170
to get to where you need to go on the

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:18,690
site with just using the keyboard so I'm

00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:21,540
not you know in doing so elements have

00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:23,310
to have a visible focus and all the

00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:26,100
elements to let the user know where they

00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:34,910
are you know as they go through go

00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:38,190
through the site and then similar to

00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:41,640
that as well we have guidelines for

00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:44,400
forms make sure to use labels when you

00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:47,280
are using forms one of the biggest

00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:50,070
mistakes that I see often too is people

00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:53,280
or developers using placeholder text as

00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:55,310
labels that is something that is a big

00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,750
mistake you know you should because

00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:59,880
placeholder texts are usually great and

00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:05,160
low contrast so it makes it very

00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:07,530
difficult to read and also using labels

00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:09,270
allow make it easier for a user to

00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:11,340
understand what exactly they're supposed

00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:13,680
to be filling out you know in the forms

00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:17,040
and then also what error messages error

00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:19,980
messages should not be in color alone

00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:22,860
now capture you mentioned earlier is

00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:28,650
also highly controversial when it comes

00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:30,480
to accessibility so there are a lot of

00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:32,580
discussions about that as to whether

00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:37,560
they are useful but they do pose a huge

00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:39,840
accessibility problem so how just say

00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:48,780
that they do pose a huge accessibility

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:52,620
problem in using cash huh yeah so you

00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:54,240
can see you know there this talks about

00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:57,150
you know different options that can be

00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:03,600
used instead of captured to validate

00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:06,870
forms as well now I wanted to briefly

00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:10,350
mention the voluntary product

00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:12,960
accessibility template now this is when

00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:16,290
you are if you are developing software

00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:19,160
to sell to the government or you are a

00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:22,620
government agency looking to acquire

00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:24,030
software you want to make sure that what

00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:27,750
you are purchasing or what you're

00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:29,960
selling as well meets the accessibility

00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:33,450
guidelines so this can be part of a

00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:36,450
proposal or it can be a part of market

00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:40,430
research that you are doing - if you're

00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:43,110
trying to procure software to you know

00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:47,100
compare to see which ones have better

00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:49,410
excessively options so this is something

00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:53,160
that's a template that's available that

00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:55,050
you can use to you know present your

00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:58,410
software if you're trying to make a

00:29:55,050 --> 00:30:00,420
proposal or to analyze and see how the

00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:02,160
software that you're trying to get how

00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:04,080
it meets the various accessibility

00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,120
guidelines so it kind of goes both ways

00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,010
and then it's something that can be

00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:10,380
included in the contract that you can

00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:12,480
hold you know a developer or a software

00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:14,040
company you know it can hold them to it

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,110
because they can have to sign off and

00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:18,390
say yes our software meets these

00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:20,700
accessibility guidelines you know so if

00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:22,560
you know God forbid down the road day

00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:24,570
and get sued you can come back and say

00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,460
hey you sign this document saying that

00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:29,940
you know your software met these

00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:30,930
different rules so that's I wanted to

00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,400
mention that as well

00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:34,440
because that's something people might a

00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:42,960
lot of people are not really familiar

00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:44,340
with now in talking about the various

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,010
resources that are available for

00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:51,210
excessively testing I mentioned screen

00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:54,060
readers screen readers are a big portion

00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:55,890
a lot of people do use screen readers

00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:58,830
now some of the most popular ones are

00:30:55,890 --> 00:31:02,460
the jaws which is primarily for Windows

00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:05,610
then we have NVDA which are which is the

00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:08,160
non-visual desktop access and it's a

00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:10,440
windows-based software then we have

00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:14,910
Apple voiceover for Mac and iOS devices

00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:17,550
and then talkback for Android and some

00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:20,370
of these are available for free online

00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:24,750
that you can also use to test your sites

00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:27,570
to see you know how it how someone who

00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:29,790
is using a screen reader is able to

00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:38,280
perceive your the information that you

00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:40,770
have on the site then to do testing of

00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:43,410
the different elements that you have on

00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:45,690
your site there are multiple tools

00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:48,570
available this is just only a small list

00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:53,610
I will show briefly here we have the

00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:56,100
wave tool by a web aim and it's I think

00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:59,660
right now I think they have extensions

00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:02,550
and you basically enter the URL and

00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:04,530
click on the extension and it gives you

00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:06,660
an audit of the page that you're looking

00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:09,870
at it tells you what errors you have

00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:12,060
what levels the errors are and it's good

00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:15,300
to do like a quick accessibility audit

00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:18,330
on the site another tool that I like to

00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:22,500
use is sort site and it's both a desktop

00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:25,320
and a web app and it will allow you it

00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:27,720
shows I really like this tool because it

00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:31,020
does show arrow warnings and it will

00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:33,690
prioritize them based on the level of

00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:38,460
conformance that you have then the axe

00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:40,410
tool and the other tools are there's an

00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:43,200
extension and then the other the last

00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:44,700
two tools are more developer focused

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:49,350
because then you can create

00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:52,350
a dashboard and have customized settings

00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:54,840
that you can track you know on a regular

00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:58,140
basis to see if anything goes wrong with

00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:01,560
your site and where the accessibility

00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:05,280
guidelines are failing on the site so

00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:09,810
just a quick screenshot this is the wave

00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:12,780
to the wave extension that I use so if

00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:15,750
you look on here this is I think this is

00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:18,840
a CNN website this is a CNN homepage and

00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:22,050
in using a wave extension to view this

00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:26,310
this CNN homepage it shows how many

00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:29,190
errors that they are on the page it

00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:32,040
shows contrast errors and then you have

00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:35,340
these various tabs here you know at the

00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:37,400
very top and in clicking on each of

00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:40,140
these tabs it will show you a more

00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:44,400
detail it will show you in more detail

00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:45,960
so here is the details tab here I said

00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,820
you had eight errors these are the eight

00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:50,130
errors you're missing alternate text

00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:52,620
unlike this image and then if you click

00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:54,750
on that on the icon that is there it

00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:57,900
will take you to that specific item on

00:33:54,750 --> 00:34:00,840
the page so that you know where exactly

00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:03,510
the problem is they have missing form

00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:06,780
labels document language is missing

00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:10,220
that's another very simple easy to fix

00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:13,440
error that I see all the time a lot of

00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:16,650
websites often don't have language

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:19,530
specified and that is something that is

00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:23,970
very easy to fix but often times you

00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:26,610
know is omitted as well and so you have

00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:29,670
you know different empty links as well

00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:32,940
and then down here it shows you contrast

00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:35,010
errors and this is just a screenshot of

00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:37,800
the page and these are all different

00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:41,730
tabs that show you know the different

00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:45,510
elements that it is reading now you also

00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:49,320
want to think well how can I test mobile

00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:52,740
or you know mobile devices as well it

00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:54,810
does allow you to do that when you and

00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:56,670
use an alpha use Chrome a lot of the

00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:58,060
times and making sure that your site is

00:34:56,670 --> 00:35:00,640
responsive

00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:03,310
you can use the developer tools to view

00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:06,280
different screen sizes and then run that

00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:09,250
extension to see what errors are coming

00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:11,620
up you know for I typically do mobile

00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:18,150
testing on the desktop simply because it

00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:22,180
allows more more screen time to do that

00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:25,750
so and then the other two that I talked

00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:27,970
about is sort site I really like this

00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:30,220
tool as well because it gives you a

00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:32,320
little bit more detail it allows you to

00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:34,810
do more than just accessibility testing

00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,570
it gives you errors or shows you broken

00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:40,900
links it shows where you are compatible

00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:43,330
with in terms of your cold and then for

00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:45,790
the accessibility it gives a breakdown

00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:48,700
you know at the very top here it tells

00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:50,860
you what levels of errors that you have

00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:53,950
and then if you click on each one of

00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:58,450
those here it gives you the error that

00:35:53,950 --> 00:36:01,000
you have it tells you how this impacts

00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:02,740
users so what assistive technologies

00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,510
will be unable to access this

00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:09,550
information it tells you here what

00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:12,610
what rules you know how which specific

00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:14,890
rule that this applies to and then it

00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:17,290
gives you the page and then it gives you

00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:19,930
the code line so if you're working on a

00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:22,500
document that has you know thousands of

00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:26,110
lines of code it's easy to find exactly

00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:28,420
where you need to go and what you need

00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:34,390
to do to you know correct that that

00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:37,810
error so the main key takeaways are that

00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:40,690
if you are to make excessively a major

00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:43,120
part of your early workflow it will be

00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:45,370
easier to correct problems as you go

00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:47,440
along you know keep in mind the web

00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:50,500
content accessibility guidelines and its

00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,240
various principles your cold or your

00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:56,260
site should be perceivable operable

00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:59,160
understandable and robust as well and

00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:03,430
always you should strive to provide

00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:08,010
alternative ways for people for users to

00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:10,900
access your euro site in an apps as well

00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:11,770
always keep in mind to try to test with

00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,380
a keyboard

00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:16,450
and a screen reader and be consistent

00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:20,020
with your layout and your navigation and

00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:22,990
always always always use accessibility

00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:25,360
tools to audit your sites to see how you

00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:27,700
can improve and make them better

00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:32,200
you know for users all across the board

00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:34,710
and with that that is all I have for

00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,710
