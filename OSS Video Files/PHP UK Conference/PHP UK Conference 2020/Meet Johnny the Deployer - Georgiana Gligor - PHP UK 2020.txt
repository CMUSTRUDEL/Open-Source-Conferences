Title: Meet Johnny the Deployer - Georgiana Gligor - PHP UK 2020
Publication date: 2020-03-11
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2020
Description: 
	After working on AI-powered applications for a while now, we applied a lot of the lessons learned in building our own bot. Johnny, our DevOps chatbot, enables the release manager skip the confusing discussions with the tekkies and master the release process. It’s using NLP, so you don’t feel like talking to a bot, rather to a teammate. In this session you will learn about the building blocks of Johnny, dive into how each plays its part (pointing out reasoning behind our design decisions), and then we’ll get to do a live demo to see how all fits together. A bot framework is used to pass on information to “the brain”, which decodes your message using Natural Language Processing, and if it’s below a configurable certitude threshold comes and asks you for confirmation/clarification. Once the task to be executed is understood, the “brain” goes on to execute it and hand you over the results.

as as my introducer already said I'm

00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:12,320
Georgiana I'm originally from Romania

00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:15,199
but I lived in a lot of places including

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:19,100
London Amsterdam a lot of places in

00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:23,450
Romania I also have a six year old kid

00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:27,290
and I've been doing enterprise scale PHP

00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:30,860
for over 17 years lately I've been

00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:33,530
cheating and doing more Python but a few

00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:37,309
years ago I even organized Romania PHP

00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:39,170
which was an amazing adventure I would

00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:41,390
say I didn't even recognize my own

00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,039
wedding so I was faced with this thing

00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:46,390
let's organize a conference because why

00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:49,729
not so that was a very fun thing to do

00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:54,350
when I don't play with my kid I don't do

00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:59,719
PHP or Python or conferences I am trying

00:00:54,350 --> 00:01:02,449
to complete my PhD studies I'm trying to

00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:05,089
do systems engineering with machine

00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:07,820
learning quite an interesting topic

00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:10,940
let's grab a cup of tea later if you

00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:14,090
want to hear more one year and a half

00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:16,970
ago I moved in Brabant which is a

00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:19,760
historical province south of the

00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:23,150
Netherlands in Eindhoven it's a very

00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:26,210
very big technical hub and I'm working

00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:29,200
for SML which is one of the largest

00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:32,420
companies in the world so we have around

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:36,290
24,000 colleagues out of which 12,000

00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:39,980
are located in Eindhoven what we do is

00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:43,310
produce machines that Intel Samsung and

00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:45,830
any other manufacturer is using to make

00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,300
chips and memories for all the devices

00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:50,930
that you already have in your pocket or

00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:53,330
on the labs in some cases so what we do

00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,990
there is change the world one nano meter

00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:58,280
at a time

00:01:53,990 --> 00:02:01,520
that's our measurement unit but today

00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:05,350
I'm going to talk about the project that

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:08,300
is very dear to my heart which is

00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:13,810
solving this kind of problem so before

00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:16,470
CI CD completely automated was a thing

00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:19,200
our teams were

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:21,780
interacting on a human level with a lot

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,180
of questions yeah so the project manager

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,070
would ask hey what status are we good

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,200
for the next release and then the QA

00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:31,250
team would go to the developers and ask

00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:35,070
them do you have anything for me to test

00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:37,890
and then can you install it summary this

00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:41,780
kind of things in some companies and

00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:48,450
some groups this is still the case so

00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:52,320
that is why we many many many years and

00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:53,400
projects go in 2012 actually we decided

00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,450
to use Skype

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,940
we found this self about tool that would

00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,860
allow us you could hook it as a

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,690
participants in a group conversation and

00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,670
then you would have like a keyword that

00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:08,160
you put in the beginning after the

00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:10,350
exclamation mark and that one would be

00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,050
your pot and then these are the commands

00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:16,110
so in this case discover all

00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:20,220
environments would give us the stage in

00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:23,370
development QA and so on and then this

00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:27,000
is an emulation that we used for scaling

00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:30,270
you can see here the twelfth meaning how

00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,920
many elastic items you will have and you

00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:34,770
would say just provision it put the

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:39,540
latest stuff in there so this was

00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:41,700
actually very very easy to do from a

00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,380
chatbot point of view we just go as a

00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,180
project manager in Skype they start

00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:48,120
typing all these things which was not

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:51,390
very funny but it would take the burden

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:58,170
of answering this kind of questions to

00:03:51,390 --> 00:04:02,370
the QA or the PN Department and what I

00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:04,980
can also show you here is a versioning

00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,840
and installation done automatically so

00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:13,890
you trigger this one you would have a

00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:16,890
hook and just use it so if you go and

00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:19,830
search on github this still exists as a

00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:23,160
code base of course Microsoft acquired

00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:26,970
Skype and started to kill all the good

00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:29,940
features about it so for one year I

00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:32,910
think we didn't upgrade our skypes

00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:36,350
because we had this chat bot up and

00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:40,800
running so we were like one year behind

00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:44,580
so what I'm going to show you today a

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,790
small introduction chat bot I will

00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:50,160
showcase a little bit on the technical

00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:53,100
side of journey and if time allows we

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,160
will do a demo but I want to start with

00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,430
the show of hands who has written a chat

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:03,480
pod that is being used more or less

00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:07,110
introduction by others okay two people

00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:10,530
very nice so this is a very hooky

00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:14,340
audience right so I will insist more on

00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:25,080
the first part are you chat bot

00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:27,540
technical or no okay thank you so for

00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:31,560
those who haven't written any chat BOTS

00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:34,290
yet let's learn a little bit of history

00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:41,280
when did the first chat bot actually

00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:43,500
appear very long time ago 1966 it was

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,250
called Eliza and it appeared that the

00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,390
MIT artificial intelligence laboratory

00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:51,900
they were using regular expressions

00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:58,230
pattern matching to identify certain

00:05:51,900 --> 00:06:01,860
things and mimic understanding much much

00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:06,140
later 1993 this is also before I started

00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:08,610
programming so quite a while ago in IRC

00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:11,430
mmm you know

00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:14,130
slack is written on top of IRC but the

00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:17,640
original IRC right somebody wrote a

00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:21,330
couple of TCL scripts and C code modules

00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:24,120
and so on so complex thing to do user

00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:28,280
management channel management game

00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,280
starts and all sorts of things

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:38,950
in 2001 have you ever heard of smart

00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:41,380
child of course because this was a

00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:44,490
chatbot that was written for the AOL

00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:49,270
instant messaging platform which died

00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:53,500
successfully a long time ago but this is

00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:57,639
the actual chat pod that resembles what

00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:59,680
we are used to get today so if we want

00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,540
to look a little bit at what other

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,800
people are doing I suggest you start

00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:08,710
with both directories both lists or

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:12,669
there is a bot for that comm or chat

00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:15,370
bottle you go there and see categories

00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:17,440
of chat BOTS and some of them allow you

00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:21,250
to start interacting with them directly

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:26,490
so this is a good starting point to get

00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:26,490
the feeling of what people are building

00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:34,120
my current employer is an on-prem shop

00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:36,820
therefore I will always come up with

00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:40,270
this kind of slide today if you want to

00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:44,260
do a cloud-based chat bot you have quite

00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:48,210
good shopping list IBM offers Watson

00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:51,090
assistant Google has dialogue so

00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:55,169
Microsoft has the bot framework and

00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:58,510
engine that recognizes does anal you

00:07:55,169 --> 00:08:01,120
know which is called Louis Facebook

00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:03,669
acquired with dot AI so when I first

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,470
started doing this with dota I was a

00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:09,669
small independent thing not yet

00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:14,800
purchased by the big guys and Amazon has

00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:22,390
on in AWS something called legs have you

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:24,820
ever heard of it yeah so legs is quite

00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:27,070
connected with Alexa uses some of those

00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:32,610
things and also allows you voice

00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:32,610
interaction which is a bit more modern I

00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:38,979
must say I tried to change this

00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:42,370
particular demo using legs and it took

00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:45,100
more than two days so I consider the

00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:47,759
training part to be more complex

00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:52,360
then Watson that I will show you later

00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:53,470
if you are happily living on Prem with

00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,279
your codebases

00:08:53,470 --> 00:09:01,120
you have perhaps very secure data that

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:03,069
must not leave your friends you can

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,699
still install what's an assistant there

00:09:03,069 --> 00:09:10,389
which is very nice it's a pre trained

00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:12,610
model it's the best one that you can do

00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:16,860
as a starting point there is a company

00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:19,360
in Berlin startup called the rasa which

00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:22,750
was the first one to actually product

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,389
eyes an on-prem robot they have two

00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:28,420
components the chatting part and the

00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:32,170
natural language processing part again

00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:36,779
just like relaxed the NLP part you need

00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:36,779
to train it really well I did deliver

00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:43,750
1.44 company here in London Formula One

00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:47,019
team and the training part for Assad

00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:51,069
took quite a solid week I would say yeah

00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:53,439
so I'm just trying to show you that a

00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:55,720
lot of investment needs to be spent in

00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:57,130
this part so my recommendation is to

00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,370
start with one of the cloud-based

00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:03,910
solutions and then slowly move if you

00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:07,959
need to go on from what Russia does have

00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:10,569
is you can do a Watson chat bot and then

00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:13,000
you can export it and import it into

00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:15,880
rasa so you don't need to start from

00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,370
scratch so did these two guys work

00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:23,079
really well together

00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:25,810
snips is the on-prem for voice really

00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:29,259
check it out it works on your phone it

00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:33,329
works any way you need it offline snips

00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:37,839
is the tool for you if you want voice

00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:40,180
now because this kind of others didn't

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:43,509
really build chat BOTS I will start with

00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:47,529
a bird of you on what pieces you would

00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:49,779
need let's say you have a consumer that

00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:52,149
needs to interact with your chat bot

00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:53,800
they will need to go to a conversational

00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:55,930
interface to actually input their

00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,520
queries and get the output from it and

00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:01,300
you would need like more

00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:02,830
complicated part to do processing now in

00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,660
the conversational interface you would

00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:06,850
have the entry point let's say slack

00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:10,420
Twitter I will use it later in the

00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:13,990
example but there telegram and Facebook

00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:17,020
Messenger and whatnot and a bot

00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:19,710
framework why is the bot framework part

00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:23,770
important because it completely abstract

00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:27,040
the entry point from the actual

00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:29,350
communication and we will talk about it

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,680
a little bit later on the processing

00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:35,860
part whatever the prison input in the

00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,960
entry point we want to understand what

00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,280
they are doing which is the NLU part and

00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:43,630
then we want to tap into the knowledge

00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:48,610
base and actually do the job so if we go

00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:49,990
and start doing it in more depth on the

00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:53,170
left-hand side you could see the entry

00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:55,330
points like slag twitter etc etc that

00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:59,170
does nothing for you other than allows

00:11:55,330 --> 00:12:01,540
you to type in text and get messages

00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:04,360
back what monster is the part that

00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:06,700
abstract all these formats because of

00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,080
course the JSON that comes from slack is

00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,000
completely different from the one that

00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,290
comes from Twitter and completely

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,900
different from the one that comes from

00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:16,930
telegram which is why a bot framework is

00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:19,060
a solid choice at this point it

00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:24,310
completely cleans the entire pipeline

00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:27,250
for you one word of advice bot master

00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:30,310
which we use for journey exists the code

00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:33,970
is there but the project is not really

00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:38,200
maintained anymore if I would start

00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:40,540
right now I would go for the Microsoft

00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,670
solution and I'm not proud to say I

00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:45,040
would go for Microsoft solution but the

00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:49,300
bot framework seems to be the best one

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:51,100
because it's not only a good abstraction

00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:54,250
for these things but also interacts with

00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:58,320
Skype particularly so that that is one

00:12:54,250 --> 00:13:02,200
of the reasons Skype is not yet dead so

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:07,180
that would be my advice now for both

00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:09,490
master which again we still use this was

00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:11,420
the good part about it it allowed you to

00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:16,550
do Facebook messengers

00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:18,770
like any socket IO interaction which we

00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:22,900
specifically used for monitoring

00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:25,820
dashboards so we trigger queries in

00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:32,420
slack and we would update certain

00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:33,740
dashboards using socket IO again Twitter

00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:38,410
and telegram

00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:41,840
so go for go shopping for bot framework

00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:43,820
not bot master unfortunately so you can

00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:47,000
see how easy it is you create the bot

00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:49,820
and then you just add the various

00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,060
interactions that you need here which

00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:55,760
means that either of these channels no

00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:58,910
sense message you get them centralized

00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:03,140
in one place which is very very nice

00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:06,050
now if pop master is just a mediator of

00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:08,510
these channels we need some powerful

00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:11,750
thing which is the brains and the brains

00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:16,490
is the part that we do in PHP because we

00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:18,380
all love PHP but the brains the

00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:20,140
orchestration part doesn't really

00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,910
understand what the customer is saying

00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:26,570
which is why we need a natural language

00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:30,620
understanding platform to help us with

00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:34,730
that as I said before there are multiple

00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:39,740
alternatives that you can try the market

00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:45,620
leader is Watson and it's the one that

00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:49,310
uses the best pre-trained model does

00:14:45,620 --> 00:15:01,250
anybody know Watson where does the name

00:14:49,310 --> 00:15:04,460
come from a detective maybe no there was

00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:09,770
a guy called Thomas Watson which was the

00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:13,400
first CEO of IBM and they used his name

00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:16,850
to designate the entire umbrella of a

00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:19,610
technologist that they offer so this guy

00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:21,410
was a teacher and he just gave up and

00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:24,440
decided the annalistic course in

00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:28,400
accounting and do business

00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:35,030
he was a bookkeeper yeah so that Watson

00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:36,530
not detective and today if you want to

00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:38,330
search for documentation you have to

00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:40,610
search for Watson assistant

00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,840
but before it was called what's an

00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,330
assistant it was called Watson

00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:47,140
conversation so you might find very good

00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:50,030
tutorials under the previous name and

00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:51,740
when it was first launched of course it

00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:54,350
had a completely different name it was

00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:56,870
what's in dialogue so don't be confused

00:15:54,350 --> 00:16:00,470
it is the same product that evolved over

00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:03,320
time it does have a free tire you can

00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:05,960
really really play with it and even if

00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,940
you move into the paid tire it's not

00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:11,180
very expensive if I'm not mistaken the

00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:16,370
free tire allows you like 10,000 Andalou

00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:21,770
calls more than enough to put start and

00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:24,170
even use in your team the what an

00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:25,850
umbrella offers a lot more product for

00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:27,980
example if you want to do really really

00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:31,220
advanced and you you might want to move

00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:34,370
into studio and other things so that is

00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:40,340
why like another reason for which Watson

00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:41,900
is a good point to start so did you get

00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:47,870
bored with all the technical

00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:52,730
introduction part not really if we move

00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:54,740
into the more fun part Johnny let's try

00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:56,660
to break it down a little bit I don't

00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,370
really like sequence diagrams but I

00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:00,530
understand people resonate with them

00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:03,530
better than any other kind of diagram so

00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:07,010
here we go we have a teammate trying to

00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:12,589
communicate with our bot we have the pot

00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:16,819
master framework we have our PHP brains

00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:19,130
that connects everything together by

00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:23,930
communicating with Watson and in our

00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:25,579
case Jenkins for to build so I want to

00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:29,510
ask a question and receive an answer

00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:31,760
let's see what happens in between the

00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:34,550
bot master will try to figure out

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,780
meeting meaning by asking the brains

00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:41,250
that is

00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:44,820
I'm going to give us that answer now the

00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:47,910
NLU part is okay whatever question was

00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:51,800
placed do you have an idea what it means

00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:56,910
can you please break it down for me the

00:17:51,800 --> 00:18:00,330
language for Emmylou is intact and

00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:04,110
entities so what was the user intention

00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:06,620
and entities what are the topics that

00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:12,570
you can extract from that sentence that

00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:17,940
was asked in the chat once we are sure

00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:21,360
of the intent we can go and operate on

00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:26,490
our knowledge base in this case Jenkins

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:29,220
JIRA or anything else now the intent can

00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:32,150
be recognized by Watson in this case

00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:35,400
with a certain threshold of certitude

00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:39,390
what you can do is say okay if the

00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,260
certitude is less than 0.8 which is like

00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:43,680
80%

00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:46,260
it means the NLU engine is not really

00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:49,170
sure it figured out what you try to say

00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:51,090
and then you can instead of going and

00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:53,250
operating on the knowledge base you can

00:18:51,090 --> 00:19:00,720
come back and ask for clarifications and

00:18:53,250 --> 00:19:04,220
more things so going away from the

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:11,330
sequence diagram into like a normal flow

00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:13,200
you can see that we have the entry point

00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:16,800
the knowledge base

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:20,190
everything else is the bot yeah so the

00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:28,830
boat is multiple components just to make

00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:31,860
sure we can see it yeah so let's move to

00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:33,720
the first one entry point I have some

00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:35,940
slides explaining how to set up in slack

00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:40,200
because we are all technical we want to

00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:41,640
go to the something that works so in

00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,929
slack you have to make a slack

00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:48,929
application in the API online you have

00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:50,550
to choose the organisation and this one

00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:53,970
will give you authorized

00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:59,850
tokens and boat user or token these two

00:19:53,970 --> 00:20:04,170
are different yeah and then you will go

00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:06,120
and subscribe to events you can say okay

00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:09,630
I only want messages I want group

00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:12,570
messages I want some slack allows you to

00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:17,100
split it down and you have to provide

00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:22,710
the URL of your bot in this case I used

00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:24,630
an croc do you know what end work is you

00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:26,250
see people doing chat BOTS if you want

00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:28,080
to work locally because we are

00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:30,450
developers first first we want to test

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,000
it not just put it in the cloud and

00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:35,250
group allows you to create a tunnel from

00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,730
your machine to an endpoint on the

00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:42,690
internet and use that endpoint in your

00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:44,850
body in this case I have a prefix you

00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:47,610
can see here Johnny but this means I'm

00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:50,490
using the paid plan if you use the free

00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:53,400
tire which is perfectly fine you will

00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:56,760
have a number that gets changed every

00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:59,910
time you restart the tunnel you can keep

00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:03,540
the tunnel open for weeks like sometimes

00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:06,420
we do or you can move on to the paid

00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:08,010
version and use the same name and then

00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:10,650
you don't have to come here and update

00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:13,650
it too often I just wanted to show you

00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:18,870
that this is a manual process that you

00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:21,420
will need to do so the in slack in

00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:24,180
particular you can see mmm if somebody

00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:26,640
sends a personal message to the bot it

00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:30,210
can react or it can react into certain

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,250
group conversation or channels yeah pick

00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:34,560
your poison here in the beginning you'll

00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:36,840
probably talk to the bot all by yourself

00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:45,230
and with time you will move to the next

00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:49,290
level the next component is the mediator

00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:51,660
at the bot master part in here for the

00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:55,680
select setup yeah so we can do multiple

00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:58,290
setups I'm outlining the slack one you

00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:02,100
grab from the own eyes like the team

00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:03,840
identifier this is your journey but user

00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:07,349
identifier

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:09,929
this is the key identifier and both ID

00:22:07,349 --> 00:22:11,879
with the authorization token if you

00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:14,159
remember from the previous slide you had

00:22:11,879 --> 00:22:16,769
to access tokens one for the

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,840
organization and one for the bot so

00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:24,659
that's why you need both from from that

00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:26,999
screen now here it's the piece of

00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:29,549
JavaScript code that shows you how to

00:22:26,999 --> 00:22:32,969
set up slack it's not very complicated

00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:35,580
you just need to say okay which one of

00:22:32,969 --> 00:22:38,549
these is the webhook endpoint and I will

00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:42,960
go back because I want to show you it's

00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:46,859
this part so your end point your domain

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:49,320
of the bot and then slack and then this

00:22:46,859 --> 00:22:53,029
part is the web hook that you are

00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,029
calling yeah everything else is fixed

00:22:53,450 --> 00:23:04,889
and the credentials now in the mediator

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:07,589
you have incoming and outgoing so what

00:23:04,889 --> 00:23:11,879
you do here is the middleware in coming

00:23:07,589 --> 00:23:13,729
from slack I decide to make sure that

00:23:11,879 --> 00:23:19,139
the bot doesn't talk to itself

00:23:13,729 --> 00:23:21,149
yeah because if the slack bot user ID is

00:23:19,139 --> 00:23:23,339
exactly the same one coming from the

00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:26,070
event the bot will get into an infinite

00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:29,070
loop it will try to talk to itself not

00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:30,869
very funny and then we just prepare

00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:33,950
request options and we pass them forward

00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:37,830
to the brain very straightforward but

00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:39,929
you can see that you in here the slack

00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:42,570
income middleware can be completely

00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:46,950
separated or can be the same as the

00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:49,649
Twitter one or any other platform so

00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:52,440
this is like the part where you decide

00:23:49,649 --> 00:23:55,649
how your boat is going to react react to

00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:57,499
all channels the same or not and then

00:23:55,649 --> 00:24:01,139
you have exactly the same for outgoing

00:23:57,499 --> 00:24:04,619
yeah so you can very finely grained

00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:12,229
configure how your body hey've on every

00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:12,229
single entry point okay PHP time

00:24:14,309 --> 00:24:21,820
this is a very very skinny our symphony

00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:26,040
application because I love symphony more

00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:30,070
than laravel any laravel lovers here

00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:30,280
yeah and it's Symphony lovers here thank

00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:33,790
you

00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:38,010
more enterprise people so my demo is

00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:40,960
quite good you can see it's very easy

00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:43,150
you know we don't have like a full-sized

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,330
application of conversational controller

00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:47,679
and then these entities are

00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:51,030
automatically mapped with the GMS

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:56,590
serializer from the json into an object

00:24:51,030 --> 00:25:00,880
so put them in this small way so let's

00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:05,320
see how how we do it we just received

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:07,840
that text thing from javascript from the

00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:11,770
bottommost part we deserialize it

00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:14,470
directly into this entity we know it was

00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:17,890
a json incoming so now we can link into

00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:18,640
the api request and see no message no

00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:21,580
response

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,700
okay so defensive programming first now

00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:27,220
we can focus on the interesting part I

00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:29,080
made a small service called ask which is

00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,770
the part where okay now I want to go to

00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:34,120
the NLU

00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:37,840
watson in this case just ask this

00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:39,520
question for demo purposes we also look

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:45,700
it because we want to have a look at it

00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:48,340
and then we send it back now if you can

00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:51,520
see here in the response that we got

00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:52,090
here from Watson we don't have any

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,240
intent

00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:57,549
it means the NLU engine didn't figure

00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:02,140
out any kind of meaning in the text that

00:25:57,549 --> 00:26:04,030
was being said if we do have intent we

00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:06,270
can iterate over them please

00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:10,510
introduction to not use switch in case

00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:13,380
use normal injection yes this is not

00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:17,350
something that you want to take home for

00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:20,590
usage in production because you imply

00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:22,530
employer will not like it but it's much

00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:26,770
easier to fit it on the slide like this

00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:27,309
so if the first intent is ok tell me how

00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:30,389
many to

00:26:27,309 --> 00:26:32,980
did you have read before do this thing

00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:36,639
if you want to me to prepare will this

00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:39,490
candidate and deployed pick these two

00:26:36,639 --> 00:26:42,999
items that were identified by the Unreal

00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:45,249
Engine and send them as parameters to

00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:48,129
the corresponding job if you want to ask

00:26:45,249 --> 00:26:52,240
historical questions what happened when

00:26:48,129 --> 00:26:56,350
was something last performed like an

00:26:52,240 --> 00:27:02,740
update or something else then we're

00:26:56,350 --> 00:27:05,649
going to do this third action how do you

00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:08,470
interact with Watson even easier we have

00:27:05,649 --> 00:27:11,440
a ready-made request we place a string

00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:13,409
in the constructor it will make all the

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,840
rest for us with all the environment

00:27:13,409 --> 00:27:19,749
variables that are required we civilize

00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:23,679
the desert Jason and give it to the

00:27:19,749 --> 00:27:27,159
Watson client to post it super easy API

00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:30,399
is one on one and then we get back a

00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:36,970
body that we respectively do civilizing

00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:39,629
the response entity okay so the KGB part

00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:42,730
was just gluing things together and then

00:27:39,629 --> 00:27:47,100
that's where you can see yeah do I trust

00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:52,990
this from the NLU and so on let's see

00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:55,149
how do we do the analysis as I said this

00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:58,210
thing changed like a million times

00:27:55,149 --> 00:28:01,029
in the naming in you eyes you will find

00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:03,879
all sorts of stuff nowadays it's called

00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:06,340
assistant and an assistant can have one

00:28:03,879 --> 00:28:08,499
or multiple skills so this is your

00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:13,809
actual and natural language

00:28:08,499 --> 00:28:16,499
understanding part you can see I am

00:28:13,809 --> 00:28:20,289
actually keeping this screenshot from a

00:28:16,499 --> 00:28:23,440
while back because this was a an example

00:28:20,289 --> 00:28:26,619
for a customer care chat bot and you can

00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:29,769
see how few examples are fed here yeah

00:28:26,619 --> 00:28:32,139
so the examples that are given are just

00:28:29,769 --> 00:28:34,929
free text things and then you say okay I

00:28:32,139 --> 00:28:38,559
want I don't know five business hours so

00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:40,990
they give 38 possible ways in which

00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:44,440
person can ask about business hour

00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:46,870
or checkbook but if they want to say

00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:49,270
goodbye they only give like six

00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:52,210
alternatives if you want to make an

00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:54,370
appointment they need more than 19 yeah

00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:58,000
so this is the part where you train your

00:28:54,370 --> 00:29:00,820
bots in Watson you the numbers are quite

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,770
small in the other ones who don't have

00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:05,620
such a good pre-trained model you will

00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:07,390
need a lot more so this is why I'm

00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:11,950
keeping this slide because these numbers

00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:14,470
if you think maintaining 47 examples is

00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:16,330
easy this one I can guarantee you that

00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:18,640
in the other platforms you will need to

00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:23,760
provide more alternatives so that the

00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:26,950
training is improving the new interface

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:29,230
yeah so that one the old one I keep it

00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:35,140
for that kind of explanation you can see

00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:40,900
with five six examples we can do this

00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:44,100
kind of understanding so what is

00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:49,030
involved here intent are the things that

00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:50,950
as I said before do we recognize what

00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:53,380
the person is asking from us and it's

00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:55,030
one of these things or you can have

00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:59,050
multiple like in the previous example

00:29:55,030 --> 00:30:05,080
this is what our bot knows what to do

00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:08,590
yeah and then entities which are of two

00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:11,350
types user-defined called my entities

00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:15,370
and the system once the system ones can

00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:18,880
detect time ranges locations all sorts

00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:23,559
of things the system entity is used by

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:27,790
the Facebook with a I are better yeah so

00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:30,460
that that's where you get confused is

00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:33,280
there are fewer in Watson so it doesn't

00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:36,790
understand like everything but it allows

00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:38,920
you to create better user-defined ones

00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:41,830
so you can see here that in the

00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:43,530
environment I have like my keywords this

00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:47,920
is what I'm going to pass as

00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:50,710
parametrized items to Jenkins by the way

00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:55,090
we upgraded to circle CI but don't tell

00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:56,950
anyone so you can see here

00:30:55,090 --> 00:31:01,810
yeah I'm when I'm saying therefore

00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:04,260
development is the same thing if I want

00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:06,640
to use production it will be like

00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:10,630
production live whatever you want to say

00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:13,000
this is how it recognizes the entities

00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:16,030
the intents are comprised of various

00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:25,150
entities and combinations of those into

00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:28,960
a sentence so you have code that you can

00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:32,710
play with you have a video tutorial how

00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:36,460
to set up JIRA and online a demo video

00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:39,370
but I will do something better if time

00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:42,730
allows we have some more time I will

00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:46,600
show you a couple of recorded videos

00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:48,660
just to show you how all these

00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:51,490
complicated things work together

00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:53,170
remember it's not complicated a person

00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:54,700
interacts with the conversational

00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:56,560
interface we already know the

00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:59,260
conversational interfaces to component

00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:01,540
and we do a processing part which has

00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:13,390
two different components our brains and

00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:16,930
the another engine now okay let's let's

00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:20,580
show you the first one so the first

00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:20,580
attempt is ready for QA

00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:34,810
the text that's been written here is

00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:34,810
saying do you have tickets ready for QA

00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:42,980
and you see here the doc wised version

00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:45,770
of JIRA that I prepared so you can see

00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:50,390
in this column there is nothing so now I

00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:52,790
just move the ticket I'm done and now

00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:55,730
I'm going to ask different with

00:32:52,790 --> 00:33:04,280
different wording are there issues ready

00:32:55,730 --> 00:33:07,220
for testing okay it found one I can even

00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:11,290
click it if I craft my response

00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:11,290
correctly so that it provides the link

00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:33,770
I'm just going to skip now and move both

00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:36,880
of them what the kids are this was me

00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:40,460
learning how to do proper demo are ready

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:43,190
for testing probably yeah but you can

00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:46,250
see tickets and Gira's and all sorts of

00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:48,770
slang that we use this was not provided

00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:53,660
with synonyms we provided it in the five

00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:59,200
or six examples of the center's and of

00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:59,200
course it found both of them okay

00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:10,119
the next example is this one more

00:34:05,769 --> 00:34:12,909
complicated and I also want to show you

00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:14,830
that in the Watson conversation you can

00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:19,869
try it out here so this is where you

00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:21,820
train it and then so you don't go

00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:25,119
through the whole component set up if

00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:27,730
you don't need to ok I'm going to do

00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:30,389
something really hacky I found the tool

00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:32,830
that completed the list slack history

00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:37,320
please don't delete your company's like

00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:41,169
history like this but it can be done

00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:46,359
okay and I'm just going to copy paste

00:34:41,169 --> 00:34:49,659
some text this is not in the right place

00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:52,450
I need you to build an RC for the CMS

00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:56,230
and deploy it okay and you see here I

00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:58,750
need you to deploy to integration I did

00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:00,609
not specify I need you to build an RC

00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:04,119
because that one is in another training

00:35:00,609 --> 00:35:06,310
sentence so what I'm typing here is not

00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:08,530
the same thing that I did for training

00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:10,839
is are completely different things and

00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:13,089
you see it started to build and it

00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:17,580
passed on two variables an environment

00:35:13,089 --> 00:35:23,349
and the component that were identified

00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:25,300
from from the new engine build a new

00:35:23,349 --> 00:35:32,950
release candidate of the frontline and

00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:37,359
deployed integration a refresh shows we

00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:39,400
have the next build with two parameters

00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:44,760
the environment is integration and the

00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:44,760
component is front-end this one

00:35:53,500 --> 00:36:01,000
and another one and in this particular

00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:03,520
Jenkins instance which is for demo

00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,520
purpose I have a random thing that fails

00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:11,319
the build was in wild yeah because in

00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:13,329
real life not everything is green so you

00:36:11,319 --> 00:36:15,720
see this one is marked as a failure or

00:36:13,329 --> 00:36:15,720
something

00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:29,340
prepare an API build and deploy to

00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:29,340
production again to actions

00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:47,350
okay so now that we created history in

00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:52,840
Jenkins who here you still use these

00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:59,320
jackets yes yes how easy it is to find

00:36:52,840 --> 00:37:01,840
anything there in the history not very

00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:03,340
right so this is one of the reasons for

00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,680
which I made this thing

00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:06,730
there were many frustrations but this

00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,750
was one of them

00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:13,030
so finding out things in a parameterize

00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:15,400
dialogue you have like hundreds of pins

00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:17,710
you can never find anything so this one

00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:20,910
is telling me Oh tell me when the web

00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:24,550
site was like last deployed staging and

00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:28,720
it will go use the API of Jenkins scrape

00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:31,590
it and find the result and put the link

00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,590
in no slack

00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:49,760
okay this is the part where we take the

00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:53,690
debugging part this is what what's

00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:55,300
inside and we're going to have a look at

00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:58,220
it

00:37:55,300 --> 00:38:01,340
beautified you can see it has a degree

00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:04,880
of confidence of 92% so we can really

00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:07,910
make this section there are other cases

00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:11,210
when the confidence level we found like

00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:17,660
50 60 % and then we keep on asking

00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:21,010
questions this is a nicer way to scrape

00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:21,010
your Jenkins history

00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:52,869
okay this is the example that is not so

00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:56,740
confident lets you see it's like 0.5 454

00:38:52,869 --> 00:39:00,330
said we wouldn't really want to execute

00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:00,330
this if it was an action

00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:11,890
