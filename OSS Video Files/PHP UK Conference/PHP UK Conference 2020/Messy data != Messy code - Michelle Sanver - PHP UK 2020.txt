Title: Messy data != Messy code - Michelle Sanver - PHP UK 2020

Description: 
	The role of our API in Switzerland is to consume a lot of data that was not meant for a digital age and to transform it into beautiful output, for one of the biggest retailers in Switzerland. This is a journey of consuming a lot of data and APIs from different sources and in different formats. Some of them made us laugh, some of us got migraines. We built a smooth architecture to consume and output data. I am proud of our architecture that we seamlessly upgraded to keep the latest versions, now Symfony 4 along the way. I want to share with you how we managed to keep this API up to date for over 5 years and the architecture that we use to make it happen.
