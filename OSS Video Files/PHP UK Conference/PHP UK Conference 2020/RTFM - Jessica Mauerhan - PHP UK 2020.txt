Title: RTFM - Jessica Mauerhan - PHP UK 2020
Publication date: 2020-03-11
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2020
Description: 
	There is a stereotype of programmers as being antisocial and difficult, and unfortunately many of us take on this attitude as if it comes with the job – but it doesn’t have to be this way! I know it from experience, because I’ve been an angry, judgmental know-it-all, and I’m ready to tell you how I completely changed my attitude and refactored my life.

hi I'm Jessica Mauer Han I have been a

00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:11,430
software engineer for about 16 years

00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:13,709
I'm a software engineer and an

00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:16,230
engineering lead at Skillshare which

00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:18,690
means that in addition to writing code I

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:22,800
help mentor and lead the other engineers

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:26,609
I go to conferences and speak about four

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,310
to six times a year about testing code

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,289
quality best practices all that kind of

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,340
stuff but today we're going to talk

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,370
about something a little bit different

00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,920
and in this talk I'm going to mention

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:44,160
several articles blog posts things like

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:49,620
that so there is a bitly link on here

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:54,030
wellthat the mark bit ly flash RTFM - JM

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:55,230
RTFM jm4 Jessica Mary hands that has all

00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,649
the links and stuff that I'm going to

00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,649
mention

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,690
all right so like I said I've been a

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,640
software engineer for 16 years and I

00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:14,130
didn't go to college and a lot of times

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,430
when people hear that they ask how did I

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,470
learn to be a programmer I spent a lot

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,110
of time doing trial and error reading

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:25,680
blogs and googling I also spent a lot of

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,690
time on forums there was a PHP forum

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,420
that I joined and I quickly became one

00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:31,680
of the top contributors on there mostly

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,410
answering questions about how to

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,380
properly escape SQL statements and also

00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:39,479
helping people debug their code I also

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,060
joined Stack Overflow and make a mat op

00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:44,430
contributor on there raise your hand if

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,110
you've ever used Stack Overflow or one

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,630
of those types of forums or something

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,680
like that

00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,690
raise your hand again if you've ever

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:57,330
gotten an answer to your question that

00:01:51,690 --> 00:02:00,270
said RTFM a couple I like to explain

00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:03,270
RTFM to non-technical people as just

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:05,010
read the manual or as Eleanor from the

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:08,280
good place would say read the forking

00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:10,619
manual so sometimes when you ask a

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,780
question you get RTFM and that's all you

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:14,730
get sometimes it's a little more

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,519
detailed you might get a link to the

00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,709
relevant documentation sometimes people

00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:23,340
say google it or look it up and

00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:26,400
sometimes it's a lot harsher people who

00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:29,850
respond this way will often justify it

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,040
by saying the question asker needs to

00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:34,050
learn how to ask better questions do

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,090
more research and problem-solving on

00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:39,780
their own and that they're really

00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:41,880
helping them in the long run and there's

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,190
a little bit of truth to that if you

00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,739
know that you won't get help or that

00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:49,530
you'll be made fun of for asking you're

00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:51,540
less likely to ask a question maybe

00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,130
you'll spend more time banging your head

00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,160
against the wall trying to figure out

00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,540
the answer on your own maybe you'll

00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,519
learn to stop asking questions

00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:04,620
or give up because you don't think you

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:06,900
can figure it out sites like Stack

00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,570
Overflow and forums have a ton of great

00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,000
knowledge in my opinion the best case

00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:14,040
scenario is you search for your problem

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,450
and someone else already asked the

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,739
question and you don't have to be the

00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,849
one to ask it

00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:21,700
sometimes unfortunately you do have to

00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:24,629
ask and sometimes like in the relevant

00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:27,400
xkcd comic you never get an answer

00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:29,200
sometimes though you do get answers you

00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,489
learn something new and that's what

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,939
happened for me a lot of the time I

00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:35,319
learned a lot from these sites but

00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:37,989
there's something else that we find on

00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:40,030
these types of sites and I think it's a

00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:42,790
symptom of a cultural problem that

00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:45,730
exists not just on Stack Overflow or

00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:47,549
stock spaces or Twitter or wherever it

00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,780
is that we are gathering together online

00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:53,769
it's a problem in the entire tech

00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:56,889
community this is a screenshot of a

00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:58,750
Google search I did this in an incognito

00:03:56,889 --> 00:04:01,750
window this is not influenced by my

00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:03,790
search history I've typed why our

00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:07,019
programmers and the autocomplete is

00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:10,120
suggesting things including so rude

00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:14,290
socially awkward so arrogant

00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:16,620
such douchebags this is what people

00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:19,750
think of when they think of a programmer

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:24,610
the anti-social condescending attitude

00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:26,880
that tells people to RTFM mocks people

00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,229
who call HTML a programming language and

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,659
I don't think this is a shock to any of

00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:33,909
us right we know this is how the rest of

00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:38,530
society thinks of us and that's how we

00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:40,630
think about ourselves in a debate on

00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:43,560
Twitter about conferences having a code

00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:46,990
of conduct someone responded this way

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,720
you demand too much from nerds that lost

00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:52,830
a lot of social skills as a trade-off to

00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:55,270
be good think about that

00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:57,490
they're not saying that they're

00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:00,190
concerned about a code of conduct being

00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:01,599
abused by bad actors they're not saying

00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:04,659
they're concerned about freedom of

00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:08,530
expression or something like that they

00:05:04,659 --> 00:05:11,080
are saying that we are not capable of

00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:13,599
treating each other with respect because

00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,960
it's incompatible with being good

00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:19,479
technologists and in the tech community

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,780
for too long we have accepted that as a

00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:25,050
given that programmers are shitty human

00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,050
beings

00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:38,320
well oh sorry all right we see this

00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:40,750
behavior in our tech leaders all the

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,680
time some of the biggest names in tech

00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:46,660
have reputations for being jerks a

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,260
prominent example is Linux crater linus

00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,620
torvalds

00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:53,490
who has been known for his rude behavior

00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:57,370
profanity and personal insults for years

00:05:53,490 --> 00:06:00,400
there is an entire subreddit dedicated

00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:03,430
to Torvalds rants and outbursts on the

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,180
Linux kernel mailing list a New Yorker

00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:09,250
article highlighted Torvalds approach

00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,590
the emails of the celebrated programmer

00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:15,610
Linus Torvalds land like Thunderbolts

00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:18,900
from on high on two public lifts full of

00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:22,150
invective insults and demeaning language

00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:27,790
please just kill yourself now the world

00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:29,590
will be a better place he wrote in 1 so

00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:32,410
Torvalds has defended his style for

00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:34,690
years saying it's just who he is that he

00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:36,460
despises being nice and he doesn't

00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:39,460
believe in politeness or political

00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:41,770
correctness now he's been successfully

00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:44,650
managing the Linux kernel development

00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:47,080
for over 20 years and he's argued that

00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:50,520
his no approach has made him

00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:53,650
successful maybe it's working

00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,090
it's definitely kept some people from

00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:57,580
wanting to contribute to that project

00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:59,890
and it's promoted the idea that

00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:03,790
technical communities are full of

00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:07,680
condescending jerks it's not just him

00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:10,620
this attitude exists all over I

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,540
mentioned using a PHP form earlier

00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:17,350
here's a quote pulled from a post on

00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:18,400
that forum oh and by the way I don't

00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:21,550
come here to help

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:24,130
ungrateful whiny babies so stop acting

00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:26,650
like a child and remember this is a free

00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:29,020
help forum way to ensure you won't get

00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:30,670
my help again this is why I don't

00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,010
usually write actual code for people

00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:35,950
they act like even when you

00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:37,210
give them what they want does that sound

00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:40,120
like someone who's actually trying to

00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:45,100
help those me I

00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:46,720
that in 2013 I resented my customers who

00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:49,660
asked stupid questions

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,300
I picked on co-workers who annoyed me

00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:55,870
for stupid reasons and criticized their

00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:58,090
code for equally stupid reasons I worked

00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:01,300
at a company that had a manual QA team

00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:02,979
overseas once and I remember seeing them

00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:07,600
as the enemy like who did they think

00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:11,320
they were to find bugs in my code in

00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:13,810
April of 2014 my boss said we're going

00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:16,840
to a PHP conference I didn't even know

00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:19,930
if such a thing existed at that time and

00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:21,510
I was honestly not super excited about

00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:24,340
having to be around that many people

00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:27,190
like I've never been great with

00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:28,840
strangers my nightmare is when I'm at

00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:31,990
the self-checkout in the grocery store

00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,550
and the cashier comes to talk to me I

00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,960
just naturally don't want to interact

00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:38,800
with people that I don't know most of

00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:40,870
the time I have social anxiety so anyway

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,940
we went to the conference and it turned

00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:44,890
out it was an amazing experience of

00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:47,740
listening to people explaining

00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:49,750
technology and how I could use it and it

00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:52,510
was okay that I didn't already know how

00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,020
to do it this is a photo of me and Adam

00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:55,450
Culp

00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:58,060
I want a drawing to get a super cool big

00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:59,440
Zend PHP elephant and I was actually

00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:05,080
eight months pregnant at the time so I

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:07,360
was like extra grouchy the next year we

00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,709
went back to lone Starr again and in

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,529
between the sessions I got to talk to

00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:12,730
Ben Ramsay Ben has organized conferences

00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:16,000
and user groups

00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:17,950
he wrote the PHP UID library UUID

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,980
library excuse me we're actually

00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:23,950
coworkers now even I remember saying to

00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:25,900
him at the time it's so cool that you

00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,650
get to do this I wish I could do this

00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:30,040
sort of thing

00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:32,200
meaning the thing I'm doing right now he

00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,180
told me something along the lines of you

00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,990
can everyone has something they can

00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:39,880
offer it was totally ok that there was

00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:42,520
so much information that I didn't know

00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,440
there were all of these people who

00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,480
wanted to share their information and

00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:50,860
they did it in a way that didn't make me

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:53,360
feel like an idiot at some point I had

00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,890
to start thinking about what it meant

00:09:53,360 --> 00:10:05,779
when someone didn't know some piece of

00:09:54,890 --> 00:10:08,600
information that I did one evening in

00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:11,329
December of 2016 I got a text message

00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,670
from a friend of mine said do you know

00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:16,010
how to make an end write app I responded

00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:17,810
in theory I thought he had some business

00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:20,480
idea and maybe he wants to make the next

00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:22,820
flappy bird app I'm pretty sure flappy

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,120
bird mr. Naumann don't know if that's

00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:27,800
even a thing anymore

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,399
my friend responded and he spent the

00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:33,560
next hour telling me about how his

00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:35,920
friends eighteen year old daughter had

00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:39,200
been in a coma and had just woken up a

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:42,440
month prior she had had an arterial

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,870
venous malformation which is a tangle of

00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,959
abnormal blood vessels connecting

00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:49,550
arteries and veins in the brain two

00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:51,860
hours after that she had life-saving

00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:54,920
surgery to remove a portion of her brain

00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:57,350
the size of a kiwi fruit in order to

00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:01,790
stop swelling and bleeding she was in a

00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:03,980
coma for 31 days when she woke up from

00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:06,079
the coma the only thing she could do was

00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:09,740
blink she couldn't move anything else

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:11,600
and they were not eligible to get the

00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:13,670
fancy eye tracking software and hardware

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,380
that would have made it possible for her

00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:17,149
to communicate so they were

00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:21,470
communicating entirely through blink

00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:23,620
once for yes and twice for no her family

00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:28,130
had to guess at things she might want

00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:31,449
she had no way to say I'm thirsty or my

00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:33,620
head hurts or I want to watch TV and

00:11:31,449 --> 00:11:35,120
they had no way to know if she was even

00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:40,399
capable of thinking those thoughts

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:43,040
anymore so my friend asked if I could

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,470
make an app for him that would cycle

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,360
through the alphabet so she could blink

00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:50,480
at the letter she wanted and they could

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,680
spell out words so I quickly told him I

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,290
can't actually make you an Android app

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:58,610
right now but I can make a website that

00:11:54,290 --> 00:12:01,579
work so I sat down and I spent 45

00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:02,779
minutes making this app in view

00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:05,540
it let you swipe through the alphabet

00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:06,740
click to add a letter we added happy and

00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,480
sad faces that

00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,700
they asked for and then I threw the

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,600
generated files onto Amazon s3 and sent

00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:16,790
him the URL for several weeks they used

00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,940
that to communicate while Libya went

00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:22,390
through physical therapy and recovered a

00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:24,709
few months later she was walking again

00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:27,290
so here I was spending time out of my

00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:29,810
evening Christmas time I could have been

00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:31,550
spending with my kids to create

00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:33,529
something in a language that I didn't

00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,760
know I'm not a JavaScript developer but

00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:37,339
I thought that that would work

00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,260
I wrote code that my JavaScript friends

00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:42,980
would probably make fun of if they saw

00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:46,910
it for a person that I didn't know and

00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:51,950
had never met because I thought that it

00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:54,529
might help so why couldn't I spend five

00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:56,690
extra minutes to write code review with

00:12:54,529 --> 00:13:01,880
actual thoughtful comments that could

00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:04,880
help people why was I so angry at people

00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:09,550
who had done nothing but ask for my help

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:13,760
or simply exist in the world around me

00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:19,579
why did I resent the people who used the

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:21,050
products that I built and why did I get

00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:26,930
annoyed that they didn't understand how

00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:27,709
software worked there's a podcast by the

00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,290
Lifehacker

00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:32,630
called the upgrade and they did an

00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:35,060
episode called how to not be a dick in

00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:38,630
which they interviewed a former

00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:41,149
childhood bully named Jeffrey in the

00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:45,410
interview Jeffrey mentions several times

00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:47,180
about how angry he was as a teenager he

00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:50,390
describes being as young as five years

00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:52,850
old playing baseball and he could pitch

00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:55,250
a perfect game but if the team still

00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:57,620
lost by one point he would lock himself

00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:00,800
in his room and cry because he felt this

00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:03,140
intense pressure to be perfect in the

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,360
interview he says I didn't come home

00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:08,180
every day and think wow I'm a bully I

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,980
thought I'm cool I'm great I'm a tough

00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:13,490
guy and don't mess with me because I'll

00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:16,279
start a fight with you the victim of

00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:17,870
Jeffrey's bullying Eric chimes in to

00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:20,600
describe how he felt like Jeffrey was a

00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:22,430
giant because of how aggressive he was

00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:26,240
but in reality Eric was about a foot

00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:28,300
taller as the interview goes on Jeffery

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:36,710
explains how he later had to ask himself

00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:39,410
why am I so angry anger is usually a

00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:43,280
secondary emotion meaning it stems from

00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:47,000
some other emotion entirely behind most

00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:48,890
of this anger is fear we naturally try

00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,130
to fight the things that we are most

00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:55,040
insecure about sometimes pointing out

00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:57,140
that we don't know the answer sorry that

00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,440
we know the answer makes us feel better

00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:03,290
about an unacknowledged fear that we

00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,870
don't know other answers in the

00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:08,390
interview Jeffery describes his fear of

00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:11,780
not being good enough even when he

00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:16,330
succeeded if it what even if it wasn't

00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:16,330
perfect he still felt fear and guilt

00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,160
there's another podcast i listened to

00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:24,890
called my brother my brother and me

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:28,250
hosted by justin travis and Griffin

00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:31,160
McElroy they actually taught me a lot

00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:32,900
about respecting people when they first

00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,880
started their show they were just

00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:38,690
messing around and they made a lot of

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:40,070
jokes that didn't age very well in the

00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:42,890
very beginning they made one joke in

00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:44,720
particular about furries and they were

00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:47,690
pretty mean and then attempt to be funny

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,850
and they got some letters from some of

00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:51,500
their listeners that basically said hey

00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,870
I'm a furry and you really hurt my

00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,240
feelings

00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:58,340
so they had two choices at that point

00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:01,600
they could be defensive and pulled the

00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:03,980
whole it's just a joke man lighten up or

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,400
they could admit that they had been

00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:09,980
insensitive and changed their behavior

00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:12,740
and they chose the second option they

00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:15,950
apologized and they started making an

00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:18,530
effort to be more empathetic they grew

00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:21,680
as comedians and they created and

00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:24,310
nurtured this amazing welcoming

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,660
inclusive community built around

00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:29,570
encouragement and comedy that isn't

00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:33,170
cruel they went on to grow their podcast

00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:34,550
into a TV show several spin-off podcasts

00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:37,070
they do national

00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:39,350
and they recently had the graphic novel

00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:41,510
adaptation of one of their shows be

00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:44,230
number one on the New York best New York

00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:47,360
Times bestseller list

00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:50,000
Justin published a blog post several

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,460
years ago titled what it has taken me 33

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,340
years to learn and the first item on the

00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:58,310
list is you can be funny and kind or

00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:03,440
funny and cruel the second one is easier

00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:05,450
but the first one is worth it I spoke

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,700
earlier about how linus torvalds has

00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:11,680
been an example of some of the negative

00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:13,930
stereotypes of programmers last year

00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:17,990
Torvalds made a surprising announcement

00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:20,780
when after he accidentally created some

00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:23,120
scheduling conflicts to try to avoid the

00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:25,190
yearly Linux kernel summit he was

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,100
confronted by the Linux community about

00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:31,190
his behavior

00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:33,110
Torvalds wrote this week people in our

00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:35,590
community confronted me about my

00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:38,780
lifetime of not understanding emotions

00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:41,530
my flippant attacks in emails have been

00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:43,910
both unprofessional and uncalled for

00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:46,760
especially at times when I made it

00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:49,880
personal in my quest for a better patch

00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:53,420
this made sense to me I know now this

00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:55,640
was not okay and I'm truly sorry the

00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:56,900
above is basically a long-winded way to

00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,080
get to the somewhat painful personal

00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:02,330
admission that hey I need to change some

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,310
of my behavior and I want to apologize

00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:07,010
to the people that my personal behavior

00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:09,440
hurt and possibly drove away from kernel

00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:11,330
development entirely I'm going to take

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,460
some time off and get some assistance on

00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:20,180
how to understand people's emotions and

00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:22,130
respond appropriately so I will admit

00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,840
that I was not raised in an environment

00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:26,210
where empathy was something that was

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,440
encouraged or taught I don't think that

00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:30,860
it was something I really heard people

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:33,260
talk about until a few years ago so it

00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:35,300
would be easy for me to say I wasn't

00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:37,940
raised with empathy as an important

00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:40,190
value it's not my fault that I don't get

00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:43,970
it and I could have kept using these

00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:46,280
excuses to defend my behavior but after

00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:48,230
seeing other people practicing empathy

00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:51,049
in their everyday lives

00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:53,120
seeing examples of successful people who

00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:55,789
are making a difference and living

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,340
without that constant fear and anger I

00:18:55,789 --> 00:19:01,880
had to acknowledge that I had a problem

00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:05,450
and that it was possible to be both a

00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:08,600
good programmer and a kinder more

00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:10,130
respectful compassionate person I've

00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,500
never been satisfied with seeing a

00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:19,940
problem going solved and I saw a problem

00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:21,799
in my own behavior most of the time when

00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:24,260
we're talking about empathy we're

00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:27,200
referring to what's called emotional or

00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:29,799
affective empathy which means being able

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,350
to respond to someone else's emotions

00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:35,870
with an appropriate emotion

00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:39,769
there's also another aspect to empathy

00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:41,299
known as cognitive empathy or the

00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:44,690
ability to understand another person's

00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:47,029
perspective I think a lot of the

00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:50,029
conflict that we deal with could be

00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:54,110
reduced at least a little if we work on

00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:56,389
our cognitive empathy so often we don't

00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:58,370
take the time to put ourselves in other

00:19:56,389 --> 00:20:00,740
people's shoes and it's easier to

00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:04,250
dismiss them when we don't empathize

00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:06,399
with their experiences it can be really

00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:10,010
hard to understand just how different

00:20:06,399 --> 00:20:13,789
someone else's life experiences have

00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:18,639
been from our own so we often don't even

00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:20,750
attempt it it's easier to dismiss them I

00:20:18,639 --> 00:20:24,230
want to try a little experiment with you

00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:27,340
guys everyone close your eyes and I want

00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:31,100
you to imagine yourself on a beach

00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:34,909
imagine the blue-green waves crashing

00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:38,029
against the shore imagine your toes

00:20:34,909 --> 00:20:40,279
digging into the whites and think about

00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:43,639
the sounds of the seagulls flying

00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:46,700
overhead think about the smell of the

00:20:43,639 --> 00:20:48,889
salt water maybe there's beautiful palm

00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:51,169
trees on your beach or maybe there's a

00:20:48,889 --> 00:20:55,940
fire pit in the sand with people making

00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:57,980
s'mores okay open your eyes I want you

00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:01,580
to raise your hand if you would use the

00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:02,050
words pictured or visualized to describe

00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:05,890
what you

00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:09,280
dead raise your hand if in your mind you

00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:11,860
saw yourself on a beach maybe it looked

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,430
something like this my husband says he

00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:16,930
sees the beach from the movie contact

00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:19,150
maybe some of you would say that you

00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:21,250
smelled the salt water or the fire pit

00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:26,140
or that you heard the sounds of the

00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:29,200
waves this is what I see that there's

00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:31,540
not a sight there there is no such thing

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,770
as visualization for me because I have a

00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,170
Fantasia

00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:39,490
I have no mind's eye if I close my eyes

00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:41,590
I see the back of my eyelids a Fantasia

00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:44,650
is the inability to produce visual

00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:46,330
images in your mind and I don't have any

00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:48,010
other senses in my mind either some

00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:54,010
people can hear other people's voices

00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:56,050
not in a bad way I have none of that so

00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:58,270
there's a part of your brain that lights

00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:00,250
up on an MRI when you are looking at a

00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:02,980
picture and the same part of your brain

00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:05,530
lights up when you visualize or a

00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:07,210
picture things in your brain unless you

00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:10,510
have a Fantasia and you can't picture

00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:12,580
things so I didn't actually find this

00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:15,040
out until about a year ago when a

00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:17,470
co-worker shared an article about a

00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:19,540
Fantasia and I had to start asking my

00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:21,040
friends and family if they really saw

00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:24,100
things when they tried to visualize

00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,870
things I had gone my whole life so far

00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:30,610
thinking that everyone was being super

00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:32,830
metaphoric so I didn't understand that

00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:34,930
the vast majority of people when they

00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:37,210
say they picture things they actually

00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:39,280
picture things until I read about the

00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:41,380
two percent of people who don't picture

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,210
things and in an audience this size

00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:46,450
there's probably two to four of you who

00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:48,610
just found this out as well so when I

00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:51,340
figured this out it actually made a lot

00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:53,740
of sense for me but when I started

00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:55,420
explaining it to my friends so many

00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:57,520
people had a hard time understanding it

00:22:55,420 --> 00:23:00,010
they were like do you mean you see in

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:05,260
black and white it's like no I don't see

00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:07,770
anything - so many people the experience

00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:10,540
of not being able to visualize things is

00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:13,510
unimaginable they cannot put themselves

00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:15,770
in my shoes any more than I can close my

00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:18,860
eyes and picture myself on a beach

00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:20,660
I can think about a beach when I imagine

00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:22,880
things I don't see them or hear them or

00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:25,640
smell them but I know what they look

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,280
like I know facts about them I can

00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:30,020
remember walking in the sand with my

00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,610
friends or making s'mores on the beach

00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,140
with my daughter I just do it

00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:35,120
differently and I'll never know what

00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:39,140
it's like for people who can visualize

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:40,910
things so we're talking about something

00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:43,760
that honestly has very little impact

00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:49,220
right I went 32 years of my life without

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:50,480
even knowing that this was a thing so it

00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:53,030
clearly wasn't keeping me from doing

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:57,530
anything really important other than

00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:58,910
picking paint colors for my house so my

00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:02,300
friends not being able to understand

00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:06,530
that when I say that I see nothing it

00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:08,000
really doesn't mean that much how do we

00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:10,820
handle it when it's something that does

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,650
matter do we dismiss that person's

00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,450
experiences because we can't put

00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:19,580
ourselves in their experience in their

00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:22,340
shoes this is a tweet from Lindsey Scott

00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:24,500
where she says looking forward to the

00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:26,510
day when women in tech don't have to go

00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,850
above and beyond to prove themselves and

00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:31,820
it's accompanied by a screenshot of an

00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:34,250
Instagram post featuring Lindsey who is

00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:36,320
a Victoria's Secret model and also has a

00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:39,220
bachelor's degree in computer science

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:42,550
and knows multiple programming languages

00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:45,200
some of the comments on the post include

00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:52,520
while printing hello world these days is

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:54,920
considered coding and what a waste this

00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,570
is a quote for my friend Q someone

00:24:54,920 --> 00:25:02,060
shared an article about infighting

00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:05,210
between C JavaScript devs and CSS devs Q

00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:07,520
says undervaluing slash under estimating

00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:10,610
front-end code is very much a thing

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:14,210
especially if you do CSS things like I

00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:16,790
do I feel this sometimes according to

00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:18,880
some stuff I do isn't considered real

00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:22,310
programming I don't know why there

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,230
exists a need to look down on others or

00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:27,760
for folks to have to defend their

00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:27,760
profession slash work

00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:36,380
Justin's post of advice also includes a

00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:38,180
lot of other good items such as I can

00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:40,640
count on one hand the number of times

00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:42,800
putting out negativity has brought me

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:46,850
back something worthwhile and even when

00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:49,160
it works it feels terrible don't correct

00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:50,870
people unless their wrongness will lead

00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:53,210
to them getting hurt or hurting someone

00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:55,160
else you'll have a fleeting sense of

00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:58,900
superiority and they'll resent you

00:25:55,160 --> 00:26:01,760
nothing worthwhile comes of it and

00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:03,710
empathy is the final step of maturity

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,440
it can take some work but you'll be

00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:09,770
shocked how much easier the world is to

00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:11,270
navigate when you remember to use it he

00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:19,730
also reminds us we're probably not

00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:21,740
drinking enough water it's okay if you

00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:25,400
don't like talking to people that might

00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:28,070
write I I still don't I am always happy

00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,260
to talk to people at conferences I am

00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:33,140
happy to help anyone who emails me but I

00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:35,090
do have anxiety and I don't like it when

00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:37,070
that cashier comes to talk to me at the

00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:38,840
self-checkout because it's the

00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:41,030
self-checkout and I have both of my

00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:44,510
earbuds in why are you coming to talk to

00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:47,300
me I don't know maybe her boss makes her

00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:48,679
do it maybe her kids grew up and moved

00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:52,309
away and she doesn't have anyone else to

00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:54,470
talk to it doesn't matter it doesn't

00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:55,190
solve anything for me to be mean to her

00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:58,790
about it

00:26:55,190 --> 00:27:01,550
or to be angry about it and solving

00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:02,840
problems is my favorite thing to do it's

00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:04,940
the whole reason that I got into

00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:07,970
programming is to solve problems for

00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:11,860
other people and I forgot about that for

00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:15,110
a long time I forgot that that paycheck

00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:17,330
only keeps coming because the code I'm

00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:20,600
writing is ultimately solving a problem

00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:24,200
for someone else that problem might be

00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:26,960
technically challenging you could be

00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:29,480
using the newest language doing things

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,150
that I can't even think of yet you could

00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,620
be doing something as mundane as

00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:35,690
automating a reporting process that

00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:39,980
previously took someone four hours to do

00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:42,540
manually or it could be as life-changing

00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:44,910
and inspiring as allowing a team

00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:50,550
major to tell her family she's okay

00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:53,340
after she had brain surgery if I had

00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:55,760
continued to view the people around me

00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:58,460
as beneath me instead of as equals and

00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:02,010
continued to take out my anger on

00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:06,330
everyone in my life I might not have had

00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:08,520
the chance to help Livia but now I have

00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:16,080
the opportunity to help anyone who asks

00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:19,140
for it so going forward I'm constantly

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,330
making a choice to be kind I'm making a

00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:23,730
conscious effort to be more thoughtful

00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:29,010
and purposeful about the way I speak

00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:31,050
about and to the people around me I'm

00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:35,070
not saying I'm perfect I can still be

00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:38,730
better we can all do better the lack of

00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:46,290
empathy understanding respect compassion

00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:48,200
and community in tech is a problem sorry

00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:50,820
I'm having a little issue here all right

00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,800
we're all responsible for making this

00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:56,730
community a better place we are all a

00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:59,760
part of it through the jokes that we

00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:02,700
make the tickets that we solve at work

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:05,190
the code that we write everything we do

00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:07,950
we are responsible for making tech a

00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:10,790
better place so let's go do it

00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:10,790
