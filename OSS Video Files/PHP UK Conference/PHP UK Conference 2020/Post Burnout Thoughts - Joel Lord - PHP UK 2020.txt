Description: 
	Working in the tech industry can put a lot of pressure on people. Long hours, tight deadlines and a culture of always being connected can easily lead to depression or burnout. Through the sharing of the speakerâ€™s personal experience, the attendees will learn to help people that might be experiencing distress and stop keeping this subject taboo. 1 in 5 Europeans are dealing with mental illness and the costs associated with this is too high to ignore.

	00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,300
all right so we're mostly all engineers

00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,690
here right let's take a look at some

00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:13,559
numbers first Europeans living with

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:15,240
diabetes there's about 1 in 11 European

00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:20,279
I don't want to make any politics but

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,820
Europeans I've been told it's a touchy

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,699
subject

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,359
so Europeans living with diabetes when

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:29,579
it oughta let it 11 Europeans living

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,900
with asthma one out of twelve and I

00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:33,329
pretty sure if I ask this room here

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,079
there's what maybe 200 people so if I

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:39,870
ask who has asthma like there's probably

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,760
we see a few hands that's fine you know

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:45,719
that's the kind of goes close to the

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,399
statistics there arthritis Europeans

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,399
living with arthritis there's one out of

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,140
five that will eventually usually starts

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,910
at a older age

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,399
I'm starting to feel it in the mornings

00:00:53,910 --> 00:01:01,589
it's kind of a yes I'm getting at that

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:03,809
age it's about one in five and people

00:01:01,589 --> 00:01:08,460
living with mental illness also one in

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:12,600
five that's a little bit more of a you

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,830
know I'd say shocking status status so

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,680
mental illness is one of the most

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:19,170
prevalent chronic health conditions but

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,300
we just don't talk about it right I

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:24,120
would have never dared asking hey who

00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,410
here lives with a mental illness nobody

00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:29,670
would have raised their hand right we

00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:31,080
don't talk about it this big taboo so

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,550
today I'm here to talk about my own

00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,740
experience I'll talk more specifically

00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:37,920
about burnout which is one of the many

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:40,470
mental illness that that covers and

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,910
under that statistic mental health

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,460
covers a lot of different things it

00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:47,610
covers things like depression

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,380
schizophrenia OCD and so on but I'll

00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:52,470
focus on burnout I'll focus on my own

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:55,440
story now here's one thing I'm not a

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,060
mental health professional I'm only here

00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,990
to talk about my own experience so your

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:03,180
own experience may differ and and if you

00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,820
have any question I mean don't rely on

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,910
me just go ask a medical professional

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:11,400
it's very important the reason why I do

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,879
this talk though is to kind of help to

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,290
break that stigma around mental health

00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:18,239
special mental health in the workplace

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,819
like I said we don't like to talk about

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,349
it so by doing talks like this I I'm

00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:26,969
hoping that it will help to open up

00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:29,219
conversations now I'm not used to talk

00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:32,480
about myself I am you know your typical

00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:34,769
software developer introvert you know

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,239
I'm much more comfortable talking about

00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:39,390
containers than I am talking about

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,970
myself but we'll see how this goes if

00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,299
you're gonna try so a little bit about

00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,359
me

00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:46,980
hi everyone my name is Joel Lord I am I

00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:48,569
am french-canadian that's the little

00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,400
charming little accent you might have

00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:54,209
recognized there I currently live in

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,950
Ottawa in Canada and I I do some talks I

00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:58,019
work as a developer advocate for Red Hat

00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:03,959
so I spent a lot of fun traveling going

00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:05,430
to conferences I'm just like this one if

00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,290
you ever want to get in touch with me

00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,109
Twitter is always the best way so that's

00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:11,519
Joel with two hundred scores Lord

00:03:09,109 --> 00:03:14,340
whenever I have Twitter notifications I

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:19,739
get really really excited and yes that's

00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:21,479
a gif of me why not burnout is a heavy

00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:24,260
topic for the first talk in the morning

00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:30,419
so I thought I'd lighten up a little bit

00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:32,519
all right so pretty now it can be kind

00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:34,260
of hard to define it's it's not like

00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,609
having a flu right it's not like you

00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,889
wake up one morning and you start

00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:39,690
coughing or you wake up one morning and

00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:42,419
you're just you're not feeling well

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,889
it goes it takes some time and it's

00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:46,500
spread so longer a long period of time

00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:47,879
and it's a little bit like whenever you

00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,519
go to the movie theater right and they

00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:51,690
they slowly fade out the lights and you

00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:53,400
only realize that the lights are out

00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:56,010
once they're actually out but it's

00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,340
really hard to say at one at what point

00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,599
they started fading those lights a

00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,729
little bit I like that image you might

00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:04,650
not have noticed but it was a very nice

00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:06,260
image at the beginning and slowly faded

00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,639
into you like this post-apocalyptic

00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:11,639
image so it's a slow fade it's really

00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:15,509
hard to see when it actually started or

00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:20,099
not but it's easy to see the end result

00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:23,400
though so for me at one point I woke up

00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:26,099
one morning and everything was hard at

00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,770
this point I I had to get out of bed and

00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,800
drag my body out of bed it was so hard I

00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:32,560
had no

00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,750
motivation I had to take a shower really

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,680
and I got into the shower that morning

00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:41,190
and I started crying I had no clue what

00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,659
was going on but I was just crying and

00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:45,879
it was it was this really weird feeling

00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:47,379
because I I mean there was I was

00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:50,849
completely losing control of all my

00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:53,979
emotion I didn't know what was going on

00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:56,220
now my wife who had been incredibly

00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:58,509
supportive during that period of time

00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:03,490
she'd been telling me for a while that

00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:06,009
something was wrong but you know I'm

00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:08,169
strong I'm not gonna go see a doctor I

00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:11,590
don't need that and just you know a

00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:13,090
little tired but when I when I would

00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,379
that happened that morning I kind of

00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,759
realized that something was wrong and

00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:23,349
maybe it was time for me to actually

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:25,270
face it so what is burnout exactly so

00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:26,800
burnout is a state of emotional mental

00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,629
and physical exhaustion caused by

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,580
excessive in prolonged stress and it

00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:32,530
manifests itself in ways including

00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:36,539
anxiety loss of motivation confidence

00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:39,490
and even degradation of physical health

00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:41,440
in my case so it kind of mimics a lot of

00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,569
symptoms of depression so it's kind of

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,909
hard to diagnose when you're just

00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:48,490
looking at the symptoms in my case I had

00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:49,900
a complete lack of motivation like I

00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,990
didn't want to do anything

00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:55,360
never-ever and a lot of anxiety I

00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:56,830
started having so much anxiety and I

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,440
started getting physically sick as well

00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,789
I had it flu but it lasted over a month

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,129
I mean that's that's not normal when

00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:04,629
you're your regular common flu lasts

00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:08,770
over a month and you should probably

00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:11,259
talk to a doctor I had I had so much

00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:14,110
heart burns like it's so much stress I

00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:15,849
actually bought tums at Costco there's

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:19,659
no problem I'll just take more tubs you

00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:21,129
know nothing's wrong I should have put

00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:24,159
an image of that dog you know yeah it's

00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:26,050
fine and I was having so much trouble

00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:28,750
controlling my emotion that was actually

00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:30,879
one of the hardest part everything was

00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:33,370
kind of like this roller coaster of

00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:35,289
negative emotion I went through through

00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:37,300
anger and then sadness and then

00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:39,550
aggressive and then I'm super anxious

00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:43,400
all of a sudden then an impatient and

00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:44,870
discouraged and really weird

00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:49,550
when you can't even control your own

00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:54,139
emotions I felt like it was almost

00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:56,509
losing part of my mind you know and the

00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:58,789
lack of motivation I've touched about it

00:06:56,509 --> 00:07:01,490
but it was I didn't want to do anything

00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:03,139
like really my friends would call me to

00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:05,389
go and have a drink and I'd find an

00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:08,210
excuse I just I just didn't have any

00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:10,009
energy to do anything so most of my

00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:15,259
weekend were just spent in bed you know

00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:18,469
watching Netflix someone once told me

00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:19,789
that a willpower or motivation is a

00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:21,020
little bit like a bucket of water that

00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:22,819
you have in the morning so in the

00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,279
morning you wake up you have this full

00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:27,080
bucket of water and and it's up to you

00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,389
to decide how you're going to spend that

00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,800
water throughout the day so that's why

00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:32,449
they usually say you know all the things

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,150
that you don't really like doing like

00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:36,560
going through your emails and Bill you

00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:38,120
should do early in the morning when you

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,860
still have some energy and some

00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,409
willpower and somewhere watering your

00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:44,389
bucket and as the day progress you

00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:46,580
should do things that are more fun that

00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:48,529
don't require as much energy to get

00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,000
started right so you'll do I'm coding

00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:51,770
towards the end of the day because then

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,060
you can really get into it and a lot

00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:59,089
more fun and some days you wake up and

00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:00,830
but might be a little bit smaller maybe

00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:03,770
you have young kids and they kept you

00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,939
awake all night or maybe you're

00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:07,879
traveling from Canada and you're

00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:10,330
jet-lagged and maybe there was a social

00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:13,189
last night then you have a beer too many

00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:14,659
or maybe it's a mix of all of that but

00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:17,149
sometimes the bucket is a little bit

00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:19,099
smaller but ultimately it's up to you

00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:23,509
every day to manage how you're going to

00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:25,580
spend that water now when you're burnt

00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:28,430
out your bucket feels like it's full of

00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:30,949
holes you wake up in the morning and

00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:32,419
already you start thinking about all the

00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:36,229
horrible things that are going to happen

00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:37,610
today and and already it's hard to get

00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:40,459
out of bed because there's like all that

00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:43,579
energy that just drained out and drag

00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:47,300
yourself out of bed gotta take my shower

00:08:43,579 --> 00:08:51,140
that's before I work remotely gotta take

00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:53,959
my shower got to go to work get into my

00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:55,960
car and stuck in traffic and put your

00:08:53,959 --> 00:09:00,640
damn turn signal on and

00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:01,600
like this green move already and by the

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,520
time you get to the office

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:08,770
I think there's absolutely no energy

00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:11,230
left to do anything else so that's kind

00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:14,710
of how I felt when I was at the worst

00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:15,960
part in my burnout so where does it come

00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:17,950
from

00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,660
so burnout can be prevalent in

00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:21,280
organizations that promote hero culture

00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,410
and where employees maintain a strong

00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:26,740
sense of duty or feel they have no

00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:29,380
alternative in the employment market now

00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:31,330
that last part might not be as true I

00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,880
think we live in an industry where we

00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:35,380
have a lot of chances to move although

00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,590
sometimes we feel like we're kind of

00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:41,560
stuck in our job and there's also that

00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:42,130
hero culture that we have in in the tech

00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,960
industry

00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:46,720
Jessica kind of touched on it yesterday

00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:50,110
where you know everybody has to be the

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:53,020
best and and somehow everybody has to be

00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:55,690
an ass to everybody else so the tech

00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:59,230
industry tends to have that that that

00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:01,450
hero culture high number of working

00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:03,430
hours is often sees seen as they're

00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:05,470
desirable as well and when you're done

00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:07,690
with your work you know what should we

00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:09,520
do well we should go back home and work

00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,560
on a blog post based on whatever we

00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,910
learned today or work on that open

00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,220
source project because we need that for

00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:19,180
our portfolio and there's always

00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:20,710
something else that we need to do at

00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,660
that time I was doing about 70 hours a

00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:24,580
week for my job and it never seemed

00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:27,280
enough I could never accomplish what I

00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:29,020
needed to do in my days and so I started

00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,310
working at night because that makes a

00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:33,090
lot more sense right because I didn't

00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:37,210
have any interruptions by bed at night

00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:39,820
so and no don't do that please not very

00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:41,650
healthy and it's also that startup

00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:47,950
culture where everything moves at 2,000

00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:51,520
miles per hour my case there was also

00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:55,090
that false sense of responsibility I was

00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:57,010
working as a manager back then and my

00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:59,050
manager would ask me to put together

00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:01,330
some project or but put up some new

00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:02,800
processes for different things but I

00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:05,470
didn't have any power to change anything

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,780
in the organization so whenever I try to

00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:09,160
push something immediately somebody else

00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,110
would come in and destroy all the work

00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,520
that I did

00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:14,020
so this type of thing kind of leads to a

00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:19,180
toxic work environment which is

00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:21,190
definitely not very good so a lot of

00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:25,060
people think that or associate burnout

00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:27,310
with just being tired that it will go

00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:29,950
away with a little bit of sleep well

00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:32,530
once you reach the state of burnout

00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:34,420
usually it's a little bit too late I

00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:37,720
mean you will need to recover at some

00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:39,340
point but but you know it's not just

00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,830
getting a good night of sleep that will

00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,730
fix everything

00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:44,920
occupational burnout is considered a

00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:46,450
real disease it's recognized by the ICD

00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,490
as its own

00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:51,760
ICD code recognized by the word World

00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:53,350
Health Organization and it can be

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,000
diagnosed with the mass tag burnout

00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:57,700
inventory which is a series of question

00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,530
that you rate from 0 to 6 the questions

00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:03,730
themselves depend on your profession and

00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:05,200
some few criterias now when you go see a

00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:06,820
doctor and because you feel like

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,470
something's going wrong be careful on

00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:11,020
how you will answer those questions be

00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:13,920
honest so one other question and I

00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:15,130
remember this clearly doctor asked me a

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,200
question

00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:19,960
are you having difficulties getting

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:23,410
along with your colleagues so I thought

00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:26,710
oh this today I got in the to a fight

00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:28,720
with only two of my colleagues the

00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:31,420
yelling lasted about ten minutes each

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:38,230
time so that's 20 minutes out of 24

00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:40,720
hours so rarely know so try to be honest

00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:43,360
I mean you're not you know you're only

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,590
lying to yourself at that point if you

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,590
aren't sure whether you should actually

00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:48,220
see a a professional or a mental health

00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,780
professional

00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,700
the Mayo Clinic released a quick survey

00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:55,450
that you can do to decide whether you

00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:57,930
should or not see a doctor so as those

00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:00,550
some of those are some of the questions

00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:05,740
have to be consent cool or critical at

00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:07,660
work yeah do you drag yourself to work

00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,380
and have trouble getting started once

00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:13,810
you arrive

00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:15,220
I mean outside of Mondays right have you

00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:18,649
become irritable or impatient with

00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:23,329
co-workers customers or clients

00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:26,019
I have so many stories do you like the

00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:28,430
energy to be consistently productive

00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:30,769
have your sleep habits or appetite

00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:32,360
change so I can have physical effects as

00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:34,009
well have are you troubled by

00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,160
unexplained headaches backaches or

00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:39,939
physical complaints if you answered yes

00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,809
to any of those questions you might be

00:13:39,939 --> 00:13:43,699
experienced all to your doctor or a

00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:45,529
mental health provider however some of

00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:46,910
those symptoms can also indicate certain

00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:50,420
health conditions such as thyroid

00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:51,649
disorder or depression so if you feel

00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:53,119
like something is wrong and you're

00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:54,769
saying yes to at least one of those

00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:56,869
questions well maybe it's time to

00:13:54,769 --> 00:14:00,170
actually think about it and go talk to

00:13:56,869 --> 00:14:02,420
your doctor all right so what should you

00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:05,569
do if you feel like you're going through

00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:08,059
burnout so first of all go into your

00:14:05,569 --> 00:14:10,910
doctor I said many times and it's very

00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:15,850
very important I actually do so III

00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:18,050
think a lot of especially people my age

00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:19,550
but we feel like we shouldn't talk about

00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,259
that stuff and we should be strong right

00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:22,699
and we shouldn't see a doctor and it's

00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:26,420
very important that you actually do so

00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:29,300
and you know they might recommend or

00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:31,370
prescribe some medication if you have

00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,809
any doubts ask questions just ask them

00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,610
questions they are health professionals

00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:36,050
that's what they do ask them questions

00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,459
is that something that might be

00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:39,679
addictive is that is that a medication

00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:42,319
that I'll be eventually able to get off

00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:44,660
of and so think about it what it is that

00:14:42,319 --> 00:14:45,759
worries you and and just ask those

00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:49,269
questions

00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:51,740
they'll probably also recommend therapy

00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:54,139
you should do it definitely

00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:56,990
one thing about therapy though is and

00:14:54,139 --> 00:14:59,990
and that people don't say enough is shop

00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:01,519
your therapist it's really hard if you

00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:03,139
want to get some real benefits out of a

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,449
therapy you need to be with someone that

00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:09,110
you trust and you might have to shop a

00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:10,850
therapist to actually find one all right

00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:13,339
but what else can you do apart from

00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:15,339
seeing a doctor well do a little bit of

00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:17,990
introspection that's always a good start

00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:19,939
think about what it is that put you in

00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:23,329
this position where is it that you get

00:15:19,939 --> 00:15:25,069
that pressure from and don't just go and

00:15:23,329 --> 00:15:27,319
blame others like think about it really

00:15:25,069 --> 00:15:28,579
and maybe it's just you that can't say

00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:29,929
no to anything and maybe that's

00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:32,540
something that you actually need to work

00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:34,760
yourself or maybe there are some

00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,830
external factors that are putting you in

00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,540
this situation so do a little bit of

00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:40,520
introspection and really really think

00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:45,800
about what it is that is causing you

00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:47,600
this stress take a break of course not

00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,390
all employers will give you a full month

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,990
off but you know sometimes you might

00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:56,000
have personal days off days that you can

00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:57,470
take without any questions asked so by

00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,780
all means take them you should take them

00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:01,790
maybe take a long weekend take a Friday

00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:04,610
a Monday off and go go somewhere where

00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:07,070
nobody will bother you I like to do can

00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:09,380
you campaign with my wife and it's in

00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:11,810
the middle of the forest of the Canadian

00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:14,510
forest and it's exactly like you would

00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:16,700
imagine and there's no cellular theater

00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:18,410
north of your connection whatsoever and

00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,180
it's great because I can't answer any

00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:22,520
emails or anything so I kind of need

00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,140
that but you know do something like that

00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:27,050
and try to disconnect a little bit from

00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:32,630
from work and other worries that you

00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:36,110
might have oh due west yes right just do

00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:37,910
a little bit less but by that I mean try

00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:40,430
to try to offload some of the work that

00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:42,560
maybe you don't have to do here's an

00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:45,470
interesting story when I started dating

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,390
my wife you know I wanted to impress her

00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:49,610
and I would do the cooking and like

00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:53,210
every night I do dinner prepare dinner

00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:55,310
and she wanted to be like a traditional

00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:57,890
you know wife and she did all the dishes

00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:59,210
after after the meals and and we did

00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:01,700
that for a while until we actually

00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:05,180
talked about it and I hate cooking I

00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:07,100
absolutely hate it and she loves it it

00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:11,060
turns out that I was able to do a little

00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:12,530
bit less by delegating that to her now I

00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:16,100
know what you're thinking I do the

00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:18,140
dishes now right so but that's something

00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:20,960
that I actually enjoy doing I find that

00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:22,880
it's a really relaxing way to end a meal

00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,830
to actually just clean up everything and

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,870
everything is nice back to the original

00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:32,720
thing I think it's I don't know I love

00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:34,310
doing the dishes and it's but it was an

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,020
interesting discussion and and when we

00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:38,360
realized that and ever since like they

00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:40,790
were good bitter anymore and and she

00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,440
never does the dishes so I'm doing a lot

00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:44,680
less because it's not as much effort for

00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,680
me

00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:49,340
so you know try to see if there's

00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,930
anything that you can offload in a work

00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:52,910
environment maybe maybe you can ask

00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:54,410
someone else to take on that that code

00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,370
review that you don't want to do that

00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:57,050
today

00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:58,460
you know what ask that junior in the

00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:00,380
team to actually do that code review

00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,760
from that senior developer because that

00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,170
will offload some of the work for you

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,360
and it will probably be a very

00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:11,450
beneficial experience for the other two

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:13,700
parties involved say no mostly as a

00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:15,500
reminder for myself if conference

00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:19,040
organizers ask you to fill in for a talk

00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:21,530
you know maybe say no like you know

00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,850
that's not so true but you know you

00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:25,760
don't need to be a superhero

00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:27,440
I mean don't need to justify whenever

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,320
you don't whenever don't want to take on

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,330
a task and you know what saying no

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,060
sometimes actually increases the values

00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:39,970
of your yeses so say no from time to

00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:44,990
time it's very very important all right

00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:46,730
save your I mean you can't give a

00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,380
 about everything all right so you

00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:50,480
kind of need to save some choose your

00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:53,330
fights you won't be able to save the

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,850
world by yourself so you won't be able

00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:58,670
to please everyone just pick some fights

00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:00,800
some that you can win ideally and bring

00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:02,240
them to an end so you have a limited

00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:07,970
number of folks that you can give in a

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:10,730
day so you know use them wisely ask for

00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:13,850
help that's a really really hard one for

00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:16,850
me but reach out to people reach out to

00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:19,210
people that you trust reach out to talk

00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:22,190
to your spouse your significant other

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:23,780
reach out to your friends you know kick

00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:25,010
yourself in the butt and just call one

00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:27,560
of your friends and go out for coffee

00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:29,030
and and talk to them just tell them that

00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,830
you're going through a rough patch I

00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:33,170
don't need to go through the details but

00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:35,320
you never know what's going to come out

00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:41,710
of that sometimes you might find someone

00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:41,710
unexpected support there's some exercise

00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:50,010
seriously well it's been proven like you

00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:54,080
should do exercise it's good for you

00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:59,940
it's endorphins and things in your brain

00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:02,070
I'm not the exercise - one thing that

00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,600
was very important for me though is find

00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:05,610
something that you like to do find a

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,840
hobby try to find something that it's

00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:10,290
completely different from your work and

00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:14,010
that you actually enjoy doing for me was

00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:16,080
I started brewing some beer they usually

00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:18,170
say I don't drink too much when you're

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:22,530
going through depression or burnout but

00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:24,990
yeah I only brewed the beer so I started

00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:26,790
doing that and whenever I have in this

00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:29,640
picture of me my cousin and my brother

00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:31,890
and we're are bring partners we brew big

00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:36,060
batches of 20 gallon beers every you

00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:37,650
know a few weeks and those are the only

00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:39,540
warning we're actually set up my alarm

00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:41,820
at 6:00 in the morning I get there as

00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:43,980
quickly as I can I get very very excited

00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:47,280
about that and if you're not familiar

00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:49,770
with brewing beer essentially the

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,090
process is you get there you drink a lot

00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:53,280
of beer and you watch some water boil

00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:57,510
during a few hours that's pretty much

00:20:53,280 --> 00:21:01,500
all you do but whenever I have brew days

00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:04,290
I sleep so well at night might be the

00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,900
beer drinking but it's also the fact

00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:08,910
that I spent a full day doing something

00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:11,130
that I really enjoyed with people that I

00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:12,600
really love and I don't have to worry

00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,620
about anything during those days so find

00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:18,780
something that you're actually like

00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:21,210
doing and and pursue that alright so if

00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:22,440
you see people going or if you want to

00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:24,900
help people that might be going through

00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,220
burnout so what can you do to help well

00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:29,250
there's a few things that you can do as

00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:32,240
an employer for for starters first of

00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:34,530
all you might want to enable remote work

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,420
there's a lot of controversy around that

00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:37,800
but remote work can definitely help

00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,450
people if they need to take an

00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,880
appointment with a health professional

00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:43,710
during today they might bless you they

00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,660
might not have to justify that or they

00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:48,570
not might not have to I feel like they

00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:51,060
have to justify that offer some personal

00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:52,500
time off it's very important let your

00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,660
employees take some days off without

00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,760
asking for justification or asking for a

00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:59,240
doctor's note just let them say take

00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:01,710
some days off

00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,450
have an Employee Assistance Program

00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:04,650
those are very very important if you're

00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:06,210
not familiar with an Employee Assistance

00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:08,070
Program it's basically just the phone

00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:11,039
number where you can call and get all

00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:13,410
kind of works of help whether it's from

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:16,980
a mental health or even sometimes legal

00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:18,840
stuff now if you have an Employee

00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:21,210
Assistance Program be really careful on

00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:24,510
how you promote it I used to work at a

00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:26,429
place where it was a very nice open

00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:28,140
floor office right and right in the

00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:31,230
middle of that this floor there was this

00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:32,460
big column and there was a poster and

00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:34,020
the phone number for the Employee

00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,880
Assistance Program was right there in

00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:38,460
the middle of the room

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:40,470
now for some reason go figure I never

00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:42,299
saw anyone actually go up to that post

00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:45,059
and take a phone number and note and you

00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:46,679
know give them a call afterwards oh you

00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:48,809
want to put that in a place where people

00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:50,460
will have a little bit of privacy good

00:22:48,809 --> 00:22:52,409
places are you know maybe in the

00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,909
bathroom stalls so people can actually

00:22:52,409 --> 00:22:55,220
just you know take the number in note

00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:58,080
and then they'll be able to call later

00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:00,059
so be careful on how you promote it make

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,250
sure that it's available and that people

00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:06,030
don't have to be shy of taking that

00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:07,860
number as well train people to the

00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:09,360
Mental Health First they'd get so

00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,700
there's a program called mental health

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,070
first aid kind of like the regular first

00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,330
type programs but aim towards a mental

00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:17,820
health so you can take a look at that

00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:19,830
and there's the mental health in tech

00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,750
guidelines for mental wellness in the

00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:24,030
workplace which was published by Azmi

00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:27,150
I'll come back to ask me later but you

00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:30,990
might want to take a look at this as a

00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:35,309
manager all managers here lead by

00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:37,409
example that is so important don't send

00:23:35,309 --> 00:23:39,059
emails at 2:00 in the morning I don't

00:23:37,409 --> 00:23:41,429
care if you think they don't have to

00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:44,640
answer at until 7:00 in the morning just

00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:46,320
don't send them scheduled them for 8 or

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,919
9 in the morning if you don't need an

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,100
answer now

00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:51,990
don't send the email now end of story if

00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,400
you send emails at 2:00 in the morning

00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:55,020
your employees will feel like they

00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,020
actually have to answer back at this

00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:59,700
time take some days off

00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,890
take some take your vacation especially

00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:04,470
in tech where we have this unlimited

00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:05,850
vacation policy you know take your days

00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:08,159
off and make sure that everybody knows

00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:11,070
that you actually do and talk about

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,360
mental health in your workplace

00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:15,210
my colleague there's a few things that

00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:17,009
you can do as well mainly language

00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:20,130
matters be careful on how you address

00:24:17,009 --> 00:24:22,259
different situations don't call people

00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:24,870
crazy and things like that which might

00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:26,309
not be very good there's a grid a great

00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:28,919
guide that was published by Bell Canada

00:24:26,309 --> 00:24:31,679
they have a program a figure which is

00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:36,299
called let's talk the link is there as

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:37,610
you can see they're all be I'll publish

00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:40,350
everything on Twitter afterwards a

00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:41,690
decline mostly just you know don't be an

00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:43,769
ass

00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,970
listen to people don't jump to

00:24:43,769 --> 00:24:46,980
conclusions

00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:50,399
things like I you'll get over it or just

00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:52,649
relax usually don't help you know ask

00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:55,460
instead like or say I'm sorry you're not

00:24:52,649 --> 00:24:57,690
feeling well ask how you can help and

00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,860
break the silence talk about mental

00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:01,740
health in the workplace that's very

00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:03,750
important so the talk is called post

00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:06,870
burnout thoughts so what now so I've

00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:10,049
been through that and I found out that

00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:11,909
it wasn't only negative I mean sure when

00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:14,220
you're when you're in the worst part of

00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:17,220
your burnout and and you feel like

00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:19,559
everything is dark and it's it's not a

00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:21,299
good place to be in but you know what

00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:23,039
things will get better it'll only get

00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:24,990
better from there the moment you start

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:30,389
talking about and start and the moment

00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:31,860
you reach out for help so it's what

00:25:30,389 --> 00:25:34,350
helped me to find this job that was a

00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:36,059
very good output for me so I took that

00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:37,740
time to do some introspection I thought

00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:39,480
about what is it that I like doing what

00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:41,159
is it that I actually enjoy in my work

00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,320
and what is it that I don't like

00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:45,480
so everything management out the window

00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,580
and a lot of things like mentoring and

00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,289
coaching people's are things that I like

00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:52,559
to do so that's why I do what I do right

00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:56,399
now and it brought me so much closer to

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:59,279
my friends and family I got to I got to

00:25:56,399 --> 00:26:01,019
recognize who was my real friends they

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:03,330
were Delta they were there to help me

00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:05,610
out whenever I needed a lot of times

00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:08,220
without me asking they just knew I was

00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:10,080
going through a rough patch and they'd

00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:13,500
reach out to me and help in various

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:15,720
different ways so now I live a much

00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,940
better balanced life so I think overall

00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,409
the out book was very positive sure it

00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:21,360
wasn't a lot of fun when I went through

00:26:19,409 --> 00:26:22,720
it but now that I think of it and that I

00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,619
look at it

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,639
it's the result is a lot more positive

00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:28,779
I'll leave you with this quote from

00:26:27,639 --> 00:26:31,480
Christopher Narang friend of mine

00:26:28,779 --> 00:26:32,619
actually listen honden here and he said

00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,210
something along the line so if you don't

00:26:32,619 --> 00:26:36,159
get burned out by working for you get

00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:38,470
you get it by working with for someone

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,669
who doesn't appreciate your work so make

00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:42,039
sure at the extra hours that you're

00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:43,539
putting in are for yourself so if you

00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:45,429
want to write that blog post after

00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:46,720
you're done with your work sure go ahead

00:26:45,429 --> 00:26:48,549
but make sure that you do it for

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,289
yourself if you want to learn that new

00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:51,639
shiny framework that they've been

00:26:50,289 --> 00:26:53,470
talking about at the conference today

00:26:51,639 --> 00:26:54,789
sure but make sure that you actually do

00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:56,320
it for yourself and not because your

00:26:54,789 --> 00:27:00,909
employer expects you to learn about it

00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:02,440
next week so I talked about this I do a

00:27:00,909 --> 00:27:05,289
little bit of volunteer work for the

00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,489
open sourcing Mental Illness group so

00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:08,559
you might want to take a look at their

00:27:06,489 --> 00:27:11,590
their website they have a lot of very

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:14,259
good reference there so I'll leave you

00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:16,090

00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:23,700
