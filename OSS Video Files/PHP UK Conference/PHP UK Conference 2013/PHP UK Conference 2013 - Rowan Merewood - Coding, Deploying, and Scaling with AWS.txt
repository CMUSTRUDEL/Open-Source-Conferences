Publication date: 2013-04-22
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2013
Description: 
	Ten years ago the Amazon Web Services platform was launched and in that time it has dominated and shaped the way cloud computing is viewed. Even after a decade there are still a lot of buzzwords flying around and putting your app in the cloud is often sold as a simple, cure-all solution. So what's really involved? This talk will give you a hands-on walkthrough of building a PHP application stack in AWS. We'll start by deploying a simple Silex application to the Elastic Beanstalk and then add in a selection of other AWS services. This is not a theoretical, text-book session - this is real-life configuration with the cool concepts and tricky hacks that involves.
