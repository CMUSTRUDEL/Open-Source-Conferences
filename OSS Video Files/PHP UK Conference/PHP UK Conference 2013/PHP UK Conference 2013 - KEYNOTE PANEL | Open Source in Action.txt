okay and so what's the focus of this

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:16,370
panel and PHP is a big open source

00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,830
project and we all use

00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:22,560
but if you look at PHP as an open source

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:25,680
system you will find that only maybe 10

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,740
10 to 15 people are actually really

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,360
making a difference to the core of PHP

00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:32,910
they're the people that make things

00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,640
going and move stuff and they're really

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,400
key to it every person on this panel

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,770
today is somebody who has made a real

00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,230
key difference to open source they're

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,760
people who have moved things forward and

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,800
what we want them to talk about today is

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,170
how basically how do we get more of them

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,629
how do we grow more new people how do we

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:55,409
create the right environment for them so

00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:57,540
that's the focus of our panel Jonah okay

00:00:55,409 --> 00:00:59,790
so we're just going to start off and

00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,260
introduce our panelists so we'll just go

00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:05,159
down the line and if you could each give

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:07,260
us a quick 20-second introduction of who

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,920
you are and any contributions you've

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,600
made to PHP community or the open source

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,390
greater open source communities so start

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:19,620
with a role okay cool hi my name is her

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:21,600
all and the contributions I've made well

00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:24,479
I was in the flash world for a long time

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,579
and I found it something called OS flash

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,170
open source flash which was a website

00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:32,009
where a lot of the open source flash

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:34,979
projects originated like red 5 hacks etc

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,810
we can just all came together there and

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,270
I've been involved with open source

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,710
throughout because you know I learned so

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,719
much from reading other people's code

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,750
and from people who shared that I want

00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,280
to give back so I think PHP wise I think

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,189
the most popular thing I ever did was a

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,689
wordpress plugin that I released that

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:54,899
let you I think it was called in line

00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:56,609
posts for putting posts into pages or

00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:57,929
something I still get emails about that

00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:03,420
today I mean I haven't touched it in

00:01:57,929 --> 00:02:06,630
years um yeah I'm Babs Tucker long I

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,130
work for a PHP architect I'm not huge

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,560
into the over source community I have

00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,180
one pull request one successful pull

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,490
request i should say i have a couple

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,560
others that i'm still working on and so

00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,510
not big into that side of it but as a

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,980
PHP architect employee we run

00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,540
conferences and the magazine and we

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,250
teach training courses and so we're very

00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,050
big into promoting open source software

00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:32,750
so we're more on the promotion set

00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:35,300
hi my name is Martine Java so I helped

00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,650
coordinate the global efforts of Java

00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,570
user groups and other volunteers to work

00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,330
on Java itself and also to work on the

00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:44,060
Java Enterprise standards pretty large

00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:47,390
open source project to put it mildly you

00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:49,580
forgot to mention java java I'm Sarah

00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:51,710
Goldman I've been working the PHP

00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:54,410
internals the the runtime in the engine

00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:58,100
since about two thousand two wrote the

00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:59,360
book on extensions and internals kind of

00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,130
been quiet the last five years got

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,420
sucked in the private sector but coming

00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:05,720
back a bit because i'm working on hip

00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,920
hop as well and some SSH library out

00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:11,630
there's all but I really has nothing to

00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:15,100
do with PHP and hi I'm Ian barber I feel

00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:15,100
like I'm on blind date at the moment

00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:24,260
absolu number one and I've been doing

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,600
open source stuff for a little while now

00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:29,330
I've read Sarah's book and ridden a few

00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,040
extensions for PHP and I'm also pretty

00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:33,530
heavily involved with the zero and key

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:46,460
messaging library but if you were a

00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:49,430
fruit what fruit would you be so let's

00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:52,220
kick this off and with a question and I

00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:54,140
I don't want to start at one end so I'm

00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:57,110
going to start with Martin because I

00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:58,490
want to know and what contribution have

00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:00,950
you made to open source that you think's

00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:03,380
really made the biggest difference it's

00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:06,770
actually kind of political in a way so

00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:09,080
our Java user group was the first user

00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,720
group to sit on the Java standards body

00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:14,510
itself which is heavily dominated by

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:18,020
Oracle google investment banks such as

00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:19,700
goldman sachs etc so actually providing

00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,989
a developer's voice for the entire jar

00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,690
of ecosystem has probably been the

00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:28,390
biggest contribution that we weave I've

00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:28,390
made so what about somebody else

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:35,090
go well I'm on right to say go to

00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:39,710
because I'm sort of the one that blamed

00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:41,270
for that one in PHP okay anyone actually

00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:47,000
I did not do the actual commit on that

00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:49,250
one to blame Demetria um but actually no

00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,919
I think probably my biggest contribution

00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,379
was probably my ssh library which has

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,650
since been pulled in curls so that's

00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:59,090
unpretty much every machine in the world

00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,740
okay well well I would actually like to

00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:03,379
mention your book because your book

00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:08,780
cause a huge it was useful here I I read

00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:11,569
my own book from our oh I don't know I'm

00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:14,060
there was a an open source data format

00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:17,719
for flush kind of like JSON but it's a

00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:20,060
swift that was used quite a bit I don't

00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:23,289
know what else gay bar that's Google App

00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:25,550
Engine back up in richmond and restore

00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:27,440
when it didn't have backup and restore

00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:30,949
hey if your google you don't you know

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,599
put backup and restore into your into

00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:35,779
your cloud service i'll call it whatever

00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:40,159
the heck i like if I'm gonna do it for

00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:44,599
you um and yeah I guess I guess though

00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:46,940
um yeah probably probably does they were

00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:52,039
use quite a shot to right now I love it

00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:53,509
I guess Beth oh well that one pull

00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:56,690
request I did I don't think changed the

00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:58,639
world very much no you don't know that

00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:01,400
but i think i think i bought the total

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:07,000
failing tests in web de project from

00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:07,000
like 13,000 down to like 12,000 98 so

00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:15,289
people actually fix here yeah i know i

00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:18,770
think i think actually i've probably had

00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:20,029
more impact going to conferences like

00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:21,860
this and speaking to people and blogging

00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:24,050
about things than the actual kind of

00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,789
code I've contributed so there's more

00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,800
that I've happened to talk to small

00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:29,569
people and they've then themselves gone

00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,169
away and actually implemented sign

00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:33,479
either in PHP or in another

00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:35,520
haha so I'd say yes it's a speaking

00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:37,379
while speaking of blogging problem a lot

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,389
of features have come out of that and

00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:41,099
out of beer bottles yeah oh wait a

00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:43,550
minute I got a better answer for you the

00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:46,949
ex off Twitter engine that was used in

00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:50,819
yeah that was used in Instagram so there

00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:54,029
you go I didn't get a penny but fine

00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:55,620
it's fine I'm not sure it's not bitter

00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:58,110
about with that that's that's mostly

00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,270
matter all of that can you sir I

00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:03,930
described with the ex off Twitter engine

00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:05,610
oh it's just X off is a flavor of Olaf

00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:09,360
which is you know that should probably

00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:11,430
spit when I say that a lot but it made

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,620
oooff easier because you could actually

00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:16,620
just get someone's username and password

00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:19,050
and then get your OAuth token instead of

00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,240
going through the web flow which is

00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,979
horrendous for native apps I mean it

00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,659
works on the web yes because you're not

00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:25,800
changing context but with native apps

00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:27,689
you're actually changing from a native

00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,120
context to a web context and back which

00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:32,969
is a user experience nightmare so when

00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,490
they introduced X off I just implemented

00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:36,750
X off Twitter engine on top of mg

00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:39,089
Twitter engine that mat gamel had

00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,219
created and that got that got used and

00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:43,560
also in Game trains I think which was on

00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:45,599
iOS is fun fun puzzling game puzzle

00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,189
games yeah that's the cool thing about

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,330
open source you make something and then

00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:50,370
people use it for stuff that you've

00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:52,649
never dreamed of you know and that's the

00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:56,339
stats what's so cool about it it is

00:07:52,649 --> 00:07:57,629
because open source you come to be

00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:58,979
something or you put something out there

00:07:57,629 --> 00:08:00,360
you know one has to tell you that I

00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,099
using it yeah and then something that

00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,930
suddenly someone comes up and says yeah

00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:05,189
we're doing you know it's 30 million

00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:09,389
events per second with this oh yeah

00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:11,789
you're doing haha yeah with this oh good

00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:13,259
you did okay because i don't i don't

00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:14,610
like asking permission so i don't want

00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,830
other people to ask permission for the

00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:19,050
stuff that i put out there you know it's

00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,969
and i don't think we would be sitting

00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:22,499
here if it wasn't for open source none

00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:24,749
of us the internet wouldn't be what it

00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:27,149
is you know if Tim berners-lee had kept

00:08:24,749 --> 00:08:29,699
it close to his chest and not opened up

00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:30,689
the protocols and everything it just we

00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:34,039
wouldn't be sitting here none of us

00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:37,979
could have a job are you listening

00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:39,659
what do you guys think that makes open

00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:41,580
source communities successful and what

00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:44,430
makes open source communities maybe not

00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:47,670
as successful or sometimes unsuccessful

00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:49,080
and what should we be doing to do more

00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:51,120
things that are successful how should we

00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,589
be evolving how should things be

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,750
changing for the better in the future

00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:56,420
now all we had an interesting

00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,740
conversation earlier today about

00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:01,080
bringing open source to the consumer

00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,820
space can you tell us a bit about that

00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,279
well it's definitely something that I

00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:07,200
would love to see happen I want to see

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,690
open source succeed in the consumer

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,850
space and I can't really off the top my

00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:14,850
head think of an open source success in

00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:17,370
the consumer space today and I think

00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:21,120
part of the problem is open source

00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:22,830
culture it's not designed lead design is

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,190
seen as a layer it's seen as an

00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:27,839
afterthought it's seen as makeup and

00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,640
Rouge you know it's it's what we add at

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,730
the end we pretty five things at the end

00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,260
and the culture doesn't exist to

00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:36,060
understand the importance of designs so

00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,470
the development processes don't exist

00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:40,589
and the organizational structures don't

00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:43,079
exist in open source to be design led to

00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:45,480
have design at the core and if you look

00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:47,640
at where open source succeeds today it's

00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,730
when geeks are scratching their own

00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,839
itches right it's in operating systems

00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:54,839
when they're used for things like

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,100
servers it's in programming tools where

00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:58,110
we're scratching our own it was

00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,579
scratching your ownage mean it means it

00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,680
means you're the user right you're

00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:05,160
you're making something for yourself and

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,750
hence it will fit fulfill your needs but

00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,520
in the consumer space that's not the

00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:11,100
case we're not building for geeks and

00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:13,680
unless we're design leed we're not going

00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,970
to succeed and I want to see a succeed

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,339
because I don't want a future where my

00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:19,730
only decision is do I give my data to

00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:24,000
Facebook or to Google or to Twitter

00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:27,710
these clothes silos or you know do i do

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,800
I put it all into iCloud on Apple I

00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:32,990
to have an open source solution and that

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,560
has to be the full stack that has to be

00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:38,900
hardware and software that's easy to use

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,810
out of the box I think we need that we

00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:43,430
really need design leed open source and

00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:46,820
that's going to take a cultural

00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:49,130
revolution in order to to to make happen

00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,630
I mean you look at how much Google and

00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:52,070
Android struggled with this exact

00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,720
problem for such a long time and it's

00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:55,880
still struggling with exactly why

00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,890
because when they released android they

00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,630
just said ok and now do whatever the

00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:03,260
heck you like with it no control over

00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:05,390
the user experience whatsoever right and

00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:08,240
and that's when you get that sort of

00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:10,130
crazy fragmentation that crazy

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,750
fragmentation and if you you know there

00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:13,940
is no such thing as Android what is

00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,680
android I don't know it's whatever you I

00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,480
customizations people have made its

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,780
whatever other customizations and when

00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,310
you talk about customizations for

00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:23,870
carriers and for device manufacturers

00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,890
it's basically me it basically means you

00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:27,650
know whatever fuck-ups they've

00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:29,030
implemented there on top of it right so

00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,620
the carrier's it up and then the

00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,550
manufacturers forgive and finally you've

00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:34,160
got something that doesn't even look

00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:36,070
like whatever Google originally intended

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,060
even if they were entirely design-led

00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:40,010
well it's the unfortunate thing about

00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:43,250
that example is getting patches back

00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:44,720
into Android because good to me good

00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,970
open source projects are the ones that

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,770
are completely open the ones that have

00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:50,840
dated going before Sandor isn't

00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:53,930
completely Oh busy that's the thing yeah

00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:55,430
it's open it's an internal project of

00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:57,590
Google that kind of pushes out

00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:59,450
everyone's yeah and I'm my current

00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:01,610
projects guilty of that too I want to

00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:04,550
fix that yeah but but for example with

00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:07,010
Mozilla and the Firefox OS you know

00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:08,840
there's a real chance there for that to

00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:10,970
be that thing but they're following the

00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:13,220
same model they're falling like even a

00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:16,600
worse model in a sense than Android

00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:18,590
because it is entirely open yes but

00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,510
carriers can customize it and

00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:21,950
manufacturers and gusts can customize it

00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:23,420
so they have no control of what's

00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:25,490
actually going to end up in people's

00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:28,880
hands it wasn't it wasn't the point in

00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:30,650
your chemo the design isn't democratic

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,330
it's it needs a villain sing on to

00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,770
illness it's not so it's alan's if

00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:36,050
you're going to have that situation what

00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:37,910
you have is a design load process but

00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:40,310
it's a designer lead process there's

00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:43,130
someone that is making the decisions and

00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:44,870
an open source project clean why you

00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:47,930
know I love pie that I think python is

00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:50,300
elegant but Guido leads that with an

00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:52,850
iron fist in a sense you know and we

00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:55,130
have that already but we need that

00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:57,890
vision to be a design vision for the

00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:59,630
consumer market I think the the thing

00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:00,740
with with those kind of protein ever you

00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:02,300
see a project that's gone through that

00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,430
maturity except projects open source

00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:06,260
projects always start with someone build

00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:07,760
something for whatever reason and they

00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,740
open source and they get other people

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:13,279
involved and then there's a period of

00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:15,200
you know you mentioned 10 to 15 PHP and

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,850
that's probably about right but those 10

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,130
15 people are not the same from you yeah

00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:20,750
yeah and there's a kind of hole backlog

00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:23,240
of people on that and when you get to

00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:25,240
that sustainable point where there are

00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:28,070
rotating groups of people on that the

00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,570
original originator tends to find

00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:31,310
themself in this unit benevolent

00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:35,900
dictator position or this position where

00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:38,240
they are the arbiter of arguments night

00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:40,100
with juice what Rasmus does a lot in PHP

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,540
which has come in and solve arguments

00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:46,339
and family matter she wants to see kinda

00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,900
guess as to yeah I hate to cut across

00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:49,790
you guys because you're also important

00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:52,820
but I want to involve the audience and I

00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:55,190
think we have a question yay further men

00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,930
hired I have a question because concerns

00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:58,610
organization of open source projects and

00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:01,610
do you actually think that there is a

00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:03,560
better one or is there one that's more

00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:06,350
suitable like it's dictatorship more

00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:08,510
suitable for a project than anything

00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:10,580
else because looking at most of the open

00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:12,290
source project except for PHP and it

00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:14,180
doesn't really work that well in PHP is

00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:16,339
the dictatorship actually is pretty good

00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,380
and in open source so what do you guys

00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:20,540
think about that but I'm the benevolent

00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,250
dictator of one large open source

00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:29,600
project called pc gin dungeons and

00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:33,200
dragons yes and works well for me what

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,480
can i what can I say yeah you value look

00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:38,060
at linux as another and as another

00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,860
example without Linus's guiding

00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:41,420
sometimes not so gentle heads I don't

00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:43,580
think Linux would be what it is today so

00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,560
it needs definitely I think in my mind

00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,930
one person or a small group of trusted

00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,970
people to give the project some

00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:52,160
direction any any project in life needs

00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,740
direction if you want it to succeed so

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,680
yeah

00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,610
I disagree slightly with with that that

00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,250
last but I think you're right there

00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:02,250
needs to be a person but it's less to

00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:04,709
give it direction and more to apply

00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:07,230
constraint and cherry-pick so it's

00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:08,580
there's a view and you get what I think

00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:10,320
a lot of projects fail is where the

00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:12,029
original founders no choice to have to

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,680
tighter control and saying must go this

00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:16,380
way like one of the things that works

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,270
with the colonel and works with a lot of

00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:20,610
projects is you have someone that this

00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:22,800
is how it is a lot of other people try

00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:24,149
stuff and then you kind of got yes

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,459
that's right you can guide people

00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:29,040
towards something but it's like choosing

00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:31,649
from the ideas that come in one person

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,959
does not have enough good ideas to

00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:35,130
maintain any sort of substantial open

00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:36,779
source project yeah it doesn't

00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:38,610
necessarily have even one person either

00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:40,230
but there has to be a design vision

00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,880
especially in the consumer space there

00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:44,220
has to be a design vision that you

00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,320
adhere to you can't really cherry-pick

00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:48,450
the vision by definition that's not how

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,580
a design vision works you got to know

00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:52,110
what you're building right and and and

00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:54,029
the beauty of open source is yes people

00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:55,110
can fork it they don't agree they can

00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:56,940
fork it and then you can cherry pick

00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:58,920
from those as long as you're going with

00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,480
that vision yeah so I mean for a

00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,040
consumer products their fault let's take

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,620
a phone let's make an open-source phone

00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,720
that actually competes with iphone right

00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:08,279
you'd have to control the hardware you'd

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,959
have to control the software you'd have

00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:11,790
to control the whole experience you

00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:13,620
could make all of that open you could

00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:16,709
still control it let's call it an

00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:18,450
x-phone you could trade mark that and no

00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,950
one else can make an X phone and call it

00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:21,600
an x-phone right they can call it

00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:23,040
whatever else they want but you can

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,720
control the experience from the moment

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,420
that people open the box they take their

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,190
ex phone out it's / it's open hardware

00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:31,829
open software it's a beautiful

00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:33,630
experience and that's what an X phone is

00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:35,579
right and someone else makes next phone

00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:37,110
you sue them but they can take it they

00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,370
can make a wife owned an x-phone screw

00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:40,200
it up make it better they can do

00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:41,850
whatever but you still have that control

00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,160
and I think that's the only way it will

00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:46,560
succeed in the consumer market I think

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,730
that the challenge with hardware in

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,640
particular and all the things is that

00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:51,690
the change latency is extremely high one

00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,670
of the reasons open source works for

00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:55,920
software is because I can come up with

00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:58,050
an idea and I can try it and especially

00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,180
with with GERD and github and a lot of

00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:02,160
projects like this I can I can commit

00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,930
that and I can have a bunch of people

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,430
try it and I'm very quickly I can

00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:07,930
iterate over ideas and problems

00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,640
hit solutions with hardware you're in a

00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:11,170
much more difficult state there's one of

00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:14,380
the things yeah Apple are very very good

00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:15,400
at is you don't see that the sausage

00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,260
being made there but that's definitely

00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,120
been iterated a lot they would make

00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:22,300
decisions to to go through that nothing

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:24,160
anything open-source in that space is

00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:26,050
challenging which is why we've seen odd

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,640
things like the Raspberry Pi yeah now

00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:29,050
which you know you look at his history

00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,640
and that was it erated that had to go

00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,870
through that the faster you can change

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,760
the faster you can get to the right

00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:35,440
solution but Apple applies that to their

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,910
software components as well you can't

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,820
just go on to the app store and say

00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:42,220
here's an app that does whatever there's

00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,900
this approval process something that has

00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:46,300
been sometimes controversial sometimes

00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:48,280
just a pain in the ass but they're

00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:53,920
exercising that same control do you do

00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:56,830
not find that just aggravating um see I

00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,810
think there's a that's a kind of my

00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:00,820
perspective as an end user of a certain

00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:02,620
artifact of a bit of software as opposed

00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:04,420
to the perspective of someone that might

00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:08,500
want to modify the bitter software so

00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:10,690
it's I can't modify I us is well we

00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,460
can't know but iOS is built on a bunch

00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:15,010
of open source stuff at the same time

00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:20,980
yep thank you I'm check for example the

00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:25,080
ayah and it's a bsd so Sarah we were

00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:28,120
talking earlier today and you had some

00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:31,030
yeah I was there too it was great moment

00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:33,970
so i wasn't i misdoubt know or i wasn't

00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:37,540
there it was just me and sarah law but

00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:40,300
you have some interesting viewpoints on

00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:45,070
what works on the PHP group and what

00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:48,720
doesn't yeah you don't have to talk

00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:51,430
about those easily but can can you guys

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,020
tell us what you think what you think we

00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:55,270
should do differently in open source

00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:57,250
based on your experiences we've been

00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:58,510
talking a lot about of kind what the

00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,580
problems are and whether maybe things

00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:01,900
I've gone wrong and things what should

00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:05,080
we do going forward how should we be

00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:07,540
evolving well i'm gonna i went to harp

00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,610
on something that I've said already up

00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:12,380
here and that is that the more open the

00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:15,930
better period end sentence

00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:18,630
PHP works really well because there's

00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:22,170
almost no barrier at entry to even work

00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:24,330
on it my first exposure to work in the

00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:27,740
Eternals PHP was like you know it's

00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:31,170
stupid that I can only do base 10 and

00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:33,990
natural logarithms off of numbers I want

00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:37,350
to throw an arbitrary face into there

00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:40,410
here's a diff okay great accepted done I

00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:43,740
took the span of a few minutes to

00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:44,700
actually get into that project it

00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,750
probably would've been different today

00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,000
you would have been you know pull

00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:49,980
something for kind of github that sort

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,420
of thing but it was still very open and

00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:54,150
it's still open today if you want to

00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:55,890
work on the PHP internals you just do

00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:57,300
that you just go grab the source you say

00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:59,490
here's something I want to change and

00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:03,330
you just do it but but what if you don't

00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:05,100
have karma that's what github forking is

00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:06,750
for you fork PHP source you put your

00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,780
pull request up there and you say hey I

00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:11,100
think this does what I needed to do and

00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:13,740
I think it'd be useful to other people

00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:16,980
can somebody do a pull on that for me

00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:18,210
and I you know for the first one it's

00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,400
probably just going to be okay that

00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:24,150
looks good let's pull it eventually

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,490
you're going to get karma anyway so try

00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:31,170
the only 10 to 15 people actually commit

00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:32,820
on PHP itself no um so the PHP's kind of

00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:35,040
splitting a few pieces there's there's

00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,570
the engine which actually interprets the

00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,370
scripts in terms of an object and all

00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:40,500
that kind of thing that's probably 10 to

00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:44,130
15 people they're all the rest of it

00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:46,470
which is the balkan has some larger

00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:48,630
number it's not massively larger there's

00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:51,540
well okay there's like 900 people who

00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:54,240
have the karma to potentially do it but

00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:56,370
in practice is probably a couple three

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,340
dozen um it's not much bigger well I

00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:01,590
find that I find that absolutely crazy I

00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:03,180
mean PHP is one of the most important

00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:05,370
programming languages in the world full

00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:06,720
stop and is that few people who are

00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,760
actually taking the time to commit

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,240
backed up yeah but that's that's quite

00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:14,040
purified a quite mature stable project

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,650
that that's the big thing they're making

00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:18,120
incremental improvements so so so is

00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,950
Java and we have about three or four

00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,160
hundred committers on me yeah but you've

00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,160
got

00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:28,010
wait a minute that explains everything

00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:29,720
yes what you'll find very often is that

00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:31,640
these will be bug fixes so somebody will

00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,530
report a bug and then one of those

00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,480
regulars will just see it and fix it

00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:37,370
because they know exactly what effect um

00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,350
actually breaking into a project the

00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:41,660
size of PHP just like breaking the side

00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:43,309
project the size of Java is no small

00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:45,020
task those three hundred people didn't

00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:46,940
just wake up one day and say hey you

00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:48,679
know what I think I see a problem in J&I

00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:51,080
I'm gonna fix that yeah that does take a

00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:52,040
lot of sauce yeah I think one thing that

00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,410
can really help though with the

00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:56,150
community is that we are very focused on

00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:57,830
getting new people involved so we have

00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:59,390
conferences we have user groups we are

00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:01,490
really focused on teaching new people

00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:03,080
and trying to mentor people so I think

00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:05,299
that really helps get people involved

00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,500
because you know as Joanna said what do

00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:08,600
you do if you don't have karma will find

00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,580
someone who has karma yeah well and

00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,410
that's because we had need to get new

00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:15,710
blood in constantly because of that

00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:16,880
spool being so small you know like I

00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:18,770
said I kind of got swallowed up by the

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,330
private sector at one point and just

00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:22,070
wasn't working on PHP at all that's one

00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:26,000
less person that's a significant

00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:28,309
percentage though Marcus measures used

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,750
to be a big contributor he stopped when

00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:35,000
he got married and had a kid and moved

00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:36,110
to Switzerland that's what so I could

00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,400
name other people who just don't

00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:39,110
contribute to the project anymore

00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,929
because their lives have moved on to

00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:43,640
other places like a pc is having trouble

00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:45,140
getting 5.4 compatibility because

00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,360
everyone who understands how that works

00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:50,960
it's doing something else or just isn't

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:53,360
interested in a pc anymore on the top

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,419
community actually and you were saying

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,100
you know what's what's perhaps lacking

00:22:55,419 --> 00:23:00,320
one thing that I've seen I mean of

00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:03,380
course not in our community in general

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,600
but even more so in the open source

00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:09,679
community I've noticed that there is

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:11,960
quite a lack of diversity even more so

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,370
than in technology in general and I

00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,260
don't know why that is but it is

00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:16,760
something that I've noticed and if

00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,980
there's you know one thing that rings

00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:21,860
true it's that communities that have

00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:24,350
greater diversity

00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:27,500
benefit from that in a multitude of ways

00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:29,900
Hunter yeah exactly if you so I think

00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,070
that's sorry but it is a really weird

00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,720
thing because with open source

00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:35,120
development you're not looking at people

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,700
you're you have an email address maybe a

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:40,010
name that you're working with I was only

00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:41,390
known as peeta on the peach felis until

00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:43,250
I actually had to go and get a CVS

00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:45,170
account was I'm just like I don't want

00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,820
to throw my name out there never mind

00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:51,290
that my name translates to check in

00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:55,370
Spanish but you know still it's just

00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:57,230
like you would think there would be more

00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:59,480
opportunity to build up diverse

00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:03,020
populations I have no idea what that

00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:06,140
doesn't happen I think is a bit of that

00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:08,450
way it's just you know the internet is

00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:10,760
full of ourselves and if you do when you

00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:13,250
try and contribute you're there there's

00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,770
some degree of you're going to get mad

00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:18,049
woman editing whatever you're going to

00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:19,460
get a degree of resistance and I think

00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:22,460
if you've dealt with that more in your

00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:24,049
career and you've resulted in going I'll

00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,660
leave it I don't want conflict on this

00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:28,790
you're more likely to to do that an open

00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:31,820
source although that said I have seen

00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:33,650
different types of responses that guys

00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:36,950
get versus different types of responses

00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:38,960
that women get online there's a sort of

00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:41,450
there's a sort of vitriol that I've

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,460
never experienced as a guy online and

00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:45,559
even though I'm very outspoken about my

00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:49,250
views you know I'm pretty opinionated i

00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:51,020
piss a lot of people off and I've never

00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:53,179
gone the kind of things that I've seen

00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:55,520
some women get for just stating very

00:24:53,179 --> 00:24:57,380
mundane views like very you know nothing

00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,480
that's too incendiary or anything you

00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:02,299
know and getting the sort of feedback

00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:04,700
just horrible horrible feedback that

00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:07,850
I've never experienced guy so I think

00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:10,669
there is there is an element there that

00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:14,240
where it does come into play can I just

00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:16,340
I don't we say stop harming no not a bit

00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,630
we got a 10-minute warning and I have

00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:20,270
one last question for you in a minute

00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:24,710
but I just wanted to say something on

00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:27,710
the diversity thing but HP is pretty

00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:29,970
damn good at diversity when I first

00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:32,110
joined I was always made welcome

00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:33,999
admit maybe half the people didn't know

00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:38,590
I was a woman but I never got any I

00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:41,070
never had any trouble look at us with we

00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:44,980
have more women on the stage we have men

00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:46,989
this is this is pretty good and I think

00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:48,850
I know we have an amazing cage few women

00:25:46,989 --> 00:25:50,799
group and people are encouraged and I

00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:52,869
think we should be setting an example

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,369
for the rest of the world I don't

00:25:52,869 --> 00:25:55,720
actually know the answer to this but I'm

00:25:54,369 --> 00:26:01,840
going to challenge you anyway name

00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:03,549
somebody on the team was not white name

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,590
somebody who's not white yeah that's

00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:09,549
pretty hard when I interact over email

00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:11,049
and I are also sometimes you need to

00:26:09,549 --> 00:26:12,489
remember what I talk about diversity

00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:15,179
we're not talking about just one aspect

00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:19,419
that's true yeah when we have i think

00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:20,970
when i run the 2009 test first so we had

00:26:19,419 --> 00:26:25,539
user groups all over the world and

00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:27,159
brazil okay bid user groups big news two

00:26:25,539 --> 00:26:29,169
groups in South America or the user

00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:31,450
population is just yeah but those guys

00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:33,749
are contributing to PHP they wrote

00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:37,179
tested me they were they were great

00:26:33,749 --> 00:26:38,499
anyway I want actually selling right so

00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:42,220
can we we've just got a question from

00:26:38,499 --> 00:26:46,509
rolling over sorry this might be a good

00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:48,789
one to kind of help you guys wrap up I'm

00:26:46,509 --> 00:26:51,340
getting a lot better at contributing my

00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:52,840
own code in the sense that I stopped

00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:57,129
caring about what it looked like and

00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:58,960
just put it on github so I'd like to

00:26:57,129 --> 00:27:02,320
hear about your experiences about

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,970
contributing your own code and what kind

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,649
of gotchas are there about you know

00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:08,409
should I pick a license that kind of

00:27:05,649 --> 00:27:11,889
thing and also what about getting code

00:27:08,409 --> 00:27:13,809
open sourced from work so what kind of

00:27:11,889 --> 00:27:16,600
because that you need to present a more

00:27:13,809 --> 00:27:18,789
professional face there than you do when

00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:21,669
you just throw anything up on your gab

00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:24,639
account that's a good question so first

00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:28,960
off lysis bsd end of story don't touch

00:27:24,639 --> 00:27:30,609
GPL I I don't go say it's bsd but if you

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,109
are totally happy with anyone doing

00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:36,039
whatever the hell they want with your

00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:37,570
coat if you lgpl has some benefits and i

00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:39,519
can see if you're making a library and

00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:41,560
you want to ensure that you have access

00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:43,540
to the changes that are happening some

00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,640
so someone can just type bsd go and do a

00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:47,200
bunch of changes and use it in their own

00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,900
stuff and never ever contributed any

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,730
reason is a PSD and not MIT because I

00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:54,780
find MIT a bit more elegant same brights

00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:58,480
basically unless I'm mistaken it isn't

00:27:54,780 --> 00:28:02,920
MIT non attribution no no its

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:05,440
attribution ok man emoji yeah and

00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:07,600
what about apache that she lost she sees

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,570
good license is Apache too it's got its

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,730
got the committee agent the Peyton it's

00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:14,170
got calls in it which are important if

00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:16,390
you happen to be working for a company

00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:17,740
that cares about patents I shall

00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:23,620
submission i worked for new university

00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:25,690
of california st is kinda like so I open

00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:28,210
sourced a middleware platform at a very

00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:31,150
large investment bank and that's an

00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:33,370
interesting process and that the two

00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:34,900
huge problems are one legal you will

00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:36,640
need to learn to speak Latin and you

00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:38,830
will need to actually teach the lawyers

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,600
what things like copyleft means because

00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:42,370
the whole point of having liz is that

00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,480
they need to fight over a contract and

00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:46,090
the idea of that you're actually trying

00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,710
to share something is completely and

00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:52,630
utterly foreign to them it's like trying

00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:54,910
to share something with a crocodile the

00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:57,400
other huge problem is the sort of

00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:59,410
opening of the firewall as it were from

00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,700
organization all of a sudden this

00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:02,890
investment bank had to think about

00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:05,080
allowing contributions from the outside

00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:06,730
where do we do the hosting who gets

00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,620
commit rights or are they going to see

00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:10,390
our private mailing lists what's going

00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:12,760
on here and it actually ended up

00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:14,230
changing the entire social

00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,030
infrastructure of the whole IT

00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:17,950
department from this one little open

00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:20,500
source project all of a sudden things

00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:22,870
like Jenkins came in all of a sudden

00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,070
things like git and github came in and

00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:25,480
just spread throughout the whole

00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:27,490
organization because they were forced to

00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,620
deal with the outside will so it can be

00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:32,620
a very positive change but be prepared

00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:34,980
to deal with the lawyers and you will

00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,980
not like it

00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:43,649
Shakespeare was right okay um so we have

00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:45,899
just one last kind of wrap up question

00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:47,460
which it's sort of ties into that in

00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:50,159
fact it's very similar to the last

00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:52,590
audience question is what advice would

00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,269
you give and aspiring members of any

00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:57,090
open source community what's the key

00:29:54,269 --> 00:30:00,450
thing that you tell them to do for these

00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:03,720
folks now my first and last piece of

00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:06,690
advice is open source is a social

00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:10,200
activity not a technical activity keep

00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:12,570
that in mind yeah I open source it

00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,100
should be fun like you to be doing it

00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:15,539
primarily because you enjoy doing it

00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,070
because there's always going to be

00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:18,960
something grinding at you or suddenly

00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:21,059
annoying if you don't enjoy it it's

00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:29,340
gonna be very hard to stick with I would

00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:31,350
say to like lovemaking but you should

00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:33,179
enjoy making the contribution not the

00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:34,590
contribution itself because when you

00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:36,059
submit it they're going to tear it to

00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,870
shreds and if you're too attached to it

00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:39,090
you're going to take that way too

00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:41,159
personally and so what you have to do is

00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:43,230
sort of realize that you are

00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:45,299
contributing to a project and what you

00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:46,710
wrote is going to help but maybe not in

00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:48,120
the form you wrote it in and so don't

00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:50,519
get too attached to it how it is and

00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:53,519
just appreciate the fact that you are

00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:55,320
moving things forward even if it's not

00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:58,440
how you originally intended so don't

00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:00,139
take it too seriously well I guess the

00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,759
only thing i can add that is just to say

00:31:00,139 --> 00:31:05,029
share you know don't really care about

00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:07,289
like Rowan was saying don't worry about

00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:09,330
you know are people gonna judge me about

00:31:07,289 --> 00:31:10,379
this code or not if someone fixes it

00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:13,440
that's a good thing that's not a

00:31:10,379 --> 00:31:15,840
criticism you know and we just have this

00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,340
amazing opportunity today and it's it's

00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,750
completely different from a hundred

00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:21,299
years ago you know things have changed

00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:24,419
so much where you know we d we have a

00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:26,490
community built on sharing and I think

00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:28,019
you know not many of us would not be

00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:30,029
sitting here today if that wasn't the

00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:32,570
case I know that I wouldn't be because I

00:31:30,029 --> 00:31:34,379
learned everything that's important from

00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:37,289
things that other people have

00:31:34,379 --> 00:31:38,970
contributed so just share just put stuff

00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:41,039
out there just get a github account if

00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:42,809
you don't have one and put the stuff out

00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,250
there that you write and people will

00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:46,310
improve upon it or they won't they'll

00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:48,740
ignore it who cares share

00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:50,960
you will benefit from sharing not just

00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,940
from the work of others but from the act

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,130
of actually sharing and it will improve

00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:57,590
your code as well if you do that such

00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:59,720
all I can say is just share what you do

00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:03,110
an open source is not just about

00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:05,690
software its documentation is acting bug

00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:07,960
reporting it is good poetry into github

00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:10,760
and it'll work there just fine yes

00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:13,430
someone has recipes on github it's all

00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:14,750
sent yeah and if you put cut out there

00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:16,220
and somebody goes through and cleans it

00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:20,020
up look how much time they just saved

00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:22,040
you come on that's great yeah that's 40

00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:23,090
which will probably not happen by the

00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,160
way it's not how it works you know

00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:26,450
that's the people over people open

00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,890
source there stop thinking wow I'm going

00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:29,360
to get a hundred people helping me on

00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:30,950
this that's not how it works right there

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,260
handful of projects where lots of people

00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:34,700
help out mostly you'll just be getting

00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:38,570
emails from people going how do I make
