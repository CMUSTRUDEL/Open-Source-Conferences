Description: 
	What do you do if you have a single letter Twitter handle and your reply stream is useless due to people misusing and abusing the @ sign, like "I'm @a bar"? Machine learning to the rescue! I will explain how I used ML and a couple of other tricks to build a program that sanitizes my Twitter mentions and will hopefully inspire you to use ML in your own projects.
