Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2013
Description: 
	Modern web applications are using lots of JavaScript to create a fluent and responsive user experience. But if you want to create mashups, load data from many different places or include external widgets into your site, you are quickly running into boundaries because of browser and security restrictions. In this talk you will learn how to create such a JavaScript application from scratch and step by step enhance it with techniques and features, like accessing an external API with OAuth2, embedding external widgets securely or receiving real-time updates through WebSockets and PubsubHubbub. On top of this you will get a glimpse into what developing web applications may look like in the future.
