Title: PHP UK Conference 2013 - Helgi Thorbjoernsson - Cranking Nginx up to 11
Publication date: 2013-04-22
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2013
Description: 
	You may see Nginx as the run of the mill web server, geared towards serving up static files and your language of choice but there is so much more to Nginx than that. Under the hood is a treasure trove of additional features and configurations that can help you take things to the next level. This includes having Nginx talk directly to Memcached / Redis (perfect for APIs, without hitting your application), proxy functionality, GeoIP, Lua in the config, MogileFS file serving, improved headers manipulation, and the less useful yet cool ability to query Drizzle / Postgres directly. This is only the tip of the iceberg. I will take you one a journey to explore the hidden corners of Nginx and show you how to crank it up to 11!
