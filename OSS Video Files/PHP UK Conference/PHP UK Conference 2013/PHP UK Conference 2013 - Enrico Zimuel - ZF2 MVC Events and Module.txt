Publication date: 2013-04-22
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2013
Description: 
	The new architecture of Zend Framework 2 is based on a new MVC design that uses events and modules. In this talk we will show how to build web applications in ZF2 using the SOLID principle (Single responsibility, Open-closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation and Dependency inversion). We will show how to use Events to manage the application flow, how to organize and reuse the code using Modules and how to separate the responsibility using the new MVC design of ZF2.
