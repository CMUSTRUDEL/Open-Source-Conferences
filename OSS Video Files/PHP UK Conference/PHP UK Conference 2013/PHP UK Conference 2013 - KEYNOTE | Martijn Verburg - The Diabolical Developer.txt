Title: PHP UK Conference 2013 - KEYNOTE | Martijn Verburg - The Diabolical Developer
Publication date: 2013-05-09
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2013
Description: 
	The Diabolical Developer has spent the last few years utilising best practices in various languages, following lean/agile techniques, practising software craftsmanship and listening to the likes of Martin Fowler, Derick Rethans and Rasmus Lerdorf.
He's discovered that it's all just one giant hoax and he wants to expose the lies that you've been told your entire careers! This talk is going to change your life - you'll learn practical steps on how to free yourself from the oppressive chains of the industry (and your so called betters) and actually get back to loving development again.

	00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:16,509
what everyone working yeah so I had to

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:22,800
make some emergency adjustments to my

00:00:16,509 --> 00:00:25,570
slides this morning not working no no

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,180
that would help there we go

00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:32,169
so apparently last night you were all

00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:35,289
busy doing this so attention spans may

00:00:32,169 --> 00:00:37,629
not be quite what one would hope first

00:00:35,289 --> 00:00:42,780
thing in the morning but that's okay

00:00:37,629 --> 00:00:48,130
because in true Enterprise tradition I

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:50,320
have a lot of slides so who the hell is

00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:52,540
this guy talking to you

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,550
anyone who bothered to trying google me

00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:58,149
would have realized quite quickly that I

00:00:54,550 --> 00:01:01,030
don't do PHP well I kind of do now

00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:04,390
thanks to one particular person so I'm

00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:09,759
actually one of the enemy I come from

00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:11,469
Java ooh the boobies start already this

00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:16,630
week we've managed to bring you at least

00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:18,280
50 security vulnerabilities which I

00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:22,539
think the PHP community will be quite

00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:24,130
sympathetic towards oh well we'll talk a

00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:26,109
little bit more about Java in fact the

00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:27,789
entire keynote is gonna be about Java

00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:32,529
I'm gonna see how many of you I can make

00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:34,990
leave the room so why am I here if you

00:01:32,529 --> 00:01:39,880
find this lady running around PHP UK

00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:42,039
it's her fault so Zoey taught me PHP

00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,899
about two or three weeks ago we were

00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:48,189
knocking up a quick WordPress website

00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:50,920
for my little Java startup and she said

00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:53,590
ah and Java it'll take you three months

00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:56,740
to build website PHP it'll take me three

00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:58,929
days so I took it up on the challenge

00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:01,060
she indeed knocked up a website for us

00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:03,929
in three days and then she handed the

00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:08,619
code over to me with no documentation no

00:02:03,929 --> 00:02:11,739
explanation no nothing she said PHP is

00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:13,989
so easy to understand so easy to code in

00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:15,160
that you as a big Java Enterprise guy

00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:17,080
should be able to figure this out easily

00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,319
so I took a look at the first bit of

00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,319
code

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:31,170
I mean really really as a statically

00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:34,560
typed language guy being able to do that

00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:36,750
is just horrific it makes me have

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,660
nightmares I showed the code to my team

00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,220
and they ran away screaming

00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,690
we started getting odd little bugs on

00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,780
our website people would be able to

00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,819
enter things like one-point-five

00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:50,129
software units we want to buy because

00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:54,420
there's no type safety it's like scary

00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:55,590
stuff really really worrying so I'm here

00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,220
to try and convince you that there is a

00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,170
better way

00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,390
you don't need to have this dynamically

00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:08,510
typed nonsense you don't have to have

00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:08,510
nightmares anymore use Java that's right

00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:16,200
so if you get imagine PHP as Java you

00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,640
can have nice variables like this so in

00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,500
Java we like to have lots of factories

00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,959
lots of beans lots of XML configuration

00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:26,130
so your code will start to look a little

00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:27,780
bit like this it's quite quite nice Java

00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:29,579
is statically typed therefore it is much

00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,169
much better when we say we are going to

00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:32,280
have a big decimal and we have to have

00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:34,669
big difference because we're very

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,079
enterprise-e we give lots of big numbers

00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:38,819
we say it's a big decimal there's no

00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:42,060
there's a VAR nonsense going on no

00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:46,680
dynamic typing none of that rubbish so

00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:48,989
you can see here 0.2 plus 3 should equal

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,030
3.2 right and Java is definitely gonna

00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:56,299
get this right cuz you know we're

00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:56,299
statically typed and all that maybe not

00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,500
so enough of me trolling you guys about

00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:02,940
Java

00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,930
it won't happen too much more throughout

00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:10,079
the keynote I promise so I have some

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:12,389
rules for this talk first one is is

00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:16,680
there anybody here who is legally under

00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:18,090
the age of 16 in the room no good

00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,109
alright because they should probably

00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:24,320
leave do we have any sensitive Souls out

00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:28,800
there anyone who doesn't like a few

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:32,190
uncouth words shall we say one person

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,460
I'm afraid sir you should probably leave

00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:43,630
to have any agile manifesto people here

00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:45,550
people follow the edge all yes software

00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,780
craftsmanship does that come into the

00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,440
PHP world yet or is that a bit

00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,040
enterprise-e

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,420
we've software craftsmanship here no not

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,060
really okay well they need to live as

00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:57,910
well and there's got to be some of you

00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,810
guys here right Lean Startup ninjas are

00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,480
you iterating it

00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,970
are you iterating it are you iterating

00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,770
it I think you get the idea

00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:09,070
all right good so now that we've set the

00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:10,330
rules we're gonna take you through the

00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:12,610
problem we have in the software industry

00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:16,950
today and that is that we are bound by

00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:20,910
chains of what I call politely

00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:24,669
we have all of these procedures policies

00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:27,880
techniques tools weights and weights of

00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:29,800
tools we have ideas we have building

00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,570
continuous integration servers we have

00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:35,050
cloud deployments we have a

00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:37,120
proliferation of languages did you know

00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:39,580
that there are now almost more

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,370
turing-complete programming languages

00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,950
then there are spoken human languages on

00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:51,040
this planet there's about seven thousand

00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:52,510
of each it's quite scary so I want to go

00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,470
back to the philosophy from this guy

00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:57,910
Steve Ballmer

00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:59,590
and he said one very very fantastic

00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,300
thing is at a very famous keynote where

00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,550
he was throwing chairs around the stage

00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,210
and he was sweating and it was all very

00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:07,650
exciting

00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:11,169
Bill Gates never would have done that

00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:15,930
he's dead on right for what he said and

00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:18,220
that's this it's you guys who met her ok

00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,660
everything all the stuff that happens

00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,580
around you or the fluff or the

00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:24,250
management crap they get to put on you

00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:26,620
all of the tooling all of the people

00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:29,830
trying to sell you books all of the

00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:31,660
techniques at your torts none of it

00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:33,910
matters what really matters is you

00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:36,669
sitting down and creating beautiful

00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:38,710
wonderful things because most people

00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:40,030
forget and this is what I want you to

00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:41,970
tell people who say oh you're a

00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:44,490
programmer you are very boring

00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:47,080
programming is one of the most amazing

00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:51,250
creative things you can do in your life

00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:53,020
it is absolutely wonderful with you and

00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:55,510
a friend and a keyboard you can

00:06:53,020 --> 00:07:00,669
absolutely change the world you can

00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:01,270
create amazing things like Facebook let

00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:03,160
me try that again

00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:07,510
Twitter that's a little bit video right

00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:09,700
so you know software changes the world

00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,680
at topples governments that feeds the

00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:14,710
poor it can also do evil things as well

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,270
it's a mate amazing power of change so

00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,650
Steve Ballmer was quite right when he

00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:21,550
says you know it's all about the

00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:23,680
developers so modern software

00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:25,840
development today again we have all of

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,240
these amazing tools we have all these

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,520
amazing techniques you can go study

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,260
computer science at university you can

00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,860
study for years and years and years and

00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:38,560
if you're really good you will become a

00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,390
list master and grow a long beard and

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,979
wear white robes or if you're one of the

00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:45,220
ladies you'll just sort of float in a

00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:47,650
yoga position so we think we're good a

00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,510
software development today right we can

00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:52,419
do things like in PHP knock out a

00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,740
website in three days yes the rails

00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:59,979
people will tell you about in three

00:07:53,740 --> 00:08:03,070
hours we suck we suck so badly at

00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,790
building software how many people in the

00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:07,240
past year

00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:12,310
actually delivered a project on time on

00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:14,710
budget and with high quality there are

00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:19,270
10 Liars in the room the rest of you at

00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:22,000
least they're honest so I'd like to talk

00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:23,530
a little bit about best practices there

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,210
are lots of best practices in the PHP

00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:28,270
world I imagine you know call your

00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:29,860
variables X make sure that you change

00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:33,040
the type of your variable wherever you

00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:35,169
can make sure the PHP file is at least

00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:38,590
2,000 lines long that sort of thing

00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:42,040
at least from what I've seen best

00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:44,710
practices piss me off right because what

00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:47,980
it actually does is it forces you to

00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:50,260
conform to someone else's idea of what

00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:52,720
they think is right for you and what is

00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,760
right for your code base and you stop

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,290
challenging yourself you stop

00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,410
challenging your teammates because you

00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:01,990
just go oh the fallacy of will appeal to

00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:05,950
the expert some book said this was best

00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:09,070
practices so it must be right aim for

00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:12,790
this aim for better practices question

00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:14,170
everything question why the person in

00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:17,170
the book has told you to do it a certain

00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:20,440
way question why you've been told to

00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:23,020
deploy to the cloud question why we

00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:27,670
should use virtualization because it's

00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:30,370
more flexible hmm talking a little bit

00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:31,840
the agile now all the edge are people in

00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:35,880
the room you can eat refocus are you

00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:39,490
siding funds it is not a silver bullets

00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:44,860
are there any scrum certified masters in

00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:48,610
the room your exits are there there and

00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:53,050
there's one over here scrum

00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:54,910
certification is a pyramid scheme the

00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:57,250
people at the top have made an

00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,990
incredible amount of money off this it

00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:01,240
takes you only two days and I believe

00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:03,550
about 800 to a thousand pounds typically

00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,920
in London to become a scrum certified

00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:07,600
master and in theory you're then told

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,000
you can go and take on the whole world

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,160
you'll run IT projects there we'll be on

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,980
time they'll be on budget and they'll be

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,419
delivered with amazing quality and heavy

00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:20,929
smiling developers

00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:26,539
the reality is no definitely not

00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:29,569
so scrum certification yeah agile has

00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:34,549
always been about eight culture things

00:10:29,569 --> 00:10:38,269
like collaboration over contracts it is

00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:40,339
not a in stone XP programming you must

00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:43,549
be a programmer you must use scrum you

00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:45,619
must use Kanban that was not the intent

00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:48,199
of the agile manifesto at all to start

00:10:45,619 --> 00:10:49,579
with so can all the people who said

00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:53,209
they're agile people put their hands up

00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:54,829
again how many of you actually remember

00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:57,979
what the agile manifesto is keep your

00:10:54,829 --> 00:11:00,609
hands up that's what I thought go back

00:10:57,979 --> 00:11:03,019
and read it people okay

00:11:00,609 --> 00:11:05,119
software craftsmanship now I don't think

00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:07,429
this is something that's happened in the

00:11:05,119 --> 00:11:10,429
PHP community too much which is a good

00:11:07,429 --> 00:11:12,319
thing they tend to wear black robes and

00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:13,999
sort of sway and since around the place

00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:15,889
so if you see them in London it's not

00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:19,039
some new religious cult it's just the

00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:21,619
latest software cult it's an excuse to

00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:24,859
be pretentious so what I'm really trying

00:11:21,619 --> 00:11:28,069
to say is this is all you need to worry

00:11:24,859 --> 00:11:30,529
about okay this is a methodology you

00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:32,749
should be following the code should

00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:34,369
speak the interactions you have with

00:11:32,749 --> 00:11:36,799
your teammates and your peers should

00:11:34,369 --> 00:11:41,479
speak and not some methodology that is

00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:43,639
applied on you from way on hi sorry

00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:47,029
sorry if you told me I should not be

00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:53,079
swearing on stage I apologize still here

00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:56,209
good right so some practical tips oops

00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:58,100
bad code tips for you to break free of

00:11:56,209 --> 00:12:00,709
these chains okay so you've been told

00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:03,019
you must do agile you must do scrum you

00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:07,309
must use this IDE you must use this

00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:09,529
particular best practice you gotta take

00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:11,389
charge and the first thing you've got to

00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:12,979
do is when you wake up in the morning

00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:16,879
you've got a look in that mirror and say

00:12:12,979 --> 00:12:20,689
I am awesome I do one of the most

00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:22,879
kick-ass creative jobs in the world it

00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:25,279
is absolutely fantastic and amazing and

00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:28,489
I don't need other people telling me how

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,079
to go about doing it so rule number one

00:12:28,489 --> 00:12:30,470
you have to be passionate about your

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,510
work

00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:33,950
okay the very fact that you're here

00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:35,450
probably indicates that you're more

00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:37,850
passionate than the average PHP

00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:39,740
developer which is a wonderful thing if

00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:42,560
you don't care about doing software

00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:45,260
development then I mean really sitting

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,690
inside with a keyboard and a computer

00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:49,610
and having your manager changed your

00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:52,100
requirements on you every two minutes is

00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:54,560
not a fun way to lead your life right so

00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:57,440
unless you enjoy the creative process of

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,530
creating software and working with teams

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:03,920
to create beautiful wonderful things

00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:05,030
then go do something else still come

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,710
back to this conference by the way

00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:10,280
because they need your support but go do

00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:12,920
something else you have to defend your

00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:15,260
empire at all costs okay don't let those

00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:18,430
little whippersnapper junior developers

00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:21,860
come in with their fancy ideas all right

00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:23,960
none of us oh we should try Jenkins we

00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,190
should maybe try that live rebel product

00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:30,430
which would make our deployments easier

00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:30,430
no that takes away jobs people

00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:35,750
and in today's recessionary times we

00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:38,460
don't need our jobs taken away so

00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:41,150
remember shell scripts which fail

00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:43,560
regularly are still the way to deploy

00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:45,960
definitely the best way to go and if you

00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,820
can combine some shell with some pill at

00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,950
the same time then you're really winning

00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,380
and those young kids they don't even

00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:56,090
know what pill is regular expressions

00:13:52,380 --> 00:14:00,060
expressions make them run away screaming

00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:02,610
right you need to cultivate an

00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:05,760
atmosphere of telling people what to do

00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:08,850
but not doing it yourself this is a sort

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,460
of a key development management trick so

00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:14,310
certainly things like we should have

00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:16,080
code coverage with PHP unit encourage

00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:18,210
your teammates to golf and do that busy

00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,860
work while you get on with the fun task

00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:21,390
of actually creating the real business

00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,180
functionality and being the hero

00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:26,540
for your team and the hero to your boss

00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:29,700
because remember in recessionary times

00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:33,780
person who adds business value is the

00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:36,630
person who will be kept on in a job make

00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:39,240
sure your abrupt make sure you interrupt

00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:41,010
people all the time you have to ensure

00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,600
that when your managers come and speak

00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:44,880
to you and say how can I take you to

00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:48,300
this meeting you just have to push on

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,490
the side say sorry I'm too busy I need

00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,410
to explain category theory to my

00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:56,090
teammates otherwise the website won't be

00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:59,040
delivered tomorrow very important

00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:00,570
sinking or swimming something else that

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,870
should be taught to all the new people

00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:06,630
coming into your team so for example

00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:10,650
when I was being mentored by Zoey she

00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:13,250
did this extremely well and said so on

00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:19,280
the command line you can type man space

00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:21,750
PHP and that is how you will learn PHP I

00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:23,700
said where do I download the binaries

00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:25,140
from to you know use all of these

00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,300
different plugins and things of

00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:32,190
WordPress she says well you compile them

00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:37,110
from scratch obviously yeah so it's been

00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:40,930
a fun experience mmm

00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:43,660
learn only from yourself Cartman is very

00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:45,370
good at this you don't need to listen to

00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:47,380
all the charlatans out there in the

00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:51,550
industry today there is way too many of

00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:55,300
them must make sure you reinvent the

00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:57,190
wheel okay I believe PHP is some nice

00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,570
frameworks to do web development there's

00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:02,770
something called Zend I believe is that

00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:05,320
correct yeah no anyway writing your own

00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:07,630
web framework is way more fun but

00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:10,720
extends the project out for quite a nice

00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:14,430
few months if you're a contractor this

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,750
is a specially good way to get renewed I

00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:18,880
also like to write my own logging

00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,800
frameworks wherever I go that's another

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,200
good not invented here syndrome thing to

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,050
do it usually takes about two weeks and

00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,370
I'll knock out a good logging framework

00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:29,380
make sure it's tagged based by the way

00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:34,390
tag based logging is good all other

00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:37,360
logging is bad rent over don't read the

00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:40,540
books don't read the blogs don't go to

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:45,730
the community sites the internet is full

00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:50,020
of amazing advice amazing opinions how

00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:55,530
much of it is actually verified this

00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:57,910
much so places like Stack Overflow

00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:59,530
perpetuate this myth that oh we can go

00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:02,560
somewhere and get the definitive answer

00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:04,480
from an expert you just got the

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,390
definitive answer by the person who

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,130
answered first and all the other lazy

00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:10,990
people just click the up vote button

00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:14,230
after us because it's the first answer

00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:19,839
they saw on a screen very very

00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:26,860
concerning I like to say that those who

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:31,030
cannot code teach those who cannot teach

00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:34,570
write books do we have any PHP authors

00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:37,150
here no no one's willing to admit it now

00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:38,830
oh this one over there brilliant so that

00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:40,880
person failed as a teacher and felt as a

00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:43,820
programmer

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,250
but there's one step worse there is one

00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,590
step further than a book author over

00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:54,640
people that you really really cannot

00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:57,320
trust managers that's not a bad answer

00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,880
men yet man it is actually just about as

00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,880
bad but conference speakers conference

00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:06,320
speakers are failed programmers who

00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:07,940
couldn't teach who couldn't complete a

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,430
book because I've got too much ATD

00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:13,490
syndrome going on and they come up on

00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:16,160
stage and they tell you what to do it's

00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:19,400
gotta make you worry doesn't it when is

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:24,650
the last time I actually coded more than

00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:27,200
10 lines of PHP hmm yeah I haven't and

00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,590
Here I am at a PHP conference talking to

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,210
you

00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:36,530
don't trust me so don't trust the Giants

00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:38,870
in your community I had to look up who

00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:41,300
actually a bit of PHP guy called Rasmus

00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:43,870
apparently wicked thanks thanks sexy

00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:48,830
you've helped the Java cause nicely

00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:52,370
people at Zoe etc you've got me very

00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:53,930
very careful the real heroes I think in

00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:56,240
the industry the real heroes there are

00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:59,300
people who actually push us forward push

00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:02,270
your entire community forward as again

00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:05,260
you guys it's the people producing code

00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:09,500
day-in day-out trying out new ideas

00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:12,550
building new libraries figuring out how

00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:17,390
on earth to make XML convert to JSON

00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:20,150
dear lord exploring new concepts like

00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:22,310
the no sequel space trying to make

00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:24,890
themselves their community and their

00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:28,460
technology bitter and it happens quietly

00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:30,620
away in offices and homes and schools

00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:33,830
and universities all around the world

00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:36,620
and yet all the attention is kind of

00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:39,100
focused on war when a book comes out or

00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:42,410
a famous person has put out a blog post

00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:45,860
okay what I would like to see is to see

00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:47,480
all of you producing blog posts all of

00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:50,140
you regularly putting out on Twitter

00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:52,130
what it is you get up to day to day

00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:54,710
because those are the real challenges

00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:57,169
you face the small day-to-day challenges

00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:58,220
more frustrations and that's hopefully

00:19:57,169 --> 00:20:01,610
what you should be sharing with each

00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:02,539
other and not reading some esoteric lied

00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:08,630
out of a book

00:20:02,539 --> 00:20:11,929
which you may or may not ever use this

00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:14,330
kid is awesome why because he's coding

00:20:11,929 --> 00:20:16,610
in isolation that's right

00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:19,100
you don't in today's world want to be

00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:21,010
coding in a team anymore because your

00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:24,039
teammates will stab you in the back

00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:27,110
there will sell you out to your manager

00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:28,399
they will cheats using gets blame to

00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:31,700
make sure it looks like that you

00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:34,669
actually put in all the bugs they'll do

00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:36,409
things like tell their manager ooh look

00:20:34,669 --> 00:20:38,510
at the impact graph I have here on

00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:40,640
github see how much more productive I am

00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:44,690
than my colleague and all they did was

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:47,809
commit some long logs evil so code in

00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:51,620
isolation keep away from teams you only

00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:54,440
end up fighting anyway definitely do not

00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:56,120
talk to the users how many people here

00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:00,919
have got users who actually know what

00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:05,870
they want one I rest my case

00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:08,299
so why bother talking to them on a

00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:10,070
slightly serious note it is better to

00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:12,409
prototype and throw something across the

00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:13,850
wall to them very quickly then to have

00:21:12,409 --> 00:21:16,760
them put out some sort of a

00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:20,270
specification which they will then

00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:22,340
change week on week on week humans are

00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:25,490
very tactile and very visual creatures

00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:27,590
generally speaking and so you need to

00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:30,289
throw them working code or at least

00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:32,270
prototype code as quickly as possible so

00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:34,610
that as end users they can play with it

00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:36,230
and when they play with code when they

00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:38,510
play with the prototype website you've

00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:40,700
put up for them that is when they will

00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:43,520
actually really realize what they want

00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,980
okay it is incredibly difficult for any

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,200
human being to sit down

00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:51,049
arbitrarily open up Microsoft Word boo

00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:54,260
hiss and go ooh what is it my business

00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:55,640
does again it's there's no context there

00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:58,419
they actually need to get their hands on

00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,419
something and use it

00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:04,750
oh and you're smarter than users right

00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:06,910
software industry we will have higher

00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:10,000
IQs therefore by definition they're

00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:15,340
dumber than we are which driven

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:17,620
development very permanent in London at

00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:21,930
the moments the UK just lost its

00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:21,930
triple-a rating go us

00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:31,090
soon we'll be yeah and even more trouble

00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:35,350
so you need to hold on to your jobs you

00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:39,190
need to make sure that you keep

00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:42,490
information to yourself knowledge is

00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:44,260
power today you must make sure that the

00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:47,470
only person who can read the source code

00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:49,630
is you Zoe

00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:51,550
quite helpfully again did this for me by

00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:59,100
naming all of her variables X and the

00:22:51,550 --> 00:23:01,300
code base X x1 x2 x3 x4 Sun and so forth

00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,530
wonderfully concise code by the way I

00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:05,650
mean she certainly wasn't lying on that

00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:10,450
front she will never speak to me again

00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:12,010
after this talk sorry Zoe yes a

00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:14,470
development very important keep

00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:17,290
knowledge to yourself do not write any

00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:20,520
documentation or if you do make sure you

00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:22,960
write it in something like klingon i

00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,370
prefer to use elvish myself coming from

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:30,280
New Zealand where we all learn this as

00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:32,230
part of high school now another key

00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:34,560
point is make sure you take source code

00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:36,880
home away with you so instead of using

00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:39,700
revision control or source control

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:42,960
don't put your code up on github silly

00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:45,970
people take it away on a USB stick and

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,000
if your manager insists absolutely

00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:50,440
insists that you have source control

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,920
just put it in a local file on the file

00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:58,300
system and call it revision one revision

00:23:53,920 --> 00:24:00,000
2 version 3 version 4 visual sourcesafe

00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:03,010
did this very well for years

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,600
fantastic version control system misses

00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:06,520
are one of the reasons why vb6

00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:09,280
developers held onto their jobs for so

00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,570
long there's good stuff

00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,020
so go I want to talk a little bit about

00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:15,340
tolling now well they seem to be roughly

00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:17,890
halfway through my slide deck which is

00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:19,120
good use the golden hammer for

00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,860
everything I think that's pretty

00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:25,540
self-evident because you guys are PHP

00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:27,730
developers after all so in the Java

00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:30,730
world we just used Java for everything

00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:33,630
with a small sprinkling of XML a few

00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:35,830
thousand lines or so it's quite nice

00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:41,080
does anyone here actually had to code

00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:42,910
Java well holy crowds and have you all

00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:46,150
converted to PHP because you just hated

00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:47,590
Java pretty much or was it just the XML

00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:50,470
configuration that finally made you give

00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:53,380
up cool so use the golden hammer for

00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:58,390
everything wonderful wonderful way to go

00:24:53,380 --> 00:25:06,280
this is my golden hammer anyone here use

00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:08,470
Emacs get out how very dear you home

00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:12,850
believer and I saw someone tweet today

00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:15,970
going oh my god NetBeans 7.3 has come

00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:20,290
out it's the best PHP IDE ever I'm

00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:24,850
stucked on a humble person down and give

00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:27,010
them a copy of I why is the only the

00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:30,010
only is that you can ever rely on and

00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:32,080
why because at 3 o'clock in the morning

00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:35,530
when you have a production problem and

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:38,830
you log on to that remote server what do

00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:41,020
you get you don't get NetBeans you don't

00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:42,850
get eclipse you sure as hell don't even

00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:47,470
get next window you just get this little

00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:50,170
flashing green cursor mocking you daring

00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:51,610
you fix me fix the production problem

00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:53,470
while the manager is screaming at me at

00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:56,110
3 o'clock in the morning after I've been

00:25:53,470 --> 00:26:00,550
to PHP UK and had one beer too many last

00:25:56,110 --> 00:26:02,980
night this this is your friend learn to

00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:04,630
use it learn to use it well and you will

00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:07,360
look also more elite in front of your

00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:08,470
colleagues who will tell your boss and

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,010
you'll keep your job

00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:13,480
cool so gooeys are evil command line is

00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:16,150
what all the leaked hexes should be

00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:18,310
using by the way most of the so-called

00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:20,710
elite hackers I've talked to who work

00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:22,020
for organizations the shadowy Anonymous

00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:23,970
and people like that

00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:25,520
don't actually use command lines they

00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:29,850
just sort of double-click on scripts

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:33,059
said you need to make sure that you have

00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:36,510
a room to Codan who here isn't some sort

00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:38,850
of crazy open plain office do you

00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:41,910
actually ever get any work done no

00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:44,480
exactly right so open play it officers

00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:47,580
and this is again coming from the dumb

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,500
school of uber agile Capital Area

00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,809
dwellers like to call it we need to

00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:55,110
collaborate more what we will do is take

00:26:51,809 --> 00:26:58,110
a very skillful highly logical highly

00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:59,820
creative task and will make people do it

00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:04,350
and in an environment which is more like

00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:06,170
a rock concert go create really high

00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:10,070
quality stuff in that environment people

00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:15,059
yeah so make sure you get a room

00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:17,520
preferably a nice dark room again I'm

00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:19,679
showing my prejudices slightly here so

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,030
coming from New Zealand again we're

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,270
starting to build little hobbit holes

00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:26,190
for programmers can I tell you what they

00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:28,620
work a treat because you have that nice

00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:30,750
little kitchen and as long as Dwarfs

00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:33,750
don't come you know charging in aka

00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:37,260
managers yep you're generally pretty

00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:39,179
happy sunlight is a curse it just shines

00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,230
off your screen and and you can't see

00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:42,540
what you're doing any more horrible

00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:43,770
stuff I think that's why there are so

00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:47,490
many programmers in London actually

00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:50,120
there's just no Sun here ever you need

00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:52,770
to have at least one gaming console and

00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:55,530
no I don't mean your Android device or

00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:58,610
your little iPhone okay you need to go

00:27:55,530 --> 00:28:01,440
back you need to have as it expectrum 80

00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:03,059
maybe an old Nintendo console if you

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,390
want to be a little bit retro which is

00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:09,300
quite an at the moment

00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:13,080
why because programming is a creative

00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:17,070
activity you cannot sit in a boring

00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:19,020
corporate office and be inspired you

00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:21,150
don't see artists sitting in a corporate

00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:22,620
boring office to do their artwork you

00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:25,740
don't see poets doing it you don't see

00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:28,860
writers doing it programming is actually

00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:30,360
a very similar creative activity you can

00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:32,669
go out and see lots of studies done by

00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,830
smart people at MIT and all that in

00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,850
Cambridge and Oxford which actually

00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:38,430
shows the brain it

00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:41,970
of people who are doing art and music

00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:44,940
and mathematics and programming very

00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:46,110
very similar brain activity so the sorts

00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,180
of thinking you do

00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:49,700
despite the reputation that we have of

00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:53,700
being a very logical

00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:55,050
community a very logical profession we

00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,000
actually actually incredibly creative

00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:59,880
and so you need to surround yourself

00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,850
with creativity gaming consoles are

00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:05,210
certainly one way to do that Google has

00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:09,060
probably taken this to slight extremes

00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:10,700
anyone here from Google it's like a

00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:13,110
kindergarten in that place it's

00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:15,540
unbelievable so I can't believe you get

00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:22,320
worked on all the shiny toys it's very

00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:25,260
cool this is really important this is my

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:28,590
auntie manager device so I have two

00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:30,900
rearview mirrors on my my monitor and

00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:34,680
anytime I see a manager coming within

00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:37,500
about you know five meters I get up and

00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:40,260
go talk to a colleague or go make a

00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:43,920
coffee or just wander outside and wait

00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:45,060
till the manager goes away so I was

00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,650
contracting at one of these big

00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:49,520
investment banks about three or four

00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:54,320
years ago very soul-destroying stuff

00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:59,010
converting Java to XML XML back to Java

00:29:54,320 --> 00:30:01,470
Java to JSON JSON back to Java really

00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:07,170
fun stuff I did not speak to my manager

00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:09,150
in six months thanks to these guys it

00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:11,580
was so good in fact that it was that

00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:12,720
clearly a three month contract and they

00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,080
just kept me there for another three

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,780
months

00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:17,630
why because my manager could never find

00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:22,230
me to get rid of me

00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:23,970
brilliant talking about source code a

00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:27,150
little bit now here is a lovely little

00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:28,830
diagram of the amount of Java you need

00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:30,900
to write to do some logging or some

00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:34,860
basic translation of you know Java dick

00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:36,600
smell again this is closure and if you

00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,040
can't see the closure graph there's a

00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:42,750
reason for that because it takes about

00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:44,070
three lines of closure to do anything do

00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:46,740
people actually know what closure is by

00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:49,820
the way half not okay do people know

00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:54,769
what lispers yeah so closure

00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:56,809
the lisp on the JVM on Java and even the

00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:59,389
ascended list masters say that closure

00:30:56,809 --> 00:31:01,369
is lisper done right so it might be

00:30:59,389 --> 00:31:03,169
worth checking out you do have to get

00:31:01,369 --> 00:31:04,960
used to the fact there is a million open

00:31:03,169 --> 00:31:08,869
brackets and a million closed brackets

00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,789
but if you have the right editor vai and

00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:11,960
actually nicely rainbow colors that for

00:31:10,789 --> 00:31:14,479
you so you're all okay

00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:16,909
so source code is very very important

00:31:14,479 --> 00:31:19,309
it's the only true source of anything in

00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:22,639
a software project documentation but

00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:25,059
rots commit messages are usually lies or

00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:31,009
contain lots of swear words in my case

00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:36,769
saying why why why PHP why source code

00:31:31,009 --> 00:31:39,200
is king only use one file now in Java we

00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:42,019
have this concept that Java is nominally

00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,989
an object orientated language it sort of

00:31:42,019 --> 00:31:46,309
is it doesn't truly but it's the myth is

00:31:44,989 --> 00:31:47,539
out there now so we just keep

00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:52,609
perpetuating it because it's popular

00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:53,989
right so we typically like to put source

00:31:52,609 --> 00:31:55,879
code in lots of different what we call

00:31:53,989 --> 00:31:57,320
class files and every class file

00:31:55,879 --> 00:32:01,129
represents a different type of object

00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:03,109
and in Java this proliferates we have

00:32:01,129 --> 00:32:05,539
thousands of these things and even a

00:32:03,109 --> 00:32:08,359
small project and I've seen this

00:32:05,539 --> 00:32:10,549
creeping over to PHP so Zoe for some

00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:12,649
reason had this really nicely modulized

00:32:10,549 --> 00:32:14,450
PHP code that she handed over to me and

00:32:12,649 --> 00:32:16,940
everything wasn't kind of these well

00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:20,119
named distinct files little PHP

00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:24,080
functions is nicely split off I couldn't

00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:26,179
find anything especially when you're

00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,279
using via it's quite frustrating my grip

00:32:26,179 --> 00:32:30,229
isn't that good and I couldn't find

00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:32,450
anything so what I've done is I've

00:32:30,229 --> 00:32:36,529
merged all of those PHP files into one

00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:40,460
giant PHP file and it's about 14,000

00:32:36,529 --> 00:32:42,830
lines long and it's fantastic because on

00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:46,309
my Mac I could just say Apple F and I

00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:49,220
can find anything it's brilliant so go

00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:51,049
back to using a single source file it's

00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:54,669
much easy to use in an editor such as

00:32:51,049 --> 00:32:58,159
via as well good times

00:32:54,669 --> 00:33:00,980
who here design sort of architectural

00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,659
layers you know three-tier architectures

00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:04,519
do we have any of those

00:33:02,659 --> 00:33:06,169
there is a bit of a dirty rumor going

00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:09,950
around that PHP is just basically one

00:33:06,169 --> 00:33:12,139
layer because in Java we typically have

00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:16,340
at least nine because we enterprise you

00:33:12,139 --> 00:33:17,960
like that we like LS please please

00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:21,889
please do not fall into the trap that

00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:23,989
our community has Java is horribly

00:33:21,889 --> 00:33:27,580
infamous for over architecting the

00:33:23,989 --> 00:33:30,109
living daylights out of everything I

00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:31,519
took a look at one crud system the other

00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:33,559
day and it was just a very simple

00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,649
payroll system and they just had to save

00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:39,470
a single staff member down to a typical

00:33:36,649 --> 00:33:43,039
my sequel database there were nine

00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:48,109
layers in between nine layers can you

00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:49,909
imagine it so please don't do that hit

00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:51,979
the database directly from the webpage

00:33:49,909 --> 00:33:56,179
that's the way to go you guys do that

00:33:51,979 --> 00:33:58,879
already no problem we like to talk about

00:33:56,179 --> 00:34:02,330
the single responsibility principle in

00:33:58,879 --> 00:34:06,830
Java or in software craftsmanship have

00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:08,450
people run across this term so again

00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:10,099
you'll see the people with the black

00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:11,569
robes swing the incense

00:34:10,099 --> 00:34:16,190
they'll be chanting this like a

00:34:11,569 --> 00:34:18,919
Gregorian chant SRP SRP and the

00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:21,079
principle basically is this your

00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:24,849
function should do one thing and one

00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:26,899
thing wealth seems reasonable doesn't it

00:34:24,849 --> 00:34:29,299
yeah up to people who adhere to that

00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:30,980
sort of coding style functions should do

00:34:29,299 --> 00:34:33,200
one thing one thing well they should be

00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:35,389
named well they should only try and

00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:38,119
return one thing these sorts of basic

00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:39,919
rules so in the jar of the world we talk

00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:41,809
about our classes our objects should do

00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:43,639
one thing one thing well our methods

00:34:41,809 --> 00:34:45,669
which is synonymous with your functions

00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:49,730
should do one thing and one thing well

00:34:45,669 --> 00:34:52,129
what a load of nonsense because you know

00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:55,809
what happens you get function

00:34:52,129 --> 00:34:58,460
proliferation they breed like rabbits

00:34:55,809 --> 00:35:00,410
you end up having thousands and

00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:03,410
thousands of little tiny functions all

00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:06,079
over your PHP code and you can't find

00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:08,809
anything and you end up repeating your

00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,799
code all over the place because I'm sure

00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:11,539
I did that little piece of string

00:35:09,799 --> 00:35:13,849
manipulation in the function somewhere

00:35:11,539 --> 00:35:16,040
but out of the fifteen hundred functions

00:35:13,849 --> 00:35:17,900
I have in my one giant source file

00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:20,510
I can't find it so you know what I'll do

00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:24,740
helped us write a new one copy and paste

00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:26,600
off Stack Overflow jobs done so what you

00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:29,750
really want to do is have what I call

00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:32,900
multiple responsibility principle and

00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:34,550
it's going to be a new sort of software

00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,960
methodology that I'm going to promote so

00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:41,060
if anyone wants to join me in the course

00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:43,130
I'll be having a MRP org and basically

00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:45,680
not only should you have all of your PHP

00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:51,170
code in one file it should all be in one

00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:53,330
function and one of the reasons why is

00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:56,690
because humans are incredibly good at

00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:59,900
reading things procedurally very good at

00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:02,660
reading flowcharts so going step a step

00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:04,970
bees dip sees dip see all these an if

00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:08,030
condition will hop out to one side e if

00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:10,460
G we come back so on and so forth you

00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:12,260
can show that to any five-year-old child

00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:15,200
even younger and they will usually

00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:18,560
understand it this is the reason why

00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:20,420
Visual Basic 6 was one of the and still

00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,450
remains most popular programming

00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:25,010
languages on the planet because it spoke

00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:26,720
to the average human being who

00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:29,900
understood flowcharts understood

00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:32,900
procedural programming and you'll find

00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:35,300
that despite all of the people who claim

00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:37,100
they are functional programmers or claim

00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:39,740
that our object orientated programmers

00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:42,050
take a really careful look at the source

00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:43,730
code you will find more often than not

00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:49,000
that the code you write is actually

00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:52,070
procedural code try the PHP to vb6

00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,870
converter try it one day and see how

00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:56,150
much your code actually really changes

00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:59,470
you will probably be horrified quit your

00:36:56,150 --> 00:37:04,190
job immediately and go do something else

00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:05,480
copy and paste is okay I don't think I

00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:07,790
need to tell anyone the audience that

00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,680
actually there's a bit of a movement and

00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:11,870
the software craftsmanship will at the

00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:15,290
moment saying that copy and paste should

00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:18,680
be banned there priests have actually

00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:20,660
gone into ideas and disabled copy and

00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:22,970
disabled paste I kid you not they do

00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:24,980
this in workshops this is unbelievable

00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:27,260
they say everything should be

00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:29,600
handcrafted from scratch you should

00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:32,240
always know what your intent is what you

00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:37,670
going to be building when you copy and

00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:40,100
paste you are being lazy rubbish copying

00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:41,600
pasting is the fastest way to code the

00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:46,310
fastest way to knock together a

00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:47,780
conference presentation I'm gonna be in

00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:53,750
so much trouble and copyright notices

00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:55,340
with this talk idea right so we've

00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:58,910
talked a little bit about the chains

00:37:55,340 --> 00:38:00,920
that bind us so some of the tools some

00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:03,200
of the methodologies agile software

00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:05,750
craftsmanship all these horrible things

00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,820
and we've talked a little bit about how

00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:11,030
we can break free of these chains how to

00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:13,670
dodge your manager how to avoid the

00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:16,280
scrum certification pyramids how to make

00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:19,130
sure to use vai put a real source code

00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:22,730
into one file all good useful practical

00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:24,320
stuff you can take away I by the way

00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:27,140
would like to challenge you to send out

00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,820
some tweets about these pills of wisdom

00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:30,890
and see whether it actually really

00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:33,800
propagates across the PHP community I'd

00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:35,720
love love to see if it works so we're

00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,160
going to talk about some of the really

00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:40,250
modern things that are starting to come

00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:43,340
into the industry some of these I guess

00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:45,560
topical points areas of technology or

00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:49,970
areas of methodology that we are

00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:53,240
expected to adhere to today and the

00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:55,190
overwhelming message is that if you

00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:57,470
don't if you don't keep up with the

00:38:55,190 --> 00:39:01,490
Joneses if you don't keep up with the

00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:03,860
future the bleeding edge you will go the

00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:05,930
way of the dinosaur and some young

00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:10,400
faster programmer fresh out of

00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:13,310
university with the PHP 5.5 beta manual

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:15,920
in his hand or her hand will take your

00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:18,290
job away from you take your mortgage

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,180
away from you and the next thing you

00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:22,520
know is that you'll be coding Visual

00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:25,070
Basic 6 and some lonely office and

00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:31,280
microsoft somewhere said times for

00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:33,590
everyone so let's talk about cloud who

00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:38,750
here is developing applications in their

00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:40,610
cloud isn't that interesting you would

00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:42,540
think by the tech media and you would

00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:45,810
think by the conferences and the

00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:50,250
out there today that everybody is on the

00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:51,630
cloud now I saw about roughly eight to

00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:54,380
nine percent of the audience say they

00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:56,880
were genuinely doing stuff in the cloud

00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:58,350
so that's really interesting and I've

00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,710
been asking this question for the past

00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:05,040
four or five years and every year it's

00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:07,260
about the same percentage the whole

00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,160
cloud thing is a bit of a fallacy it's a

00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:11,130
bit of a myth

00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:15,270
if you've ever fired up a virtual server

00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:19,740
that is not sitting on the box under

00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:22,590
your disk you are in the cloud so I mean

00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:27,720
it's the hype around that is certainly

00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:31,080
quite interesting so myth that is a lot

00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:33,390
of to say about cloud if you really have

00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:37,050
to go to the clouds you need to research

00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:38,880
all of its limitations there are some

00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:40,860
really horrible horrible lessons that

00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:49,910
people have learned the hard way hello

00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:53,190
Twitter things like Amazon will go down

00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:54,990
regularly so if you really want to have

00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:56,970
high availability in the cloud for

00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:57,990
example you need to make sure that

00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:59,940
you've split your code between

00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:03,210
virtualized servers or virtualized data

00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:05,180
centers in Amazon and outside of Amazon

00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:08,010
so it may be something on East Coast

00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:10,200
maybe some small little isp sitting in

00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:12,800
Germany or the UK maybe something else

00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:15,390
in South Africa just to be really sure

00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,940
then you get really fun problems like oh

00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:19,320
how do i distribute my data across all

00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:21,660
of these data centers so there's

00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:24,600
effectively a master copy in all of

00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:27,540
these data centers I know I'll use one

00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:31,890
of these no sequel solutions and now you

00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:34,830
have two problems let's talk about

00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:38,160
mobile who here's doing mobile

00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:40,020
development oh I thought I was going to

00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:42,630
be cruel here how on earth are you doing

00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:45,600
mobile development with PHP I have to

00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:49,230
ask because Android doesn't support PHP

00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:51,710
natively as far as I'm aware apple sure

00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:55,430
as hell doesn't support PHP natively

00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:55,430
objective-c is the way to go

00:41:55,460 --> 00:42:00,720
unfortunately the days of being a

00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:03,870
successful mobile developer is already

00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,130
over so that of all the people who held

00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:07,110
their hand up doing mobile development

00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:10,110
how many of you have made millions off

00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:12,210
it no because you're sitting here in a

00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,810
PHP conference if you had made your

00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:15,090
Millions

00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:16,980
you'd be hosting your own PHP conference

00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:19,890
and would all be in the Bahamas it would

00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:22,410
be wonderful time so the reality is

00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:24,180
today that unfortunately already the

00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:26,940
very large software studios and the

00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:30,210
large game studios have completely taken

00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:31,800
over the mobile space they put in multi

00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:33,510
million or multi hundred thousands of

00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:36,450
pound budgets into the top paying

00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:38,430
applications and it's very very

00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:40,230
difficult for an individual developer or

00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:44,610
a small studio or a small group of

00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:46,710
individuals to make a big impact look at

00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:48,540
the research you have more chance of

00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:50,880
winning the national lottery ticket here

00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:55,470
in the UK than you do of making it big

00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:57,960
in one of those app stores so if you're

00:42:55,470 --> 00:43:00,150
going to build a mobile app for for fun

00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:02,370
or for profit then you might want to

00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:04,260
take the rose-colored lenses off and

00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:07,800
take a very very careful look at the

00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:09,690
space sure it is fun however for you

00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:14,700
personally it may not be all that

00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:15,810
profitable so me if a PHP unfortunately

00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,730
you're not really allowed to anyway

00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:19,850
someone pricked me after the keynote if

00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:27,630
I'm wrong

00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:31,530
now SQL who here is

00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:35,430
using MongoDB there's a web scaling for

00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:39,600
you it's not really web scaling for us

00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:42,810
very well it's been okay Derek if he's

00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:45,860
here in the crowd has very kindly been

00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:50,670
patching the PHP driver bugs for us her

00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:53,940
just about every week no sequel is an

00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:57,840
incredibly immature space and has

00:43:53,940 --> 00:44:01,080
several problems one is there's no

00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:02,410
documentation to the drivers tend to

00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:04,809
suck

00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:09,099
three they store everything either as

00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:13,809
binary blobs or as JSON for has anyone

00:44:09,099 --> 00:44:16,599
tried querying one of these things so my

00:44:13,809 --> 00:44:19,869
favorite story comes from a no sequel

00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:20,950
solution called react or ryuk it's

00:44:19,869 --> 00:44:23,940
fantastic

00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:27,280
it does master master replication it's

00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:29,799
incredibly fast there is a company

00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,410
called crux Digital which actually

00:44:29,799 --> 00:44:35,380
replicates data more data than Twitter

00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:37,030
has ever had as a daily peak every

00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:39,970
single day they replicate across the

00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:44,160
world syndicator works like an absolute

00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:47,890
charm there's only one small problem in

00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:52,839
order to query it you have to write a

00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:55,510
MapReduce and Erlang so we took a look

00:44:52,839 --> 00:44:58,059
at and we went cool did most of

00:44:55,510 --> 00:45:00,609
the stuff we expected it to we got it in

00:44:58,059 --> 00:45:02,530
there we're all excited and then my

00:45:00,609 --> 00:45:04,059
finite field director said cool our

00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:06,609
customer data is now on this cool

00:45:04,059 --> 00:45:10,299
replicated MongoDB thing how do I get

00:45:06,609 --> 00:45:13,059
the data out now I was like huh boss all

00:45:10,299 --> 00:45:14,380
you have to do is write a bit of JSON to

00:45:13,059 --> 00:45:16,480
query the database and you can get the

00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:18,400
data out and he just gave me that

00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,809
thousand-yard stare and said did you

00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,809
just tell me to go and myself

00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:29,799
and I set back and I thought yeah I

00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:31,480
think I pretty much just it so it gets

00:45:29,799 --> 00:45:35,710
what our company is doing right now yep

00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:37,930
we're writing a sequel like interface on

00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:40,150
top of MongoDB so our poor business

00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:43,210
people have actually got some hope in

00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:46,240
hell of getting data back out so be very

00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:49,329
careful is no sequel because sometimes

00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:50,589
things like this happen by the way if

00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:58,180
you haven't seen the website already

00:45:50,589 --> 00:46:00,789
only had one job com is fantastic so you

00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:02,920
should get rid of the fluff and there's

00:46:00,789 --> 00:46:06,160
gonna be sort of my last key key key

00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:09,339
points you want to get rid of things

00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:11,799
like testing get rid of test team don't

00:46:09,339 --> 00:46:14,349
need them get rid of documentation

00:46:11,799 --> 00:46:16,009
nobody's going to read the 60 page Word

00:46:14,349 --> 00:46:18,809
document you wrote anyway

00:46:16,009 --> 00:46:21,089
get rid of source control get rid of all

00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:23,789
the extra hosting servers get rid of the

00:46:21,089 --> 00:46:25,529
business analysts because they're just

00:46:23,789 --> 00:46:26,759
the middle person between you and the

00:46:25,529 --> 00:46:30,469
customer and the customer doesn't know

00:46:26,759 --> 00:46:33,059
what they want anyway don't need those

00:46:30,469 --> 00:46:35,670
this one should be popular get rid of

00:46:33,059 --> 00:46:38,400
the project managers down with the

00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:38,999
managers how many project managers in

00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,059
the room

00:46:38,999 --> 00:46:44,579
Oh two people admitted the whole project

00:46:42,059 --> 00:46:45,690
minutes well either Finn they're just

00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:49,709
about everyone else anyway so that's

00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:52,799
fine so get rid of the fluff source

00:46:49,709 --> 00:46:54,119
control you don't need it again keep the

00:46:52,799 --> 00:46:56,670
contents on your local Drive

00:46:54,119 --> 00:47:01,440
take it away on your USB stick keep your

00:46:56,670 --> 00:47:03,239
job safe keep your job secure some

00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,180
companies go to quite nice extremes

00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:08,309
actually Microsoft is very good at this

00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:10,799
they don't let anyone have access to the

00:47:08,309 --> 00:47:12,180
source code you only ever get binary

00:47:10,799 --> 00:47:16,140
there's no such thing as open source

00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:18,029
know that namby-pamby stuff so consider

00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:20,729
going close source for your application

00:47:18,029 --> 00:47:22,979
development keep your source closed from

00:47:20,729 --> 00:47:24,959
your teammates if they want to have your

00:47:22,979 --> 00:47:26,910
source code say no this is a closed

00:47:24,959 --> 00:47:32,670
source piece of code overran here's your

00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:36,479
binary enjoy ignore the underlying

00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:37,920
platform you guys just use a patch in my

00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:39,690
sequel anywhere right it's all pretty

00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,699
standard so don't worry about

00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:44,309
understanding how Linux works or how

00:47:41,699 --> 00:47:46,559
virtualization works don't worry about

00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:48,509
how the PHP runtime works you don't need

00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:49,890
to know that really smart people have

00:47:48,509 --> 00:47:53,039
taken care of that for you and it will

00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:54,630
never ever go wrong will it no so it's

00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:56,039
completely fine so ignore that

00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:58,469
underlying platform because otherwise

00:47:56,039 --> 00:48:01,650
you spend a lot of time having to read

00:47:58,469 --> 00:48:03,989
Linux manuals and read man pages and

00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:06,839
you're not coding PHP which is what we

00:48:03,989 --> 00:48:10,039
what you love to do right so ignore that

00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:14,839
fluff that's fun continuous integration

00:48:10,039 --> 00:48:16,949
I think is an absolutely fantastic thing

00:48:14,839 --> 00:48:19,349
we're always continuously integrating

00:48:16,949 --> 00:48:21,029
our code every time I you know add a few

00:48:19,349 --> 00:48:22,410
new lines of code or a copy and paste

00:48:21,029 --> 00:48:24,959
something from Stack Overflow I'm

00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:26,940
integrating it to my one source file so

00:48:24,959 --> 00:48:28,210
I don't really see what this whole CI

00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:32,530
buzz is all

00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:34,660
about continuous integration also goes

00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:37,030
away when you have a single source file

00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:38,820
in your team because only one developer

00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:41,020
can edit that one source file at a time

00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:43,480
which gives all the other developers

00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:45,970
time to you know spend time designing

00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:48,730
things on the whiteboard having sword

00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:50,109
fights on their wheelchairs doing that

00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:54,070
sort of creative thinking that our

00:48:50,109 --> 00:48:58,780
industry needs this is at least what we

00:48:54,070 --> 00:49:01,390
tell the project managers small serious

00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:03,609
notes the one thing that did frustrate

00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:05,230
me about the whole PHP space initially

00:49:03,609 --> 00:49:06,849
until I started learning more about what

00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:08,589
tooling is out there is that it's a

00:49:06,849 --> 00:49:10,690
little bit immature in the terms of

00:49:08,589 --> 00:49:13,930
hauling around building deployment at

00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:16,210
the moment and I haven't tried the stuff

00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:19,150
out personally but it looked interesting

00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:21,310
so go go take a look and see if you can

00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:22,900
boost your productivity and see if you

00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:24,660
can actually get your stuff out more

00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:28,330
quickly and don't have to worry about

00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:29,740
the underlying platform so much we've

00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:31,630
been actually doing this in the Java

00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:33,369
community for years we're really really

00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:36,430
good at ignoring the underlying platform

00:49:33,369 --> 00:49:43,869
the whole write-once debug everywhere

00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:46,300
promise basically if the syntax

00:49:43,869 --> 00:49:48,700
highlighting and Vie says that your PHP

00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:52,660
is good to go then the damn thing is

00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:55,560
good to go ship it get it out there and

00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:58,180
I'm quite serious about this remember

00:49:55,560 --> 00:50:00,490
users need to see your code as soon as

00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:02,080
possible and that includes the other

00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:06,250
members in your development team they

00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:08,650
are the users of your software get it

00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:11,410
out to them really really quickly what's

00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:13,920
bugs good things bad things everything

00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:16,960
the sooner you get code out to people

00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:19,240
the sooner discussions happen the sooner

00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:21,220
refactorings happen the sooner people

00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:24,670
realize what the real requirements

00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:26,410
actually are and the more time you can

00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:28,359
also spend putting in more easter eggs

00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:30,550
into your code base as well which is

00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:32,400
always fun so when the syntax

00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:35,170
highlighting says you're good to go

00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:40,270
get it out there

00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:41,500
I personally commit to github probably

00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:42,970
when I'm actually coding which

00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:45,660
sadly isn't as often as I'd like anymore

00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:48,190
I probably commit about 200 times a day

00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:49,780
quite seriously every time I get a good

00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:51,280
couple of lines of code in there that

00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:53,800
either compiles or in the case of a

00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:58,780
scripting language says it's good to go

00:50:53,800 --> 00:51:02,290
I get it out there make sure you run

00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:04,090
your source code through a service or

00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:06,609
through a library that makes it

00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:10,980
completely unreadable naming your

00:51:06,609 --> 00:51:13,480
variables X sometimes isn't good enough

00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:17,680
has anyone seen the source code for

00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:19,119
Libre Office or OpenOffice yeah have you

00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,980
seen what they've done with it with the

00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:25,840
variables and the comments it's

00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:28,359
brilliant it's all in German absolutely

00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:30,460
fantastic and I went and had a chat at

00:51:28,359 --> 00:51:32,619
FOSDEM and Brussels to the to the

00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:34,630
developers and they just shrug their

00:51:32,619 --> 00:51:36,670
shoulders and gave me the most maniacal

00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:38,710
grin and said yes and we've been

00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:41,410
controlling this piece of software for

00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:43,090
the past ten years and you know what no

00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:48,089
one is ever gonna take her away from us

00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:50,500
not even Google Translate brilliant so I

00:51:48,089 --> 00:51:52,900
would certainly recommend that it's

00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:55,599
getting harder actually Google has got a

00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:57,339
lot to answer for go have a chat to the

00:51:55,599 --> 00:52:00,580
Googlers at the back and tell them off

00:51:57,339 --> 00:52:03,760
I had source code and Klingon the other

00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:05,800
day and one of my colleagues was

00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,960
actually able to throw that into Google

00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:12,099
Translate and get it translated I was so

00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:17,560
mad I'm gonna have to now invent my very

00:52:12,099 --> 00:52:22,780
own language ignore the small simple

00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:24,339
bugs ignore the low-hanging fruit these

00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:26,920
are the sorts of things that you can fix

00:52:24,339 --> 00:52:29,140
very quickly and make people very very

00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:31,380
happy so what you need to do is ensure

00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:33,760
that you don't ship a polished product

00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:37,540
make sure you ship a product that has

00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:40,599
lots of small bugs in it humans love to

00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:43,180
pick up on small bugs oh that icon isn't

00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:45,490
in the cornflower-blue I asked for or

00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:47,740
there's a tiny spelling mistake in the

00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:49,510
corner in the meantime they've

00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:51,160
completely forgotten about the feature

00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:52,919
that you promised which you didn't

00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:55,449
deliver

00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:57,609
you've got a fantastic series of little

00:52:55,449 --> 00:52:59,079
bugs and you can fix them really quickly

00:52:57,609 --> 00:53:00,669
and you go look I just rolled out a new

00:52:59,079 --> 00:53:06,999
version and I fixed the bug in me like

00:53:00,669 --> 00:53:08,169
wow that's customer service it's an

00:53:06,999 --> 00:53:10,660
amazing piece of human psychology

00:53:08,169 --> 00:53:12,699
actually they're the most important rule

00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:14,169
of customer service and people and the

00:53:12,699 --> 00:53:16,959
United States will tell you this

00:53:14,169 --> 00:53:20,469
especially keeping the customer happy

00:53:16,959 --> 00:53:22,359
and feeling good about the problem is 99

00:53:20,469 --> 00:53:23,589
percent of the battle and there's some

00:53:22,359 --> 00:53:26,319
99 percent in the battle that you need

00:53:23,589 --> 00:53:28,809
to win you don't actually have to fix

00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:30,339
the problem you just have to make them

00:53:28,809 --> 00:53:30,849
feel like you're going to fix the

00:53:30,339 --> 00:53:34,630
problem

00:53:30,849 --> 00:53:37,419
interesting psychology trick don't write

00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:41,380
comments just preaching to the converted

00:53:37,419 --> 00:53:47,919
I suspect here testing is definitely a

00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:50,229
waste of time okay your your users are

00:53:47,919 --> 00:53:53,229
actually your best testers get rid of

00:53:50,229 --> 00:53:55,029
the test team nothing survives contact

00:53:53,229 --> 00:53:58,089
until it hits the enemy anyway and the

00:53:55,029 --> 00:54:00,039
enemy are you end users your QA team

00:53:58,089 --> 00:54:01,839
will do all sorts of stupid stuff that

00:54:00,039 --> 00:54:04,599
you users would never do

00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:08,169
oh we put a negative 5 billion into this

00:54:04,599 --> 00:54:10,839
field what user is going to do that I

00:54:08,169 --> 00:54:12,609
mean unless you know my three-year-old

00:54:10,839 --> 00:54:17,739
niece gets her hands on the keyboard I

00:54:12,609 --> 00:54:22,869
think we're going to be okay so in

00:54:17,739 --> 00:54:26,469
conclusion back in the day in the 1950s

00:54:22,869 --> 00:54:28,599
1960s 1970s when our forbearers were

00:54:26,469 --> 00:54:30,999
writing software on punch cards and

00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:33,759
languages like Fortran and COBOL if they

00:54:30,999 --> 00:54:37,089
were lucky hand crafting bits of

00:54:33,759 --> 00:54:44,169
assembly to work on RISC processors they

00:54:37,089 --> 00:54:46,989
did this right oh you take a long look

00:54:44,169 --> 00:54:48,459
at that and think about the tools and

00:54:46,989 --> 00:54:55,779
the methodologies that software

00:54:48,459 --> 00:54:57,249
developers head to build that so why the

00:54:55,779 --> 00:55:01,869
hell do we need all the crap we have

00:54:57,249 --> 00:55:03,969
today most developers most of us can't

00:55:01,869 --> 00:55:04,320
even get a half-assed website up in a

00:55:03,969 --> 00:55:06,730
week

00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:08,950
with all the modern methodologies all

00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:12,790
the cool tools everything can barely say

00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:16,900
hello world they did that interesting

00:55:12,790 --> 00:55:19,780
isn't it so I would think on that I

00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:22,540
don't think are the methodologies are

00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:25,480
the tools are best practices actually

00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:28,000
stopping me from thinking about what the

00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:30,460
real problem is solving the actual

00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,800
programming problem looking at the code

00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:36,040
thinking about the code and working

00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:37,480
closely with my teammates to solve the

00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:39,970
real problems as opposed to worrying

00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:42,310
about all we need to do our standup we

00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:46,000
need to do our introspective we need to

00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:47,620
fill in this piece of documentation are

00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,100
you doing there are you building there

00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:53,490
that's what you should be focused on

00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:53,490
thank you very much

00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,960
you

00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,560
