Title: PHP UK Conference 2013 - Derick Rethans - OpenStreetMap for the Web
Publication date: 2013-04-29
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2013
Description: 
	This presentation introduces OpenStreetMap and explains to the audience what sort of rich data set it has. I will also cover different APIs for using the map tiles as well as other APIs that form sister-projects to OSM, such as Nominatim (search), routing, and obtaining current-location information. Some hints on storage and searching will also be given. During the course of the presentation I will also have to dip into some of the theoretical issues surrounding map making in general.

alright welcome after lunch do you all

00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:21,760
have a cup of coffee or tea with you

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,970
because if people start snoring all make

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,060
fun of you a lot and don't don't think

00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:29,860
that never happens because it does

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,980
people snoring loudly in the back I will

00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:34,600
make fun of you alright and i'll be

00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,940
talking with austin about openstreetmap

00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,710
for the web whether that should be an

00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,540
uppercase F or lowercase F I debated

00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:45,010
about five minutes then went to the pub

00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:46,960
and this slides will be online through

00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:51,190
this year all over here that's also

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,570
where you can leave feedback the link to

00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:54,820
the slides is an extra link to the

00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:56,949
slides it's a link to a page that has

00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,199
all the resources on there so don't

00:00:56,949 --> 00:01:01,210
bother trying to write them down just go

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,629
to link and have them all there so you

00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:06,729
don't have to copy all right so what am

00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:09,870
I talking about him first a little bit

00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:13,210
about myself I'm Derek and I've been

00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:15,580
speaking at conferences for so I'll hear

00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:18,640
something like that I'm Dutch vera leaf

00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:20,890
in London I work as one of the PHP

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,290
mongodb drive maintain is I also hack on

00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:25,540
lots of order PHP extensions you might

00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:28,240
have heard of this thing called XD book

00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:30,520
it's also something that I've done all

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,409
right and i absolutely love maps maps is

00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,750
a bit of a hobby for me an Open Street

00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:37,390
Map combines two very interesting things

00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:41,250
it combines walking around cities or

00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:43,149
countryside maps as well as pups and

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,700
that's always great thing good

00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:47,649
combination if you ask me so let's talk

00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:52,420
a little bit about Bob maps actually are

00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:54,850
well you know that the earth is the is

00:01:52,420 --> 00:02:01,140
falling away but the earth is actually

00:01:54,850 --> 00:02:01,140
not really square on my Mac

00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:09,179
and now I can't actually but that's

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,039
right no don't worry too much about is

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:14,160
the if it's only the theme messing

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,080
number around right so yeah the earth is

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,940
not really sphere right it is a bit

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,200
elongate it is a bit wider than it is

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,480
high and there's a bit of a pear shape

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,870
and yeah not quite like that there's no

00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,910
stamp for it but this creates quite a

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:30,150
lot of interesting difficulties because

00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:32,010
in order to approximate the shape of the

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:38,340
earth you use it differently depending

00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:40,080
on where on earth you're so most mapping

00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,510
solutions that will try to create a

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,360
reference ellipsoids an ellipsoid is

00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:47,340
basically what was fear but a bit longer

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,180
than water and they try to match that to

00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:53,549
the size of the earth or to do how do

00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,790
you call it the how do you looks like

00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:58,709
and there's different ways of doing that

00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,920
and use and this is some this is like

00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:03,660
that I don't have outside of UK because

00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,130
it's not really necessary but if you do

00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,959
anything with maps in the UK every

00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:11,310
coordinates that will be provided for

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:13,799
you will be a voc be done in a system

00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:16,230
called osg be 36 and that coordinate

00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:20,209
system is not the same as what you find

00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:22,799
on almost on my graphing applications so

00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:25,109
what Google Maps uses what openstreetmap

00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:28,440
use we use wgs84 which is the same thing

00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:30,510
that GPS uses fairly useful whereas in

00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,200
the UK they tend to use osg be 36

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:37,310
because that is a better-fitting shape

00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,650
to how the earth looks like for the UK

00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:42,180
right so that is sort of important but

00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:44,160
after you have figured out which shape

00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,739
fits best you still need to define two

00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,970
things you need to well northern sound

00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:50,100
is quite simple because that's your

00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,650
poles but where do you put your meridian

00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,120
right and that is also not really that

00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,739
simple I mean how many of you have here

00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,650
been here to the Royal Observatory in

00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:02,310
Greenwich and how how many of you have

00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:03,780
used a GPS on that line right I know

00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:06,870
what happens then because it doesn't

00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,220
show zero you actually need to walk 170

00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:11,560
meters this way and end up on the blue

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,390
line which is the GPS meridian

00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,400
and it has changed a little bit so this

00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:16,810
is something that you need to keep in

00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,000
mind if you see coordinates in UK

00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,790
because almost everything will be using

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,950
oh she beat 36 cornet luckily you can

00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,990
convert it but I don't have the mods for

00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:28,180
that ball now after you have created

00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:31,290
your coordinate system you still need to

00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:34,870
map a spherical or an ellipsoid to a

00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:36,880
plane but because usually I don't have a

00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:39,040
globe in my pocket but the map is a lot

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,800
easier to do and it's different ways how

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,750
you can do that so here we have I don't

00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,030
even actually this equivalent projection

00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:48,220
fairly useful for North America but if

00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,960
you in India pretty useless because as

00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:53,950
you can see here is always squished to

00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:56,050
the Android there's the Australian

00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:59,650
variant that likes putas draw in the top

00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:01,510
middle again probably not a world filled

00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,820
at you often see but I mean if you miss

00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,440
girl yet might make some sense animal I

00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:08,380
think this is looks really really weird

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:13,210
myself all the things that exact or

00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:17,140
exaggerate certain shapes right so this

00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:18,520
is a petersville pipe is horrible

00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:22,690
projection it's a projection because

00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:26,260
it's the length of Africa and the length

00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:30,070
of say what Australia is not nearly as

00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:31,870
high as a third of Africa right and it's

00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:34,350
really difficult to see anything useful

00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:37,060
to serve as many different protections

00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:41,800
what most online things use including

00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:43,690
openstreetmap is the wgs 84 system

00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,090
anyway now a little bit about

00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:47,770
openstreetmap I've told to about maps

00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:50,200
but openstreetmap is actually not about

00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:53,440
maps it is about geographical data

00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,910
stored in an enormous database this all

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,410
owner free license you can download

00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:58,990
everything I have some example of that

00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:01,180
later and you can use it as much as you

00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,460
want providing that you get an attribute

00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:06,789
bution that you're using openstreetmap

00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:08,830
and as if you all are points that you

00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:11,110
can have to look at if you look at a

00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:14,350
license but the basic idea is that your

00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:17,139
credit openstreetmap and don't intermix

00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:18,820
it with with your own personal data or

00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:21,280
your company's data to create a new

00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:23,409
database so it's a bit of a copy copy

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,669
leftish license

00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:27,550
but that shouldn't really be a problem

00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:28,809
so opens free map is both this database

00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:32,709
business a few other points as well

00:06:28,809 --> 00:06:36,249
there's api's to art and read the data

00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:38,349
and it's also a social platform for

00:06:36,249 --> 00:06:40,619
improving a map and that is how I Walton

00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:43,029
to openstreetmap am I don't know some

00:06:40,619 --> 00:06:45,129
another PHP developer can guess I'm not

00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:47,709
sure any of you know him he introduced

00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:50,259
me to openstreetmap because i hope next

00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:52,629
thing you remember why don't remember

00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:54,149
why but it's been all his fault that i

00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:58,179
spent way too much time napping now

00:06:54,149 --> 00:07:00,269
alright so of course you want to show a

00:06:58,179 --> 00:07:03,819
map if you have the data for it right so

00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:06,219
this is an API code leaflet so if you if

00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:08,739
you speak about Google Maps API you

00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:10,869
think about an API from bearing a map in

00:07:08,739 --> 00:07:14,039
your website right the OpenStreetMap ABI

00:07:10,869 --> 00:07:16,860
is the API for adding and reading data

00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:19,779
openstreetmap doesn't provide a

00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,849
embeddable mapping tool for your website

00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:23,409
where it is very many different variants

00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:25,839
that allow you to that I tend to use

00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:30,369
something called leaflets and leaflets

00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:32,050
is is fairly simple to use I mean this

00:07:30,369 --> 00:07:35,289
is probably the most simple way of doing

00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:37,629
it you get to zoom around here from a

00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:38,949
mouse blender and zoom in and stuff like

00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:42,069
that I means this simple space you can

00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:44,679
do and there's some controls or so now

00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:48,369
setting this up is not more than to

00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:50,349
click that it's about this much I mean

00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:52,419
there's not even PHP involved right it's

00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:56,050
just a bit of JavaScript and a map

00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:59,050
library that unity includes all right so

00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:00,789
that's a showing the map but it's all of

00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:03,569
course different API is a chicken and

00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:07,059
then this is a fairly simple one

00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:08,679
interesting they seem to be I know that

00:08:07,059 --> 00:08:10,779
they recently push the new stealth suit

00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:12,550
like last week or so and now all the

00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:14,050
tube stops are showing up a lot better

00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:19,209
than they used to be before which I

00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:20,889
definitely like okay so this map

00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:24,610
automatically sends it on London and

00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:25,929
London is basically a 12 square there's

00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:30,189
actually a little dot on Trafalgar

00:08:25,929 --> 00:08:31,360
Square you can find it and doing finding

00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:32,500
the coordinates for that is fairly

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,750
simple there's a service called

00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,710
nominative normal item is a bit of a

00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,720
sister party openstreetmap

00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:40,220
openstreetmap itself like I said is the

00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,110
data but there's lots of side projects

00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:44,840
such as leaflet and nominate same here

00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:46,580
and yeah it's really really simple to

00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:51,650
find coordinates for things like that

00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:53,420
what is basically returns is a big JSON

00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:55,130
document or actually I told her to

00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,990
return JSON so that's why returning case

00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:58,550
in otherwise of the six and upwards it

00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,500
returns quite a lot of information here

00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:03,260
a lot more than I put in because i put

00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,970
in london UK the UK is sort of important

00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:07,220
because otherwise it's sometimes returns

00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:09,260
long in Ontario which is not quite where

00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,880
we are at the moment and yeah you get

00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,980
quite a lot of stuff back the place that

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,110
isn't interesting you get to see the osm

00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:18,350
type which can either be a note away our

00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:19,910
relation its ID again not very

00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,500
interesting but what is interesting that

00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:23,990
you get a bounding box back for the

00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:26,480
object as o in a bounding box is

00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:31,340
basically a demarcation of London in

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:33,230
this case as well as here we have the

00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:36,410
center points and it also expands the

00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:38,060
name so it expands long run into also

00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,890
again is that it's gotten a bit

00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,600
ridiculous lately its long-run great

00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:46,100
along in England United Kingdom European

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:48,860
Union Union tarragon but it provides you

00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,660
with lots of information air words it

00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:53,200
also shows an importance I have known

00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:57,200
you how to scale clayton anderson icon

00:09:53,200 --> 00:10:01,430
alright so to delete that bit better

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:08,270
with this if the map loads then i can

00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:10,040
get a demo not having a good day zoom in

00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:12,080
zoom out I might have done something

00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,530
wrong way so let's search for debris or

00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,530
for example

00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:23,190
and so what I've done here is basically

00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:25,590
I audit in the name of it and then it

00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:28,230
shows you the top 5 results in this case

00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:29,730
it expands the brewery city of lohman to

00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,410
the brewery and Montcalm roman city

00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,630
chisel straight Golan Lena state city of

00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,250
long ago and including the postcode so

00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:38,220
that goes quite quite far but I can

00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:41,220
click it and then you'll see that it put

00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:43,410
the box right around the river and this

00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:46,860
is not something that costs me a lot of

00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:48,660
time to wake to make if you don't have a

00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:51,450
look at this example there is a URL here

00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,250
it's all my my my github repository

00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:56,490
again don't bother writing this it's in

00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:58,320
a in a resources link and I have some

00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:00,420
other openstreetmap tools in there as

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,950
well so that create some visualizations

00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,290
and things like that so I have a look at

00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:07,290
it and of course if you have more than

00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:10,830
one result you get things like let's try

00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:14,370
Paris and you get a few rights you get

00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:15,930
Paris which is the whole city and all

00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:18,420
the time sometimes things show up toys I

00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:20,430
don't know what three times then there's

00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:23,280
also bearers in in the United States

00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:26,040
somewhere and in Texas and things like

00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,390
that so it's a little demo I threw

00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,480
together and it's not very difficult to

00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:32,820
do no interestingly you can also do you

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,920
opposites so you can give it coordinates

00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,690
and it will tell you exactly where where

00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:40,590
you are so let me give that a shot a

00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:46,220
zone we're over here is a dis building

00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:46,220
looks like that chisel streets

00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:52,140
and if you zoom in far is diverted the

00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:55,080
further you zoom in there more it

00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:56,070
exposes the address so in this case I

00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,209
gave its coordinates and it came back

00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:04,160
with an address and this service is a

00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:07,709
sort of free service but there are some

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,959
resource limits they're not hardly

00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:13,589
enforced and unless you span them

00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:15,660
basically but as with any of the tools

00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:16,709
around to openstreetmap you get to set

00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,320
it up yourself if you want to that

00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:22,350
setting of nominating for a city like

00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,490
London doesn't require lots of resource

00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:25,380
if you want to do it for the whole world

00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:28,140
you need a very fast machine with lots

00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:31,310
of memory all right so this is the

00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:34,680
reverse geocoding now well scan with him

00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:37,649
okay for a geocoding of course Google

00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,029
has a services all but it's not free you

00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:41,060
can't actually use it if you're not

00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:43,399
using google maps to display it so I

00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:46,560
can't really use in this presentation

00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:50,730
but another good service for doing any

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,950
sort of geolocation and you stuff is a

00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:56,430
service called geonames and they will

00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:57,930
have also they offer all their data for

00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:59,490
download so if you want to find an

00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:03,060
enormous list of every city in a world

00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:05,730
with population location and time zones

00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:10,380
geonames dot org has it for you very

00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:15,350
useful website all right next slide it

00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:18,870
takes some time because it does magic no

00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:21,149
there we go so this is another side

00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:23,220
project is exactly developed outside of

00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:25,050
openstreetmap it is a routing engine

00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:28,589
called OS around which i think stands

00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:31,920
for open stream of routing mapper I

00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:34,020
don't know I made it up and basically

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,959
they have a very nice website that you

00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:38,220
can use to put in some data I can

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:42,230
probably demonstrate that that's more

00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:44,470
fun isn't it also more dangerous but

00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:46,330
there we go

00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,460
would you like to share my location

00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:52,530
let's do that see how that works this

00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:54,640
time definitely not on telling t'en but

00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:58,440
apparently the rooty that I'm connect to

00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:02,620
use to be intelligent now let's try

00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:10,270
nottingham this one you know that will

00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:17,010
work and we go to Moscow I guess that is

00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:19,410
Moscow okay they said Moscow sort of

00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:23,320
maybe I should have picked some slightly

00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:26,290
smaller route but I'm just wanting to

00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,570
show how fast it is do it go if there's

00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:31,510
data available this is continent level

00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:33,820
routing in 10 milliseconds which is

00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:37,440
pretty awesome if you ask me ok

00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:41,200
nottingham to what's close to Nottingham

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:46,390
Darby mega English geography isn't the

00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:49,480
greatest for me to this one zoom zoom

00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:51,060
two roots toga and then it gives you the

00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,090
route between Nottingham and Derby

00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:56,470
including step-by-step instructions

00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:59,020
sometimes it has alternate if you can

00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:01,840
also create a link and you have a I call

00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:03,280
it a permalink to the to the roots and I

00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,290
find it quite useful to play with an

00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:08,380
interesting thing is that this is an API

00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:09,880
zone so if you don't want to use their

00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,200
fancy website but use it from your own

00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,950
application you can actually do that

00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:17,020
let's let me go back to the slides next

00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:20,530
song so let's have a look at how you

00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:22,180
would interact with OS around our

00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:24,310
theorem actually uses nominative

00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:26,110
internally for resolving names so the

00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:27,520
first thing you basically do is pull

00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:30,940
logs on here along the lines in Paul's

00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,590
Cathedral I basically queried Norman

00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,780
attempt to figure out where those places

00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:36,310
are goes the routing engine basically

00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:39,490
what you give it is to coordinate points

00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:42,010
and it calculates route between so yeah

00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:44,310
there's a bit of formatting necessary as

00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:46,810
you can see here lots of interesting but

00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,550
yeah you can basically query this route

00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:51,610
with two coordinates and you'll get back

00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:54,090
in order JSON documents which looks

00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:54,090
something like this

00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:58,630
so at first as a diversion that's not

00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:00,070
interesting but it has a status message

00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:02,950
status message is useful because

00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:05,020
sometimes it's gone to find a route in

00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:06,700
this case the state is we found a route

00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:11,280
which is always a good thing and then it

00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:14,290
gives you this route route geometry

00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:17,530
string and that is an encoded array of

00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:21,460
points that can we use to draw the route

00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:23,880
on the map now this is encoded in how

00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:28,540
they call it is google geo points

00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:30,340
something array thing and of which i

00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:32,350
have an explanation and a decoder in

00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:34,630
your resources again so have a look at

00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:36,130
that and then of course you have root

00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:37,990
summary it tells you the total distance

00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:40,930
a total times which i think is in meters

00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:43,090
and seconds start point and end point

00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:45,220
they're not always exactly the same as

00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:47,950
you would get what you give in because

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:50,530
how to resolving isn't necessarily a

00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:52,300
one-to-one mapping all right just a bit

00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:55,960
of URLs about the OpenStreetMap routing

00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:57,550
engine it's a project or n dot org it is

00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,140
really fast if you want to do a whole

00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:01,150
world's routing you need a fast machine

00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:05,020
because there's just too much data in it

00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:07,060
but it's really really fast and they're

00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:09,010
happy for you to use the service again

00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:11,040
don't spam is basically the wrong

00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:13,780
alright let's look at a few other things

00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:16,630
this is not so much PHP things it is

00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:18,610
more like share your location right it's

00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:21,160
basically an HTML API call that allows

00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:22,630
you to find out where you are at the

00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,160
moment so you click share location and

00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:28,330
will probably tell me I'm telling Tintin

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:32,170
ended which is not the location why I am

00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:34,660
really I don't know why that goes wrong

00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:37,180
I can't explain that it this is actually

00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:38,830
goes through the browser to a good

00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,630
google geolocation service and

00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:42,550
apparently doesn't know the correct IP

00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:44,590
address for this location so i don't

00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:48,760
quite know why that happens but and most

00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:50,170
of the time it works fine doing that an

00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,360
HTML isn't very difficult this is

00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:56,820
something i'm using a different mapping

00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:59,500
api which is called openlayers

00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:01,630
openlayers is a lot more powerful

00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:04,660
because it can actually deal with all

00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:06,850
the different datums all the different

00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:08,710
coordinate systems but because it

00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:10,570
deal with that he needed a lot of manual

00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:13,990
work I tend to prefer leaflet now

00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:15,790
because so much easier to use but the

00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:18,640
most interesting thing here is basically

00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:20,260
the first line anyway is there's a API

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,880
additional five sets called navigator

00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:25,570
get geolocation get current position

00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:28,660
virtual them with to call to call backs

00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:30,370
either one works or doesn't work you

00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:34,660
then get to the location back and that

00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:36,550
gets put into position which you then

00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:39,550
can extract the longitude and latitude

00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:41,290
from that's basically it and earn some

00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:44,830
calculation to draw circles and things

00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:47,200
like that again quite useful to use

00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:50,440
alright so let's have a little bit a

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,030
look at OpenStreetMap data itself the

00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:55,110
data that you can download to an open

00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:58,240
street map is all Nixon or file formats

00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:00,760
the xml formats is very simple because

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,980
it needs to be quite fast however if you

00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:05,260
download the whole planet it's about 18

00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:07,240
gigabytes of compressed XML there's

00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:09,880
probably a bit more than you can process

00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:12,310
in about an hour it'd take a couple of

00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,710
days a minute the data in there consists

00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:18,070
of notes and notes are basically points

00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:20,380
with coordinates as you can see I have a

00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:23,740
note of something I don't actually know

00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:26,710
what this it's probably just a note has

00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:30,580
no other information text it notes make

00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:32,050
of ways and areas an area is basically a

00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,850
way where the first and the last point

00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:39,360
are the same that creates like mallu

00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:42,610
part ways are used for roads footpaths

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,260
hiking trails shipping lanes rivers

00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:46,180
streams whatever you can think of and

00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,950
then there's areas which are pedestrian

00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:51,940
areas or parks or buildings and things

00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:55,030
like that and a way has a way ID and

00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:58,720
some random data and then it has a

00:19:55,030 --> 00:20:00,550
reference to the notes so in order to

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,930
process this external fold first as all

00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:04,420
the notes and then it has all the ways

00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:05,680
in there so in order to figure out

00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:08,230
actually where the ways are you need to

00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:10,810
keep a cache of all the notes again if

00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:12,220
you have about a billion notes it's not

00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,990
going to fit in memory so I need to come

00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:16,980
up with something clever than that how

00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:18,970
you do that is more part of this talk

00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,350
but the interesting thing is that you

00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:23,320
can describe every

00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:26,880
oats and whey with text and the tanks

00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:30,299
are all all down here tanks are freeform

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,590
so you can basically take any objects

00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:35,400
exactly how you want to do that which

00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:37,809
makes it makes it possible to have quite

00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,760
quite a lot of extra data and

00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:43,690
openstreetmap that is not necessarily

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:45,910
visible in a nap all right so editing

00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:50,590
those things is also again more fun to

00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:53,440
show him so i have downloaded the area

00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:56,080
here I know it's a bit small but this is

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,120
an editor called Joseph and Joseph is

00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,450
basically CAD drawing program falling

00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:04,480
maps I don't know I don't think I should

00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:07,539
be adding anything interesting ok of

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,490
course I made it large than my screen

00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:10,900
was different size but that's for

00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:14,669
example pick this thing on the corner

00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:18,220
here the thing on the corner is a pop

00:21:14,669 --> 00:21:23,919
pops are really well mapped in

00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:26,799
OpenStreetMap probably also sampled most

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,419
of the time but never know yeah so yeah

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,250
you have a couple of taxiway have it's

00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:33,460
an it's an amenity it's a pup is a

00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:35,590
building many points of interest in

00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:39,190
London are maps as buildings now instead

00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:40,720
of just the points in all the countries

00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:42,010
that differs a little bit it depends a

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,809
little bit on what the local mappers

00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:47,110
have decide on how they do this in the

00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:48,700
UK if we know the building is the

00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:50,890
building for it if you don't it's just a

00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:53,620
point both of them are good enough at

00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:54,640
some point somebody can upgrade it you

00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:57,070
can also see that in the background

00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,190
directly a satellite imagery now the

00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:03,340
satellites inventory from bing Microsoft

00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:05,970
is kind enough to allow us to use the

00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:08,830
satellite imagery as a background for

00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:11,799
for positioning things well there's a

00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:14,200
few caveats there don't like it's not

00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:16,900
always properly aligned and you can I

00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,940
guess sort of see that right like the

00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:21,070
building outlines aren't exactly on

00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:23,409
where the satellite imageries and that

00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:25,299
gave me because of different different

00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:27,400
reasons either the GPS traces work

00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:29,590
accurately or the satellite imagery

00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:32,100
isn't accurately aligned and its various

00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:34,440
different ways and how you can fix that

00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,820
if you really want to fix that you need

00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,110
really expensive equipment and

00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:39,510
openstreetmap being a volunteer project

00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:41,340
we don't have that the most of the time

00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:43,770
it is done pretty good let me zoom in a

00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:45,210
little bit also different zoom levels

00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:47,940
and the satellite imagery are

00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:53,070
differently aligned up for your concerns

00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:54,600
all right I don't know somebody mapped

00:22:53,070 --> 00:23:00,360
here's something interesting I have no

00:22:54,600 --> 00:23:02,669
one do this it's a wall angle hey that's

00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,409
not as bad as what some people Germany

00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:07,140
map they map all the benches in parks

00:23:04,409 --> 00:23:10,770
including Bennett has sunlight there you

00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:13,650
go but yes all this information is in

00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:16,710
here there's also streets it tells you

00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:19,950
what the speed limit is referencing in

00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:22,440
some cases the surface as well again I

00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:25,049
don't tend to map that for roads because

00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:27,480
most of the time there are asphalt so I

00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:30,870
would only all that in case it is not as

00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:32,760
faults so if it's a road that erosion

00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:36,570
cities are mostly asphalt right so I

00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:38,309
would map the exceptions which makes a

00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:40,919
whole lot more sense i think the same

00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:42,539
thing for footballs or tracks in the

00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:46,320
country so you don't have to say it is

00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:48,539
not for your grounds what everyone to

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,400
call it's mostly not to be frame and all

00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:51,840
of the data is in your notice the

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,590
hairdressing here it's a nice Club

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:58,020
including opening times no you so

00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:59,580
yesterday evening after the the event

00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,559
you ended we were looking for papa was

00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:03,630
open longer than eleven that's quite

00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:05,460
difficult alone but with this

00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:07,320
information in OpenStreetMap you can

00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:10,049
actually probably create a map of props

00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,400
that are open at this moment right if i

00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:14,220
have time i might where the heck for it

00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,210
and then we probably have to send all

00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,900
the mappers around to all the perps

00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:22,140
again to figure out when you're open and

00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:24,299
where they actually sell beer anyway and

00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,679
lots of data in there and you can add it

00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:29,340
is i'm not going to edit and upload

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:31,460
anything now because then i'll spend the

00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:33,600
next hour adding things in the map

00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:37,890
there's a different address the one that

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:40,679
shows here is is jawsome or java

00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:43,620
openstreetmap a doctor it is an additive

00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:45,779
primarily use rules written by by

00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:50,969
Germans so it's a bit more complicated

00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:54,330
but really really powerful that joke

00:24:50,969 --> 00:24:56,099
doesn't work in Germany part alright so

00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:58,919
how do we get the data in there right

00:24:56,099 --> 00:25:00,509
and we tend to do that with a mapping

00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:02,549
parties in London we have a mapping

00:25:00,509 --> 00:25:04,889
party about every two week when it's

00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:07,349
daylight savings time but basically mean

00:25:04,889 --> 00:25:09,929
we meet up about six map around for an

00:25:07,349 --> 00:25:12,719
hour hour and a half and then go to the

00:25:09,929 --> 00:25:15,960
pub in winter we just go to the pub

00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:18,899
straight away with this kind of phone

00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,999
also we do sometimes weekends where we

00:25:18,899 --> 00:25:23,039
go to the countryside and then spend the

00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:25,139
day walking around and actually mapping

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,759
footballs mapping footballs in the

00:25:25,139 --> 00:25:27,960
countryside is a lot more work than

00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:29,429
mapping in a city where if it's

00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,869
satellite imagery I mean it's very

00:25:29,429 --> 00:25:32,460
clearly to see where the building in the

00:25:30,869 --> 00:25:33,719
streets are but food plots in the

00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,909
countryside is really really difficult

00:25:33,719 --> 00:25:40,739
to see the satellite imagery so we

00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:42,809
prefer to serve it is surveying is

00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:44,309
probably one of the most important

00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:46,019
things that open stream up its really

00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:49,109
really important that you actually

00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:51,239
verify that what's on the map is

00:25:49,109 --> 00:25:55,919
actually on the ground so we don't tend

00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:58,469
to it's unlikely that street names in

00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:02,309
OpenStreetMap are different from what

00:25:58,469 --> 00:26:03,779
the signs say on the roads whereas some

00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:05,999
of the Ordnance Survey dated actually

00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:09,509
had incorrect name for the streets which

00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:11,279
is bit annoying but so it goes so

00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:13,440
surveying is really important and we do

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,029
that by hands with a GPS if necessary

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,039
but mostly with pen and paper and

00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:18,179
cameras so that we don't have to write

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:22,619
down all the details of all the

00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:24,509
buildings and restaurants repulsing and

00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:27,179
we always do the surveying in a group

00:26:24,509 --> 00:26:29,269
it's a lot of fun and this is just a

00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:31,320
quote from one of my friends record them

00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:34,499
there's a bit of a running joke is that

00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:36,359
I like mapping post boxes they're quite

00:26:34,499 --> 00:26:40,499
useless navigation marks that's my

00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:41,999
reason but I item so a Rick was saying

00:26:40,499 --> 00:26:45,210
that he mapped in all the post books and

00:26:41,999 --> 00:26:47,369
that would make me proud this is a after

00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:48,619
we've gone out mapping as you can see

00:26:47,369 --> 00:26:50,839
we're about the dolphin people here

00:26:48,619 --> 00:26:53,519
that's usually better than sup it

00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:55,619
alright so editing the map pack demo so

00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:57,870
I can skip the slides there's also

00:26:55,619 --> 00:27:02,700
actually I probably should show you that

00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:07,170
not on this one why does it go to the

00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:09,960
German one goes on to files typing so if

00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:17,850
you where is this the talent and again

00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:19,530
no it's somewhere in Germany suburb city

00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:22,590
of lohman and whether that's correct i

00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:23,850
don't quite know but again we are the

00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:25,920
Bank of England that's basically the

00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:28,410
city of luminescence you can actually

00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:35,070
add it straight from the website with a

00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:36,960
flash-based editor if you log in I can't

00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,730
stand / also i can only get to use one

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,429
mouse button here and not the right

00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:43,410
click because flashes and do that but it

00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:45,300
is a very simple way getting started are

00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:48,030
linking to openstreetmap you basically

00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:50,700
the view that you have and you can

00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:53,700
basically draw things on the drag thing

00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:55,740
suit so i wouldn't call the bank of

00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,000
england museum but you can see how easy

00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:00,120
it is then you can click 'change and

00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,250
give it names you can give it all the

00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:04,980
details I tend to always out addresses

00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:07,110
and post codes as well because that is

00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,360
data that you can really only find birth

00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:10,710
survey because you can't copy it from

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,130
anything else because it's copyrighted

00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:17,309
information and I this is how you do

00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:21,150
some editing on map leave the page

00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:27,410
delete my changes by converting the Bank

00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:31,200
of England into museum all right okay so

00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:32,580
surveys don't only happen in the UK in

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,450
the UK most of the data has been

00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:38,160
contributed by people in the Netherlands

00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:40,590
lots of the data has been imported in

00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:43,050
the US the whole road network has been

00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:44,220
important and that is a bit of a sad

00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:46,080
thing because it means there is no

00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:48,750
community there that actually does the

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:52,290
surveying getting UK there's probably

00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:54,150
500 people mapping every day yeah little

00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:56,760
bits here and there I mean usually when

00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:58,050
I go somewhere and I don't I see things

00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,450
that are not on that power all is when I

00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:02,610
get back home whereas in the u.s. you

00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:04,290
don't have it at all because the data is

00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:05,670
already there it's usually rubbish

00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:08,400
data's or because it's being imported

00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:10,410
from some counties and they don't even

00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,399
know how to scale properly so sometimes

00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:13,169
you see like a hold of

00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:14,460
that's twice the size of what it

00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:16,919
actually is because they haven't

00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:19,799
bothered to skilled properly which is a

00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:23,700
problem but of course you get to fix

00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:27,839
that if you want to do that but more of

00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:30,419
a social thing is open three members

00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:32,849
also really useful in humanitarian areas

00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:35,210
a couple of us I split off into

00:29:32,849 --> 00:29:38,940
something called hot which you meet a

00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:42,570
humanitarian OpenStreetMap teen and they

00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:44,519
try to empower local populations to

00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:47,729
create your own maps without giving the

00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:48,929
data to Google because Google notice

00:29:47,729 --> 00:29:52,139
that this is a really good thing to do

00:29:48,929 --> 00:29:54,269
anyway keybar is one of the law is a

00:29:52,139 --> 00:29:55,919
slum in Nairobi and let me zoom in a

00:29:54,269 --> 00:29:57,479
little bit so what I've mapped here

00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,450
they've mapped all the tracks the

00:29:57,479 --> 00:30:02,789
footballs buildings water fountains

00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:04,139
toilets clinics those are the things

00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:05,879
that are important there they don't care

00:30:04,139 --> 00:30:08,969
about benches that have sunlight and

00:30:05,879 --> 00:30:10,879
things like that one no it's the basic

00:30:08,969 --> 00:30:14,070
things that are important for them and

00:30:10,879 --> 00:30:15,749
the whole team actually went in there

00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:17,219
and trained the local population to do

00:30:15,749 --> 00:30:18,479
mapping and I think that's really really

00:30:17,219 --> 00:30:22,080
good and there's a lot more of those

00:30:18,479 --> 00:30:23,460
projects going around I'd they have

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,739
changed the logo since last time I

00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:28,409
looked at this all right so that's

00:30:25,739 --> 00:30:29,789
really good thing Google thought well we

00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:32,729
can do this as well we have a tool

00:30:29,789 --> 00:30:36,690
called map maker and we do the same

00:30:32,729 --> 00:30:39,479
thing so this is a is a difference

00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:40,950
limits go gotcha and you can see well

00:30:39,479 --> 00:30:43,589
it's difficult to see because the lines

00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:46,710
aren't very bright there's lots and lots

00:30:43,589 --> 00:30:49,710
of football cns has water vendor in big

00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:51,299
letters and they put it in the block

00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:54,299
pose make a big who are about it but

00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:57,960
they sort of forget forgot to scroll to

00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:59,279
the left where the open Street members

00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,219
then all does an Easter I can show that

00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:04,379
our map is actually look better again

00:31:01,219 --> 00:31:09,899
where it has buildings and clinics and

00:31:04,379 --> 00:31:12,089
water for sale I don't know so there's a

00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:14,309
few differences a google map maker has

00:31:12,089 --> 00:31:15,690
been introducing the u.s. now and not

00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:17,849
sure whether it's available in UK else

00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:21,749
so what they try to do is to get people

00:31:17,849 --> 00:31:23,700
to contribute data to them under their

00:31:21,749 --> 00:31:24,600
license rights which basically means you

00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,040
can't advocate today

00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,600
out again and one of the most both

00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:30,420
things about openstreetmap is that you

00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:33,180
can they get to date out so even though

00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:34,680
google map maker if you come from you

00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:37,290
there the data will show up on your map

00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:38,820
tiles it's still just images right

00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:43,830
there's no data behind it are you

00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:45,300
basically helping out google creating

00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:47,700
value for google instead of creating

00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:49,890
value for yourself so open street map is

00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:53,100
only on the side right makes happy

00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:54,480
people you can get to the data you can

00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,640
do basically everything metadata so

00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,550
instead of contributing to google map

00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,900
maker why not do an open thing right so

00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:04,560
there's always a bit of a struggle to

00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:08,040
explain explain it to people i hope you

00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:10,950
quite understanding why it is better to

00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:12,390
contribute open strip right all right so

00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:16,500
let me have a another look at how you

00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:18,300
get to the data you can query that hero

00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:21,390
exhales lying and wasn't 18 gigabytes

00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:23,340
its twenty six gigabytes now and there's

00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:25,980
lots and lots of data in it and i

00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:30,150
wouldn't if you start with this don't

00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:32,820
start with the whole planet again i

00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:35,010
would probably even go as far as go even

00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:38,730
slightly smaller than a country because

00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:41,730
i get to import england's on my laptop

00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:47,250
with a nice false SSD in there in about

00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:48,630
five hours so ya think about that so if

00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:51,420
you start doing this either pick a

00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:53,880
smaller country or query for a smaller

00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:56,970
slice and there is an api called

00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:59,190
overpass again as you can see written by

00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:02,490
germans so it's really complicated to

00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:04,080
use but really powerful and basically

00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:06,060
what you can do is you can query it with

00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,770
a star a star basically means every node

00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:10,350
where your relation and then with the

00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:11,610
bounding box you basically gave it the

00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:14,150
coordinates of where you want to map

00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:16,350
from in this case i've also added a

00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:18,690
predicate saying that i only want all

00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:22,230
the restaurants in this area and you

00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:24,420
cannot more and more predicate see this

00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:29,490
is actually not the overpass api this is

00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:32,460
called except e api or x a p that used

00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:34,830
to be really slow and absolutely useless

00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,240
because it was just too slow so the

00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:37,470
Germans that road is over Passaic

00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:42,419
animated compatibility

00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:46,559
they're to then use except ESO all right

00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:48,960
so you can do a little bit more with

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:51,360
overpass as well so what i'm doing here

00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,659
is i create like a query objects xml

00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:57,059
query based object where what I've query

00:33:54,659 --> 00:34:01,320
for is a union for all the notes and

00:33:57,059 --> 00:34:03,960
ways where they where the amenity tag is

00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:05,610
a pub so basically i'm looking for all

00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,550
the notes and all the ways in this

00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:11,940
bounding box hence the dollar PB then

00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:15,000
from this union I query around bitter

00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:16,950
radius from to two meters all the bus

00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,090
stops so basically what this query says

00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:23,399
find me all the pups in i think it is

00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:25,530
lonely all the pups in London that are

00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:28,050
not more than two meters away from a bus

00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:30,000
stop okay it's a bit of a contrived

00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:34,139
example but you can see how powerful

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:37,010
this gets and yeah I you can simply post

00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:39,450
to this URL and you get a result back

00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:42,270
there's a few different providers that

00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:43,859
provide your overpass API again if you

00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:45,210
really need to use this a lot you can

00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:49,169
set up your own instance of it because

00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:51,780
again this is open source alrighty and

00:34:49,169 --> 00:34:53,280
then of course because you can get to

00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,810
the days that has lots of visualizations

00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:59,540
that are possible to the right so this

00:34:54,810 --> 00:35:02,369
is a net a map of all the cycling routes

00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:05,670
the cycling was highlighted in blue and

00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:07,290
rats you can see that the icons which

00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:09,930
cycles on the target cycle repairing

00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:12,390
shops surprisingly weather pups are not

00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:14,790
showing up here but i would have

00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:16,200
expected apps to do this is an immature

00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:19,410
contacted you can also this isn't but

00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:21,210
need is edinburgh but i zoom terrain so

00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:22,859
this is open cycle map open cycle map

00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:25,260
also has an application called cycle

00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:26,849
streets as an apple website cycle

00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:29,460
streets and an application called cycle

00:35:26,849 --> 00:35:32,280
streets which provides you cycling

00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:34,980
routing in the UK specifically tailored

00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,599
for cycling routing so not sure how

00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:39,630
familiar you at attaboy but is this big

00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:41,700
hill somewhere right and if you will do

00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:43,020
the fastest or the shortest route it

00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:46,530
would have routed you straight through

00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:49,410
the hill but it's fairly steep so

00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:50,500
actually this engine knows about this

00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:52,300
and will root you

00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:54,370
desty bits and basically in this case

00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:55,930
around the hill so it's really really

00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:58,990
tailored for this it also knows about

00:35:55,930 --> 00:36:00,490
quieter Street and busy streets and I

00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:04,360
will tailor your route according to that

00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:05,890
very cool to have a look at again some

00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:08,350
Germans thought it would be nice to have

00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:10,180
an open sea map where they met all the

00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:13,360
buoys and light signs and lighthouses

00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:15,790
and things like that transport routes

00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:17,860
are maps and shown with the transport

00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:20,080
layer which is also available for an

00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:24,240
open three method org again this exactly

00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:24,240
this area that's by excellent by my

00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:30,150
skiing resorts this one is T selanne our

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:33,790
way right at maps all the pieces and

00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:35,890
rendered in a specific way yeah this is

00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:37,930
data you don't see on every of the tiles

00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:41,590
but just different layers at your

00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:42,790
different information alright skip over

00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:45,790
that and this is something that I've

00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:47,800
come up with myself I I'm a bit addicted

00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:49,210
to foursquare but I don't like giving

00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,910
foursquare data for the same reason I

00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:54,190
don't like giving Google Maps data so

00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:56,020
what I've come up with is an IDs that

00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:58,180
I'm making an application that allows

00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:59,860
you to check in in two places with no

00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:02,470
getting points for checking in getting

00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:03,880
points for contributing data so in this

00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,460
case the English National Opera has

00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:08,320
enough data so it's not very useful but

00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:10,750
there's lots of restaurants and around

00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,580
here that don't have a specific tax they

00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:14,380
don't have the address or they don't

00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:15,910
have the restaurants cuisine type where

00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:18,370
that's Italian our Chinese for example

00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:20,410
or lots of addresses are missing so I'm

00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:22,150
trying to turn it into an application

00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:24,880
that makes it fun to all the data to

00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:27,160
openstreetmap but I'm rubbish making

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,770
pretty things so we'll see how this

00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:32,560
continues alright this is what I had to

00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:33,790
say if you if you scan this QR code

00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,800
which you probably can do from the back

00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:37,600
end up at this URL where the slides

00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:41,230
aren't there yet they'll sort it out

00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:43,780
after the talk it also has the list with

00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:45,850
resources you can always send me an

00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:48,330
email a Derek Derek buttons you can send

00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:52,450
me tweets I try to be nice to people

00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:53,920
please leave feedback at join in I find

00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:57,370
it really important to know what you

00:37:53,920 --> 00:38:01,150
think of this talk so please go there so

00:37:57,370 --> 00:38:03,480
far are any questions yes go for it wait

00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:03,480
for the mic

00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:09,670
and I just wondered if you could get

00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:12,340
things like contact details when you

00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:14,230
said that you could access data so for

00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:15,820
example if you put a bounding box around

00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:17,350
London and you said get me all the

00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:19,420
telephone numbers or something like that

00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:21,280
or even if it went as far as email

00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:24,340
addresses for certain establishments

00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,940
like say restaurants or pubs all right

00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:29,200
yes that is actually possible to do

00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:31,240
whenever I go to a restaurant I've

00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,040
always sent out as much data as it can

00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:34,990
find about the place so that is opening

00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,780
times telephone numbers websites

00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:39,220
Wikipedia link sometimes and yes you can

00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:40,570
get the data out of it because all the

00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:42,760
data is available right you can do that

00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:44,920
through the except the API if you query

00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:47,080
for a note or a way that is a restaurant

00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:50,310
you get all of the tax with it so yeah

00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:52,270
that's absolutely possible hello um

00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:54,220
where's the best place to do my

00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:57,520
conversions for longitude latitude

00:38:54,220 --> 00:39:00,400
Easton's northerns and gps and which way

00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,840
do you think we should be moving which I

00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,400
didn't get to laugh that saw which way

00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:07,480
do you think we should be making the

00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:10,750
standard eastings northerns GPS are a

00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:14,080
long acute latitudes I think gps and

00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:16,480
wgs84 is used in so many other places

00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:19,000
besides the UK I think that'd be a

00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,060
really good standard but I can

00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,470
understand that for things like

00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:24,730
countryside maps you won't the better

00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:26,830
shape of the earth and in those cases

00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:29,640
the Ordnance Survey maps with nor teens

00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:33,820
and ease things is a better solution I

00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:35,380
never found it a real problem that the

00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:38,830
power that I'm looking for is 7 meters

00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:40,390
off I mean you can see if the part isn't

00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:43,600
there and just a little bit along right

00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:46,060
but to confer that I actually started

00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:47,560
working with two other guys on an

00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:50,020
extension to do the conversion between

00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:52,810
those coordinate systems I actually have

00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:55,150
some code up there better than in PHP

00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:56,470
but it's fairly slow so I've been

00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:59,050
starting to work on extension but I'm

00:39:56,470 --> 00:40:00,250
not quite done with that yet not

00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:04,750
hopefully that answered the questions

00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:08,190
all right perfect all right there's some

00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:08,190
more right down to damn

00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:17,110
hi I'm what's your experience with

00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:18,710
producing static Maps avid static map so

00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:20,420
anytime I've known that one

00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:23,180
OpenStreetMap data I actually have a

00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:24,860
whole rendering stack set up I imported

00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,390
dated I want to render I tweeted the

00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:28,490
style sheet and I just create an image

00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:30,290
out of it now open three my bill torque

00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:32,990
itself also has a link to create a

00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:36,350
static map as far as i know that works

00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:38,450
very well and there is a german site

00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:40,430
again i've found that actually creates a

00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:42,620
you're the aesthetic much yet but it is

00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:44,900
quite limited you know it gives roxy is

00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:48,350
limited and about spamming our server so

00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:50,300
we took it offline s'okay there was a

00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:52,550
german website i didn't hello SEO change

00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:54,620
yes no we're actually talking to the

00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:56,360
guys who provides a better way of doing

00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:58,610
this because basically what we're doing

00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:01,640
is they're just requesting all the

00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:04,850
towels they could find and because those

00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:06,530
of high zoom level tiles they don't not

00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:08,180
become prerendered all planets because

00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:10,820
it's just too much data so to get

00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:13,790
rendered on the fly for a zoom level 18

00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:15,740
and 19 now if you request 500 of them

00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:18,260
that takes quite a long time and that

00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:20,300
basically to garner we're rendering

00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:23,360
infrastructure so we don't allow people

00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:25,790
to scrape map tiles if you it's fine to

00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:27,680
using your website or mobile apps but it

00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:29,420
is not okay to download all the map

00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,490
tiles to have them offline in your

00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:33,110
device there's much better ways for

00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:35,270
doing that like download your data

00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:38,270
converting into vector data which is

00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:40,720
what most of the other map apps do but

00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:44,150
for static Maps I have my own setup

00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:47,030
which is not trivial but not too

00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:49,850
difficult in there is there is a

00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:52,550
mechanism because we use user actually

00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:55,580
Google static Maps API pin and that's I

00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:57,590
think gettin some sort of change anyway

00:41:55,580 --> 00:42:00,740
and we're looking into you know going

00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:03,820
with free air if you like so you say

00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:08,300
it's quite easy to implement an

00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:10,160
open-source way of generating what open

00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:13,310
source but I say you know what I mean

00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:17,360
look like say a commercial or restricted

00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:19,760
way of creating static Maps yeah sure I

00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,210
mean the only thing if you use any map

00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:27,190
dating

00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:29,720
to credit you're welcome one there hi

00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:31,430
along the lines of projections wouldn't

00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:34,130
it be easier perhaps to provide a way of

00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:35,780
rendering onto a surface I go as fit to

00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:38,390
actually match the shape the globe

00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:42,320
instead i'm not sure where i got a

00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:44,060
question sorry so is a way that machine

00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:46,070
back could provides a is they're doing a

00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:47,390
flat projection do it or rendered on to

00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:50,630
the Nightosphere me house using like

00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:53,089
canvas something oh like that i have not

00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:54,859
seen people acting creating globes on

00:42:53,089 --> 00:42:57,980
opens figment data where I can't see why

00:42:54,859 --> 00:42:59,420
that wouldn't work what I did see

00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:01,880
something where instead of putting it on

00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:04,010
paper they put it on clothes waterproof

00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,599
clothes that you can basically take out

00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:06,800
in the country's I mean how often have

00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,900
you been in the countryside with a map

00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,630
back at webbs it's kind of rubbish so

00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:13,849
they actually have a waterproof foldable

00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:15,890
map but I've never seen anybody doing it

00:43:13,849 --> 00:43:18,740
on a globe specifically but it would be

00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:23,540
cool to have but I don't know that it's

00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:27,440
are on there how complete is your UK

00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:31,580
coverage i would say UK coverage is

00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:35,330
excellence it's it doesn't go as far as

00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:37,550
deep ball one to 25,000 or deny survey

00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:40,339
maps and a country sites but I've yet to

00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:43,880
find a place where the parts that I was

00:43:40,339 --> 00:43:46,790
walking on where in maps London I would

00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:49,520
say is a lot better points of interest

00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:52,550
wise than Google Maps a lot better also

00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:54,920
more up-to-date so yes covers in the

00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:57,500
UK's excellence covers in Germany is

00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:59,270
excellent the Netherlands is very good

00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:02,330
but there's all the countries where I

00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:05,960
mean the community is fairly new and Ida

00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:08,119
maps aren't so good but that is mostly

00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:10,760
points of interest related not symmetric

00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:12,260
network related we don't have a hundred

00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:18,290
percent covers of all the roads in UK

00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:20,570
but it is way above 99 percent extension

00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:22,670
of that how good is your postcode data

00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:26,560
so postcode 8 is always an interesting

00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:26,560
one because the data isn't free right I

00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:33,500
think Royal Mail's being pushed to open

00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:34,220
up the paf data file and they are sort

00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,320
of leaning too

00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:39,830
which direction they already have opened

00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:41,359
code point open which we are still

00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:43,460
trying to figure out whether we can use

00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:46,670
that legally but of course she can

00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:49,430
overlay that on a map rights as for post

00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:51,920
code coverage for buildings is I

00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:54,500
wouldn't say it is usable enough to be

00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,119
able to rely on it you'd be better

00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:58,280
relying on actually entering the

00:44:56,119 --> 00:45:01,369
addresses and the names of restaurants

00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:02,900
than asking for postcards but wearing

00:45:01,369 --> 00:45:04,790
the postcode database which you can

00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:06,890
download and do anything you want but

00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:09,410
really mapping that to coordinates of

00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:13,609
course you can do but not as part of

00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:15,380
openstreetmap at the moment writing it's

00:45:13,609 --> 00:45:17,720
one more question and the thing that

00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:19,880
sort of has to be the last one right and

00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:23,270
yeah sorry Fitz bit mean direct I mean

00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:25,070
I'm struck by your like example of you

00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:27,200
know sharing pubs that happen to be open

00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:29,119
at a particular time a guy but it

00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:31,849
strikes me that but if there's only 500

00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:33,740
of you walking around the UK then that

00:45:31,849 --> 00:45:35,570
information you know I phone numbers or

00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:40,790
cuisines or whatever is going to rapidly

00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:42,349
get out of date yes so the first

00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:43,760
challenge is getting all the data in

00:45:42,349 --> 00:45:46,730
there the second challenge is keeping

00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:49,010
all the data up-to-date right and the

00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:51,020
only way how you can do that is by

00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:53,570
having mappers that take care of a

00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:55,970
specific parts I mean the area where I

00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:58,849
live every time I notice a shop is gone

00:45:55,970 --> 00:46:01,310
orny who has a new name or whatever

00:45:58,849 --> 00:46:03,230
burned out then I tend to map that

00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:04,580
instantly right so it will be a that my

00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:06,560
area is fairly up today but as other

00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:10,550
parts of the UK where it is more of a

00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:11,960
problem yeah that is a challenge but the

00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:13,910
only way how we can fix this is having

00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:17,150
more people taking care of their own

00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:19,430
blocks or own local environment and it

00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:22,280
doesn't cost you a lot of time and I I

00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:25,040
find it's quite relaxing today so any

00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:28,130
one more question there well I don't

00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:29,300
mike is really support for photos for

00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:34,609
example you could take photos of the

00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:36,680
public going to visit or restaurant all

00:46:34,609 --> 00:46:39,050
this is sort of attached binary data in

00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:41,000
general there are the only way how you

00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:43,400
can attach binary data is by linking it

00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,410
we have links to Wikipedia we have links

00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:48,410
to flickr actually flickr

00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:50,270
has like a specific tag that allows you

00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:52,880
to tag things to openstreetmap as well

00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:56,360
which you can query on we don't store

00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:58,610
binary data and openstreetmap itself but

00:46:56,360 --> 00:47:00,290
there's links to it quite a lot mostly

00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:01,940
if people doing this surveys then

00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:03,230
linking it to the original photos so

00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:07,100
that you have proof that is all that

00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:09,620
clear alright thanks very much guys I

00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:12,380
hope it was useful slides will be online

00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:15,080
there later and as well as a long list

00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:17,440
of resources for you to explore thank

00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,440
you very much

00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,280
