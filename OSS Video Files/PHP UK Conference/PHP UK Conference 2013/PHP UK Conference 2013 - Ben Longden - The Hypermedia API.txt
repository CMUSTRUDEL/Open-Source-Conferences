Title: PHP UK Conference 2013 - Ben Longden - The Hypermedia API
Publication date: 2013-04-22
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2013
Description: 
	As experienced developers we're regularly told that very few API's out there are really RESTful, and sometimes we're even told why and how they could be. But what is the process of actually designing an API that uses hypermedia, and what is hypermedia anyway? This talk takes the listener through the process of designing an API structure up front that uses hypermedia at it's core over HTTP, what considerations do you need when selecting a media type to represent your resource and what is out there to help you document it for others to use. This session is recommended for architects and developers alike and will give a good grounding in writing excellent, self-explanatory Hypermedia APIs.
