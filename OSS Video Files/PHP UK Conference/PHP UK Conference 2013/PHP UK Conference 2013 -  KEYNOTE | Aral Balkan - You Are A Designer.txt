hi everybody thank you so much for that

00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:20,060
for that introduction it's actually

00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:23,390
lovely to be standing here today four

00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:25,160
years ago in a different venue I did the

00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:28,060
opening keynote for the PHP UK

00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:31,820
conference and it was the very first

00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:34,580
opening keynote I ever did so it's

00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,620
really quite an honor to be back here to

00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:40,250
be asked back thank you for having me

00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:42,320
and I just want to say thank you to the

00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:45,200
PHP UK conference for believing me for

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,760
you in me four years ago and having me

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,280
open their conference because I know how

00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,469
much work goes into organising one of

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,719
these things the people that you see in

00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:55,850
the PHP UK shirts have been working for

00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:58,100
months tirelessly to bring you this

00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:01,120
conference so I just want to say it's

00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:06,410
really really lovely to be here

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:08,570
hi my name's are all and I'm an

00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:10,729
experienced designer not going to be

00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:14,539
talking to you about PHP today one of

00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:16,429
those few non PHP coding sessions you

00:01:14,539 --> 00:01:19,970
might know this term better as user

00:01:16,429 --> 00:01:21,950
experience designer but I feel that the

00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:23,660
term user has become redundant and

00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,479
unnecessary because if you think about

00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:29,530
it how much of our days and our modern

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,670
lives are spent interacting with objects

00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:34,849
interacting with things that people have

00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:37,789
created we're all users right the user

00:01:34,849 --> 00:01:40,160
is redundant in that term so I call

00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:44,050
myself an experienced designer which

00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:48,470
means that I design things for people

00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:53,450
I'm also a developer which means that I

00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:54,920
make things again for people and I don't

00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,569
believe that these two things are

00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,450
separate I think they're both par the

00:01:56,569 --> 00:02:03,050
same thing what I call experience design

00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:08,020
so basically what I like to do is I try

00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:08,020
to make things that make people happy

00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:15,739
yeah unfortunately what happens usually

00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:20,620
in my own interactions with things is I

00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:20,620
end up feeling frustrated and sad

00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:29,300
who gets angry at things here things

00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,080
that don't work right angry emotional

00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,240
right

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,940
not just huh it didn't work but more

00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:38,480
like why didn't you work right and

00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:41,300
that's normal because we have emotional

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,180
relationships with the objects that we

00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:46,610
interact with so now that we've shared

00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:49,750
this intimate moment I think we're at a

00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:52,670
point where I can show you my toilet

00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:54,530
this isn't actually my toilet this is a

00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:57,830
toilet that I had in one of my hotel

00:02:54,530 --> 00:03:00,320
rooms and this was my experience after

00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:03,920
having used the toilet this is simulated

00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,990
don't worry yeah it's a bit too early in

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,580
the morning for that but this is my

00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:10,070
experience as a guy having used the

00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:13,100
toilet I want to flush where's the flush

00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:15,730
I don't know um it's definitely not

00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:19,070
there okay maybe it's on the other side

00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:21,740
you know uh nope it's not there maybe

00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:23,870
it's a proximity sensor no that's not

00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:28,760
working did they hide the flush behind

00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:31,940
delayed no it's not there oh oh oh right

00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:35,570
look above the counter above my toiletry

00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,980
bag that's where the flush is right and

00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:39,860
it doesn't even look like a flush and if

00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:43,160
you if you if you push that in then it

00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:44,870
flushes the toilet let's break this down

00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:48,950
to find out what went wrong

00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:51,590
okay let's break this down now notice

00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:54,290
the counter okay about one third of the

00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:56,810
way at the top that forms a natural

00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:59,750
barrier grouping everything above it and

00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:02,690
everything underneath it look at what's

00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:05,720
close to the toilet the toilet paper is

00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:07,580
close to it right so by proximity I make

00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,770
an association between those two things

00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:12,470
I know immediately intuitively

00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:14,390
that the toilet paper is somehow related

00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,260
to the toilet even if I've never seen

00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,970
one before

00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,160
just by the fact that they're next to

00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:23,270
each other what's the problem that's

00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:26,000
where the flush is right completely away

00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:28,610
grouped away with that barrier cutting

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,740
it off so not where I would think it is

00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:34,220
related to the toilet right proximity

00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:35,540
implies relation and what we're doing so

00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,850
think about that when

00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,930
designing your interfaces as well right

00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,850
and when you're designing your apps

00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,680
things you put together people will

00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:45,920
immediately correlate as being related

00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:48,310
to each other right and as a guy this

00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:51,770
was my view as I was using that toilet

00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:53,900
and where is the flush it's not even in

00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:55,970
my view if something is out of sight

00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,280
it's out of mind when we're designing

00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:00,140
user interfaces we call this layering

00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,480
right we try to find the features that

00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:04,820
are most important bring them out so

00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,380
that they're in sight but the features

00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,140
that are not as important we layer away

00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:12,020
knowing that they will be out of sight

00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:14,030
and probably out of mind right so this

00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,710
is another toilet this talk is not all

00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:18,020
about toilets just because in case

00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:20,000
you're wondering and this was a

00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,800
different hotel room and again this

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,660
toilet worked really well you know it's

00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,610
a beautiful toilet it supported my bomb

00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:28,820
it was great it did everything a toilet

00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:30,770
should do right and it had a flush and

00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,270
the flush was great had a little you

00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,440
know little one for you number one the

00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:35,210
bigger one for your number two is

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,580
awesome I was like is a great flush

00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:39,980
right but look what happens when they

00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:43,430
put the two together okay this is me

00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:46,310
opening the lid of the toilet and it

00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:48,860
covers the flush right toilet worked

00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:51,290
great flush worked great together they

00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,760
didn't work so great right because they

00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:55,700
didn't think about how those two

00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:57,530
elements fit together this is what Steve

00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:00,710
Jobs was talking about when he said we

00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:02,720
make the whole widget not toilets but

00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:05,540
about having control over the whole

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:09,320
experience because an experience is only

00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:13,520
as strong and experiences only as good

00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:15,230
as its weakest link right so what could

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,520
be that weakest link in the applications

00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,860
that we create it could be a third party

00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,260
API that we don't have the source code

00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,760
for right what happens when sorry a

00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,200
third party API that we have no control

00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,360
over what happens when that API goes

00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,310
down we're screwed

00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,410
do our users care that it was a third

00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,030
party API that went down no as far as

00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:35,660
they're concerned our app went down

00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:37,940
right if we use source code if we use if

00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:41,000
we use components for which we don't

00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:42,950
have the source code and we can't make

00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,280
changes that becomes the weakest link

00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:47,720
right so I travel around a lot I was at

00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,320
a hotel and I'm

00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:54,140
this machine it's a juice machine for

00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:56,810
getting juice and when I approach

00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:58,640
objects I approached them naively right

00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:00,680
I think it's a very important trait to

00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,560
have as a designer I walk up to them and

00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:06,620
I go hi tell me about yourself

00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:09,380
and they do they usually do tell me how

00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:11,000
to use them right here it's pretty clear

00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,710
where you're supposed to put the glass

00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,400
right where am I supposed to put the

00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:17,840
glass right that big round bit over

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,820
there right what does that say it

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,550
doesn't speak to me but it says put the

00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,590
glass here like yeah and then how do I

00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:27,380
get the juice it's pretty clear right

00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:29,150
we've got arrows saying push me all of

00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,640
the affordances are there it's beautiful

00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:36,280
so I did I put my glass there this was

00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:37,700
my experience I'm pressing it oh crap

00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:43,780
okay

00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:47,120
it lied to me there I was naive innocent

00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:51,560
you know to tell me how to use you as I

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,330
put it there it lied to me right and

00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,770
this happens very often so it became a

00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,850
little game where do I put the glass

00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:58,430
awesome

00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:01,130
things tell you how to use them by how

00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:03,710
they look we call this an affordance

00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:05,630
right an affordance or affordances are

00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:07,250
important we see how important they are

00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:10,100
when we look at a platform like iOS

00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:11,360
where you know maybe in to some degree

00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,010
we've gone a little overboard with

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,380
skeuomorphism where we're taking the

00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:17,470
forms of things and applying them to the

00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:20,690
digital realm right so this for example

00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:23,060
looks like a key but it's actually a

00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:25,640
skeuomorphic key because it's an

00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:28,340
electronic key it's not a real key that

00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,470
you turn right it's not a mechanical key

00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,940
it's an electronic key how do how do

00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:34,789
electronic keys normally look like they

00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,560
look like cards right usually with a

00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:38,240
little chip inside them but they made it

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,700
look like a key so immediately I know

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,830
that it's a key right and it worked

00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,630
really well as well you know this was me

00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:47,060
trying to get into my hotel room and I

00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:49,100
insert it and it worked I could get in

00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,810
but how is that different from a

00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:54,260
real-world key what I did when I first

00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:56,480
put it in is I tried to turn it because

00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:59,209
it looks like a key it should act like a

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,430
key right so even if turning it does

00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:03,620
nothing at all they could have added

00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:05,960
in because it's an expectation they've

00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:08,180
created and that's the biggest challenge

00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,980
with skeuomorphism as well when you're

00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:12,589
when something looks like something it

00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:14,810
should behave like that thing and making

00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:18,830
it behave like that thing is much harder

00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:24,620
than making it look like that thing so I

00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:26,930
was on a flight and I was having a a

00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:30,620
small bottle of champagne and some chips

00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:32,029
as you do right and I want to open the

00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,950
ball of champagne and I was like this is

00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:37,550
so cool it's even got a court these guys

00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:39,410
are also so that's like this is meets me

00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:48,020
opening a champagne it's get a pop get

00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:51,500
ready for it what the what the what

00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:53,630
what what happened there that's not what

00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,520
I was expecting never in my adult life

00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:59,300
when I've opened the bottle of champagne

00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:02,089
has there been another cap you know it's

00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:04,310
usually the court right so what did they

00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:05,870
do here you know this is actually the

00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:07,940
ball of champagne great this would have

00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:11,420
been perfect but no they had to put that

00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:14,240
cork like thing skeuomorphic cork on

00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:15,830
this ball of champagne to really say hey

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,490
it's champagne

00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:21,440
don't miss the fact that it's champagne

00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:24,020
but it tricked me again right and these

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,580
guys must have been crazy about getting

00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,020
us to really understand that it's

00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:29,270
champagne to make sure that we didn't

00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:32,180
miss it cuz this was the back of the cup

00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:35,390
as well this is really champagne okay

00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:40,550
this is definitely definitely champagne

00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:44,750
that noise tells me it's time for trains

00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:48,470
subways and bending machines ticket

00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:50,570
machines what is up with ticket machines

00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:52,459
it's almost like every sadist in the

00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:55,490
world has a job designing ticket

00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:58,880
machines of one sort or another this was

00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:00,200
one in Belgium and this is a friend of

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,450
mine who knows how to use it buying

00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:07,000
tickets it says tickets train card

00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:09,829
passing cards okay or die Oh bowl OFI oh

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,360
okay that sounds interesting okay I

00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:13,880
don't know what to choose maybe I'll get

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,960
a ticket great let me get a ticket who's

00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,060
like a standard tick

00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:21,070
we can't ticket a senior ticket or would

00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:21,070
you like a large families children I

00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,640
don't know wow what else can I buy here

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,350
but you know what the worst thing about

00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,970
it is do you see that thing over there

00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:32,000
on a touchscreen that should never be on

00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:34,070
a touchscreen that's a mouse cursor that

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,740
sort of thing just drives me up the wall

00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:38,600
I mean we're not gonna talk about the

00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:41,150
color or any of the other bits of it you

00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:44,360
know and if you thought that that was

00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:46,820
bad if you've been to San Francisco if

00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:49,430
you've been on the BART you know until

00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:51,620
you have you haven't seen bad okay so I

00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:54,020
was in San Francisco and I want to get

00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:56,420
somewhere to meet my friend so I didn't

00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:59,110
know how to use it but everywhere on the

00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:01,640
barriers everywhere it said get clipper

00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:03,020
right so I didn't want to ask someone

00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,120
how to use the BART I mean I've been on

00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:06,740
subways right I was like I know what I

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,590
need to do get clipper I told you

00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:11,930
everywhere get clipper and so easy you

00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:14,270
loaded your target can't go right it's

00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:15,800
awesome it's the American Way it's great

00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:18,350
it sounds like I just need to get a

00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,240
clipper and my life will be awesome um

00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:22,310
so I looked around from machines where I

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,610
can get clipper and I saw these guys

00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:28,610
look and clipper look at that look do

00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:30,890
you see that clipper I was like yes yes

00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:33,380
the path has been enlightened in front

00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:34,550
of me I just need to walk it so I went

00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,620
to the machine the machine was actually

00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:38,060
quite delightful to use for it's a four

00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,270
ticket machine so I mean that that

00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:45,130
rarely happens um and and I got my card

00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:48,260
right and I went up to the barriers and

00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:50,090
whoa why isn't it working so I went up

00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:52,520
to the the woman who was behind the

00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:54,530
counter waited in line I was like um I

00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:59,030
got a clipper but it's not working she's

00:12:54,530 --> 00:13:01,190
like it's not a clipper pick a clipper

00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:03,800
like it's not a clipper that's not a

00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:06,380
clipper and she was right she was right

00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:09,290
because anyone can plainly see that this

00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:12,200
is not a clipper machine this is a Muni

00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:14,210
machine right that's just that's just

00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,190
clear as light of day I mean I don't

00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:18,620
know what I was thinking I must have

00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:21,950
been high or something right I did not

00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:23,930
see that distinction and then so I

00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:26,570
started looking for the clipper machines

00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:28,430
in the same station right and it's

00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,880
apparently this where you can see the

00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,200
only

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,980
Clippers signage is that tiny little

00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:35,300
card at the top okay and at this point I

00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,470
kind of knew I was gonna have a bad day

00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,330
right

00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:40,070
looking at this machine I mean you can

00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:41,930
see how things have been bordered and

00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:43,550
there's instructions everywhere let me

00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,200
take you through how to use this machine

00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:47,120
because I don't think any of you are

00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,690
sadistic enough to actually come up with

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:53,660
it for one thing there is a scheduled

00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:55,700
Affairs so the first thing you do when

00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,740
you start using this machine is you look

00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,720
through this manual scheduled affairs

00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:01,520
and you find the fare for where you're

00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,220
going to go to I think I was going to

00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,970
24th Street and I picked my fare which

00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:10,730
is 175 and then you as the human

00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:13,700
remember that number okay so already the

00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:15,590
machine has started making you work for

00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,180
it instead of the machine working for

00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:19,070
you right it's using your memory

00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,510
register to store that because

00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:22,130
apparently memory is not cheap or

00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:25,250
something I don't know all right so I've

00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:26,450
got it 175 in my head and and then I

00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,920
looked at the machine of course they

00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:30,320
don't want to make it too easy for you

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,420
like you know lining those up would just

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,550
be too easy there'd be no difficulty to

00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:36,950
this game whatsoever you get bored and

00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:38,480
go home right they don't want to do that

00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:40,360
so I was like okay I guess I need to

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,160
press one of these but how do I start

00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,690
how do I start how do you how you start

00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,460
something is really really important

00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:47,960
telling people how they start and the

00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:50,630
only thing I could find was this touch

00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,670
card on disk too right but I I have a

00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:54,110
slight existential problem here because

00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:56,330
I don't have the card so it's like a

00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:57,530
chicken and egg thing right so I was

00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:59,000
like okay you know what I'm gonna go

00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:01,130
back and ask the woman so I waited in

00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,790
line again I got to the front I was like

00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:07,160
I'm really sorry but um so do I need to

00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,570
buy a card from you that I refill from

00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,400
there and by this point she's looking at

00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:12,560
me like I'm rather daft right

00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,900
she's like no just put your money in and

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,900
that'll start the process but nowhere

00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:20,480
does it say that right and then it'll

00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:23,390
give you car a card like okay alright so

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,620
I go back I go back to this thing and by

00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,720
the way I mean it has a lot of

00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,790
information there for you it tells you

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,770
tickets and magnets don't mix and it's

00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:33,140
got this big magnet great that's really

00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:36,820
good to know I just had a lot of magnets

00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:40,160
in my pocket thank you for saving me

00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:42,800
from that so you put your money in to

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,509
begin right so I did I put a doll

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,610
and this is what it said it said cash

00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:48,980
inserted one dollar minimum ticket value

00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:51,170
175 which suited me just fine because my

00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:53,119
ticket cost 175 what I had in my head

00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:55,910
I've still got it in my head so I put

00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:59,119
another dollar in right awesome and then

00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:01,249
it said wow you got two dollars okay now

00:15:59,119 --> 00:16:04,279
my problem is I want a ticket

00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:05,839
apparently that cost 175 and think about

00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:08,029
it they're not even I'm not thinking in

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,489
the problem domain about where I want to

00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:13,639
go a ticket to somewhere no I want a 175

00:16:10,489 --> 00:16:16,670
ticket ok great how do you think I go

00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:18,610
from 2 dollars to 175 how do I get my

00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:20,899
ticket which is what I really want to do

00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:23,629
you won't be able to come up with this

00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:27,230
seriously this is how you do it you

00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:34,610
press the subtract 5 cent button as many

00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:36,170
times as it takes to get down to 175 and

00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:39,559
then at the end once you've gone through

00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:41,869
this whole process it goes and gives you

00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:43,610
your ticket and it's it's like a lottery

00:16:41,869 --> 00:16:47,329
win it's like these jackpots I think

00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:48,980
that you won yes here's your tickets

00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:57,559
you're awesome

00:16:48,980 --> 00:17:00,829
you beat the game Wow so that was a

00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:03,860
subway what about the Train I was on a

00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:05,360
train recently in first class here in

00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:07,669
the UK because I want to plug my laptop

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,839
in one of the reasons that you go to

00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:10,039
first-class in the UK if there are

00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:11,659
people from Scandinavian countries

00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:12,559
you're probably going but you do that

00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:14,329
everywhere I don't know why you're

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:18,020
saying that in like a semi out German

00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:20,270
accent but um so this was my experience

00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:21,730
there's my macbook adapter and I'm about

00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:26,959
to plug it in now you know what's coming

00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:29,750
yeah oh oh okay all right that didn't

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,000
quite work right of course it's very

00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,649
difficult to keep a determined geek down

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,740
because I was traveling with an

00:17:33,649 --> 00:17:39,440
extension cable alright it's they didn't

00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:41,299
get me that time but what's the problem

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,159
here you can see that the table works

00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:45,380
great it didn't collapse or anything you

00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:46,940
can see the plug works great but they

00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:49,309
didn't think about how they go together

00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:51,110
again like that toilet but this wasn't

00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:52,549
the worst experience I had on the train

00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:55,480
the worst experience came when I was

00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:59,110
going to leave the Train and

00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:00,670
I was stuck I was at the door and I

00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:01,870
couldn't leave the train because if the

00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:05,260
door wouldn't open I didn't know how to

00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:07,840
open this train door this is why this is

00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:10,330
how you open that train door okay when

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,990
the door becomes unlocked automatically

00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:17,700
you lowered the window you put your arm

00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:20,590
out the window and you open the door I

00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:22,810
was seriously stuck until I saw this

00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:24,130
sign I was like that's okay I'm stuck on

00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:27,060
this train I'm gonna have wonderful

00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:30,130
adventures and meet some amazing people

00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:32,440
so you might be thinking my gosh what

00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:37,300
sort of idiot designs something like

00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:41,400
this right what horrible design but wait

00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:44,680
up there was a time when this was

00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:48,430
excellent design there was a time when

00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:51,670
this was awesome design when this was an

00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:53,800
old train right there was a time when

00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:56,800
this train did not have automatically

00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,540
locking doors now what happens if a

00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,610
train doesn't have automatically locking

00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:02,650
doors and you accidentally because it's

00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:07,210
easy to do open the door and you step

00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:08,890
outside you have a bad day right you

00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:13,210
have a bad day and that day probably

00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:15,250
lasts for a while so there was a time

00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:17,530
before automatically locking doors this

00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:19,600
was awesome because if the result of a

00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:23,020
gesture is going to be so catastrophic

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,730
that you might die or in our case lose

00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:27,670
data which is the same thing for us

00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:31,060
right then you want to make that as hard

00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:33,370
as possible for people to do so this was

00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:36,760
great design what happened things

00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:39,360
changed right the circumstances changed

00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:42,130
the context changed it got a new feature

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,170
automatically locking doors what they

00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:47,110
should have done at that point is to

00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:48,550
review every other feature and how it

00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:50,290
relates to it because every feature

00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:51,580
affects every other feature in the

00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:53,410
applications that you're building in the

00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:55,090
products that you're building they

00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:57,160
didn't do that at that point they

00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:59,110
stopped iterating and they were lazy

00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:02,230
about it and hence we got this farce

00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:04,510
that we have great design transformed

00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:07,960
into ridiculous design with just the

00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:09,639
addition of one feature okay

00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,950
and you see this in a lot of places I

00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:14,139
mean I was in a bathroom and there were

00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:14,799
these faucets that's press-on auto-off

00:20:14,139 --> 00:20:17,169
okay

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:20,860
perfect but they changed some of them

00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:23,649
press on auto off nope that's a lift you

00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:27,159
know they didn't change the label and we

00:20:23,649 --> 00:20:28,419
see this so often in applications so

00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:31,179
that's a bit of laziness there's

00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:33,610
laziness and then there's really not

00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:36,820
respecting the user's time this was a

00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:38,919
vending machine and I think it was at

00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:40,659
the airport and I wanted to get some

00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:42,190
water so I walked up to it to find out

00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:46,059
how much the water was so I could put my

00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:48,970
money in right there was a problem do

00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:51,509
you see the problem there no prices on

00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:53,980
it at all none of the items had prices

00:20:51,509 --> 00:20:57,369
like how do I know how much money to put

00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:59,289
in ah they had thought of that yes in

00:20:57,369 --> 00:21:02,919
this stick on the sticker it says press

00:20:59,289 --> 00:21:04,929
selection for price now that's a bit

00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:07,600
succinct I realized that what that meant

00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:09,940
was you look at a bottle like let's say

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,580
it's on b3 you want to find out how much

00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:15,720
the bottle at b3 costs you go over there

00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:18,399
you press b3 and it shows you the price

00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,110
they got so inspired by mystery meat

00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:21,789
navigation from the early days of the

00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:22,869
web that they implemented this interface

00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:24,789
it's amazing

00:21:22,869 --> 00:21:27,730
right instead of telling you immediately

00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:29,440
at a glance how much everything costs if

00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:31,090
you want to find out three things let's

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,249
say you have a limited amount of change

00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:36,519
on you you'd have to enter each one's

00:21:33,249 --> 00:21:38,740
value separately right very clear that

00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:42,850
they don't respect the users effort and

00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:44,919
and that's a sad thing so oh I think

00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:46,629
we're coming up on one of the the best

00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:51,419
the my favorite parts of the

00:21:46,629 --> 00:21:51,419
presentation which I call wrong

00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:06,680
elevators Wow elevators are the gift

00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:09,860
that keeps giving for a user experience

00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:12,080
talk they really are that first elevator

00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:15,320
that you saw with the blinking lights

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,340
where every light was blinking I think

00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,370
that was in the Netherlands or Belgium

00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:20,930
again and that mean the guy who tore the

00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:22,670
woman who designed it must have had a

00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:24,200
blink fetish of some sort because every

00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:26,000
light on that elevator blinks and what

00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,040
do you lose when every light blinks you

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,870
lose the read the reason that the

00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,190
current level blinks right or the

00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:33,650
current level comes on as you're going

00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:35,420
up to show you progress you kind of go

00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:38,270
oh my gosh am I gonna die is something

00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,650
going wrong here right I'm not even

00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:42,290
gonna talk about this one this is in the

00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:44,360
States Wow but what's the problem I

00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:47,270
don't get this with elevators because

00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:49,460
you know we've we've solved the elevator

00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:51,740
problem I'd like to think you know it

00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:54,440
might be a bit naive about this but over

00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:56,600
the ages we've iterated a solution to

00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:59,240
the elevator control panel problem that

00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:00,710
just works right what is it buttons that

00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,180
look like buttons so that you know that

00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:04,460
you want to press them right that's

00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:06,020
number one buttons that are arranged

00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:08,150
according to the arrangement of the

00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:09,920
floor so it's intuitive if you press a

00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:11,300
button that's higher than the one that's

00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,280
lower you know you're going to a higher

00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:17,360
floor it's amazing how that works right

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:20,030
so this is amazingly intuitive and yet

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:23,120
we seem to have a problem accepting this

00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:26,210
solution in Lithuania I ran into this

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,950
lift that that is a control panel for a

00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:31,550
lift it's not some sort of weird Cylon

00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:34,520
calculator but it actually has a

00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:36,050
calculator keypad and you can't see it

00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:39,110
too well in this picture but it was

00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:41,510
shiny and glassy you know and what does

00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:43,670
that remind me of my phone so what do I

00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:45,890
immediately know how to do I know how to

00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:47,600
use this it's like my phone so I tap it

00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:49,760
right so this was me trying to go up to

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,460
my room tap oh nothing

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,780
tap oh nothing tap oh it doesn't look

00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:57,290
like a button bites a button I need to

00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:59,780
push it okay fine I can live with that

00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:02,720
it did lie to me coming back down oh

00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:05,330
that was interesting what do i press ah

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,960
I guess zero let me press zero and see

00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:12,820
what happens

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:17,490
Aaron we took something without an error

00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:17,490
condition and added one to it

00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:23,470
elevators do not by design have an error

00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:28,600
condition you cannot go to a floor that

00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:30,310
does not exist I mean look at what they

00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,930
did they even have a minus sign in the

00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:35,380
decimal point what are you supposed to

00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:37,090
do math well I want to go to the floor

00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:41,260
too but I think I'll do that as three

00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:45,220
mine at five minus three yes who's on

00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:47,020
floor 3.2 today I don't know maybe there

00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:51,190
was a floor 3.2 and I missed it I missed

00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:55,240
the game and I ran into this friend

00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:57,100
again in Wales a few months ago and in

00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,530
another hotel and this is what they done

00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:04,750
to it though I love this this is what

00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:06,400
they had done to the same elevator do

00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:10,480
you see what they've done this is genius

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:14,170
they hacked it okay they hacked it to

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,090
remove all the noise right because the

00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:18,490
only buttons that really make sense are

00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:20,410
the floors that you can go to right so

00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:22,000
they've removed all the noise by hacking

00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:24,280
it themselves I don't know if you can

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,520
see if they actually even like gaffer

00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:29,170
taped over the display as well but of

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,480
course those buttons are still there

00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:33,880
I checked right the buttons are still

00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,760
there so if you actually press it there

00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:41,170
error but you can't see it that's error

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:44,260
happening okay over there and all

00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:46,300
because for some reason they didn't go

00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:49,030
with the conventions and the

00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:51,850
expectations that people have for an

00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:53,800
elevator control panel right and

00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:55,660
expectations are really important

00:25:53,800 --> 00:26:00,630
meeting expectations are really

00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:00,630
important because people have them right

00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:12,100
and all of this stuff is really

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:14,080
important too it really impacts our

00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:16,630
lives because we have these experiences

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,010
day in and day out and to see why it's

00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:20,679
really important let's go back to the

00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:25,200
beginning to the very beginning where we

00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:28,600
all start out helpless helpless and

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:31,150
completely completely in the control of

00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:33,640
other people right who look after us

00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:35,980
take care of us etc and we start seeing

00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:38,500
that there are people out there who are

00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:40,750
in control who can affect things who can

00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,130
change things who know everything it

00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:44,470
seems when you're a baby when you're a

00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:47,590
kid right and we start seeing these

00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:53,590
people as super people and somewhere

00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:57,010
between puberty and extreme old age we

00:26:53,590 --> 00:27:01,120
become these people right we become this

00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:03,070
guy and his female counterpart and what

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,630
happens when we finally we've gone

00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:06,750
through all of those stages we've gone

00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:09,130
through puberty for goodness sake and

00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:10,960
just to get to a point where we can

00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:14,130
change the world we can affect change

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:18,970
right we're in control this happens

00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:22,090
right what the heck is that is that some

00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:24,220
other language is it like what and when

00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:27,700
I see a control panel like this which is

00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:30,130
for a washing machine I feel like that

00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:34,390
little baby again but trapped in the

00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:38,890
body of an adult I feel enfeebled I am

00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:41,500
bothered I get frustrated I get angry be

00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:44,650
bothered being bothered is the first

00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:47,710
step if you don't notice the problems

00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:49,960
around you if you internalize them even

00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:51,970
worse if you see them as a rite of

00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,549
passage we're never going to be able to

00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:56,590
change things right and that's what we

00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:59,410
do we get a system that's very hard to

00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:01,630
use and because of the nature of us as

00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:03,940
geeks we see that as a challenge we work

00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:05,320
through it we find out how it works even

00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,750
though it's ridiculously hard and should

00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,760
never have been that hard and then some

00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:12,429
of us see it as a rite of passage right

00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,799
I've gone through all that crap and then

00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:15,400
a noob comes over and you're like hey

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,810
noob

00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,810
he's like this is really complicated

00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:24,250
that's because you're a noob noob right

00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:26,860
no no that's the point where you go yeah

00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:29,050
you know what it is overly complicated

00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:31,750
yeah I spent half a year trying to

00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:33,400
figure this out but you're right it is

00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:35,500
overly complicated and we should make it

00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,760
simpler okay just because I went through

00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:39,640
it doesn't mean you have to go through

00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:41,440
it so washing machines bane of my

00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,600
existence so I thought you know what how

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,060
would I design it let me think about my

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,100
process what do I need to do right so

00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:49,990
what do I what I normally do is I have a

00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,540
lot of black stuff I don't know if it

00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:54,430
comes with being a designer I don't know

00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:56,500
but I separate all my black stuff out

00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:58,360
and all the whites because I've kind of

00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,800
realized over the years to separate the

00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,930
colored from the whites because cuz cuz

00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:04,630
if otherwise you get pink stuff but it

00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:07,180
just seems to happen and I put some

00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:09,250
detergents and I put some softener in

00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:12,040
there and then I turned the style from

00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:14,440
zero to four why do I turn it from zero

00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:16,780
to four goodness knows I had an

00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:19,690
ex-girlfriend she said you know use

00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:21,190
program for it works and that was it she

00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:24,000
actually toured us out of the thing for

00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:28,090
me and said cool why don't I care

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,700
because I'm not interested in the act of

00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:33,130
washing clothes washing clothes

00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:35,290
interests me less than most things in

00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:38,770
the world what I'm interested in is

00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:41,920
having clean clothes I don't care how I

00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:43,600
get there there could be for all I care

00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:46,120
little treadmills and hamsters running

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:50,110
on them in my washing machine licking my

00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:52,660
clothes clean that's fine I don't care

00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:55,330
how the machine works I'm interested in

00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:57,730
clean clothes not washing clothes so I

00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:59,650
put program for on and it says to me

00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:01,390
something I mean I don't know what it

00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:03,070
says I think it's happy there's a happy

00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:06,040
smiley face

00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:08,320
I don't know what the snake is and maybe

00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:13,180
there's promise of Pi later I don't know

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:15,550
I don't know all I know is I need to

00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:17,560
press this button and it starts the

00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:19,330
Machine right that's what it does and

00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,750
it's always done it and I'm happy with

00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:21,670
that

00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:23,980
right of course I always forget that I

00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:26,550
also have to set the dryer which for

00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:29,500
mine means keeping your finger on that

00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:33,130
button for like a

00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:34,809
okay until it slowly counts up it's like

00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:36,940
I'm here all day I don't know what

00:30:34,809 --> 00:30:39,220
you're complaining about it's fine it's

00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:43,480
fun I'm enjoying this touch me longer

00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:45,580
yeah Wow

00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,350
how would I design it this is the

00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:50,049
washing machine of today right

00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:51,820
and look it exposes all of its inner

00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:53,380
complexity to us all of those control

00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:56,770
panels I have to make all the decisions

00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:59,920
why it's the expert at washing clothes

00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:01,450
I'm not why am i programming it it

00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,320
should be telling me how to wash the

00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:04,660
clothes right

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,190
and ideally to just be giving me clean

00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:08,230
clothes and it's not just the Machine I

00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:11,559
have this whole process around it I sort

00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:13,299
my clothes I go and buy my softener and

00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:14,710
my detergent I need to know which ones

00:31:13,299 --> 00:31:18,429
those are and how much to put of those

00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:21,309
right know how I would do it I've got my

00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:23,710
clothes sorted right so someone who

00:31:21,309 --> 00:31:26,350
knows how to wash clothes not me would

00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:29,200
know how each of those batches should be

00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:31,720
washed best right why don't we give that

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,250
responsibility to the Machine all right

00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,320
because that's what it should be doing

00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:36,940
it's the experts right so maybe those

00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,950
are my Cotton's knows my delicates maybe

00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:40,330
at some point I have a kid and baby care

00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:42,070
stuff right I do a little bit of

00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:43,450
research around that's a big category of

00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:46,210
stuff and that needs to be washed

00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:48,460
differently but do I care about how it's

00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:50,290
washed no it needs to know that right

00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:52,240
what about this softener and the

00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:54,790
detergent how much to put in if it knows

00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,799
what kind of clothes there are there it

00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:58,840
being the expert will know how much

00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:01,179
detergent and softener to use for each

00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,799
one of those let's put those inside the

00:32:01,179 --> 00:32:05,950
Machine and make it an implementation

00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:08,740
detail as well right at which point we

00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:10,840
don't need that control panel anymore

00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:13,660
because the machine knows how to wash

00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:15,700
the clothes right so then we get this

00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:17,919
sort of a device right it looks more

00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:20,950
like a chest of drawers than a washing

00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:24,700
machine why because it's focused on my

00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:26,770
actual goal not on what it does what it

00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,929
does is it washes clothes that's not

00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:31,150
what I care about what I care about are

00:32:28,929 --> 00:32:32,559
clean clothes and that's a machine

00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:34,510
that's focused on giving you clean

00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:36,940
clothes how does it work you turn one of

00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:39,220
them on okay and it washes your clothes

00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:43,299
and they're clean how does it wash it I

00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:47,619
don't care I don't care one bit right so

00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:49,360
we went from this okay which imposes is

00:32:47,619 --> 00:32:52,029
inner complexity makes me do all the

00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:54,789
work to this where I don't know how it

00:32:52,029 --> 00:32:58,840
works but it does all the work for me

00:32:54,789 --> 00:33:00,489
right and really if I was splurging

00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:02,139
maybe I'd have one for my dirty clothes

00:33:00,489 --> 00:33:03,759
and one for my clean clothes I put him

00:33:02,139 --> 00:33:06,159
in the clean drawer it would come out

00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:09,009
the dirty drawer no I'll do it the other

00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,899
way that's a better way of washing I'll

00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:13,450
put him in the dirty drawer it'll come

00:33:10,899 --> 00:33:15,789
out the clean drawer right awesome in

00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:17,409
fact I could mass-produce this this

00:33:15,789 --> 00:33:18,309
still counts as design if I was building

00:33:17,409 --> 00:33:20,019
it just for me

00:33:18,309 --> 00:33:22,629
right and I didn't have to mass-produce

00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:24,639
it maybe I'd go a step further right

00:33:22,629 --> 00:33:26,619
what do I do when I come home I take off

00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:28,539
my t-shirt I throw it on the ground

00:33:26,619 --> 00:33:30,730
at some point I pick it up right and

00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:32,559
hopefully hopefully when it's become a

00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:36,070
pile and then I put it into the washing

00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:38,529
machine so maybe I would optimize for

00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:40,509
that maybe I put those as holes on the

00:33:38,529 --> 00:33:42,789
ground the different places when I come

00:33:40,509 --> 00:33:44,769
home I throw my dirty stuff in there it

00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:46,539
comes out in my clean drawer when I go

00:33:44,769 --> 00:33:48,340
into my room I pull out one of the

00:33:46,539 --> 00:33:50,230
drawers I have clean clothes and that

00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:53,320
would make me feel like a super person

00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:56,799
right that would be awesome I call this

00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:58,779
the superhero effect any object which

00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:01,119
can make the technology invisible and

00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:01,869
the experience indistinguishable from

00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:04,299
magic

00:34:01,869 --> 00:34:06,129
gives you superpowers right and we

00:34:04,299 --> 00:34:09,339
already have so many superpowers we are

00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:13,450
basically cyborgs right each one of us

00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:15,220
are cyborgs we are not necessarily our

00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:17,379
physical abilities are not extended

00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:19,329
beyond normal human limitations by

00:34:17,379 --> 00:34:22,329
mechanical elements built into the body

00:34:19,329 --> 00:34:24,490
but we are extending our human abilities

00:34:22,329 --> 00:34:27,579
by various elements that we carry along

00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:29,980
with us right and by the way that's of

00:34:27,579 --> 00:34:32,530
course Robocop it's always better to be

00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:35,500
a cyborg than a robot because as we all

00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:39,700
know robots can't do stairs right so we

00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:42,669
win but why am i a cyborg I have a watch

00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:44,589
I'm wearing a watch right now and that

00:34:42,669 --> 00:34:48,389
gives me the superhuman ability to tell

00:34:44,589 --> 00:34:51,040
exact time I'm wearing contact lenses

00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:54,790
superhuman ability of perfect sight

00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:56,740
right but this device more than anything

00:34:54,790 --> 00:35:00,640
gives me superhuman abilities

00:34:56,740 --> 00:35:05,080
and many many many super superhuman

00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:07,150
abilities right objects like this have

00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:10,420
value not because of what they are as

00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:13,930
piece of jewelry for example but because

00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:17,320
of what they enable us to do I saw this

00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:20,260
sign at a media school in Oslo in

00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:22,119
central Oslo said the real danger is not

00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:24,400
that computers will begin to think like

00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:26,609
men but that men will begin to think

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:30,190
like computers and I think we do this

00:35:26,609 --> 00:35:32,619
today to a degree and we need to stop

00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:35,050
doing that we need to remember why we're

00:35:32,619 --> 00:35:37,000
doing what we're doing right and we need

00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:39,540
to focus on the humans that are going to

00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,700
be using the things that we make and

00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:44,680
that's hard that's interaction design

00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:47,230
that's experience design and that's hard

00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:50,440
it's hard because humans are hard

00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:54,369
humans are unpredictable humans are

00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:55,900
emotional right even when you have to

00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:59,080
humans talking to each other with a

00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:00,430
shared culture in the same room they

00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,349
might be thinking well does that person

00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:03,970
like me was that sarcastic are they

00:36:02,349 --> 00:36:05,980
trying to make a point I don't know

00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:07,660
we're constantly evaluating each other

00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:09,250
we're constantly misunderstanding each

00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:11,320
other in addition to understanding each

00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,820
other but what if we removed some of

00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:15,460
those cues that we have to work with

00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:17,260
like the or the visual cues right what

00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:18,820
if we were on the phone how much easier

00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:20,290
is it to misunderstand someone when

00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:22,990
you're on the phone because you can't

00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:25,900
see them anymore right you can only hear

00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:27,369
them let's take it one step further how

00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,960
much easier is it to misunderstand

00:36:27,369 --> 00:36:31,450
someone when you're just texting them

00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:35,099
and we're on email or when you're on a

00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:37,540
forum flamewars right they erupt why

00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:39,820
because we're losing humanity at every

00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:41,560
step if we can only judge what they're

00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:43,330
saying they're toned from their text so

00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:45,550
what do we do we try to inject some

00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:47,470
humanity back with emoticons and smiley

00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:50,500
faces and say hey I'm just I'm just

00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:52,260
playing with you you know now to

00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:54,609
understand how hard it is to do it

00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:56,890
experience design an interaction design

00:36:54,609 --> 00:36:59,170
remove one of the humans from that

00:36:56,890 --> 00:37:04,450
equation altogether and replace him or

00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:05,859
her with a computer that's hard human to

00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:09,260
human is hard we're trying to create

00:37:05,859 --> 00:37:12,170
objects that speak to humans via proxy

00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:15,410
lost visual cues we've lost oral cues

00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:18,020
we've lost humanity right so when I talk

00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:20,060
about design I'm not talking about being

00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:21,170
able to draw a straight line you know

00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:22,340
you hear that from people I'm not a

00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:24,830
designer I can't draw a straight line

00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:26,450
not talk about pixel pushing goodness

00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:28,070
knows I'm not talking about prettifying

00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:29,720
things someone actually asked me to do

00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:32,240
that once can you pretty fighters know I

00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:34,160
freaking cannot write it's not about how

00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,320
it looks it's about how it functions as

00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,150
well it's not about this stuff

00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,520
what's design about it's about

00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:43,550
psychology neuroscience linguistics

00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:46,730
sociology philosophy it's about

00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:50,660
understanding humans so that we can

00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:52,130
design for humans so before I did this

00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:54,500
talk I asked my Twitter followers to

00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:56,420
send in some tweets about experiences

00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,700
they've had good and bad and I got this

00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:01,280
one which really stood out he says I'm

00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:04,160
so used to broken UX that I don't try

00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:07,370
the obvious because I naturally assume

00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:10,400
the obvious will not work that's a

00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:12,290
pretty sad state to be in right and he

00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,120
goes on to say note that I wasn't joking

00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:16,280
when I rarely try something obvious and

00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:19,460
it works I feel like I've discovered an

00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:22,130
easter egg we need to change this this

00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:27,230
shouldn't be the norm right because

00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:29,360
experiences matter our whole lives are a

00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:31,400
string of experiences if you think of

00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:34,280
experiences like the grains of sand in

00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:37,010
an hourglass each experience a grain

00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:38,810
they're the experiences that are waiting

00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:40,700
to be had is that experience we're

00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:43,340
having right now that we're sharing and

00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:47,180
then there are all of the experiences

00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:49,910
that form that pile at the bottom those

00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:53,000
are our memories those are our lives and

00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:55,340
the quality of those experiences whether

00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,580
they're with things or whether they're

00:38:55,340 --> 00:39:01,100
with people determine the quality of our

00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:04,640
morning's our evenings our days or weeks

00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:08,720
or months or years our lives so

00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:10,970
experiences matter and we don't need

00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:14,390
more things the world doesn't need more

00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:17,860
things we have a whole lot of things we

00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:20,420
need things that work better beautiful

00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:22,350
experiences and it's not always that

00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,940
hard either and it's not

00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:25,530
waise what you think that makes

00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,940
something stand out for someone or

00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:30,660
creates an emotional relationship with

00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:33,990
someone so someone else sent this my

00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:36,960
favorite thing about Gmail by far and

00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:39,150
this photo this dialog in Gmail that

00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,040
says did you mean to attach files when

00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:44,760
you write I have attached and you forget

00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:46,730
this little polite dialog that says hey

00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:51,180
you said you did did you

00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:54,120
this is her favorite thing by for about

00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:56,540
Gmail by far now think about what a

00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:58,710
complex application spread around

00:39:56,540 --> 00:40:00,780
thousands and tens of thousands of

00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:03,230
servers right think about all the

00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:06,450
complex engineering that goes into Gmail

00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:08,940
what's her favorite thing this little

00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:13,770
piece of humanity this little helpful

00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:16,140
dialog box so we do get it wrong mostly

00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:18,690
though this is another site I'm not even

00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:20,700
gonna go I just you're on the site and

00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:22,740
you want to buy a pipe alright you want

00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:24,990
to buy one of these rods um

00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:28,080
let's see what happens my mouse is going

00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:29,490
over the menu okay I'm like oh okay all

00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,680
right I need to get past this menu

00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:33,150
really quickly cuz this is scary okay

00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,960
that's fine let's just don't look at the

00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:36,810
menu it's fine

00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:39,030
so go for really fast I click buy now

00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:42,930
and what it was by now me does it mean

00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:46,350
these by now unless if it means choose

00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:49,740
the color by now of course here means

00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:52,200
choose the diameter right I'd really

00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:56,160
like to buy this now which means review

00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:57,840
your order right and then finally you

00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,160
please check out that wasn't the worst

00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:01,560
thing about this the worst thing was

00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:06,510
here do you see that add 45 pounds 76

00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:07,830
pence for free delivery that made no

00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:09,510
sense to me whatsoever

00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:12,060
I thought initially they were asking me

00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:13,650
to pay them 45 pounds 76 pence in order

00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:15,690
to get free delivery in which case it

00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:18,570
kind of does not it defeats the purpose

00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:20,520
right apparently what they meant is I

00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:21,930
need to buy that amount more of stuff

00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:27,390
which I only realized after giving this

00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:29,310
talk twice and one more thing guys your

00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:33,660
app shouldn't look like your database

00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:35,220
just threw up okay if it does think

00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:37,020
about that in your heads if it does

00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:39,800
right

00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:42,690
change it there's something wrong why

00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:45,420
it's like Scott Hanselman says I love

00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:48,420
this quote there are a finite number of

00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:50,000
keystrokes left in your hands before you

00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:53,520
die right

00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,680
remember the hourglass respect the users

00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,650
efforts that user might be you one day

00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:01,770
and probably is here are people who

00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:06,830
didn't do that this is another ticket

00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:09,540
machine this time in Sweden and Wow okay

00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:10,470
where do I start it has so many

00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:12,060
different parts

00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:14,460
let's see they've got a lot of

00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:16,110
documentation on it a good sign that

00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:18,210
it's not intuitive they've written

00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:20,040
basically a manual on there right it

00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:22,890
tells you what cards you can use with it

00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:25,260
what cards you cannot use with it that's

00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:27,420
always great right you got to be

00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:29,880
comprehensive in what you do no slacking

00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:32,040
right it's got a screen and the people

00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,920
who built this we're aware as is often

00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:37,920
the case that this was not working right

00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:40,380
why because they put a phone inside of

00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:43,380
it okay so you can call for help so some

00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:45,840
poor sod in a dark room somewhere has to

00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:47,400
take calls from drunk people at all

00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,140
hours of the day because they couldn't

00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:51,450
design this right this makes me feel

00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:53,520
like that little baby again right but

00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:56,160
trapped in the body of an adult this is

00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,480
what it looks like in Sweden so maybe

00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,970
that's just the way you can do maybe

00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:01,890
there's that much complexity no this

00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:04,050
does one thing it sells you a train

00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:05,490
ticket from that station to the airport

00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:06,990
that's all it does you can't even buy a

00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:07,530
train to get to another station with

00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:10,680
that machine

00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:14,820
okay this is what the same machine looks

00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:16,440
like in Oslo does the same thing you

00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:18,420
know how you use it you see that slot

00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:20,280
over there you take your credit card

00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:22,670
that you already have in your pocket you

00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:26,550
slide it and you walk on your training

00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:28,560
that's it that's it you're on your train

00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:31,500
and on the other side you're slide your

00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:33,780
card at the gate and you walk off and

00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:36,450
that makes me feel like a superhero

00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:39,810
that's how life should be right and

00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:43,290
there's no UI sometimes the best UI is

00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:46,710
no UI here's an Oslo vien using it there

00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:49,700
we go boom walked off right on the other

00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:52,610
end boom and you're off and

00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:54,140
man feels like a superhero at that point

00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:58,280
I hope I don't know maybe was just going

00:43:54,140 --> 00:44:01,310
to work but how can two experiences be

00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:04,420
so different right the one in Sweden the

00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:07,130
one Oslo isn't their common sense no

00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:09,230
common sense is a myth it's not just a

00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:10,070
myth it's a very dangerous myth it lets

00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,890
us be lazy

00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:16,580
what we need is focus focus on a very

00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:20,540
important thing on providing quality not

00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:21,920
quantity right on 20 cent expiry the

00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:23,030
author of the little prince has a quote

00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,550
about this that I love

00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:28,550
he says perfection is achieved not when

00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:30,650
there is nothing more to add but when

00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:32,090
there is nothing left to take away

00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:34,310
remember this when you're building your

00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:36,050
applications and this focus has to be

00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:38,330
the focus of everyone not just your user

00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:40,220
experience consultants or this designer

00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:43,970
that you hire into pretty five things

00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:46,670
please don't do that great design is not

00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:49,550
the symptom of a great designer great

00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:52,580
design is a symptom of a design led

00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:55,250
organizational structure and development

00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:57,020
process right you have to design the

00:44:55,250 --> 00:45:00,920
organization as Whitney was saying

00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:03,590
before you design the product right or

00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:06,200
else it's worthless design thinking has

00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:07,790
to trickle down from the top it can't go

00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:11,660
like this your desire is your developer

00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:17,510
saying hey CEO person we need to focus

00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:19,160
more on design yeah yeah yeah no doesn't

00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:21,680
work that way right it has to come from

00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:23,750
the top down unless the organization is

00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,220
committed then there won't be the

00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:26,690
budgets there won't be the timescales

00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:29,410
there won't be development processes

00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:30,560
that will result in great design an

00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:33,350
example

00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:35,510
iDVD mike evangelist company was

00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:38,480
purchased by apple and to create the

00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:41,120
product known as iDVD back then and when

00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,350
he went in with his team to have a

00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,090
meeting with Steve Jobs they had

00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:46,550
prepared all of this all of these

00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:49,040
artifacts write wireframes and

00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:50,540
prototypes and documentation and manuals

00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:53,090
showing every feature that they thought

00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:55,220
should be in it Steve Jobs according to

00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:57,140
Mike walked into the room ignored

00:45:55,220 --> 00:46:00,440
everything they had walked up to the

00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:01,220
board and drew a rectangle he said

00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,079
that's the window

00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:04,339
he drew a button

00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:06,979
side the window said that's the burn

00:46:04,339 --> 00:46:10,009
button what you do is you drag a video

00:46:06,979 --> 00:46:13,519
onto the window and you press the burn

00:46:10,009 --> 00:46:16,900
button and you get your DVD and that is

00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:19,459
I DVD and that is what they built and

00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:20,479
that's the sort of focus I'm talking

00:46:19,459 --> 00:46:22,309
about and that's the sort of focus

00:46:20,479 --> 00:46:25,640
that's only possible if it comes from

00:46:22,309 --> 00:46:28,459
the top-down otherwise you don't have

00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:30,109
the authority to have that sort of focus

00:46:28,459 --> 00:46:32,559
you might have the responsibility but

00:46:30,109 --> 00:46:35,420
without the authority it's worthless

00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:37,400
there's no button design it's not

00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:40,819
something we do in committee it's not

00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:43,309
democratic right great design is not

00:46:40,819 --> 00:46:45,079
about sparing your feelings in the team

00:46:43,309 --> 00:46:46,849
it's about hurting your feelings now so

00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:48,349
that we can all celebrate tomorrow when

00:46:46,849 --> 00:46:49,999
we have an amazing product and feel

00:46:48,349 --> 00:46:52,489
great about ourselves because we've

00:46:49,999 --> 00:46:54,829
created something amazing together right

00:46:52,489 --> 00:46:57,079
great designs about saying no no no no

00:46:54,829 --> 00:47:01,249
no no no no no over and over when it

00:46:57,079 --> 00:47:04,969
hurts right even when it's painful not

00:47:01,249 --> 00:47:09,019
yes especially when it's painful right

00:47:04,969 --> 00:47:09,979
these people who created this machine in

00:47:09,019 --> 00:47:11,719
Oslo

00:47:09,979 --> 00:47:14,180
they weren't just Rockstar designers

00:47:11,719 --> 00:47:16,759
they had to make really painful

00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:18,949
decisions like what they compromised on

00:47:16,759 --> 00:47:21,170
security what do you not see there you

00:47:18,949 --> 00:47:26,930
don't see me going like this and then oh

00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:28,670
my pin number mmm no again ok do I feel

00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:31,039
like Superman at that point no that's

00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:36,140
just life mediocre as we know it right

00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:38,479
they said no we want this to be swipe so

00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:41,150
the bank when you don't take pin number

00:47:38,479 --> 00:47:43,219
says ok sure if there's any fraud it's

00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:44,749
on your shoulders so the design decision

00:47:43,219 --> 00:47:46,190
here wasn't how many pixels shall we

00:47:44,749 --> 00:47:48,799
make this will it have a rounded corner

00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:50,959
the design decision here was we're gonna

00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:53,359
lose a hundred thousand pounds or

00:47:50,959 --> 00:47:57,140
several hundred thousand pounds is that

00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:58,969
ok yes that was a design decision right

00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:01,249
it wasn't about what color a pixel is

00:47:58,969 --> 00:48:03,619
going to be right they thought outside

00:48:01,249 --> 00:48:06,559
the screen that screen does nothing

00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:07,999
right nothing at all they thought

00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:10,249
outside of it they moved the features

00:48:07,999 --> 00:48:12,140
outside of it and they've thought about

00:48:10,249 --> 00:48:13,690
context and ergonomics most importantly

00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:16,880
they've worried about the right thing

00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:19,820
they focused on their users needs

00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:22,700
not their own needs right and if you

00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:24,710
don't do that really bad crap happens

00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:30,650
that we starts we see some of this stuff

00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:31,970
on the web right like this I mean you

00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:33,680
might be thinking well that's Daily Mail

00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:38,450
you know you deserve it for going there

00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:40,810
right but yeah I'm not your site an

00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:43,880
important message from mail online ooh

00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:45,920
exciting do your iPhone user hmm how do

00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:48,590
they know have you downloaded our new

00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,870
iPhone app no we think it's a much

00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:52,700
better view okay great off I don't

00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:55,070
want this right right

00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:57,440
I call this a door slam because that's

00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:59,120
how it feels right and these door slams

00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,580
are gonna get louder and louder as we go

00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:03,440
cuz everyone's doing it right like

00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:04,730
everybody's doing where do you want to

00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,460
open this link I'll tell you where I

00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:10,550
want to open that link okay over here

00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:14,330
have you tried the iPhone app no get the

00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:21,080
iPhone I don't want to get that no and

00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:23,540
should I go away switch no I don't want

00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:26,920
this you need to have to read all the

00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:26,920
answers you evil

00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:37,319
door slams are a cancer on the web don't

00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:38,940
do this people especially since there

00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:41,700
are ways of doing it that are not

00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:45,029
intrusive right look at lanyards they've

00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:47,279
got this little non-modal that's the key

00:49:45,029 --> 00:49:49,170
word here right little bit at the top

00:49:47,279 --> 00:49:50,700
that says hey you know we've got these

00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:52,440
apps and all these platforms you in

00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:55,130
trying out you know you can totally

00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:57,720
ignore it if you don't want to right and

00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:59,789
you know this is just one example but

00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,960
there are a lot of things that we're

00:49:59,789 --> 00:50:03,510
doing that we should probably be

00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,940
reviewing what we're doing on the web

00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:07,799
today in 2013 right you know what I'm

00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:11,450
going with this you know you know what

00:50:07,799 --> 00:50:11,450
I'm talking about right yes

00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:20,590
people its 2013 we can let this go now

00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:23,410
all right this should never happen okay

00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:26,470
I did flash for 10 years I'm over it you

00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:28,000
can get over it okay it's over they're

00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:30,310
not developing it for mobile platforms

00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,710
anymore it's dead on the web there is no

00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:34,450
mobile web there is just the web right

00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:36,610
if they're not developing it for mobile

00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:38,320
it's dead and I wrote an article about

00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:40,330
how it was dead a few years ago when

00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:42,220
they announced that so let's let it go

00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:45,610
that's not some of the worst stuff out

00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:48,910
there though there's this crap I mean if

00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:52,330
one fake iOS navigation bar doesn't cut

00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:55,360
it used to because that might just fix

00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:58,900
your problems right what is this this is

00:50:55,360 --> 00:51:02,350
a website skinned to look like a native

00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:04,930
app there is never a reason to do this

00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:06,520
okay if you if you've done this I feel

00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:08,680
for you it was probably not your fault

00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:11,530
just go home take a shower it's a new

00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:15,670
day tomorrow okay there's never a reason

00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:17,620
to do this why it's horrendous you are

00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:19,690
creating expectations that you cannot

00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:21,640
meet you're faking components that will

00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:23,350
not behave like the native components

00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:26,020
and plus you don't need to do that if I

00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:27,610
go to the site on my Windows Phone it'll

00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:30,820
still look like that and that's not

00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:34,420
native on my Windows Phone don't do this

00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:36,310
bad bad and then don't take the next

00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:38,800
step which like Adobe will tell you to

00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:42,130
take right now don't then go I have a

00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:45,310
web app hmm let me wrap it with this

00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:47,650
amazing one-click experience on PhoneGap

00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:50,230
so that I can put it as a native app on

00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:54,520
all of my various mobile devices all

00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:57,280
4000 Android ones don't do that it was a

00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:59,740
crap experience when you wrap it with

00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:02,500
PhoneGap and it can run on thousands of

00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:04,900
different mobile devices natively it'll

00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:08,260
be thousands of crap experiences on

00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:11,380
mobile devices okay don't do that right

00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:13,390
why we need to optimize the experience

00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:15,670
for every device if you're going to

00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:17,260
support a device support it well nobody

00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:19,780
wants your middle-of-the-road to

00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:21,580
experience on their device right why

00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:22,960
because someone will come out with a

00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:25,990
better native experience on that

00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:28,210
platform and they will use that right

00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:30,280
you're not the only player in town

00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:32,680
he had no competitors fine that's great

00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:34,830
but you have competitors and you don't

00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:36,790
want to die a death of a thousand deaths

00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:39,550
you don't want to die a death of a

00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:41,560
thousand cuts as the Chinese say right

00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:45,130
death of a thousand deaths sounds a bit

00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:47,740
more okay and they're there you know

00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:49,450
there are places for PhoneGap don't get

00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:51,609
me wrong I'm not hating on PhoneGap I

00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:52,990
was hating on their marketing earlier

00:52:51,609 --> 00:52:53,410
because they were like hey just take a

00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:54,970
webapp

00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:56,560
wrap it up and you have native apps

00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:58,990
they've changed that now on their site

00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:00,580
they just say mobile apps what what's a

00:52:58,990 --> 00:53:03,160
good use case for this well we need to

00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:05,830
examine a few things right we're on the

00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:08,619
documents to applications spectrum does

00:53:05,830 --> 00:53:10,150
my application fall if it's a document

00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:12,310
if it's a collection of documents that's

00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:14,650
what the web was created for that's

00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:16,599
where the web has won you hear that at

00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:19,180
web conferences right yes

00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:20,770
documents it's a web app right forget

00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:23,349
wrapping it up or anything it's a web

00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:25,690
app the more content centric it is the

00:53:23,349 --> 00:53:28,180
more it's fit for the web right and but

00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:29,890
it's a spectrum it's a gradient when you

00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:31,780
get towards the middle maybe it makes

00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:33,880
sense to progressively enhance some of

00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:37,510
the capabilities of your web app right

00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:39,700
with native features great go hybrid

00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:42,700
there if you need to right if you need

00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:45,220
to that's fine if you have if you have

00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:47,650
applications that are really behavior

00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:47,920
centric the web is not for that right

00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:51,070
now

00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:53,200
right no cross-platform UI is for that

00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:55,240
right now because you can't support the

00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:57,040
native culture so there maybe you might

00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:58,140
consider a native application as you get

00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:00,130
to this side there's another

00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:02,680
consideration though is your app

00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:05,320
immersive or non immersive if it's

00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:07,300
immersive like a game then by all means

00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:09,190
if it's performance enough in JavaScript

00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:11,920
wrap it up in PhoneGap and create a

00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:14,470
native version of it sure do that that's

00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:16,180
fine but if it uses native components

00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:18,070
and you're just simulating those native

00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:20,500
components that's a bad experience right

00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:22,000
so this isn't a religious debate this is

00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:24,369
a design decision like anything else

00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,710
just know your medium so you can make an

00:54:24,369 --> 00:54:28,869
educated decision if you want to hear

00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:30,280
more about that I wrote 10,000 words on

00:54:28,869 --> 00:54:32,020
it and I asked the lovely people at

00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:33,730
Smashing Magazine to make my chapter

00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:35,349
available for free since this is such an

00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:37,330
issue for a lot of people so you can

00:54:35,349 --> 00:54:39,280
just go to the link is forward slash web

00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:40,450
versus native which is a horrible way of

00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,140
framing it but that's what we're saying

00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:42,970
web

00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:45,549
native it's a stupid argument there is

00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:47,440
no argument it's a spectrum right it's a

00:54:45,549 --> 00:54:49,119
spectrum of documents applications the

00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,670
spectrum of immersive to non immersive

00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:54,160
applications and then one final thing

00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:55,750
that please pleaseplease why do we why

00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:58,059
do we do this it's a it's a current it's

00:54:55,750 --> 00:55:05,819
a it's a very current very new

00:54:58,059 --> 00:55:09,940
phenomenon why are we hiding our content

00:55:05,819 --> 00:55:13,510
behind closed silos when the web is open

00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:15,069
right how many times in I can't count

00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:17,170
the number of times in the last few

00:55:15,069 --> 00:55:19,210
weeks and I've gotten links to things

00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:22,059
that people have written themselves that

00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:24,789
they choose to voluntarily hide behind a

00:55:22,059 --> 00:55:28,569
closed silo instead of put on the open

00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:30,279
web why do we do this right why are we

00:55:28,569 --> 00:55:32,140
voluntarily taking away a lot of our

00:55:30,279 --> 00:55:34,150
rights why do I have to login to read

00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:35,619
something on the web that's not how it

00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:38,859
is on the web right

00:55:35,619 --> 00:55:40,809
and remember worry about the right thing

00:55:38,859 --> 00:55:42,640
and you will sidestep a lot of these

00:55:40,809 --> 00:55:44,289
issues right if you're thinking about

00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:46,329
your users experience you'll sidestep a

00:55:44,289 --> 00:55:47,829
lot of these issues and you might be

00:55:46,329 --> 00:55:49,599
saying but what about our businesses

00:55:47,829 --> 00:55:51,730
needs are all its old my stool hippy

00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:54,700
it's all 60s what about our businesses

00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:56,380
needs great design in the age of user

00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:59,440
experience which is what we're living in

00:55:56,380 --> 00:56:01,000
is your business plan right of the

00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,190
people who made these remote controls

00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,549
one understands that can you tell which

00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:08,920
one does it stand out somehow

00:56:05,549 --> 00:56:10,210
does it actually use user experience to

00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:13,240
differentiate itself as a

00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:14,859
differentiating factor and process

00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:17,619
matters this can't happen in a vacuum

00:56:14,859 --> 00:56:20,619
right design and development are facets

00:56:17,619 --> 00:56:23,079
of the same thing design leads

00:56:20,619 --> 00:56:24,759
development right initially we make

00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:26,829
assumptions about stuff that's what

00:56:24,759 --> 00:56:28,569
design is we can call it any fancy word

00:56:26,829 --> 00:56:30,609
we want we're just pulling stuff out of

00:56:28,569 --> 00:56:31,930
our asses right initially we're like we

00:56:30,609 --> 00:56:33,940
think this is how it's gonna be there

00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:35,769
might be some research etc but we're

00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:38,079
just estimating we're just guessing

00:56:35,769 --> 00:56:40,450
right only when we start building

00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:42,579
something do we start to learn about

00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:44,920
what we're building and then the

00:56:42,579 --> 00:56:46,809
development informs the design so if you

00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:49,329
don't have this cyclical process if you

00:56:46,809 --> 00:56:51,759
can't iterate over this process then you

00:56:49,329 --> 00:56:53,890
have a broken process and of course we

00:56:51,759 --> 00:56:54,730
test in-between to get feedback as well

00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:57,070
right we design

00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:59,680
we test cuz it's cheap we developed we

00:56:57,070 --> 00:57:01,359
test and we keep doing that alright and

00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:03,310
we do this in two weeks not two years

00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:04,960
you do it in two years you pretty much

00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:06,160
have waterfall you do it in two weeks

00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,380
and you iterate you pretty much have a

00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:10,630
j'l for in terms of how much it really

00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:12,340
matters the core of it right but there's

00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:13,990
one thing we still miss out even if

00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:16,840
we're at this point and that's the most

00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:18,310
important thing your design vision your

00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:20,320
design doesn't come out of anywhere

00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:22,240
right it's not about marketing surveys

00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:23,920
you have to have a strong vision for a

00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:25,660
product that doesn't exist that needs to

00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:28,000
exist because it fits some need that

00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:30,340
you've identified right your design

00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,230
comes out of that you test and then you

00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:33,460
filter the results of that test through

00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:34,990
your vision you don't just take what

00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:37,300
everyone tells you and implements it

00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:39,640
right and then you develop and then you

00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:41,619
test and then you filter and you do this

00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:44,050
every two weeks and there you have a

00:57:41,619 --> 00:57:47,170
process that will lead you to what we

00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:48,790
call usable the beginning of where user

00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:51,609
experience begins right where it's

00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:54,040
functional and we can go beyond that

00:57:51,609 --> 00:57:55,960
this was my first stop for scanning

00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:58,420
barcodes and if the barcode existed

00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:59,920
online for a book you could read it but

00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:01,570
what happens if the internet is slow it

00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,130
says hey in just a few seconds all will

00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:05,320
be revealed I'm checking if they have it

00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:07,180
okay did I have it did I have it but the

00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:09,700
internet connection is slow so it starts

00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:11,380
going oh well okay maybe taking a little

00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:13,390
longer it starting to introspect a

00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:15,400
little bit it's it's reacting to the

00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:16,119
context oh okay this isn't making me

00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,710
look good

00:58:16,119 --> 00:58:19,180
you know it's empathizing a little bit

00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:20,619
there and then you might be getting

00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:23,200
frustrated at this point but he's in

00:58:20,619 --> 00:58:25,570
tears he's having a worse day than you

00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,990
are right and and it's not even his

00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:27,700
fault

00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:30,340
the internet connection is slow right

00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:31,240
and in the end it just says okay didn't

00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:34,200
work right

00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:36,310
what is the naive version of this an

00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,840
indeterminate progress bar right what

00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:39,490
does that say yeah I'm getting it for ya

00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:42,880
yeah that's great aspirates great and

00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:44,470
then what happens at the end well it's

00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:45,550
just saying yeah I'm getting it for you

00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:47,380
I'm getting it for you it doesn't change

00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:49,920
it doesn't adapt right this doesn't mean

00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:52,300
build Clippy into your applications okay

00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:55,600
but it does mean that you will need

00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:57,700
empathy in what you do feathers another

00:58:55,600 --> 00:59:02,800
app that I did for sending tweets with

00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:06,400
little decorations and and creating

00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:07,869
ASCII art and Unicode art right when

00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,440
you're typing the little bird turns

00:59:07,869 --> 00:59:10,690
green

00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:12,730
tell you how many letters are left until

00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:14,560
you can do something about it because if

00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:16,839
it tells me 120 letters I can't do

00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:20,740
anything I can't plan ahead 10 either

00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:22,300
way or 12 I can write and before that it

00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:25,240
just turns green is kind of cute right

00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:27,730
when you tap it flaps its wings nothing

00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:29,410
special right but it's fun it adds a bit

00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:31,810
of character right objects have

00:59:29,410 --> 00:59:34,510
character but also not just that the

00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:37,210
custom keyboard behaves exactly like the

00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:39,130
iPhones custom keyboard right the

00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:41,290
difference between almost and exactly so

00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:42,819
that that cursor follows the the overlay

00:59:41,290 --> 00:59:44,980
follows your finger as you go from key

00:59:42,819 --> 00:59:47,560
to key took me about two weeks but those

00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:50,079
details matter and people notice those

00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:52,810
details it got featured by Apple right

00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:54,520
in their us store which is just based on

00:59:52,810 --> 00:59:57,460
the user experience people call it

00:59:54,520 --> 01:00:00,430
joyful adorable fell in love with fun

00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:01,660
fell in love with not then it works I

01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:04,150
use it that's great

01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:06,010
right and yet we get the fundamentals

01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:08,589
wrong over and over again

01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:11,829
Samsung gave me a phone to try out a

01:00:08,589 --> 01:00:15,630
while back I turned it on first thing no

01:00:11,829 --> 01:00:15,630
SIM card or phone is turned off

01:00:16,609 --> 01:00:21,690
how does that happen

01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:22,980
how does that happen

01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:25,770
guys I'm gonna go about five minutes

01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:27,900
over just so you know it happens if you

01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:30,119
don't see hardware and software as as

01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:31,890
inseparable right if you have different

01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:32,940
teams then for the team that was riding

01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:34,440
that error message it kind of made sense

01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:36,240
what are the error conditions well this

01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:38,670
is the only reason like if that happens

01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:41,369
and that happens right in the age of

01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:44,250
experiences okay that doesn't cut it the

01:00:41,369 --> 01:00:48,680
age of features is over we can't settle

01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:51,680
for mediocrity and mediocrity is

01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:51,680
everywhere

01:01:22,579 --> 01:01:28,019
mistakes are awesome mistakes are

01:01:24,930 --> 01:01:31,230
learning experiences right stopping at

01:01:28,019 --> 01:01:33,930
good enough stopping at mistakes isn't

01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:37,140
right and these things add up I was a

01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:39,420
Crawley station recently and the ATM was

01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:41,819
not in order right it wasn't working the

01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:44,099
toilets were out of order there was no

01:01:41,819 --> 01:01:46,440
catering on the train same station same

01:01:44,099 --> 01:01:48,299
day right so it's really great that I

01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:50,099
couldn't withdraw money and that I

01:01:48,299 --> 01:01:52,589
couldn't buy a drink because I couldn't

01:01:50,099 --> 01:01:56,789
go have a piss later so it's great right

01:01:52,589 --> 01:01:59,069
but mediocrity is cumulative right it

01:01:56,789 --> 01:02:01,470
creates a culture of mediocrity if we

01:01:59,069 --> 01:02:03,660
accept it and in fact there's an economy

01:02:01,470 --> 01:02:05,640
of mediocrity out there so you can

01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:07,529
disregard everything I've told you you

01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:10,890
can go out there you can make a whole

01:02:07,529 --> 01:02:13,529
bunch of money right in mediocrity so

01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:15,630
don't get me wrong your decision is

01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:17,220
whether or not you want to do that or

01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:19,589
whether or not you want to make that

01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:23,309
money creating awesome stuff right

01:02:19,589 --> 01:02:25,559
because laziness fear and dishonesty are

01:02:23,309 --> 01:02:29,460
what lead to mediocrity in products

01:02:25,559 --> 01:02:31,289
right so this was a faucet in in a

01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:33,930
bathroom somewhere and it said warning

01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:35,779
very hot water may I draw your attention

01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:38,789
to the fact that there's only one faucet

01:02:35,779 --> 01:02:41,759
that's not a warning that's telling me

01:02:38,789 --> 01:02:44,900
I'm gonna burn my hand right

01:02:41,759 --> 01:02:47,519
don't use warnings as a design solution

01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:49,559
right and you see it everywhere this is

01:02:47,519 --> 01:02:51,569
a different one I just saw it what is it

01:02:49,559 --> 01:02:55,079
with faucets anyway I mean look at this

01:02:51,569 --> 01:02:58,529
right that's that's cold ice cold over

01:02:55,079 --> 01:02:59,670
there that is blisteringly warm over

01:02:58,529 --> 01:03:02,730
there what do I want

01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:04,559
lukewarm how do I do it right in the

01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:06,329
past maybe you would have stored that

01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:08,849
and he filled it up but that's at a at a

01:03:06,329 --> 01:03:10,470
public toilet right and if that's not

01:03:08,849 --> 01:03:12,930
bad enough for if you think that that

01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:15,660
gives it to easier time for users check

01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:17,999
this out make it so that it goes off the

01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:19,769
moment you let it go right and put

01:03:17,999 --> 01:03:22,019
another one there so that they have no

01:03:19,769 --> 01:03:24,660
but then of course sometimes you just

01:03:22,019 --> 01:03:27,150
find one where it's so clear oh there's

01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:27,930
the lever I can turn it on and off I can

01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:30,329
probably adjust

01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:32,400
that's so cool right so sometimes when

01:03:30,329 --> 01:03:36,720
you see something that's so obvious and

01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:38,460
use it and oh oh okay yeah maybe that's

01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:41,670
not how you turn it on how do you how do

01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:46,850
you turn it on guns oh alright it's not

01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:49,440
working down oh you press it okay

01:03:46,850 --> 01:03:52,230
there's laziness and then there's evil

01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:53,610
this is my Apple TV you have already

01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:58,610
purchased this item would you like to

01:03:53,610 --> 01:04:03,870
buy it again I never thought of that

01:03:58,610 --> 01:04:05,880
thank you don't be evil um and you can't

01:04:03,870 --> 01:04:09,660
really talk about evil without talking

01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:12,480
about Ryanair so here's here's an

01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:14,310
experience on the Ryanair website right

01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:16,170
here I mean actually this is where this

01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:17,820
is them being really nice right because

01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:19,530
here they're asking you your country of

01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:21,000
residence why maybe they want to make

01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:22,920
the experience so much better for you

01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,020
localize it internationalized they're

01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:26,280
culturally sensitive people you know

01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:29,130
they want to give you a great experience

01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:31,230
not really what they're asking you there

01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:33,840
if you could read the bit before it is

01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:36,750
whether or not you want to buy insurance

01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:38,850
travel insurance and the answer no of

01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:45,390
course lives where no normally lives

01:04:38,850 --> 01:04:48,300
between Latvia and Lithuania this isn't

01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:51,420
bad design this is awesome design it

01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:53,460
just happens to be evil right it's there

01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:55,410
to trick you if you want to learn more

01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:57,990
about this stuff go to dark patterns dot

01:04:55,410 --> 01:05:00,420
work right and we can do so much better

01:04:57,990 --> 01:05:04,050
to create delightful experiences this

01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:05,400
little sugar dispenser you take one of

01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:08,490
the spoons and look what happens it

01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:10,200
opens up it says take the sugar and then

01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:12,480
you take the sugar and then you put the

01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:14,550
spoon back and it closes it says and

01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:16,290
it's awesome it's thinking about your

01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:19,260
whole process right

01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:21,480
so in closing I've been talking to you

01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:23,550
about how I feel that objects should be

01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:25,500
should make technology invisible and

01:05:23,550 --> 01:05:27,420
make the experience magical as much as

01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:30,000
possible right so I got the chance to

01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:32,880
present at edit London last year because

01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:37,380
of a hack that I did on a boat in about

01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:39,000
18 hours in can as you do and I got to

01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:41,480
present it there when it won the hack

01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:45,619
day at this TV conference called MIPTV

01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:48,710
sweat show you that so that's your

01:05:45,619 --> 01:05:49,970
TV screen on the right okay and on the

01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:51,589
left you can see the screen of my phone

01:05:49,970 --> 01:05:53,569
I'm at home watching TV

01:05:51,589 --> 01:05:55,279
something interesting comes on and I

01:05:53,569 --> 01:05:56,749
want to share it with my friends right

01:05:55,279 --> 01:05:58,999
really quickly I want to tweet it or

01:05:56,749 --> 01:06:01,220
Facebook it or whatever right so there's

01:05:58,999 --> 01:06:02,960
my phone on the left and there's a TV

01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:04,339
screen that I'm watching on the right so

01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,960
I just wave at it so it knows that I'm

01:06:04,339 --> 01:06:08,869
there something interesting comes online

01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:10,700
and I grab it I hold it in my hand and I

01:06:08,869 --> 01:06:11,630
transfer it to my phone with my finger

01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:13,220
okay

01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:16,220
so again in case you didn't see that

01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:18,380
right I want something on there I grab

01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:20,089
it I hold it in my hand I transfer it to

01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:21,499
my phone so I just grab what's on the

01:06:20,089 --> 01:06:24,170
screen just like this just like that

01:06:21,499 --> 01:06:28,579
like we all do right and then boom it's

01:06:24,170 --> 01:06:31,039
on my phone right and that is magical

01:06:28,579 --> 01:06:33,529
that makes me feel like I have

01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:35,980
superpowers that makes the technology

01:06:33,529 --> 01:06:37,759
invisible and the experience

01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:38,990
indistinguishable from magic

01:06:37,759 --> 01:06:42,339
you're holding something that was on

01:06:38,990 --> 01:06:45,619
your screen in your hand so for the past

01:06:42,339 --> 01:06:47,869
45 minutes or so I've been talking to

01:06:45,619 --> 01:06:52,249
you about why I care about experience

01:06:47,869 --> 01:06:55,819
design why I get frustrated by things

01:06:52,249 --> 01:06:59,739
that don't work or don't work well or

01:06:55,819 --> 01:07:10,160
aren't easy to use why mediocrity

01:06:59,739 --> 01:07:13,309
infuriates me why is it a first world

01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:18,019
problem is it an expression of

01:07:13,309 --> 01:07:22,220
consumerist entitlement I don't think so

01:07:18,019 --> 01:07:27,470
I think it goes deeper than that you see

01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:32,599
the way I see it we have a tiny amount

01:07:27,470 --> 01:07:35,420
of time in this world and then we die no

01:07:32,599 --> 01:07:40,400
angels in heaven no fiery coals of hell

01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:45,529
no Elysium no Valhalla no fields of owl

01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:50,599
Roux no Summerland no coming back as a

01:07:45,529 --> 01:07:55,830
butterfly or a cockroach nada this is

01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:59,520
all there is this short life

01:07:55,830 --> 01:08:01,950
and if you see things that way then how

01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:05,310
much more precious does our time here on

01:08:01,950 --> 01:08:09,840
earth become indeed it is the most

01:08:05,310 --> 01:08:11,340
precious thing so is it going to kill me

01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:12,090
if something that should take ten

01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:16,160
seconds

01:08:12,090 --> 01:08:18,299
takes ten minutes instead maybe not

01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:21,540
although it might if it's a medical

01:08:18,299 --> 01:08:27,810
device or the control panel of an

01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:29,970
airplane but yes it is killing me it's

01:08:27,810 --> 01:08:36,620
killing me by wasting that which I have

01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:40,350
the least of my time here on earth and

01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:42,230
if it was just that it would be bad

01:08:40,350 --> 01:08:46,830
enough but it's more than that

01:08:42,230 --> 01:08:51,000
think of an app a bus times app that

01:08:46,830 --> 01:08:52,560
shows you times of local buses surely

01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,630
it's not a matter of life or death if

01:08:52,560 --> 01:09:00,030
that doesn't work well or if it's

01:08:54,630 --> 01:09:02,700
unreliable then again it might be a

01:09:00,030 --> 01:09:05,790
matter of life what if I have a five

01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:07,740
year old daughter and I'm going to see

01:09:05,790 --> 01:09:08,720
her birthday party I'm going to her

01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:13,230
birthday party

01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:15,030
and I miss my bus because this app

01:09:13,230 --> 01:09:19,890
misbehaves and I miss the sight of her

01:09:15,030 --> 01:09:21,359
blowing out her birthday candles it's an

01:09:19,890 --> 01:09:24,960
event that's important to both of us an

01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:28,740
experience that will go unlived so maybe

01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:33,120
it is a matter of life and maybe it's a

01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:37,620
matter of death what if I'm on my way to

01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:41,910
see my dying grandmother and I missed my

01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:44,339
bus and I can't spend her final moments

01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:48,930
with her and I can't tell her that I

01:09:44,339 --> 01:09:51,560
love her one last time maybe it is a

01:09:48,930 --> 01:09:51,560
matter of death

01:09:52,440 --> 01:10:04,230
and we need to realize that a bus

01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:10,140
schedule app is not just a bus schedule

01:10:04,230 --> 01:10:15,840
app it is an object that either enables

01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:19,350
you to see your daughter's birthday

01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:22,020
party or it's an object that prevents

01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:26,550
you from saying that you love someone

01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:29,070
for the last time objects have value not

01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:33,150
because of what they are but because of

01:10:29,070 --> 01:10:37,640
what they enable us to do and we as

01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:42,720
makers have a profound responsibility as

01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:44,640
designers and you are a designer we have

01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:47,190
a profound responsibility a

01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:51,120
responsibility to not take for granted

01:10:47,190 --> 01:10:56,280
the limited time that people have here

01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:59,150
on earth a responsibility to make sure

01:10:56,280 --> 01:11:03,630
that that time is as beautiful as

01:10:59,150 --> 01:11:06,930
comfortable as painless as empowering

01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:11,220
and as delightful as it can be through

01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:14,550
the experiences that we craft because

01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:20,420
this is all there is and it's up to us

01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:20,420
to make it better thank you

01:11:31,690 --> 01:11:35,830
I just want to say before I go I'm a

01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:37,120
very big fan of Creative Commons and

01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:38,800
this presentation would not have been

01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:40,989
possible if people had not shared their

01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:43,570
photos openly under Creative Commons and

01:11:40,989 --> 01:11:45,880
also that I wouldn't be standing here

01:11:43,570 --> 01:11:48,310
today if my dad when I was seven years

01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:50,800
old hadn't brought me an IBM XT computer

01:11:48,310 --> 01:11:53,320
with a basic manual put it in front of

01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:56,350
me and said go ahead use it you can't

01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:58,180
break it I proved him wrong later and

01:11:56,350 --> 01:11:58,660
this is the first thing I did ten print

01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:00,969
hello

01:11:58,660 --> 01:12:02,739
20 go to 10 and run and it was hello

01:12:00,969 --> 01:12:05,350
hello hello hello hello and that was

01:12:02,739 --> 01:12:08,230
magical for me that lit that initial

01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:10,210
spark for me and today I have the honor

01:12:08,230 --> 01:12:12,219
of sitting on the board of a social

01:12:10,210 --> 01:12:14,650
enterprise called code Club where we

01:12:12,219 --> 01:12:16,480
teach kids aged 9 to 11 in after-school

01:12:14,650 --> 01:12:18,340
coding clubs that are led by volunteers

01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:21,489
that are free to attend and free for

01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:24,520
schools we teach kids how to code to

01:12:21,489 --> 01:12:26,500
again hopefully result in that spark

01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:28,780
that initial spark that will hopefully

01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:29,920
stay with them for their whole lives so

01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:31,510
if you want to learn more about that

01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:32,949
please find me afterwards because we

01:12:31,510 --> 01:12:35,949
always need more volunteers and more

01:12:32,949 --> 01:12:40,080
schools and thank you again you've been

01:12:35,949 --> 01:12:40,080
a wonderful wonderful audience thank you

01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:54,180
