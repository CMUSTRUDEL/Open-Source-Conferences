question so pipe up right away and save

00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,090
us all the hassle so what am I talking

00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:17,180
about today I'm talking about usability

00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:18,770
so usability as sort of this big grand

00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,719
theory that a lot of people talk about

00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,549
but what it boils down to is what we

00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,170
want to do is structure everything that

00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,369
we do so that our users aren't

00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,859
complaining about us on twitter and

00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:29,810
facebook okay because they say there's

00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:32,240
no such thing as bad press they are

00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:34,460
wrong okay the last thing we want is our

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,389
users talking about how horrible we are

00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:39,770
and scaring off potential new customers

00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:41,509
okay so what's the first thing someone's

00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:45,049
going to do when your site is difficult

00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:48,020
to use they're going to go else where

00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:49,579
they're going to leave okay there are so

00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,439
many websites out there you guys are not

00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:52,939
the only option so the first thing

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,350
they're going to do is not contact you

00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:55,819
and ask for help the first thing they're

00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:58,490
going to do is just leave and never come

00:01:55,819 --> 00:02:01,609
back because it was hard okay we don't

00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:02,810
like things that are hard okay so what's

00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:04,850
the first thing we do when we're talking

00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,770
about usability the very first thing you

00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:10,789
need to do is figure out who are your

00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:12,620
users okay so your users are they very

00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:14,180
technical are they not very techincal

00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,470
are they in a hurry when they come to

00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,760
your site or are they looking for

00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,800
something that's going to slowly walk

00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,770
them through things what do your users

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,570
want out of your website and along with

00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:25,040
that what do you want out of your users

00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:26,780
when they come to your website because

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,830
those are often very different things

00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,600
they want to come

00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,910
to your website to compare prices you

00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,350
want them to buy something okay so how

00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,950
do you get them to do what they want to

00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:38,000
do and also what you want to do as well

00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,770
another great thing to find out about

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,690
your users is where are they going to go

00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:43,250
if your site doesn't work and why does

00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:45,380
that site work for them when yours

00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:49,310
doesn't so keep an eye on where your

00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:50,660
users are going when they leave so what

00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,730
kinds of things do we look at when

00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,990
designing for usability the first and

00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:56,480
foremost thing you want to look at is

00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:58,880
learnability is it really difficult to

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,130
learn how to use your site as intuitive

00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,960
as you think your site maybe your users

00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:04,760
still have to learn to use it the first

00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,320
time they come to your site and we want

00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,470
to make sure that's as easy for them as

00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:11,390
possible obviously the Internet has made

00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:13,130
us all very impatient we don't want to

00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,660
spend a lot of time having to wait for

00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:16,490
things or doing things we want it to be

00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:19,340
fast so make sure your site is very

00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:21,050
efficient make sure that the things your

00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,400
users want to do on your website are

00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:24,740
easy to find so they don't have to

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,570
remember 12 steps to dig down to find

00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:28,340
something because users don't like to

00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:29,720
have to remember things especially if

00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:33,170
they're only coming to your site maybe

00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:35,600
once or twice a year make sure that your

00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:38,269
errors are easy clear and recoverable

00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,980
and lastly and this is listed last

00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:41,239
because it's the least important not

00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,530
that it's not important but it's the

00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:44,510
least important of all this make sure

00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:46,040
your site looks nice obviously if it's

00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:48,560
hideous and horrendous it's hard to

00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,350
convince people to stay so what are some

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,150
common problems to avoid well first and

00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,950
foremost the important thing to remember

00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:57,290
is once you figure out who your users

00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:59,180
are realize that you are not one of them

00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:00,830
you have worked with the software you

00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,690
know the backend you know what happens

00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:04,430
to it when the data comes in you are too

00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:07,070
close to the project you are not a user

00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:09,709
anymore even if you are a customer of

00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:11,060
the same site okay you are no longer the

00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:13,550
user you need to find someone who is

00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,669
completely unrelated to your company to

00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:17,840
give you feedback about the users side

00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:20,390
we want to make sure we don't overwhelm

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,729
people we want to be very consistent and

00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:25,250
like I said we don't want to make people

00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:26,900
remember too many things so let's take a

00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:29,830
look at how some of these things work in

00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,640
practice okay this is a little bug

00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,560
basically what we're doing right now is

00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:36,470
going through my pet peeves on websites

00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,450
so bear with me okay so typing practice

00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,950
here we have a pretty simple form I

00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,940
won't tell you whose website I stole

00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,130
this from

00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,060
so we have a simple web form here we're

00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,160
going to go through and we're going to

00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,450
fill it all out and we're a good user so

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,970
we're going to be very careful and

00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:54,620
conscientious we filled it all out here

00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:56,540
we have everything right okay oh no our

00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,100
passwords didn't match and there's no

00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,750
way we could possibly have checked that

00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,550
no matter how carefully we did it

00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,230
because obviously it displays as

00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,910
asterisks so we can't double check that

00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:07,580
and I'm not saying that's a bad thing

00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:09,680
just that even a careful user could make

00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:14,000
that mistake so what's the first thing

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:18,200
you notice here it's empty how many

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,330
people love to see this no okay we don't

00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,430
like practicing or typing we don't have

00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:24,050
to practice their type it in over and

00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:26,600
over again so make sure you are not

00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:28,610
deleting good data if a user gives you

00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,350
good data hang on to it don't make them

00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:32,030
type it in again because chances are the

00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,650
second time they're not going to do it

00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,630
or they're not going to do it as well as

00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:39,500
they did it the first time so if they

00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:40,850
give you good data hang on to it here's

00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,010
another one of my favorites here's our

00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:47,810
web form again what do you notice about

00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:51,620
this web form select a state yes so it

00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:53,360
looks filled in but it's not right ok so

00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,530
I click to sign me up here's what

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,540
happened it tells me please choose a

00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:58,250
state so I'm going to come over here I

00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,419
must select a state i'm going to click

00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:05,000
sign me up and now what's going to

00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:07,340
happen the passwords exactly make sure

00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,830
your error messages actually tell the

00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,690
user what they need to know ok we don't

00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:13,370
want to have them go through this

00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,930
continuous loop cycle where every time

00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:17,600
they click submit another read error

00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:19,190
message pops up ok that makes them feel

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,669
like they can't move forward and they

00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:24,800
will stop trying ok so here's how we

00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:26,150
should fix something like that ok all we

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,700
have to do is just add a simple line

00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:30,110
saying please choose a state except it

00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,310
shouldn't say am state this what happens

00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,800
when you tweak your slides right before

00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:36,020
the talk ok so see spell check doesn't

00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,280
pick that stuff up so please choose a

00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,740
state for security reasons please

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,260
reenter your password ok simple simple

00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,180
but it tells them what they have to do

00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:46,490
we can even take it a step further and

00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,570
highlight those fields for them now they

00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,450
don't even have to read the error

00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:52,010
message they just automatically know ok

00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:54,330
these red fields i need to do something

00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,860
with ok so you can

00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,330
and take the reading out of it for them

00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,750
by doing something like this to

00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:02,520
highlight the fields so the goal in all

00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:05,069
of this is to be forgiving and

00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,050
empowering to the user okay no user

00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:08,969
likes to feel like they're stupid no

00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:11,280
user likes to feel like they're too dumb

00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:13,439
to use your website so make sure that

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,289
you're making it feel like oh no problem

00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,550
I can fix this so make it very clear to

00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:22,199
them what they need to do to change

00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:24,030
things okay here's another one of my

00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:27,270
favorites what's going to happen when we

00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:30,449
submit this form because where is

00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:32,729
everyone going to click clear farm

00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:35,039
because we don't read buttons we just

00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:36,870
click and at least at least in the US

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,520
where I'm from we read from left to

00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,840
right so obviously the rightmost thing

00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,430
is the last thing I do on the page right

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,500
because then I'm leaving so I'm moving

00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:46,020
this way so I'm not even going to read

00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,789
it i'm going to click clear form okay

00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:51,270
i'm done right it must have done

00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:53,219
something okay okay now if I'm a smart

00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,569
user and I think wait this isn't quite

00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:57,330
right and I take a second look and I

00:07:54,569 --> 00:08:00,440
realized oh clear form shoot okay i'm

00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:04,289
going to retype everything again okay

00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:06,210
now it's going to happen yeah exactly I

00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:08,039
don't if you are doing why is there even

00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:10,919
a clear form button I don't know but so

00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:12,210
many people use them okay and this is my

00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:14,069
favorite part of the clear form button

00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:17,250
okay so I forgot to pick a state again

00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:18,330
now what's happened because now you've

00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,250
taught me to click the button on the

00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:23,879
left and now the buttons have changed

00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:26,490
okay be consistent okay if you're

00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,870
teaching me to do something wrong at

00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:30,419
least stick with it till the end of the

00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:33,539
form okay so make sure your buttons stay

00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:34,740
in the same place okay users are not

00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:36,810
going to read your buttons they're going

00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,279
to click without thinking and then

00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:40,769
they're going to be lost and confused as

00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:42,390
to what just happened okay so an easy

00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:43,649
way to fix that if you have to have a

00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:46,290
clear form button which I don't

00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:48,660
recommend put it way way over on the

00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:50,399
left hand side and in fact you could

00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,560
even use some pictures to help because

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,740
again pictures and colors help a lot

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:58,290
more than text and so obviously there we

00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,839
have a red meaning stop and it's going

00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:03,120
backwards and we have a green moving

00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:05,970
forward okay so that's a very clear sign

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,769
to people that hey clear form is going

00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,509
to take me backwards in the process

00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:13,139
a sign me up is moving me forward in the

00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:15,959
process so let's talk about user

00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:17,699
expectations okay here we have a simple

00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:21,449
list of links where do you think these

00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:25,529
links go or I should say where two links

00:09:21,449 --> 00:09:27,420
normally go on a website I'm sorry yeah

00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:30,389
another website other pages on the

00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:33,779
website okay so what we don't know about

00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:35,309
this list here is that perhaps a day in

00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:36,720
the life of an astronaut actually does

00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:38,999
take you to another page on this site

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,679
but biography of Neil Armstrong drops

00:09:38,999 --> 00:09:42,239
you off at Amazon because this is their

00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:44,369
referral link to get you to buy the book

00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:47,309
through their referral link okay now

00:09:44,369 --> 00:09:49,259
most users might notice that they've

00:09:47,309 --> 00:09:50,670
left your site and arrived on amazon but

00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:52,499
believe it or not a lot of people will

00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,029
not notice and suddenly there's a new

00:09:52,499 --> 00:09:55,920
menu bar they can't go back to your site

00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:56,999
they don't know how to find it again so

00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,129
what we want to make sure is if people

00:09:56,999 --> 00:10:02,040
are leaving our site we're letting them

00:09:59,129 --> 00:10:03,720
know okay early photos of astronaut

00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,970
training maybe that's a pop-up for a

00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,129
slideshow light box or something okay

00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:09,689
that can startle a lot of people because

00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:11,579
all of a sudden there's this thing over

00:10:09,689 --> 00:10:12,869
the top of the website and believe it or

00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:14,730
not a lot of people don't understand

00:10:12,869 --> 00:10:16,470
that you can hit escape or mouse over

00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,970
the X to get back and so suddenly

00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,740
there's something stuck in front of the

00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:21,089
website and we don't want them to feel

00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,809
like they have to leave our site and

00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:27,929
come back to use everything the last one

00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:29,910
maybe as a PDF now PDFs generally are

00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:31,889
handled in browser by a plugin but some

00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:34,769
people don't okay some people can't

00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:36,329
handle PDFs within the browser so what

00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:38,910
happens then is they get a little pop-up

00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:40,439
message that says this website is trying

00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,660
to download something onto your computer

00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:45,149
or it says this website is trying to

00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:47,790
open up an external application okay we

00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:51,269
know what that means they don't what do

00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:53,220
they think it means virus we've taught

00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:54,689
them that when a website tries to

00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,779
download something that you didn't

00:10:54,689 --> 00:10:59,999
expect it's bad it's a virus don't do it

00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:03,600
and we don't want our users thinking our

00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:05,999
website is giving them a virus okay so

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,889
make sure that your users always know

00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:09,989
what's happening we don't want to make

00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:11,129
this a scary experience for them we

00:11:09,989 --> 00:11:13,110
definitely don't want them telling

00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,999
people that we gave them a virus so you

00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:17,429
can do something very simple here here

00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:18,600
we have by the biography on Amazon so

00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:21,029
we're just letting know you're going

00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,200
somewhere else here we just can say hey

00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:23,130
it's a slide show

00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,110
you can tell them it's going to pop up

00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:27,510
in a new window or something or just

00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:29,160
mention that it's a PDF those kinds of

00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,810
things will really help the users so

00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,930
little things can go a long way with

00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:36,120
helping your users then you end up sites

00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:37,440
like this okay users are not going to

00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,660
read the text so what they're going to

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,610
read on here is create an account sign

00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,950
up today sign up today check them out

00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,630
check them out okay none of this makes

00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:48,060
sense it doesn't tell us what we're

00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:50,610
doing or where we're going okay my other

00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:52,020
pet peeve welcome friend if you walk

00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:54,390
into a store and somebody walks up to

00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:56,130
you and says welcome friend what are you

00:11:54,390 --> 00:12:02,250
going to do right don't do that it's

00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:04,230
creepy okay so always make sure that if

00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:06,300
the users are just scanning the buttons

00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,980
and bold text on your page that they can

00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,570
understand what they're supposed to do

00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,580
your marketing department may have

00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:13,080
written some wonderful expose on how

00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,880
great you guys are nobody's going to

00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:18,210
read it so make sure the cliff notes

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,920
work so do something like this okay

00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:22,320
create an account that one's pretty

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,420
descriptive what we've done here sign up

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,010
today now we've got a link to the

00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,870
newsletter and the catalog of products

00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:29,520
so they know what they're signing up for

00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:32,130
we've made it highlighted they can click

00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:34,290
directly to those items down here now we

00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:37,080
have read reviews and view catalog PDF

00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:39,480
as opposed to just saying check them out

00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,890
let's check what out you know okay so

00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,380
just make your buttons and things more

00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:44,940
descriptive the same thing works in a

00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:47,250
block of text if you have links in a

00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:49,290
block of text okay they're going to read

00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:51,600
sign up sign up this site click here

00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:53,910
okay click here is the worst link ever

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,200
okay because people are just going to

00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,250
read click here and how many people are

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,730
going to click on something they don't

00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:01,110
know what it's for hopefully no one so

00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:02,640
we want to make sure that we're much

00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,010
more descriptive and use things like

00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,960
create an account sign up for our great

00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:08,850
newsletter read product reviews browse

00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,500
our products so use a little bit more

00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:13,980
verbiage in your links and it can go a

00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:17,180
long way another one of my pet peeves

00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,180
what color are links

00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:24,310
okay links have to be a specific color

00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:25,780
it doesn't have to be blue it can be a

00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:28,200
different color that matches your design

00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:30,910
that's fine but be consistent okay

00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,740
people don't like having to slowly move

00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,690
the mouse cursor over to see if it flips

00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:36,460
into the hand and then they can click on

00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:38,020
something make it obvious to them so

00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,760
they can go right there and click on it

00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:42,480
and be on their way don't make them

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:48,660
guess and don't make it look like this

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:51,400
so yeah just don't and another one

00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,560
remember going back to knowing the user

00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,570
and you are not the user we want to make

00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,790
sure that users have the information

00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:59,760
they need when they need it okay how

00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:04,180
many people have ordered pizza before

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:06,280
okay okay what size do you want 12

00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,780
inches 18 inches or 24 inches or I

00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,660
should probably switch it to centimeters

00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:15,270
or something here right I'm sorry no

00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:15,270
inches for pizza okay okay there you go

00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:24,880
yeah oh they get much bigger trust me

00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:26,590
okay so what size do you guys want okay

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:31,660
what kind of questions you might you ask

00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:33,490
if you call and they ask you that how

00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,810
many does it serve exactly because

00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,940
what's the real thing you need the

00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:38,350
answer to you're trying to serve a

00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,660
certain number of people you don't care

00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:42,220
how many inches big it is you just care

00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:46,630
about how many people are going to eat

00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:48,460
don't don't comment it how many slices

00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,990
that's another good question although I

00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,610
mean what if they're cutting them very

00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:54,160
small I mean you just never know see the

00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:56,650
real question is how many people will

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,180
this feed okay so we want to make sure I

00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:59,740
was going to talk about this too okay

00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,790
how about the pizza crust which one do

00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:04,580
you want

00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:07,120
no no right the new original does that

00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:10,520
make the original very bad I don't know

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,440
okay so the information that you need is

00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,180
not necessarily the information that the

00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,950
user understands okay so when you're

00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,990
making the pizza you need to know how

00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:20,060
many inches wide to make it as a user

00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:21,920
coming in they just care about how many

00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,960
people are going to be eating it so make

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,550
sure your understanding and transmitting

00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,500
the information in a way that your users

00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,880
are going to understand it okay so you

00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:32,090
can quickly add in something like this

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,830
okay feeds 1 to 2 2 to 3 etc and here we

00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,120
can say like oh it's hand toss with

00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:38,000
cheese baked into the crust okay that

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,130
sounds delicious right so having just

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,420
just a simple amount of text to help the

00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:43,130
user get the information they need

00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,390
because even if you have that

00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,730
information somewhere else on your

00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:48,530
website you never want your user to have

00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,150
to leave your order form to go find that

00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:52,220
information because chances are they're

00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:54,500
not going to find their way back okay so

00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:56,120
if we keep all the information here so

00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,890
that they can have the information when

00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,690
they have to make the decision they

00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:03,050
never have to leave they can just keep

00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:04,100
going and give us their money so now

00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,750
that we've talked about some of the

00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,240
common problems how do we test to see

00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:10,400
what our problems are the first up thing

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,220
you want to do is create personas now in

00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,930
a persona is an imaginary person so what

00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,790
you do is you think about who's coming

00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:18,980
to your site okay so we're talking about

00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:21,680
ordering pizza who would be an imaginary

00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:27,950
customer of a pizza place besides all of

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:30,440
us let's be more specific drunk college

00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:33,050
students yes John college students order

00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:36,610
a lot of pizza how about frazzled

00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:41,540
parents with screaming children yep or

00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:43,820
it's what yeah exactly so we have tons

00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:45,800
of people that can order pizza okay what

00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:48,200
we need to do is boil it down to maybe

00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,760
the top 10 kinds of people that are

00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,320
going to be ordering pizza so think

00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,420
about who's using your site the most

00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:55,490
who's doing it the most often and you

00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:57,680
want to target them or if you're going

00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:59,390
to be targeting a new audience make some

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,070
personas that fit into your new target

00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:03,710
audience okay so we create these

00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:04,970
imaginary people and the next up thing

00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:07,010
we're going to do is create a list of

00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:08,930
tasks for these people to accomplish on

00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:10,520
our site these can be things that they

00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:12,890
want to do on the site and things that

00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,569
we want them to do on the site so what

00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:17,059
we want to do when we do that is

00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:19,759
identify simple tasks break them down

00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:22,309
very small and we want to make sure each

00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:23,839
task has a success criteria so for

00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:26,089
instance perhaps it is ordering a pizza

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,610
and the success criteria is that they

00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:29,960
receive a receipt okay that way we know

00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:33,559
for sure whether or not the test

00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:35,779
succeeded or failed then once we have

00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:38,630
all of this done we want to find people

00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:40,429
that match our personas so we're going

00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:41,779
to find real people who do not work for

00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:44,809
our company who do not already know

00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:46,429
about our company you can find existing

00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:48,169
customers but you want to make sure they

00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:50,720
aren't tied into the company behind the

00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:53,450
website in any way so they're not

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,039
consultants they're not you know spouses

00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:56,240
of people who work at the company and

00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,919
things like that you want to find people

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,259
who are unrelated to your company other

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,519
than being your customers and we're

00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:03,889
going to sit down with them and give

00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:05,809
them the list of tasks and ask them to

00:18:03,889 --> 00:18:07,789
complete it now the best way to do this

00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:10,879
is to do it so no one is watching them

00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:12,529
so videotape them watch them from behind

00:18:10,879 --> 00:18:14,120
a two-way mirror something like that

00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:15,409
because if you have someone sitting in

00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,049
the room and you're at the computer and

00:18:15,409 --> 00:18:20,750
you say okay go ahead and login what did

00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:23,539
I just do I just pointed at the login

00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:25,039
button okay you can't help it even if

00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:26,570
you don't point if you sit on your hands

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,159
or something you can't help but look

00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:29,690
where they're supposed to go and people

00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:32,120
are amazingly good at picking up on

00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:33,200
those cues also having someone sitting

00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,750
in there is going to make them nervous

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,830
and on top of that you're not going to

00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,389
be sitting there when they have to do

00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:40,549
this at home so we want to find out

00:18:38,389 --> 00:18:43,370
exactly how long it takes them without

00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:44,389
having anyone around to ask for help so

00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:48,110
you want to try to put them in by

00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:49,340
themselves so what kinds of things do

00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:51,440
you test when you do these persona

00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:53,419
testings if you're doing a redesign

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,509
start by testing your old design first

00:18:53,419 --> 00:18:58,460
even if your old design is terrible your

00:18:56,509 --> 00:19:00,230
users are used to it even if they

00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,639
complain about it they know where

00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,870
everything is on your old site and

00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:04,970
they're going to be mad when you change

00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:06,350
it so what we want to make sure we do

00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:08,059
first is find out what are their

00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:10,159
expectations based on our old website

00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:11,929
well kinds of things are easy for them

00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:14,419
to do what kinds of things are difficult

00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:17,750
for them to do where do they look first

00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:19,759
for things on our website okay then go

00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:21,740
through your competitors websites do

00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:23,419
some user testing with those find out

00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,039
what's really easy on your competitors

00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:26,990
websites chances are they've already

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,039
done user testing they figured out some

00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:30,590
awesome things

00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:32,869
test it and find out what it is okay not

00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:34,879
only that but your users might have just

00:19:32,869 --> 00:19:37,429
left your competitor's website to come

00:19:34,879 --> 00:19:39,049
to yours so what we want to do is not

00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:41,210
make the same mistake and drive them

00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:44,450
away a second time so what can we

00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:46,609
improve check out sites that are popular

00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:48,710
with your users even if they're

00:19:46,609 --> 00:19:51,229
completely unrelated they are still

00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:55,299
teaching users how to use websites okay

00:19:51,229 --> 00:19:55,299
where's the login button on a website

00:19:55,389 --> 00:20:00,649
top right exactly it's in the top right

00:19:58,549 --> 00:20:02,960
why is it in the top right does it not

00:20:00,649 --> 00:20:04,789
fit anywhere else on the page that's

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,950
just that's where we expect it to be

00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:09,229
that's where we naturally look for it

00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:11,539
because over the years websites have

00:20:09,229 --> 00:20:14,090
taught us that that's where it goes so

00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:16,220
now that's what we expect so even if

00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:18,470
your website has nothing to do with

00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:21,320
facebook facebook is teaching your users

00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:23,749
how to use your website so make sure to

00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,159
test those websites that your users use

00:20:23,749 --> 00:20:26,629
even if they're totally unrelated

00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:28,129
because it will give you a lot of

00:20:26,629 --> 00:20:29,929
insight into what your users are

00:20:28,129 --> 00:20:33,080
instinctively going to expect from your

00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:34,669
website and of course you want to test

00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,349
your proposed website to make sure

00:20:34,669 --> 00:20:38,239
you're actually fixing the problems that

00:20:36,349 --> 00:20:39,859
you think you're fixing a lot of times

00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:41,779
users have problems but they can't tell

00:20:39,859 --> 00:20:43,190
us why they're having problems so we

00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:44,869
might think we've solved a problem when

00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:47,629
we really haven't so what we want to

00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:49,909
make sure we do is create the design

00:20:47,629 --> 00:20:52,190
test it with our users then make

00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:54,349
improvements to the design and test it

00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:56,599
again we never want to leave a design

00:20:54,349 --> 00:20:58,759
untested thinking that it's passed all

00:20:56,599 --> 00:21:00,590
the tests because every change you make

00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:02,869
may affect something else that we don't

00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:07,519
expect so make sure you're always

00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:09,139
testing after each iteration so if you

00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:11,239
take nothing else away from this talk

00:21:09,139 --> 00:21:14,359
make sure that you're keeping things

00:21:11,239 --> 00:21:16,129
simple the more often that someone has

00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:18,349
to do something on your website the

00:21:16,129 --> 00:21:20,599
easier it should be if they have to go

00:21:18,349 --> 00:21:22,489
through 27 clicks every day to use your

00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:24,830
site how long before they find an easier

00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:26,629
place to go I mean it just takes too

00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:29,059
much time it's too many clicks it's not

00:21:26,629 --> 00:21:30,710
fun so what we want to make sure to do

00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:32,509
is find out what our users use the most

00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,190
and make that the easiest thing for them

00:21:32,509 --> 00:21:36,440
to accomplish we don't want to be

00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:39,539
wasting any clicks any keystrokes and

00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:41,669
most importantly anytime

00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:43,679
okay so brace yourselves we're going to

00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:45,720
talk about some real live web sites and

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,100
about how their usability is these are

00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,940
pretty horrendous so here we go

00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:52,499
hopefully no one made these okay so

00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,029
here's a website and I found all of

00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:57,299
these just a few months ago these are

00:21:54,029 --> 00:21:59,460
not very old and I've put the links it's

00:21:57,299 --> 00:22:00,869
kind of hard to see here but if you get

00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,009
my slides later I do have the link so

00:22:00,869 --> 00:22:03,509
you can check them out for yourself

00:22:02,009 --> 00:22:06,090
because one of the things you really

00:22:03,509 --> 00:22:08,220
can't appreciate on a slide is how long

00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:11,909
this page goes for when you scroll down

00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:13,649
it's about 10 20 more page links okay so

00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:17,279
what you guys think of this website are

00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:22,019
you signing up anybody know what we're

00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:24,179
signing up for no idea right okay any

00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:30,499
guesses what do you think this website

00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:30,499
does and don't just say delivers pain

00:22:36,409 --> 00:22:43,679
you might think that but no yeah you can

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:46,009
buy something I don't know what you can

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,009
join

00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:51,410
okay so way way up at the top and the

00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:56,090
blue text that's not a link is the ohio

00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:57,650
academy of science so then if you squint

00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:59,120
really hard and read this tiny little

00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:02,990
print in the lower right corner it

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:11,360
explains what that is okay where's the

00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:14,990
navigation on this side yes and yes and

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,660
yes ok so there's navigation here those

00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:19,250
navigation across the top and this

00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:21,050
second column in here that looks like

00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:26,630
advertisements is actually part of their

00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:28,309
main navigation ok all right what color

00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:32,809
are the links on the site what can you

00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:35,300
click on some of them are blue some of

00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:39,200
the blue text including some underlined

00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:41,929
blue text it's not clickable sometimes

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,030
it's red sometimes it's yellow sometimes

00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:48,980
it's blue highlighted with yellow my

00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:51,890
personal favorite on the page here yes

00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:53,809
so obviously everyone's laughing looking

00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:55,280
at this right that's not the response we

00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:57,530
want our users to have when they come to

00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:59,059
our site so keep in mind these kinds of

00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:05,950
things can we're gonna take a look at

00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:09,230
another one give it just a minute yeah

00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:11,480
okay someone told me after my last talk

00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:14,660
to make another slide with it paused so

00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:17,300
that I people don't have to do it okay

00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:19,100
first and foremost never use blink okay

00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,929
but especially don't use it on a large

00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:23,500
paragraph of text it's really hard to

00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:27,520
read things that keep disappearing okay

00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:30,820
okay so what is this website do wait

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:35,020
it's wet

00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:38,630
so think they sell stuff actually there

00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:40,940
yeah water management stuff if you can

00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:43,880
read the yellow on this background their

00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:47,809
consultant company so they design and

00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:54,740
consult for something yeah I will color

00:24:47,809 --> 00:24:56,750
our links there a few of the links are

00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:59,809
red some of them are blue but this blue

00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:01,909
text in the middle is not a link yeah

00:24:59,809 --> 00:25:03,380
yeah this is probably my favorite part

00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:06,520
of this website besides the blinking is

00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:10,100
this button here that just says download

00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:11,570
yeah um someone in my last talk was

00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:14,029
brave enough to click on it I was like I

00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:15,500
didn't click on it but apparently it

00:25:14,029 --> 00:25:16,970
goes to another website where then you

00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:22,490
can click another link to download their

00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:24,220
PDF brochure so yeah okay so navigation

00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:26,840
for this site where's the navigation

00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:28,100
yeah it's buttons on the left so they

00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,350
have that going for them we could find

00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:32,059
the navigation the buttons are

00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:34,100
relatively descriptive but use a lot of

00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:36,890
abbreviated words so that they all fit

00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:38,690
on the same size button that rarely

00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:41,210
works for your users because your

00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:44,720
abbreviation internally is probably not

00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:46,549
the same like abbreviation that some you

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,350
know random person at some company who

00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:49,429
is just trying to hire somebody who

00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:51,350
knows about this stuff that doesn't

00:25:49,429 --> 00:25:52,730
actually know about it they're not going

00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:54,350
to understand your internal

00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:58,460
abbreviations so don't use abbreviations

00:25:54,350 --> 00:26:00,049
in your buttons yeah it's a really long

00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,340
list of button some subcategories would

00:26:00,049 --> 00:26:04,820
probably really help we don't want to

00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:06,529
overwhelm people with choices and if

00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,940
anyone is very interested in hiring the

00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:11,740
web designer who did this you can

00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,740
contact them at bite me web designs

00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:16,800
okay now pretend you have never seen

00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:19,200
this website before okay you don't know

00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:21,660
what it's for okay just looking at this

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:24,120
page what does this website do so those

00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:28,770
it sells apps okay and if you are not a

00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:32,670
programmer what is a nap it's a game a

00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:37,530
game for what your phone this company

00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:38,730
sell things for my phone no okay what

00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:43,470
else do you notice about this website

00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:45,300
where is the login top right so we can

00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:47,850
find the login and they've even taken it

00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:49,140
a step further because what's the most

00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:51,840
common thing you're going to do on this

00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:53,130
page login that's what you have to do

00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,050
every day when you come to this page

00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:57,150
there's not what else to do on this page

00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:58,860
except login okay so what they've done

00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:00,690
is instead of making you click login

00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,370
which takes you to a form that you then

00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:04,110
fill out and click login a second time

00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:06,450
they've put the form right there so you

00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:11,960
don't have to click it okay what else do

00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:14,190
you notice here yep you can sign up

00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:18,150
notice anything strange about the signup

00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:20,760
form yep they ask for your email twice

00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:26,460
but your password once is that right or

00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:28,620
wrong it's weird okay that's right it's

00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:30,390
weird it's weird because websites have

00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:32,400
taught us that you enter your email once

00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:34,590
and your password twice they've taught

00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,770
us that that's how it goes but why do we

00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,770
do that

00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:45,049
sure because it's unlikely you're going

00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:47,120
to type your password twice wrong okay

00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:49,160
but if you lose your password or if you

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,919
type it wrong what do you need to have

00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:54,980
to recover your password your email

00:27:51,919 --> 00:28:00,679
address okay what happens if you don't

00:27:54,980 --> 00:28:01,820
remember which email address you used if

00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:06,710
you don't know what email address you

00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:08,120
used well but what if you typed your

00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:10,510
what if you typed your email address

00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:12,559
wrong how do you recover your password

00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:16,730
you could call them on the phone and

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:18,380
hope somebody answers right so oh yeah

00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:23,390
exactly if we know someone at Facebook

00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:27,470
we call them but the average user can't

00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:29,390
do that yes okay so what they've done is

00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:31,909
identified what is the most important

00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:33,650
piece of information for their users and

00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:35,809
they're asking for that twice to make

00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:37,220
sure they have it correctly the password

00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:39,500
well you just click forgot my password

00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:41,690
so that's not difficult to recover and

00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,520
change but if the email address is wrong

00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:45,200
and you forget your password you're out

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,789
of luck okay so what they've done is

00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,750
even though that's against convention

00:28:46,789 --> 00:28:53,210
it's what works best for their users

00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:54,559
okay how about this birthday how many

00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:58,309
websites do you sign up for that have to

00:28:54,559 --> 00:29:01,970
ask for your birthday too many there you

00:28:58,309 --> 00:29:03,530
go so it's not necessarily a standard

00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:04,880
thing so what they've done here is

00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:06,679
they've added a link that says why do I

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,970
need to provide my birthday so what

00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:09,890
they're doing is without making you

00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:11,210
leave this form they're giving you the

00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:12,409
information you need to make the

00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:17,299
decision of whether or not you want to

00:29:12,409 --> 00:29:19,250
let them have your birthday okay how

00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:20,240
about this line down here I don't know

00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:23,000
if you guys can read it it's kind of

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,559
small it's the languages and what

00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,320
they've done to is they've written each

00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:30,320
language in its native language as well

00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:36,350
as sort of an English translation ish or

00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:40,580
an alternate translation it's what oh I

00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:43,900
see the country's mm-hmm yeah but that's

00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,900
not how you do spell France is it

00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:53,779
yeah so that's why i said alternate it's

00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:58,519
sort of local okay so they're giving you

00:29:53,779 --> 00:30:02,390
the option in your own language exactly

00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:04,399
that's an important distinction okay so

00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:05,899
taking a look again wipe your minds we

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:09,320
know nothing about this website what

00:30:05,899 --> 00:30:13,519
does this website do it looks like a

00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:15,559
dating site exactly and it's a dating

00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:19,639
site where you can create a page for a

00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:21,409
celebrity band or business what ok so

00:30:19,639 --> 00:30:22,880
again no information about what this is

00:30:21,409 --> 00:30:25,820
other than that it's free and always

00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,260
will be ok so perhaps they could work on

00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:29,049
their marketing just a little not

00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:31,460
everybody knows what Facebook is right

00:30:29,049 --> 00:30:34,789
so yeah so the pictures and graphics

00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:36,169
that you use even if they look cool may

00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:37,909
not be giving off the right impression

00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:39,549
for what your site is for someone who

00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:41,840
doesn't already know what your site does

00:30:39,549 --> 00:30:43,309
ok here's another one pretend you don't

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:56,840
know what this site is and what it does

00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:58,250
ok what is it lots of space yeah it says

00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,750
gmail and I don't know if you can read

00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:02,870
underneath it says a Google approach to

00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:07,510
email so it does tell you that possibly

00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:09,649
this is about email where's the login

00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:12,500
it's on the right but it's not in the

00:31:09,649 --> 00:31:14,210
top right so create an account is now in

00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,950
the top right which is a common place

00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:17,750
for us to look first and they've

00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:20,600
actually moved the login to the main

00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:22,970
page the main section of the page ok now

00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:26,000
they've done this because how many times

00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:28,490
do you sign up for a gmail account for

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,899
the average user again thinking average

00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:36,340
user here the average user signs up once

00:31:32,899 --> 00:31:39,710
ok but how many times do you log in

00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:41,029
countless times right so that is the

00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:42,679
most common thing you're going to be

00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:45,470
doing on this website so they've made it

00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:48,909
the easiest and biggest thing to find ok

00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:48,909
um what else do you notice

00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:55,649
yep you can change the language but this

00:31:53,250 --> 00:32:00,390
is another one of my pet peeves what do

00:31:55,649 --> 00:32:02,190
you do to change the language click on

00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:04,440
English rights you click on English

00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:06,330
which we're already on English so if you

00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:09,120
don't read English it's not an overly

00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:11,450
helpful drop down once you're in the

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:15,570
drop down how do you select something

00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:18,570
you just let go or you can yeah scroll

00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:20,820
and click we have taught users that

00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:22,679
these drop down buttons work that they

00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:24,539
can go in look around choose their thing

00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:27,570
and then they click a button to submit

00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:29,039
the form now this form as soon as you

00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,169
let go or as soon as you click on

00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:35,610
something inside that drop down

00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:38,370
everything on the page changes now yes

00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:40,520
now if you go in and you choose like

00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:44,309
mandarin or one of the other options

00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:47,220
this drop down button moves on the page

00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:49,200
so it will not be in the same place now

00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,789
those of us who are technical understand

00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,409
well it's still drop down box I'll still

00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:55,230
identify it by the fact that it's a drop

00:32:52,409 --> 00:32:58,350
down box but to the average user if that

00:32:55,230 --> 00:33:00,299
disappears they freak out it's gone I

00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:01,350
don't know what to do I and I didn't

00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:02,640
even mean to click anything I just want

00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:05,250
to see what was in there and suddenly

00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,899
everything's in Chinese okay so we want

00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:09,179
to make sure that we don't scare our

00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:11,730
users we don't do things that they're

00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:17,460
not expecting and we want to always give

00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:20,190
them an easy way back out okay so to

00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:22,080
recap typing practice nobody likes to

00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:25,169
practice typing so don't delete good

00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:27,149
data okay don't be sneaky don't move

00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:29,130
stuff around be clear on what's missing

00:33:27,149 --> 00:33:30,870
okay if you clear out their password

00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:32,490
which is fine just let them know you did

00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:34,649
so they can fill it back in before they

00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:36,120
click Submit not with a secondary error

00:33:34,649 --> 00:33:37,980
message we don't want to leave them in

00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:40,500
that loop of I can't ever get past an

00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:42,960
error message to submit this form keep

00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:44,309
your buttons consistent and please if

00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,100
you don't have to please don't use a

00:33:44,309 --> 00:33:48,570
clear form button okay make the path

00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:50,580
through your site obvious and make sure

00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:51,960
it's easily scannable so people can

00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:54,029
easily just read through your site and

00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,010
figure out where they need to go so make

00:33:54,029 --> 00:33:57,539
sure those links and your buttons are

00:33:56,010 --> 00:34:00,029
very descriptive to tell people where to

00:33:57,539 --> 00:34:01,280
go don't let a unicorn puke all over

00:34:00,029 --> 00:34:03,200
your website

00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:05,060
and if you do one thing one way on your

00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,830
site do it that way everywhere on your

00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:08,540
site if you're going to change it be

00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:11,000
clear on how you're changing it and why

00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:13,010
so that people are not surprised by any

00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,450
of the actions that happen and make sure

00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:17,990
that you're using the language your

00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:19,280
users understand this next slide is just

00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:22,010
for you to read later when you're

00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,470
looking through my slides okay and it's

00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:26,120
just a list of 21 different usability

00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:28,490
features and this will put together in

00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:30,980
1997 which was quite a bit of time ago

00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:32,570
however this list still applies today

00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:34,640
because even though technology has

00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:36,770
changed quite a bit and the way we use

00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:39,110
websites has changed quite a bit the way

00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:41,270
people use things has not changed as

00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:45,200
much and so these usability guidelines

00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:46,700
really do apply for quite a long time if

00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,870
you're looking for more information some

00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:50,600
great places to check out is the

00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:52,250
usability first site has a lot of great

00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,020
information about what kinds of research

00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:55,340
they're doing in to usability what kinds

00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,780
of things you can find out and what

00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:59,150
kinds of tips you can use on your site

00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:00,920
there's a usability toolkit which can

00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:02,630
help you test your existing site or set

00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:05,600
up tests for personas and things like

00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:06,980
that usability gov is a US government

00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,170
site that talks about usability

00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:11,240
guidelines in the US and even though

00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:13,370
it's us centric it is still very helpful

00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,990
just as a general usability website they

00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:17,300
have a lot of good resources listed on

00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:19,940
there and jakob nielsen if you go to his

00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:22,100
website it looks horrible it's totally

00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,960
horrendous but he has some really good

00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:25,850
articles and usability why he doesn't

00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:28,400
apply them to his own website I don't

00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:30,200
know ok but he does have some good

00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:35,060
articles but you'll have to squint a lot

00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:36,650
it's so yellow ok ok so I would love it

00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,910
if you would find me at some point after

00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:39,290
this talk I know there's not much of the

00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:40,670
conference left but i'll be around after

00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:43,700
this you can find me on twitter as well

00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:45,680
at e3 Beth t I'm involved in my local

00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:47,000
user group if you are not involved in

00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,470
your local user group I strongly

00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,870
recommend that you find it and get

00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:53,180
involved there I can't tell you how

00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:54,530
beneficial a local user group can be for

00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:56,030
building your network helping you learn

00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:58,670
about new things I mean it's basically

00:35:56,030 --> 00:36:00,440
free education every month ok and the

00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:01,910
best way to learn something new is to

00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,490
have to give a talk on it at your local

00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:06,170
user group so find a user group get

00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:08,840
involved if there is not one in your

00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:10,640
area then you should start one and I

00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:12,920
would love to help you so give me a

00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,349
contact me on Twitter or drop me an

00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,059
email

00:36:13,349 --> 00:36:16,970
and I would love to get help you get the

00:36:15,059 --> 00:36:19,680
resources you need to get that started

00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:23,609
my slides are available on joined in as

00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:26,339
well as here tree line design com /

00:36:23,609 --> 00:36:28,799
slides and don't forget about asking me

00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:31,019
about the magazine and last but not

00:36:28,799 --> 00:36:33,839
least I would love feedback on this talk

00:36:31,019 --> 00:36:36,839
I basically rewrote it about an hour

00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:38,640
before this talk so I would love some

00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:40,019
feedback and how do you think it went so

00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,569
that I can improve it for next time you

00:36:40,019 --> 00:36:44,940
can send me feedback through joined in

00:36:41,569 --> 00:36:47,160
805 9 or you can just click on PHP UK

00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:49,440
which I believe is the top right now and

00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:52,140
find the talk that way as well you're

00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,160
also welcome to email me I have multiple

00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,269
email addresses so if you get my

00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,579
business card it has a different email

00:36:54,269 --> 00:36:58,799
address but they both still work so Beth

00:36:56,579 --> 00:37:00,390
at blue parabola com or Beth at

00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:04,789
Musketeers dat me is what it says on my

00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:04,789
business cards alright any questions

00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,900
and first some of that stuff so they're

00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:19,270
making the buttons look like they should

00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:21,190
do what they actually do would you

00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:23,470
really say that's a developer task or

00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:25,690
more less than two designers and we

00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:28,270
can't really affect that it depends on

00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:29,830
the company you're working for in larger

00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:31,030
companies you might be so far removed

00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,530
from the design team that you don't

00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:34,480
really have control over a lot of this

00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:36,670
stuff but that doesn't mean you can't

00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:40,270
make comments to them and pass along

00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:42,220
feedback as well it depends in what I do

00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:43,660
is a freelance consultant a lot of times

00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:46,510
i'm doing the front end and the back end

00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:49,240
or they send they give me a design and I

00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:50,800
code it up so I can have a lot of input

00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:52,300
at that point they don't always listen

00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,400
to me but I can at least give them my

00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:56,140
input so even though you may not have a

00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:00,480
lot of control over these things and

00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:00,480
just knowing about them can help as well

00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:13,180
run run do you have cheap practices for

00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:17,200
testing because sometimes just to create

00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:20,140
personas and to and how much testing do

00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:23,680
you need you can't really measure it and

00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:25,240
you you overshoot them yeah persona

00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,160
testing can be very expensive especially

00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,900
if you reward your customers some way

00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:31,390
give them something or pay people to

00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:33,340
come in if you can I don't recommend

00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:35,200
paying people to come in because then

00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:36,670
you're going to get all sorts of strange

00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,470
people coming in just to get the money

00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:40,450
but if you can offer them some sort of

00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:41,380
in company benefit then you know you're

00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:44,560
getting your customers who are

00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:45,790
interested in your product but usability

00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,980
testing can be quite expensive

00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:49,510
especially and time consuming if you're

00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:51,280
sitting down with 200 people and you

00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:53,890
have to do it one at a time that takes a

00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,080
long time so another thing you can do is

00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:57,310
just simply you know put it up on

00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,780
Twitter and say hey what do you guys

00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:00,640
think I guarantee you if there's

00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:02,470
something wrong you'll hear about it you

00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,780
know so ask people for feedback even

00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:06,130
generically as well you can do that so

00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:09,100
if you can't afford to do the regular

00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:10,570
testing so it's just somehow get outside

00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,740
of your company so many people are just

00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:13,690
like well I sent it to this department

00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:14,980
or i sent it to that department but that

00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:16,420
department already knows what you're

00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,710
doing with the website they already know

00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,810
what you're trying to do they know how

00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:21,250
to fill things out correctly they might

00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:24,339
come up with something if it's really

00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:26,109
obvious but you really want to get out

00:39:24,339 --> 00:39:29,229
out of your company and to get people

00:39:26,109 --> 00:39:30,249
outside hmm can I just can I just set

00:39:29,229 --> 00:39:32,200
foot up on that could you give us some

00:39:30,249 --> 00:39:34,119
examples of some real times when you did

00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,559
user testing as a web sites and how you

00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:38,049
got the people involved because I think

00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:39,549
that's quite hard how I got like the

00:39:38,049 --> 00:39:44,289
actual people who came in and did the

00:39:39,549 --> 00:39:46,660
testing or sure so there is a website

00:39:44,289 --> 00:39:48,009
for a small nonprofit in the town where

00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:49,690
I live and they hired me to work with

00:39:48,009 --> 00:39:52,809
them on their website so what we did is

00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:54,160
the nonprofit served families of people

00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:56,469
who come with sick children to the

00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:59,319
hospital and so they help find those

00:39:56,469 --> 00:40:00,789
families housing in town so that they

00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:02,289
don't have to pay for hotels a lot of

00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:03,789
them have to be there for a month or so

00:40:02,289 --> 00:40:05,069
and it gets very very expensive when

00:40:03,789 --> 00:40:08,200
you're already paying so much for the

00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:11,049
hospital care and so what we did is we

00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:14,229
worked through the hospitals and we

00:40:11,049 --> 00:40:15,489
asked them you know hey could you show

00:40:14,229 --> 00:40:17,019
this to them because obviously they

00:40:15,489 --> 00:40:18,489
can't give us the information of which

00:40:17,019 --> 00:40:21,130
families might be interested in knowing

00:40:18,489 --> 00:40:22,749
about this service or who might be our

00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:24,729
potential customers there's not really a

00:40:22,749 --> 00:40:27,849
good way to say hey do you have a sick

00:40:24,729 --> 00:40:30,849
kid like that's not cool right so yeah

00:40:27,849 --> 00:40:32,559
so what we did is we contacted the

00:40:30,849 --> 00:40:34,779
hospitals and just ask them if they

00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:36,969
could pass this along and we just gave

00:40:34,779 --> 00:40:39,099
them packets to hand out and asked them

00:40:36,969 --> 00:40:40,869
to give it to the families that they

00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:42,759
thought might be interested and asked

00:40:40,869 --> 00:40:44,619
them to do it at home or do it wherever

00:40:42,759 --> 00:40:46,450
they were staying and they would do the

00:40:44,619 --> 00:40:49,390
testing and then it would submit back to

00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:52,660
us now in that case we couldn't get the

00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:54,759
video recorded feedback but in that case

00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:56,829
they had a pretty vested interest in

00:40:54,759 --> 00:40:58,630
what we were doing in offering housing

00:40:56,829 --> 00:41:00,489
because it was a very benefit to a very

00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:02,259
good benefit to them as well and so we

00:41:00,489 --> 00:41:03,969
did get some very good feedback them

00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:07,029
just reporting back to us about what was

00:41:03,969 --> 00:41:08,710
hard or what was confusing so not

00:41:07,029 --> 00:41:11,859
necessarily an ideal situation that we

00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:14,859
couldn't video record them but it was an

00:41:11,859 --> 00:41:17,589
interesting way to do it other times you

00:41:14,859 --> 00:41:19,299
can go through agencies that have lists

00:41:17,589 --> 00:41:21,069
of people and you just say I want a list

00:41:19,299 --> 00:41:22,900
of this kind of person and they'll sell

00:41:21,069 --> 00:41:24,400
you a list and you say send them out a

00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:26,619
letter and say hey would you come in and

00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,359
test out this new thing and sometimes

00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:29,769
they'll come and sometimes they won't so

00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:32,469
that's another way that we've gotten

00:41:29,769 --> 00:41:36,749
people in as well so does that is that

00:41:32,469 --> 00:41:36,749
what your question was okay yeah

00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:43,029
I'm sorry if you had many cases where

00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:44,680
users have given feedback and it's

00:41:43,029 --> 00:41:45,700
turned our users what they've given

00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,740
feedback well they've said that

00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:50,609
something confused them or slow them

00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:53,500
down by the tests have proved otherwise

00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:55,029
when you say the test you mean like like

00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,859
unit tests are proving that it's faster

00:41:55,029 --> 00:41:58,839
or something you actually time though

00:41:56,859 --> 00:42:00,730
I'm thinking that I can't remember i

00:41:58,839 --> 00:42:03,039
read in a book where they've done a test

00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:05,619
on a form and one of the things they

00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:08,769
tried was making the button red for the

00:42:05,619 --> 00:42:10,299
clear form okay and a lot of users said

00:42:08,769 --> 00:42:11,950
they really liked that because it

00:42:10,299 --> 00:42:14,140
stopped them from accidentally clicking

00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:16,089
it okay but out of all their users

00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:18,069
people were stuck like peoples know

00:42:16,089 --> 00:42:20,799
people work making it even without the

00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:23,079
color oh I see and yet every user that

00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:25,569
logged into that form with the colored

00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:28,119
button actually loaded fill in the form

00:42:25,569 --> 00:42:31,420
because they were their eyes were drawn

00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:33,250
to the red button sure a lot of times

00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:36,250
the feedback users give you is not

00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:37,809
actually what's happening but what they

00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:39,609
tell you is almost more important than

00:42:37,809 --> 00:42:41,200
what's actually happening if it only

00:42:39,609 --> 00:42:43,029
takes some 30 seconds to fill out the

00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,950
form but they think it took a long time

00:42:43,029 --> 00:42:47,019
it doesn't matter how long it actually

00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:49,299
took if they think it takes a long time

00:42:47,019 --> 00:42:51,190
they're going to complain about it so in

00:42:49,299 --> 00:42:53,950
the case of feedback not matching what

00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:55,480
you're actually seeing I mean obviously

00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:57,279
you have to wait in the case of the red

00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:59,559
button if they weren't clicking on clear

00:42:57,279 --> 00:43:01,599
for many ways maybe it's not a problem

00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:03,700
that you really need to solve but if

00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,500
they all said they liked it then that's

00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:07,809
a positive thing about your website that

00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:09,250
they appreciate so it's not that hard to

00:43:07,809 --> 00:43:11,500
make the button red why not you know

00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:14,769
make them happy you know so you kind of

00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:16,750
way okay what is their experience that

00:43:14,769 --> 00:43:18,549
they're having versus what's really

00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:20,410
happening and oftentimes their

00:43:18,549 --> 00:43:21,730
experience is going to be more important

00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:23,650
than what's actually happening because

00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:25,539
if they think it's hard even if it's not

00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:31,150
if they think it's hard they're probably

00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:32,710
not going to use it question what's your

00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:35,410
opinion a bump in yet about the

00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:37,839
clicktale or some similar services and

00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:39,730
as far as like tracking where users go

00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:41,740
on your website and things like that I

00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:44,140
love seeing where users are going on my

00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:45,460
site I love pretty much any service that

00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:48,460
will track a user's path through the

00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:49,600
website as long as it's not getting too

00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,740
personal with my users

00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:53,380
because I don't want third parties

00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:55,470
getting too personal with my users but I

00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:58,630
think it's very interesting especially

00:43:55,470 --> 00:44:00,340
if it's one thing to know like Oh this

00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:02,350
user came in from google but it's

00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:04,330
another thing to know on my website they

00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:06,190
clicked here than they were here for 20

00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:07,390
seconds then they clicked on this page

00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:09,310
and they were there for a minute and

00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:11,200
sort of follow their path and to find

00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:13,660
out most importantly where were they

00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:15,790
when they left your website now is that

00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:17,650
a natural ending place like oh the

00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:18,910
confirmation screen for an order of

00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:21,520
course they left your site because they

00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:23,410
were done okay or did they leave your

00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:25,420
website when they got to the product

00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:27,340
display because they saw the price and

00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:28,780
said no way and left you know those are

00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:30,940
the kinds of things where are they

00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:32,170
coming in where are they going as they

00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:34,510
go through your website and where do

00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:37,840
they leave but having statistics to can

00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:39,250
be great in that if you have some page

00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,840
that you're spending hours and hours

00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:43,030
maintaining and then you find out no

00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,920
one's going to that page ever okay

00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:46,600
either you need to adjust the layout so

00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,830
that it's easier to find that page or

00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,360
you need to find out why your users

00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:50,980
aren't using that page that you guys are

00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:55,330
investing so much time and effort into

00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:57,700
so so I love those places but like I

00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:59,110
said there's privacy stuff too so kind

00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:02,340
of way that you don't want to be too

00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:05,500
intrusive into your users lives as well

00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:07,930
okay I would like to add the one thing I

00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:09,160
hate most with modern web site but

00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:13,270
captures what you just

00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:14,800
country-by-country reception lying or

00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:16,270
whatever time you want to sign up

00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,640
somewhere and there's a CAPTCHA and

00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:21,490
recapture recapture still I just can't

00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:23,530
read it I know this use of proper

00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:26,500
catcher at the library to actually

00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:27,760
generate something you can read yeah not

00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:30,670
only that but they've done studies

00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:32,470
showing that like machine code is

00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:35,020
actually better at figuring out CAPTCHA

00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:37,120
than the average user is and so I don't

00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:39,070
see the point in having it at all but

00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:44,920
that's just me but maybe that's because

00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:47,650
I find it really annoying to so do you

00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:49,600
consider a be testing a good method once

00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:51,730
you've actually decided a good design i

00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:54,400
do and i wish i had about an hour longer

00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:57,220
to cover all that during this talk yeah

00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,810
I I do find a be testing very positive

00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:00,910
it can be a lot more expensive as well

00:45:58,810 --> 00:46:03,520
though so it's not always an easy option

00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:05,260
for smaller companies but if you can

00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,970
Gordon TB testing is very great and the

00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:09,040
links that i sent have some great

00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:10,900
articles on a/b testing and like i said

00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:16,750
if i had another hour we'd go into that

00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:19,570
as well services google we used to have

00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:21,010
service on analytics that helped you so

00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:23,140
see if I you testing as well I think I

00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:25,660
think they still do all that interfere

00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:28,090
well but sure I believe they do as well

00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:30,100
with the analytics they do have the a/b

00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:31,690
testing and a lot of like email program

00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:33,310
like mail sending programs will offer a

00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:34,630
be testing for like your subject lines

00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:38,170
and your emails and things like that but

00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:40,660
true a/b testing with live users can be

00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:43,020
very beneficial but it gets you know

00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:45,280
you're using twice as many users then so

00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:49,270
okay how are we on time because I'm on

00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:51,490
the next panel are we on time okay good

00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:53,770
I was really worried with that I added

00:46:51,490 --> 00:46:56,370
like 20 new slides today that's really

00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:59,650
worried that I was going to run over

00:46:56,370 --> 00:47:02,800
I've got windows and sort of hope you

00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:04,420
get as far along in your processes just

00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,580
as a development team if you're going to

00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:10,750
eat good techniques for helping your own

00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:12,100
team sort of think in abstract or in an

00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:13,210
impartial way about your own design

00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:15,220
while you're actually doing it before

00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:17,530
you get to sort of user testing stage I

00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:18,820
find with developers the best way to

00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:20,830
point out the problems in their own

00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:25,830
design is to find some horrible website

00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:28,510
that does the same thing so for instance

00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:29,590
you know so what you do is find a

00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:31,030
website that does something similar

00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:32,500
because it's really easy to critique

00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:34,120
other websites it's very difficult for

00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:36,400
us to critique our own and I'm guilty of

00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:38,230
that as well I love my design I did it

00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,580
it's all mine it's wonderful nothing's

00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,960
wrong with it right but you look at

00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:43,300
somebody else's you're like that's

00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:46,360
terrible and then you could calmly point

00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:48,250
out Oh Sam over here you know so I I

00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:51,070
find sometimes bringing in the outer

00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:53,320
info influence or those outside sites

00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:54,850
just to get the discussion started can

00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:56,200
sometimes be a good way to sort of ease

00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:58,510
the tension and open up the door to

00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:02,040
talking about why is that bad and what

00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:02,040
can we do differently to make it better

00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:06,460
