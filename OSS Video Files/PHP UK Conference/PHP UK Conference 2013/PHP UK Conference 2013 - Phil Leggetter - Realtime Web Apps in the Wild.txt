Title: PHP UK Conference 2013 - Phil Leggetter - Realtime Web Apps in the Wild
Publication date: 2013-04-22
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2013
Description: 
	It's been possible to instantly push information from a web server to a web browser for at least 10 years, but this technology has finally gone mainstream thanks to technologies like WebSockets and solutions like SignalR, socket.io, Faye and Pusher. In this sessions I'll cover the past, present and future of client/server communication technology, the realtime web and provide a number of use cases and demonstrations of how the technology is actually used today (it's not just chat and spaceship games).

	00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:17,590
everybody and so straight away there's a

00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,670
second screen kind of app that goes

00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:20,800
along on this so if you go on mobile

00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:25,150
phone or your laptop you could have at

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:30,310
least a few of you do it so JDM p /p HP

00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:35,260
hi from UK I've got it open there as you

00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:39,550
see I'm not a designer so it's just a

00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:41,879
jquery mobile app okay so that the point

00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:44,140
of this talk is to really talk about

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:48,270
real the real time web kind of what is

00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:50,200
it the underlying technologies some

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,600
examples of how people have used this

00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:56,739
sort of Technology and you know the tech

00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,570
was that you guys can use and also some

00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:00,399
demos so that's the second screen out so

00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:05,199
we'll jump some other web pages for some

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:07,390
demos too so this is me you don't really

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,220
need to linger on that yeah so i'm phil

00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:11,229
liggett liggett on twitter I'm I would

00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,390
for pusher hopefully you've enjoyed the

00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:16,780
hack space upstairs so we co-sponsored

00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:18,280
that with Julia okay so i've done my

00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,360
introduction i'm going to ask you to use

00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,900
the second screen up to do your

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,030
introduction and then we'll talk about

00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,470
kind of real-time web what it is start

00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,970
thinking about real time you know what

00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:30,070
do you have real-time data already can

00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:33,159
you use it talk about the technology is

00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:36,760
what you can build demos questions so

00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:39,159
hopefully here i'm connected which is a

00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:45,549
green bar at the top if you go to your

00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:48,610
second screen up on them every day so I

00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:51,810
haven't done any validation on me up as

00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:55,329
well so like some invisible persons here

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:58,380
beer is always a good one toaster I got

00:01:55,329 --> 00:02:02,549
taste when I got married its traditional

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:04,540
okay Oh didn't like that the scrolling

00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,340
so hopefully you get the idea I mean

00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,920
you're pushing information form from one

00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:12,040
application to another which is pretty

00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:15,760
cool now don't try and do cross

00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,989
yeah okay so what does a real-time web

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,310
it's obviously quite an important

00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:20,700
question to answer so real-time web

00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:22,780
technologies have been around for over

00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,430
10 years I speak to a guy earlier I

00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,140
don't know he's here and he said he was

00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,239
using what I'd classes real-time

00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:30,189
technologies back in 1995 now I didn't

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,109
even know computers are around them let

00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:35,680
alone you know real-time web

00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:37,239
technologies but so originally financial

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,400
companies wanted to instantly deliver

00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:43,329
data from know some sort of source of

00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:46,180
information financial stats to a client

00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:47,769
now web browsers even back in two

00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,959
thousand was still a great client it's

00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:52,030
amazing that no matter what computer on

00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:54,159
you've got a web browser so to be able

00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:56,439
to instantly push information to web

00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,849
browsers was really cool and had a lot

00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:59,169
of benefit and especially in finance

00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:00,669
where the data the sooner you get that

00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:02,379
data the more you can do with it the

00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:04,659
chances are to make some money so it's

00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:08,049
not surprised that finance was the focus

00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:10,450
of this but it's taken ten or more years

00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:12,400
for the term real-time web to go

00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,810
mainstream and initially marketing

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,159
people jumped on it and everything was

00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:17,290
real time and everything was real time

00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:19,680
web but fundamentally you know there are

00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:22,060
real technologies at using real-time web

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,979
was very up real time web apps are using

00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:27,519
real-time web technologies so what do we

00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:28,959
mean by that and so what we mean is back

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,690
in other than a few years ago Robert

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,540
Scoble was speaking about how something

00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:36,159
called friendfeed was potentially a

00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,690
Google killer or something similar and

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,639
we met there is that for the first time

00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:41,440
when you published information you could

00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:42,879
go to a search engine and instantly find

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,139
it now we could do that on our own

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,739
little apps where we got one database

00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:50,409
but we couldn't do a scale so you know

00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:52,359
we would post a message on even twitty

00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:53,799
nova semis we post a message and

00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:55,449
instantly someone could discover that

00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:57,010
information and the difference with that

00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:58,870
and Google was that Google take ages to

00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:01,209
spider pages once we publish a blog post

00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:03,760
and we'd be waiting for no days for that

00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:05,079
dated be found and discoverable so that

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,269
was the first thing and then the second

00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:10,180
thing is the ability to push information

00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:11,829
to people who are interested so that

00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,989
technologies around now we've seen it

00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:16,539
with accomplice everything in Twitter

00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:18,190
because they don't use on the client

00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:20,079
they use polling but they do have

00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,330
streams available to connect to and have

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,289
information push to you so there are two

00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,020
things really the instant

00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:26,580
discoverability of data

00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,050
and then the instant delivery of data to

00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,539
people that are interested in it and

00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:32,250
obviously you could abused it and try to

00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:34,289
focus on delivering it to people who

00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,150
want it so it's one of the obvious

00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:38,039
question all these things to say is it's

00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:41,190
not really real time you're pushing

00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:42,750
information over the web so it's not

00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,599
real time in the sense that i'm sitting

00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,250
on a car i apply my foot to a break I

00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:48,960
want the brakes to clamp down pretty

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,759
quickly so I don't crash into the car in

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,159
front of me now that needs to be really

00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:55,949
fast when we're talking about a real

00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:58,259
time on the web it doesn't need to be

00:04:55,949 --> 00:04:59,849
that fast I mean so pusher as a

00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:02,759
technology we deliver stuff in about 300

00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:05,550
milliseconds or less and that's fine if

00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:08,159
you're building applications you know

00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,300
standard web things even even in finance

00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:10,979
sometimes you know them two milliseconds

00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,340
can be enough to see a change in a price

00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:15,750
and execute a trade and the interesting

00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,159
thing about I was going to do silly

00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,409
thing like slap myself here but I'm not

00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:23,180
going to I'm not that good at talking

00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:25,650
yet so the other thing about this is

00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,750
within our apps we have a moment where

00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:30,479
data is generated so it could be we

00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:32,940
update our database a trigger fires or

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,500
we delete something or we create

00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,599
something now each of those things is an

00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,610
event within our application at the

00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:40,080
minute we probably just let that event

00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:41,400
happen it and you know update the

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,669
database and leave it but each of these

00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,650
is this opportunity to actually publish

00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:49,590
that information to people who are

00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:50,759
interested in receiving it so one of the

00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,960
things with the real-time web is some

00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,539
people are calling the evented web

00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,090
because things happen data generated we

00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:59,759
can deliver that to people so as long as

00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:03,539
the data that is received and it still

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:06,240
has value then that's fine so if I slap

00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:08,370
myself here went along through the next

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,599
five slides and then went out he'd be

00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,060
going that was weird when he slapped

00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:15,360
himself he's just shutting our three

00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:18,330
slides later that our doesn't relate to

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,219
the slap so when the data generated it

00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:23,240
needs to be delivered within a time so

00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:28,590
that it has context it has value still

00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:29,819
something sense yep few nods okay so the

00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:31,949
thing about one of the things about real

00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:33,270
time is to start thinking in that sense

00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:35,520
so obviously delivering information

00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:38,000
quickly results an opportunity in

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,740
finance the sooner people receive news

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,950
so sooner people receive bid and ask

00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:48,500
prices they can act on that and make

00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:51,620
lots of money also with with other types

00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,390
of data again the instant the sooner you

00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,060
receive it the more opportunity you have

00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:57,320
you know betting just to be kind of nosy

00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,120
and in the know and be able to tell

00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,250
everyone first you know if you get

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,740
information sooner than anyone else

00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,150
there's opportunity in that the next

00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,030
thing is pushed for the technology so

00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:09,770
you're delivering information to people

00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:11,540
are already interested in it so they've

00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,650
registered their interest they don't

00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,480
have to do anything to get that new

00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,710
information so on your you've got a

00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,150
mobile phone you've got a phone number

00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:20,360
you don't have to open up your text

00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:22,340
message application and keep pressing a

00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,930
button see we've got any texts or your

00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,710
phone call application keep pressing the

00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,660
button see if you've got an incoming

00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,820
phone calls you've got a number is

00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,410
identifies you information can be pushed

00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,120
to you which is like a you know I phone

00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:34,100
call or a text message so it's the same

00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,410
with the web people in to register their

00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,790
interest in something soon as new

00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:40,550
information is available that is of

00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,780
interest then push it to them and then

00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,820
the next thing is when it becomes more

00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:45,680
than just this push now we've all seen

00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,390
push notifications on mobile phones and

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,360
they're a really big thing at the minute

00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:51,650
but the purpose of those in some cases

00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,880
is to just kind of tell you something

00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:55,280
the interestings happen then that's fine

00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,140
but the real opportunity is to go

00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,820
something just happened go into the

00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,830
application and start interacting with

00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,479
application and then interacting with

00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,040
you know pieces of other pieces of

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,590
software that automate interaction or

00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,210
interacting with other users and that

00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:09,860
kind of creates this engaging experience

00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,150
within the application and that's the

00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,790
opportunity with this technology I think

00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:16,330
not just live content distribution but

00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:20,020
creating these interactive experiences

00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:22,160
so I think going back to the red slide

00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,750
you know within your applications I'm

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,280
sure that you do things where there's

00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,570
data and you don't do anything with it

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,550
you kind of just go okay that's some

00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:30,680
data update the database leave it but

00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,450
I'm sure you know users within the

00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,789
system that would be interested in

00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:38,150
receiving that instantly so please start

00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:39,560
thinking about you know the data that

00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,580
you have what you're doing within your

00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,560
application and whether you can think

00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,030
about distributing that and adding some

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,980
value to your apps with real-time web

00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:50,080
technologies so examples I've got is a

00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:54,740
quite old this

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:56,390
capture is if we think about going to

00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,040
google minute and we search for aliens

00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:00,200
we get historical list basically of

00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,270
stuff now Google indexing pretty quickly

00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,190
now so this will probably be a lot

00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:07,100
different to this if you search now and

00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:08,330
it'll be reasonably up to date but if I

00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,790
was going to say looking at the window

00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:12,320
is normally my talk here if we listen

00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:17,030
very carefully we can hear a hum of

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:19,310
spacecraft above the brewery then this

00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:20,540
information is completely update there

00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:22,430
will be information on the web on

00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:26,870
Twitter on Facebook people blogging

00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:28,970
videos images of stuff about aliens so

00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,950
really Google you know I've said I'm

00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,930
interested in aliens Google should be

00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:34,430
delivering new search results to me as

00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:37,730
soon as it's available there should be

00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:41,750
so many pictures there should be I know

00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:43,010
digital aliens invading my web page so

00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,660
that's the idea so it's I've registered

00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:46,450
my interest in something when new

00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,880
information is available push it to me

00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:54,170
anybody get that on the phone or they're

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:55,550
good okay so you know in order to do

00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,990
this what basic functionality do we need

00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:59,000
so you need to be able to connect to the

00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:01,070
source of information and I dearly hope

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,260
that connection open so the soon as the

00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:06,170
server has new information to it can be

00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:07,730
pushed to the interested user in this

00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:09,700
world to subscribe to something to

00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:12,110
identify what it is you're interested in

00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,670
so we use channels and a lot of other

00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:16,010
technologies use this idea of channels

00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:17,530
it's a channel or a topic or subject so

00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:20,240
what is it you're interested in and

00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:21,860
subscribe to that now I've got invents

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,290
in here because it's kind of a

00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,850
push-to-talk adapted so we provide this

00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,950
abstraction of events which works quite

00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,940
well with applications so if you were to

00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:31,880
use just something when you're

00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:33,830
subscribed to a channel and you didn't

00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,630
have the events even in the data you'd

00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:37,370
probably say what type of thing has

00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:41,060
happened and here's the data associated

00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:43,010
with it so you know again the simple

00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,900
thing is something created something's

00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:46,820
been updated something's been deleted

00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:49,190
maybe something's been read because

00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:52,310
somebody is on a page that other people

00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,870
want to know and then there's the data

00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:56,750
the data that's delivered with the event

00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:58,400
and the same with publishing so from

00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,380
your server or from other clients you

00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,390
publish something on a channel you say

00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,370
what type of

00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:05,770
has happened and you deliver the data so

00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:07,090
it's publish-subscribe so that's I mean

00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:11,620
there are different so I think I've

00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:13,480
probably gone yeah so we probably most

00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,860
of us know about pops up and it's what a

00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,930
lot of these real-time web applications

00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:20,010
use there are some frameworks out there

00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:22,810
that actually abstract above that and

00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:25,560
expose so you define your objects on the

00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:29,530
so and your server code and then the

00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,880
framework generates a JavaScript library

00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,530
or you know some JavaScript on the

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,170
client that lets you interact with these

00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:37,270
objects on the server from the client so

00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:40,120
it's pretty cool but it kind of it's a

00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:41,830
bit magical so it hides away maybe all

00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,810
the messaging that's going on and if

00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:46,180
you're building mobile apps you don't

00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:48,220
let it be send it too much data so you

00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:50,290
know these so to two technologies that

00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:52,380
use that cynical denote it's obviously

00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:54,580
an old librarian signal r which is a

00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:57,960
Microsoft backed open sourced on that

00:11:54,580 --> 00:12:00,850
library I think it's probably in asp.net

00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:02,770
4.5 or something now I'll let pub/sub

00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:05,320
because you can actually swap out the

00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:07,600
different technologies so if you decided

00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,800
to use pusher and you hated it you can

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,460
move it out and use another pop

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,960
subsystem if you decided to use soccer I

00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:15,370
oh and you went hang on a minute I'm

00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,870
having to deal with this big scaling

00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,490
issue at the minute and here's hosted

00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:21,930
service you could quite easily put push

00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:27,430
her in there or another hosted service

00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:29,470
so the tech huh modern for time okay so

00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:32,320
the guy that I spoke to earlier in 1995

00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:34,000
said they were using Java applets so an

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,890
applet embedded in a web page can make a

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,360
persistent connection to a server so new

00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,950
information can instantly be pushed to

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,110
that applet and then you could use

00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:44,320
something called live Connect which is

00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:47,500
the ability for a plug-in to communicate

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,390
with the web page to push information so

00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,770
in 2001 our frequently called coupling

00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,780
systems and that what we that's what

00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,550
we're using and interestingly enough I

00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:56,170
didn't know about polling until years

00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:58,000
later so the polling is the thing we

00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:59,410
probably do now right we pull the server

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,060
is there any new information for me

00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:02,980
isn't there any new information for me

00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:04,240
it's a lot of wasted requests and it's

00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:06,190
using up a lot of resource and it's

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,380
sending a lot of HTTP header information

00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:11,500
and responding with HTTP stuff is just

00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:13,649
wasteful and it's not real time there's

00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,730
a delay between

00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:18,699
information being generated and it being

00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:21,339
delivered so if real-time matters you

00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:22,930
know even tens no less than 10 seconds

00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:25,360
then you know you're missing data that

00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:28,990
you should get so this umbrella term

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,910
came along eventually called comet which

00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:32,829
meant bi-directional simulated

00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:35,860
communication between a server and a

00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:37,480
client so there's two ways of doing this

00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,089
as long polling which is you create a

00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,829
connection you hold it open as soon as

00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:43,480
the server has new information it closes

00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:45,730
it since the data the Clayton and

00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,100
creates under the connection soon as

00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:49,959
there's new data closes the connection

00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,550
center so that's okay but there's still

00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:53,439
a bit of a delay between the polling

00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:55,149
requests you can loosen data and then

00:13:53,439 --> 00:13:58,259
there's streaming so streaming is

00:13:55,149 --> 00:14:01,029
connect and hold so the problem with

00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:02,350
these things is that in different

00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:05,410
browsers you have to implement in

00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:06,579
different ways and also HTTP wasn't you

00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:08,709
know but it's built to be request

00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:10,959
response and that's not we doing he kind

00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:13,779
of requesting he went for ages and

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,279
eventually you'll get a response and in

00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:16,839
different browsers you know you need to

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,100
hack around different things and

00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:20,410
eventually I mean in some browsers like

00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,939
this response buff it just grows up and

00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:25,019
you get a memory leak so you actually do

00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:27,670
need to reconnect after a while but now

00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:29,769
in html5 because people been doing these

00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:32,769
hacks and they've been listening they've

00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:34,290
said okay two ways are push only which

00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:36,189
is like a you know a uni-directional

00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:38,800
solution which is service an event

00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:40,120
something happens you've got persistent

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,439
connections it's basically HTTP

00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:45,009
streaming which is the comet hack

00:14:41,439 --> 00:14:47,740
solution but with a protocol and defined

00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:49,329
specification so event source is the API

00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:51,490
service and events is like the

00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:55,360
technology and my favorite which is

00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:58,089
html5 WebSockets because it's a single

00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,129
connection tcp connection bi-directional

00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:02,679
full duplex so messages can zoom past

00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:05,110
each other and it's a lot less overhead

00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:06,459
you do like an HTTP connection it

00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:08,050
upgrades you've got the persistent

00:15:06,459 --> 00:15:09,939
connection and then you can send a low

00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:14,189
detector over and I've got to mention

00:15:09,939 --> 00:15:16,870
WebRTC which is really cool it's about

00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:20,559
peer-to-peer connections so people using

00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:22,449
with the focus really is voice and video

00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:23,920
so have a look at that if you're

00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:25,870
interested but the thing is we still

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,620
need these hacks so although web sockets

00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,760
are

00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,980
use it because we've got a protocol

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,350
Anthony for the pub sub stuff but we

00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:34,390
still need an hdb fall back because not

00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,980
all browsers pull web sockets and there

00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:37,900
aren't really good enough polyfills that

00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:40,240
you know hide that away so we need the

00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:42,790
comet hacks and but website kids are

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,660
definitely the way to go so the reason

00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,670
the web's look is great is because

00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:47,530
you're a protocol and they're an API the

00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:50,140
protocol has been well defined all the

00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:55,480
browsers implement it now I 10-5 ox

00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:58,600
Safari Chrome Opera Android native has

00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:01,860
tried to do it and broken it but even

00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:05,830
you know Safari on iOS chrome on Android

00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:08,800
5 ops Android operant I think mobile

00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:09,700
money go to oh I'll send my slides

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,840
around after which can go to the

00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:14,260
browser's bowl but it's pretty good Oh

00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:15,700
even blackberry browser so yeah oh and

00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:18,130
also it supports this cross domain

00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,720
communication so i can connect from what

00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:22,990
for instance our services w rest stop

00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,310
pusher out calm but you can connect to

00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,900
our service from anywhere because we've

00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:27,850
said allow connections for anywhere so

00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:31,390
it supports cross the main communication

00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:35,380
out the box so for PHP what can you do

00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:36,520
now obviously work for pusher but i want

00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:38,800
to know about what's going on in

00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:41,350
landscape of no real time tech so

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,020
they're only two solutions i could find

00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:45,370
obviously and these are WebSocket server

00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:49,660
is it something called wrap check which

00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:54,940
seems reasonably well maintained sock it

00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:56,940
to me but the links there and wrench I

00:16:54,940 --> 00:17:03,190
don't know why they've gone with tools

00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:04,960
anybody no no anyway stock it yeah okay

00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:06,220
so there are two solutions if you just

00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,900
want to go PHP only maybe there's other

00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:10,450
solutions if you know about them please

00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:13,750
no tell me either shower now or get me

00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:14,830
afterwards so the other solution if you

00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:17,020
going to be you know add real time

00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:18,520
functionality or PHP apps is I'm sure

00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,550
you do polling at the minute you need to

00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:23,200
deal with these requests but you know

00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:25,390
you need to have a separate real-time

00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,550
infrastructure so socket i/o is the

00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:29,440
first thing people tend to go to maybe

00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:31,090
you don't know right note there's also

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,610
some good technologies like Faye which

00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:36,190
is Ruby unload signal are which is the

00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:38,020
Microsoft supported solution SOT GS

00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:39,460
which basically provides a web socket

00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:41,770
interface

00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:43,419
abstract away rather it via JavaScript

00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:45,640
library and has loads of different

00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:47,110
back-end solutions and there's more so

00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,260
I've got a list on my site about all the

00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:52,000
other technologies and obviously can use

00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,490
it by her a hosted service like pusher

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,330
now my slides and the second screen

00:17:54,490 --> 00:18:00,940
experience I've got a shared hosted site

00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:02,919
with a friend I had a that started a

00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:06,100
company back in 2001 and I'm using that

00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:07,870
to host and publish information so you

00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:10,299
know you offload if user hosted service

00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:11,380
you offload all this publishing so you

00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:13,149
send them out you want a trigger a

00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:15,340
message to a million people you make one

00:18:13,149 --> 00:18:17,049
request to the hosted service and they

00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,820
distribute it to everyone else so that's

00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:21,250
one of the great benefits of this they

00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,840
also deal with scaling and so on there

00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:24,279
are other services available obviously

00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:29,320
and again there a link to from my sight

00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:34,450
so examples so this is our code for

00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:35,799
doing it but the the other libraries and

00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:37,029
things will do a very similar thing so

00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:39,490
are when we create a new push your

00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:42,940
object we identify the output connecting

00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:45,159
to we say encrypted true is optional but

00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:46,510
if you'd building from mobile and you're

00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:47,770
using WebSockets you need to use an

00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:49,570
encrypted connection because think

00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:51,039
people companies like Oh to have

00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:53,590
transparent proxies and you can't make

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:55,450
that connection so i recommend encrypted

00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:58,029
to i get told off on my work for that

00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:59,080
but you definitely did use that and then

00:18:58,029 --> 00:19:00,340
you subscribe to the thing you're

00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,320
interested in in this case it's my

00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:04,120
presentation what's going on here and

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,890
you bind to the introduction event so

00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,779
this is actually the code that executed

00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:09,760
when you sent those messages through it

00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:12,309
was connected I'd subscribe to the

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,740
channel you'd sent an AJAX request down

00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:15,940
to my server and I just push that to

00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,440
push here and distribute it to my app

00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:20,350
and I think you guys will probably also

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,340
got log messages as well so this

00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:23,710
function was called on the event

00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:27,730
occurred and then I added an element to

00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:28,870
an unordered list so really simple so if

00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:32,020
you look at the second scroll yeah these

00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:34,110
flashy terrible 3d glasses that means

00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:38,590
there's a second screen app experience

00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:39,669
so again I'm not designer so here I've

00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,799
got like a little service that's

00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:44,010
listening to subscriptions and I can

00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:46,659
subscribe to something like now playing

00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:48,610
and then I'm connecting to the Twitter

00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:50,649
streaming API and it send me any now

00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,630
playing information and also sending it

00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:53,430
to your phone

00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:56,310
terrible user experience on the phone

00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:57,750
you know generally in terms of reading

00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:00,600
tweets you don't want to read tweets

00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:01,860
like that and there's no point also send

00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,900
a lot of information your phone's up to

00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:07,260
process it's draining the battery so

00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,910
don't do that but it's cool huh well

00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:13,740
it's kind of subscribe to I'll leave our

00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:16,650
live on okay so where do you trigger

00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:17,910
information which is an interesting

00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,470
thing to think about now if you're not

00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:21,240
using the hosted service like pusher and

00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:23,040
you've got your own server then all

00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,930
messages tend to go through you anyway

00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,070
so it means you are the authority you

00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,720
have an opportunity to inspect these

00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:30,540
messages before distributing them to

00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,910
other people so that's cool that's the

00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:34,980
main thing to think about if the message

00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:36,330
is important and you don't maybe

00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,520
somebody's generated and you want to

00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:40,260
check the contents of it you have to be

00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,240
the authority your application has to be

00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,830
the authority so send it via your server

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,050
again as I said if you've got your own

00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:47,790
word WebSocket service that's cool or

00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:50,520
own real time web service that's called

00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:53,250
but if you send it via am a service such

00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:55,890
as pusher or other hosted services then

00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:58,770
don't allow client by publishing on a

00:20:55,890 --> 00:21:00,660
channel if you don't trust the user

00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:02,160
because they can you know I can open up

00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:04,290
my JavaScript part I'm not an idiot but

00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:09,870
now I can open up my JavaScript console

00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:12,120
I can't I go to my downloads you know

00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:15,600
and i can type code so you don't want

00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:18,960
people doing that so i'll read call you

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:21,210
later okay so that is the main main

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,350
things to think about I won't show you

00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:24,810
the pushy code so basically you know you

00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:26,400
you push information to the service

00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:28,800
different libraries of different ways of

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,650
doing things so triggering code from the

00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:43,100
client and so I can trigger hello world

00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:43,100
I can trigger hello.php k 13 I can also

00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:53,570
she jump now donphan either disappeared

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:58,040
them so I bet it's got a bet it's got an

00:21:53,570 --> 00:22:00,020
advert the start okay so you know I in

00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:02,900
here because the app that you've got

00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:08,360
open doesn't just let you know just as

00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:17,060
HTML I can do script up a document dot

00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:20,750
location.href 0 equals that I can notice

00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:25,220
any gone I like those and I can trigger

00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:26,600
that so so basically you know if I wish

00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:33,310
would get the wilderness just rick roll

00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:38,480
everybody in the world okay oh stop that

00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:43,460
was the window just rickrolled myself a

00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:47,320
saline something okay it's got a new

00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:50,180
song out in 2010 it's quicker sorry

00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,860
right okay so that's and so we have some

00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:53,000
we have something called private

00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:55,220
channels which means that when you

00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,800
subscribe to a channel there's a call

00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:59,000
back to your server to say the person is

00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,190
trying to subscribe to this do you want

00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,330
them to do it and you can go right but

00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:04,400
you've got a session for this user

00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:07,160
anyway you can go this guy yet I'm gonna

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,050
let them in this person doesn't have

00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:12,410
permission to access this no I'm going

00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:16,520
to 30 for a one them so i'm going to

00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:17,780
know i'm going to say no so think about

00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:24,380
that so how's the technology being used

00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:28,010
hammered in for time ok ok so real-time

00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:29,660
data so it's just data so you can

00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:32,300
distribute information instantly to you

00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:34,280
know other services or applications and

00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,900
that's just ate and it maybe not maybe

00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,940
doesn't affect user it just affects the

00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,710
functionality of the app that's cool but

00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:42,080
I like it when you know can see things

00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:44,750
so financial data I've mentioned before

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,550
flicky flicky things sports betting

00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:48,590
analytics so where there's real time

00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:50,780
data available it's obviously a great

00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:52,910
uterus so as I said he used to work for

00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,990
chemical cutting systems they used to

00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:55,350
have something called web sheet when I

00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:58,440
first joined them

00:23:55,350 --> 00:24:02,190
and then something called Mongoose which

00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:03,809
was trying to win over the Reuters cobra

00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:07,049
installation so Roy discovered was a

00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:08,460
desktop fat client and we went ok let's

00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:13,440
create something called Mongoose because

00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:16,380
Hmong geese then I can at least fight

00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,669
cobras and I'm not going to say any more

00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:20,280
about that because I'll probably get

00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:22,260
sued but you get the idea here there's

00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:24,510
loads of flicky data there's

00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:26,850
visualizations in charts and there's

00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:28,799
like a watch list and stuff like that so

00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:30,720
you know it's it's data but it's

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,880
visualized Google Analytics I've got the

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,559
real time thing so you know you can

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,909
publish something and instantly see the

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:40,710
result of that I think being published

00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:45,000
which is quite cool ok this term some

00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:48,510
silly examples so there's this one which

00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,620
is the bieber fever meter so there again

00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:51,150
subscribe them to the twitter feed

00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:53,820
they're seeing how many times Justin

00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:55,470
Bieber's been mentioned they're not

00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:58,169
sending each tweet as it happens is not

00:24:55,470 --> 00:25:01,289
working just so you shaking heads is

00:24:58,169 --> 00:25:04,590
just don't like Bieber I don't know they

00:25:01,289 --> 00:25:07,650
work for an agency I think it's meant to

00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:08,640
be funny so they what they do is they

00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:10,380
receive the tricks on the server they

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,370
count it and every second they send it

00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,960
so they only want to be sending the data

00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:15,120
as you need it originally they were

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,440
sending like the whole tweet and all the

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,559
tweets and you have to do the counting

00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,970
on the client and although our web

00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,890
browsers are really awesome now on very

00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:25,380
powerful you know only send the

00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:28,470
information that's required to to the

00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:31,440
web browser because if it's a mobile

00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:33,630
again you know it's a battery as the

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,100
main main results from so the next one

00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:36,990
I'll know someone's are deep in in there

00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:39,570
are you already on it so what's

00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:43,340
happening ok cool so you know voting is

00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:43,340
an obvious example kannada JavaScript

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:49,140
it's a PHP conference are going to

00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:52,320
feature I'm obviously quicker than you

00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:53,580
anyway so you get the idea so that's a

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,070
really good use for it this votes the

00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:57,480
i/o which was created a trails rumble in

00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,860
the States it's like you know it does

00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,690
that real-time voting you can put in any

00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:03,720
questions and things

00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:05,580
and then you know his info on lights are

00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,320
a few I was not very good but it shows

00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:10,880
Scotland genndy which is I live in

00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:16,830
Scotland so I say that Gary a minute

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:18,150
okay so I want to close this ok so

00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:20,310
there's notification so I mentioned

00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:22,380
notifications before so you know that

00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:23,730
I'm trying to say use notifications to

00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,860
get users attention and bring them into

00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:31,830
your application and don't just think

00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:33,540
you know pop-ups has anyone so you know

00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,590
think sounds thinks thinks something

00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,270
else fun I think different user

00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:38,970
experiences don't always think I want a

00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:40,800
sender but all the cool growl

00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:42,480
notification think you know more than

00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,800
that I mean sometimes they're fine but

00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,720
but try and think how you can use

00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:48,570
notifications to get used as attention

00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:52,740
bring them into the application so I TV

00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:54,810
news use notifications and it's not the

00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:56,250
most exciting use of that and Twitter do

00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:57,750
a similar thing but the problem here is

00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:59,370
that if you push an information to the

00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,390
browser and you slide it down and

00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:02,070
especially here when someone's trying to

00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:03,570
read something the use of experience

00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:05,190
isn't really going where's my where's

00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:06,840
that gone that was just reading that so

00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:08,850
the only solution of the minutes to show

00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,800
one new update to new updates click on

00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:13,890
it you know information spins down so

00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,600
they did a redesign to make it live news

00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:17,370
and activity stream type thing and

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,110
they've seen a tenfold increase in

00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:21,330
traffic and that was or six months ago

00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:23,810
so they also use this sort of thing with

00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:26,550
sports I think I'll show that as well

00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:30,060
use a voice they've basically create

00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:32,010
their an email client I mean it is not

00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:34,140
particular you get the idea they've also

00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:35,970
got this thing called kudos so the

00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:38,280
support agent actually gets feedback

00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:39,480
from people to say hey thanks for that

00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:43,770
help you know instant graphic

00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:45,780
gratification of doing stuff so did

00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:47,100
anyone see the demo that they've been

00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,420
doing in other from the hack stuff

00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,990
anyone seen the twilio push it

00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:53,820
integration so everybody seen it or just

00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:56,010
a few okay well right so we'll jump to

00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:59,970
that so on that second screen app should

00:27:56,010 --> 00:28:01,440
be it's on Heroku same article because

00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:04,670
everyone got links to that on the second

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,670
screen thing yeah okay

00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:14,350
come on okay so truly officer wave you

00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:15,460
know ah now I've been done again please

00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:18,910
let redirect make is that we're in the

00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:20,530
demo completely yeah so Tori offers a

00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:21,970
way of registering a number people make

00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:24,070
a phone call or they sent a text message

00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:26,440
and then a web hook is made so an HTTP

00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:27,640
request is made from twilio to your own

00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,170
app and you can do with that what you

00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,330
want so obviously you can integrate that

00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:34,660
with real-time web technologies and have

00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:43,620
you know SMS is being received quickly

00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:43,620
phone it 02 03 3 2 2 147

00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:55,660
my phones are efficient oh it's not even

00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:57,370
me anyway so you get the idea so people

00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:59,050
are actually building call centers

00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:00,790
distribute call centers they don't need

00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:02,380
a central office space anymore they can

00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:05,200
use these sort of technologies to have

00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:09,040
do not need that building and have

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,270
people plate base all over the world in

00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:13,300
call centers which is probably what we

00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:15,190
getting loads of spammy calls so there's

00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,240
loads of other examples there so as I

00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:19,390
said I'll distribute the slides and you

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,950
can have a look at those activity

00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:22,360
streams is obvious you know Facebook

00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:24,280
Twitter they're all kind of just

00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:27,160
something news happened activity streams

00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:29,680
so it's a really good use my TV again to

00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:31,570
it using the football they england vs

00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,980
brazil they had the game on and they had

00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:34,270
that tivity that was going on and pushed

00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:38,410
through highlights you know because you

00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:40,390
can if you control that stuff you can

00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:42,160
you know you can push through adverts

00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:44,080
you can push through videos as long as

00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,820
your trusted source your publishing

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,950
information you have the ability to push

00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:50,470
anything to these users so they you know

00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:51,670
them but as i said the embed like videos

00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:53,920
of clips that have just happened the

00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:55,540
users just miss something maybe so the

00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,580
ability to go through the game that just

00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:59,890
happened and do stuff there's mobile as

00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:01,210
well so i'll say now so web sockets

00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:02,560
because they're a protocol actually

00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:04,450
means that people can develop what

00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,910
people have developed client libraries

00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:11,130
that aren't just browser javascript in

00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:15,010
those solutions so objective-c java.net

00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:16,420
ActionScript you know Ruby anything that

00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:17,680
can create a TCP connection can

00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,390
ultimately make a WebSocket connection

00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:22,090
so i think the WebSockets aren't just

00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:23,590
like this browser klein technology there

00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:25,870
are one possible way of real-time

00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:30,940
communication on the web so i think the

00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:31,930
really exciting chat now if you play

00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:34,480
with this technology you'll probably

00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:37,150
build a chat application so this is the

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,490
FT they have a chat solution we've all

00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:41,380
used skype with all use IRC we know

00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:44,820
which has and i'm not bother with this

00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:49,630
example because you'll just somehow

00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:51,370
inject script into my page so one of the

00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:53,230
things that people use with this sort of

00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:55,780
stuff is obviously presents so it's like

00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:58,210
who else is on line with me we do it by

00:30:55,780 --> 00:31:01,030
you subscribe to us a presence channel

00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:03,460
and then when someone else comes online

00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:05,080
we make a call back to your server

00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,299
you get to go is this person allowed to

00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:09,539
join oh they are here some additional

00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:12,070
information so it means that we can

00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:14,760
distribute our own events on these

00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:16,750
channels to the clients which our

00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:19,809
subscription succeed we will provide a

00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:21,100
list of current people online member

00:31:19,809 --> 00:31:23,110
added so when new people come online

00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,370
member and move them people disappear so

00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:27,220
it's an obvious thing to use when you do

00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:28,809
in like chat forums so and other

00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:35,799
solutions you know have this idea

00:31:28,809 --> 00:31:38,950
presence to Jesus ok so here's an

00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:42,940
example that I didn't do but it's quite

00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:45,159
funny and this is rich I worked so you

00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:48,100
know using a presence that isn't just

00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:49,720
fills online or you know that sort of

00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:51,640
stuff so again sorry it's not heroic it

00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:58,840
will take a little while to to spin up I

00:31:51,640 --> 00:32:06,940
should have gone through this before is

00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:08,529
anyone else on there yet mmm sir okay

00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:14,490
though it's like huge hosted service

00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:17,080
what's going on this one's fun as well

00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:19,539
anyway Troy layer maybe I'll tweet it

00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:21,130
later on and we can try it it's like no

00:32:19,539 --> 00:32:23,770
it's a visual representation of the

00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:25,210
presence it's it's a kitchen you go

00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:26,919
online at a little man appears and you

00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:28,779
can move them around the room anyway so

00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:30,549
unfortunately that didn't want a problem

00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:33,970
rich fauna that's why John to draw us

00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:35,080
now and collaboration our collaboration

00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:36,940
is really interesting because I think

00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,990
we've only started to see the beginning

00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,970
of that so everything google docs

00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:42,940
real-time collaboration in spreadsheets

00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:45,880
in that paint app in documents you know

00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:47,950
we used to send a word document around

00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,990
and then check it into god forbid

00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:51,909
sharepoint and then check out again and

00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:53,320
then you know it real-time collaboration

00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:55,840
on the same document can save a lot of

00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:57,880
time data synchronization between things

00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:00,399
you know it's an obvious use this and i

00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:03,130
actually live in dollar and clack

00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:05,590
manager in scotland and what for pusher

00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:07,450
who are a start-up in London and I could

00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:09,850
do that because we use skype use is a we

00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:11,409
use Google Docs so this telecommuting

00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:14,130
this sort of technology makes this a lot

00:33:11,409 --> 00:33:14,130
more possible

00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:18,090
okay there's an example I mean you get

00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:20,670
the idea you're collaborating together

00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:21,960
on a newsletter you're chatting I don't

00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:23,460
know MailChimp called it the peanut

00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,470
gallery and you've got synchronized to

00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,580
do list about what's going on so that

00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:28,260
saves them a lot of time they have like

00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,580
the CEO in there have a marketing guy in

00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:31,320
there they have the designer in there

00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:33,720
all collaborating at the same time

00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:36,210
rather than revisions now cloud nine is

00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:39,030
really cool so these guys use soccer I

00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:41,790
oh I think they're on openshift who I

00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:44,250
mentioned yesterday my little talk so

00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:47,190
it's a collaborative ide running in the

00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:48,900
browser so you go to see 9 30 you can

00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:50,280
have up to seven developers

00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:52,260
collaborating on the same code at the

00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,580
same time and the cool thing is as well

00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:55,890
seen you can see the chart you can

00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:57,690
actually launch the application and be

00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:59,730
collaborating and debugging at the same

00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:01,890
time with the other users with the other

00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:03,660
developers so really really cool stuff

00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:06,330
so I mean companies like you know github

00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:08,130
they will distribute automatic so what's

00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:11,010
my thing they will distribute it I bet

00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:12,330
they use this you know this sort of all

00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:14,640
time calibration so from this and more

00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:17,390
examples I think this one's America as

00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,390
well so if

00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:31,639
oh come on please there's anyone else

00:34:25,609 --> 00:34:34,299
get in this one either right imma leave

00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:37,819
it on the background will go back to it

00:34:34,299 --> 00:34:39,740
so cheddar a to-do list murali which is

00:34:37,819 --> 00:34:43,879
like this collaborative workspace and

00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:45,500
they're on as your five minutes combine

00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:46,940
or eise but so you know this idea of

00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,879
these boards we can't distribute

00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:50,990
workings pretty cool games now people

00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:54,589
always going to build games of this tech

00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:57,170
as well now if you're going to build you

00:34:54,589 --> 00:34:59,900
know like WebGL you can build a 3d world

00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:01,849
that runs in the browser but I don't

00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:04,160
know whether this technology is good

00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:07,910
enough yet to allow us to really build

00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:10,190
these you know truly multiplayer instant

00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:14,539
games now any really need you to view we

00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:16,130
need something like web RTC so things

00:35:14,539 --> 00:35:17,510
like this which is scrabble you know

00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:20,119
it's not scrub or not I'd say that it's

00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:21,619
word squared you can snipe in and

00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:22,549
quickly win points so gaming is

00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:25,039
obviously really good used to this

00:35:22,549 --> 00:35:26,450
that's a massive map people all playing

00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:30,619
which is quite cool to see these tiles

00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:37,069
of dating I said this is working I know

00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:39,279
it's not working that's some so it is

00:35:37,069 --> 00:35:39,279
working

00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:45,059
that was it okay so I mean you know as I

00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,500
said I'll distribute the slide so this

00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:49,890
is called you're a ghost you absorb

00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:53,460
power from other people so that's pretty

00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:55,530
cool okay I'll not show this one so

00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:57,450
there's another one where it's basically

00:35:55,530 --> 00:36:00,119
pong and for each person that dolls in a

00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:03,329
paddle appears and you can move the

00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:06,150
paddle up and down with four and six and

00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:09,510
you know winning team so there's a video

00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:10,619
of that and in the slides and second

00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:14,160
screen the second screen is really

00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:15,540
interesting Zeebox are probably the best

00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,490
example of that of the minute but they

00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:19,319
focus really on linear television so by

00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:21,180
that I mean programs that appear you

00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:23,190
know in the standard order on TV now

00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:27,059
second screen apps work quite well with

00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:28,799
this which is an event and big events in

00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:30,359
the real world where lots of people are

00:36:28,799 --> 00:36:33,030
doing the same thing at the same time

00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:35,339
but I don't actually have a TV aerial at

00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:36,839
home I stream on my content so I might

00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:39,119
watch some live stuff but it's probably

00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:40,950
an event that a lot of other people are

00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,809
watching but for all the other times i'm

00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:45,780
on netflix you know i'll catch up on

00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:49,530
demand and I player it won't be

00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:50,940
extenders so it's difficult to think of

00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:53,010
how these second screen experiences work

00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:56,460
with this on-demand TV so but definitely

00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:57,839
for events it's great for this second

00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:59,160
screen it might be that you start

00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,660
watching something you tell your friends

00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,040
about it and use this technology to

00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:04,049
instantly bring them in to watch at the

00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,700
same time as them but I haven't seen a

00:37:04,049 --> 00:37:08,760
good example that sort of stuff yet for

00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:13,290
advert I'm the Super Bowl is it was it

00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:15,720
Chevrolet or some somebody did a videos

00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:17,339
that they would like and be answering

00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,380
questions during the adverts they could

00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:20,819
win cars and this instant real-time

00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:25,049
feedback that they would they would

00:37:20,819 --> 00:37:26,280
submit a question they get texts a car

00:37:25,049 --> 00:37:28,440
registration number and if it appeared

00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:30,329
in the advert they won the car and they

00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,700
saw something like 21 million questions

00:37:30,329 --> 00:37:34,670
answered by creating this second screen

00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:38,309
experience to work with this live event

00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:40,260
so ignorant web sockets I think they're

00:37:38,309 --> 00:37:43,020
awesome as I said it isn't just browsers

00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:44,880
it's any kind the committee or anything

00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,650
that can make a TCP connection think

00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,720
about the user experience about

00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:51,119
delivering this data to people how

00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,920
should you display it

00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:56,880
and also the performance if you send in

00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:58,619
lots of data for the user who takes what

00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,940
250 milliseconds to register this

00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:02,789
information coming and there's no point

00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:05,130
in sending anything faster than that and

00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:08,759
also the performance on the client isn't

00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:09,900
still isn't as great as the server so i

00:38:08,759 --> 00:38:13,049
only send the data that's required

00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:14,819
especially on mobile also think about

00:38:13,049 --> 00:38:16,710
speedy and https to Speedy's away of

00:38:14,819 --> 00:38:18,150
pipelining multiple what would have been

00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:20,039
a t3 request through warm natural

00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:21,930
connection so most of our mobile

00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:24,749
browsers use this already so firefox and

00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:26,819
chrome and desktop so that basically it

00:38:24,749 --> 00:38:30,119
means that you're requesting images and

00:38:26,819 --> 00:38:32,910
CSS files and javascript files actually

00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:34,140
over anyone one connection so that

00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:36,150
stuff's really cool and you can actually

00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:37,380
have web sockets I don't have you can

00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:38,880
yet but soon you will be able to have

00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:41,279
web sockets over this connection as well

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,890
so it's really cool web hooks so an

00:38:41,279 --> 00:38:46,619
event occurs an HTTP request is made to

00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:49,190
a server it's real time web technologies

00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:51,480
they called web hooks for some reason

00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:52,829
and then the internet things now the

00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,779
Internet of Things is really cool it's

00:38:52,829 --> 00:38:56,400
you know it's where digital is bridging

00:38:54,779 --> 00:38:57,869
physical so we've seen some really good

00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:02,099
examples of that ready mate and ninja

00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:04,559
blocks no I won't show that so go to

00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:06,480
these things and have a look it's a bit

00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:07,589
no so we've got an Arduino client as

00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,759
well because I doing it can make a

00:39:07,589 --> 00:39:10,609
WebSocket connection so you can

00:39:08,759 --> 00:39:13,170
instantly be sending information to

00:39:10,609 --> 00:39:15,900
objects that control in this case like

00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:18,210
this blocky thing but in closing in

00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:20,400
Garry's door it could be a robot that's

00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:25,440
over in the ground and so we've seen

00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:28,380
people triggering t-shirt cannons using

00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,789
WebSockets now I don't think there's a

00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:31,259
use for that in the real world yet but

00:39:29,789 --> 00:39:33,150
it's fun and this is how we you know

00:39:31,259 --> 00:39:35,279
innovate and create things we do crazy

00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:38,660
stuff which is what you know one of the

00:39:35,279 --> 00:39:40,529
things that hacks all about so that's it

00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:42,779
the real time web it's not just this

00:39:40,529 --> 00:39:45,710
marketing term people are building real

00:39:42,779 --> 00:39:48,029
stuff with its adding proper value to

00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:49,170
two technologies to think about Twitter

00:39:48,029 --> 00:39:50,549
and Facebook they're basically real-time

00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:53,309
communication platforms and they're

00:39:50,549 --> 00:39:55,190
massive they got loads of money so that

00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:57,269
sounds good let's try and copy them and

00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:58,559
let's try and be better than them and

00:39:57,269 --> 00:40:01,029
build more interactive real time

00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:02,589
experiences

00:40:01,029 --> 00:40:04,089
yeah and it's about I feel it's about

00:40:02,589 --> 00:40:05,679
engagement about interacting with other

00:40:04,089 --> 00:40:07,299
people or about interacting with systems

00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:08,589
so try and think about how you can add

00:40:07,299 --> 00:40:11,409
this engagement to keep people in your

00:40:08,589 --> 00:40:12,699
app so there are you know technologies

00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,259
available to pitch people do that some

00:40:12,699 --> 00:40:16,449
people have done done long polling

00:40:14,259 --> 00:40:19,599
there's these WebSocket frameworks

00:40:16,449 --> 00:40:22,150
available I mean one of the reasons we

00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:23,709
want to be here is because you know you

00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:25,569
make one request to us we distribute we

00:40:23,709 --> 00:40:26,829
hold the connections open and there are

00:40:25,569 --> 00:40:28,029
other services available so if you're

00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:29,169
thinking I can't build this sort of

00:40:28,029 --> 00:40:31,150
stuff the technology is not available

00:40:29,169 --> 00:40:32,979
for each request that comes into a patch

00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:34,719
it uses loads of resource I need to

00:40:32,979 --> 00:40:36,309
scale really quickly and you don't have

00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:38,199
to use that sort of stuff you know you

00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:40,059
can use soccer a oh we can use a hosted

00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:43,029
service and so you can nail add this

00:40:40,059 --> 00:40:45,789
function lightly now and do you have

00:40:43,029 --> 00:40:47,140
this real-time date already so think

00:40:45,789 --> 00:40:49,630
about is the data that I could pinch

00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:53,679
tend to the Expos and and get some value

00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:57,699
from so that's it as I said forget these

00:40:53,679 --> 00:41:01,599
slides out idea what felt blah blah so

00:40:57,699 --> 00:41:04,809
any questions yeah do you need the mic

00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:12,069
yeah where is it here I'll just send it

00:41:04,809 --> 00:41:14,469
from sorry hey thank you great talk by

00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:18,909
the way thank you i just stumbled upon a

00:41:14,469 --> 00:41:21,299
cora message from like 2011 and where

00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:24,459
you'd responded to a question about

00:41:21,299 --> 00:41:26,049
pusher versus pub now but because they

00:41:24,459 --> 00:41:29,140
used long polling right i don't know if

00:41:26,049 --> 00:41:30,729
that's still the case yeah but and back

00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:34,119
then apparently people were saying that

00:41:30,729 --> 00:41:35,529
because websockets weren't you know as

00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:37,929
well supported that there might be

00:41:35,529 --> 00:41:40,539
issues with proxies and some antivirus

00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:43,359
programs my block them etc how's that

00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:44,859
changed in the last two years or so what

00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,509
are we looking at right now is one more

00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:48,369
compatible than the other if you're

00:41:46,509 --> 00:41:53,829
reaching like in terms of reaching more

00:41:48,369 --> 00:41:54,999
people that can use it so I think you

00:41:53,829 --> 00:41:57,219
should be using WebSockets if you use a

00:41:54,999 --> 00:42:00,849
secure connection the chances are you'll

00:41:57,219 --> 00:42:03,519
get through proxy firewall the the

00:42:00,849 --> 00:42:04,959
antivirus things are tricky one Avast to

00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:06,519
the the worst people for it because

00:42:04,959 --> 00:42:08,229
they're distributed on windows and they

00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:10,299
stop this although I think they might

00:42:08,229 --> 00:42:12,040
have fixed that but there will be people

00:42:10,299 --> 00:42:13,540
on the old stuff so

00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,010
I would still say websockets because

00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:18,010
it's a more efficient faster way of

00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:19,420
communicating but you need to have this

00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:21,190
fall back you know which is what i said

00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:22,810
earlier so we do have the HTTP fallback

00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:26,560
transport now which we didn't have then

00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:28,360
we went to flash and then two people in

00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,250
a flash installed and then there's a

00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:32,350
client access policy XML document needs

00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:34,390
to be requested in all sorts of pain so

00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:38,020
you know you do need all these solutions

00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:42,700
you need assembly done i see got your

00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:44,320
that phone so you do need I would

00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:47,670
definitely say go web sockets and then

00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,670
have to fall back you need the full-back

00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:54,580
anyone else anyone next door not here

00:42:52,570 --> 00:43:00,210
anyone else muscle comment any

00:42:54,580 --> 00:43:04,090
around you all have I write their way up

00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:06,250
have you cooked very good cool all right

00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:08,110
thank you very much as I'll get the

00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:12,420
slides out I'll be here as well you've

00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:12,420
any questions up front thank you cheers

00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,160
