Title: PHP UK Conference 2013 - Alvaro Videla - RabbitMQ Hands On
Publication date: 2013-04-29
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2013
Description: 
	In this talk we are going to see a short theoretical introduction to RabbitMQ and messaging in general to later dive into a live coding session to see how implement messaging into our applications. The live demo will go from starting the server and issuing basic administration commands up to creating several consumers and publishers. We will implement use cases ranging from a basic queue server to a publish subscribe system. The goal of the talk is two fold: to see how easy is to implement a solution around messaging and to understand that we don't need to be a "big player" in order to take advantage of RabbitMQ.
