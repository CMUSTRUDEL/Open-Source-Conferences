Title: PHP UK Conference 2013 - Michael Peacock - Refactoring to Symfony Components
Publication date: 2013-04-22
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2013
Description: 
	Refactoring code is an important aspect of maintenance and development, but when a large application needs to be extensively refactored, often a developers goto suggestion is to rewrite it. An alternative: The symfony2 components, and their friends; standalone implementations of a range of common website features, separated from the symfony2 framework. These components provide an excellent base for any framework or application. This talk will look at how these components can be used to refactor applications of any size, through real world examples picked up from refactoring a large high-content, high-traffic news website.
