Title: PHP UK Conference 2013 - Lorenzo Alberton - Monitoring at Scale: Intuitive Dashboard Design
Publication date: 2013-05-09
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2013
Description: 
	At a certain scale, millions of events happen every second, and all of them are important to evaluate the health of the system. If not handled correctly, such a volume of information can overwhelm both the infrastructure that needs to support them, and people who have to make a sense out of thousands of signals and make decisions upon them, fast. By understanding how our rational mind works, how people process information, we can present data so it's more evident and intuitive. This talk will explain how to collect useful metrics, and to create the perfect monitoring dashboard to organise and display them, letting our intuition operate automatically and quickly, and saving attention and mental effort to activities that demand it.
