Title: PHP UK Conference 2013 - Marcello Duarte - Pair Programming, TDD and Other Impractical Things
Publication date: 2013-04-22
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2013
Description: 
	"Why should we write our tests first? Isn't that going to slow my development?" "What? Assigning a single task to 2 developers? How is that efficient? What a waste of resources!" "Look, in the perfect world your advises are great, but I have a project to finish here." In this talk Marcello explores efficiency in contrast to effectiveness. He looks into how practices, traditionally accepted as efficient, sometimes turn out to be less effective than a few "impractical" things he has come across.

	00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:18,930
I'm very excited to talk about pet

00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,369
programming in TDD I don't get to do

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,619
that every day I'm lying

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:24,060
they asked me to talk about object

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:25,890
oriented programming I'm gonna talk

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,789
about TDD to ask me to talk about

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,260
project minute I'm gonna talk about

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:32,790
today I talked about this thing of us

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:34,890
every day I'm a coach so I get to you

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,630
know give you impractical things and go

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,360
away

00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:41,100
sorry I coach to go there and urge you

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,500
to do things and prompt you to do things

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,079
and then pledge it with the trouble so I

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,500
hope I'm going you know instigating you

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,969
the desire to do some of this stuff and

00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,489
you're gonna have problems you're on

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:56,160
your own now you can you can calm you

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:58,590
can you know send me an email or find me

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,449
on IRC oh I'm always glad to help some

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,190
of you who know me you'll see that I'm

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:04,530
glad to help you with this thing I'm not

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:09,510
just gonna drop the bowmen and go to

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:11,640
Korea so software is about people some

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,299
of this lies is gonna resonate with our

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,159
all-stock for some weird reason I have

00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:19,530
had some of the ideas that he is very

00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,780
much what I'm trying to say

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:25,049
I believe software is about people it's

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:28,170
more about you know less about zero and

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:31,020
once then it is x and y's chromosomes

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,970
female male is people working together

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,220
there's what I believe software is all

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,290
about why cuz it's people who use the

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,619
software the end it's people who is

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,880
going to develop it right you guys it's

00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:44,670
people who is gonna pay for it

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,610
hopefully it's people who is going to

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,470
sign it off so you need to get into the

00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,689
psychology of people when you do

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:55,790
software there's no way around it right

00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:58,320
so coding is hard but not as hard as

00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,509
collaborating all right this is the

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,700
trick if you figure out how to

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:04,439
collaborate with other people then you

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,180
get half of the job more than half of

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,770
the job done now at the scent of the job

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,599
done you should know how to talk to

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,310
people and if you know how to interact

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,620
with people you know you're gonna be a

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,780
good developer

00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,010
seriously of course you need to write

00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,950
code as well I need to learn how to

00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:22,060
write your code but but you do need you

00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:23,840
do need a there's a big deal here

00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,209
collaborating you need to learn how to

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:30,410
collaborate alright so the practical

00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:33,890
thing number one you have to listen to

00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:35,540
your customer vada okay so I'm going to

00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:38,090
suggest that you listen to your customer

00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:42,620
that's very impractical right it's

00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:43,730
impractical because people say the

00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,299
customers don't know what they want I'll

00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:49,459
argue about that but our customer

00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:52,630
changed their mind all the time you had

00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:55,599
that experience many of you sometimes

00:02:52,630 --> 00:03:02,079
customer are too busy to get involved

00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:04,099
yes or if I listen bank all of the new

00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:06,620
requirements start cracking from

00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:08,390
everywhere and there is this and there

00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:11,209
is that and there is that and there is

00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:17,359
that and as well customer wants

00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:20,480
everything right and I keep adding and

00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:22,609
removing most hats you know you have you

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,060
done that must have been you had to miss

00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:27,620
you must remove and some must have now

00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,510
is the most remove you have now I don't

00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,819
want it anymore it was a must-have last

00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:36,109
month what happened to it all of these

00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:38,840
things impractical impractical listen to

00:03:36,109 --> 00:03:41,480
the customers in practical right what I

00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,430
want is just write my code I wanna sit

00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,700
down and write I don't want to listen to

00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:49,700
customs I want to go to my desk and just

00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:52,190
write my code no but you can't

00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:54,709
unfortunately you have to listen to your

00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:56,630
customer otherwise you're gonna be going

00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:58,970
up the ladder and at the end is not

00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:01,819
going to find anything right you know

00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:03,980
that analogy if you say if you don't

00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:06,380
begin with the end in mind you can do

00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:08,540
very well the idea of efficiency right

00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:11,450
you can keep your boat very clean and

00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:14,750
then you you know you're not going to

00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:17,329
Brazil you go into Australia right but

00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,220
the boat is really clean so efficient

00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:21,680
everything is doing at code every day

00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,360
Wow at the beginning of the project you

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,240
have that feeling all the projects going

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,530
so well right you ask someone

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,440
starting a project how's the

00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:32,600
going at the price is going great right

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,360
you had that feeling and it is going

00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,430
great we writing code committing so many

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,410
lines every day while I was doing like

00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,810
paint commits each person every day is

00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:43,430
like going great and towards the end of

00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,949
the project how is the project going

00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:49,009
not so well we have some problems okay

00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:50,930
now the custom doesn't accept what we're

00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:52,069
doing they said is something else we

00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:53,960
didn't know that we had to add that

00:04:52,069 --> 00:04:55,810
thing and in South complicating we had

00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,940
to change everything that we did before

00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:00,710
right familiar with that and then

00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,970
suddenly you don't get elephants at the

00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:07,250
ends you get like an empty stuff right

00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:10,160
the thing is the customer does not want

00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:12,169
your code they don't they don't want

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,690
your code they don't want to they don't

00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:18,199
want the estimation they don't want your

00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:21,199
estimation they don't want your contract

00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:24,440
they don't want that in the end what

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:27,020
they want they want to value of the

00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,340
software right they will work working

00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,900
software that is actually delivering

00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,240
some value back to them that's what they

00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,190
want all of the cold other things that

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,560
you're doing you have to if you focus on

00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:38,960
the value then you get the customer

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,320
happy so you do need to listen to them

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:45,889
right because nobody wants a washing

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,750
machine this is do you remember from the

00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:50,150
morning washing machine I swear to God I

00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:53,300
had the slides before this morning sweat

00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:57,020
swear to God and to prove it to prove it

00:05:53,300 --> 00:06:00,139
I have to have the guy who actually said

00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,909
that that you know they could cut this

00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:02,840
you see that this is the guy who

00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:05,630
actually said that

00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:08,270
I gotta collect and I have I have the

00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:09,560
link here for the if you want to ask me

00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,419
afterwards where I get that from

00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,830
nobody wants a washing machine what you

00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:13,969
want to washing machine for you don't

00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,190
want a washing machine you want the

00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:18,110
clothes clean right say anything

00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:19,099
customer delay they don't want they

00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,930
don't want code they don't want

00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:26,780
estimation they want numbers to what

00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:28,250
value right simple idea so okay I have

00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:31,250
to listen I'm convinced that I have to

00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:34,550
listen how do we do that right to just

00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,089
listen all the time yes you listen all

00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,180
the time

00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:39,620
continuously but then feedback can get

00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,350
very

00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,120
oh you know I have idea of feedback

00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:46,310
noise you have to filter feedback right

00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,570
advice feedback and can get really loud

00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:49,760
so you have to learn how to filter

00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:53,090
feedback you have to create some stages

00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:56,360
on your project where you can accept

00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:57,440
feedback create the space for your

00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,720
customer to come in and give feedback

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,570
for him okay feedback is much better as

00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,800
a as a pool system as it is of a push

00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,990
system okay

00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,220
have you tried to convince your boss of

00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,900
something and you're very passionate

00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:11,690
about something and you go to him first

00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:14,240
time he says ah okay and in second time

00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:17,020
is like good idea think about it

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,260
third time is like can you stop already

00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,240
right

00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:22,430
push feedback doesn't work right so you

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,199
have to create a space where you can

00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:26,780
meet together and the other person is

00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:30,500
actually anxious and how do you call it

00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:32,090
really willing to get what you have to

00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,130
say right so you create a space for that

00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,270
secret to spread there on the project so

00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:37,010
the first thing you need to do will

00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:39,350
first start a project you need to get a

00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:42,800
project mission right when you start the

00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:44,660
Charter if you are traditional it had

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,430
the chart of the project that authorizes

00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:48,110
the project to start something so the

00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,280
beginning you have to get the clear what

00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,630
is the mission of a project and then you

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,150
have the Sprint planning Sprint vision

00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,500
sign-off so you have this place as it do

00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,910
in the middle of your project where you

00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,150
can get feedback from your customer

00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:02,030
right so say your beginning of your

00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:05,419
project you get the business goals you

00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:08,479
get the business goes right so do not do

00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:10,400
not run projects based on scope run

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,560
projects based on business goes okay

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,120
it's not it's not straightforward I've

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,220
been doing I've been trying to do that

00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,139
for five years now it's not straight

00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,699
fault but is the way to go I'm convinced

00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:21,949
now is the way to go okay so you already

00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:24,320
had to get is the business goals not the

00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:26,389
scope right where's your contract babe

00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:30,710
is your relationship to whoever building

00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:32,419
software to own business goals here's a

00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:35,750
link if you're interested in PAC mapping

00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:38,150
I'm gonna show you a one slide this is

00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:40,279
from Goa cottage right the idea of

00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:43,550
impact mapping is that you start with

00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:45,470
the reason what are the motivations of

00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:47,540
this projects okay why do you want to do

00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,070
this I want to do this because I need to

00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,839
be very compliant by the end of the

00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:55,870
February I want to do this because

00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:58,360
I need to get to 2,000 users otherwise

00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,889
I'll have to drop my project so get the

00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,839
motivation get the people who cares

00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:04,660
about something and they can decide

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,600
about it so that's the why and then who

00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:11,139
who are the people who can help me

00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:13,720
realize those goals how they can help me

00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:16,329
realize those goals and how you as a

00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,040
developer organization as a partner can

00:09:16,329 --> 00:09:19,570
help them so this is going to give you

00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,790
what this is what he is going to give

00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:23,470
you the features minimum minimum active

00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:26,040
features that you're after you're going

00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:28,389
to convert them into a product backlog

00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,399
I'm not gonna tell you how today because

00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:31,660
I don't have time for you convert them

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,130
into a product backlog and then you go

00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,949
into the sprint vision you break that

00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:39,040
into different sprints so you have your

00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:40,870
sprint vision for your sprints and

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,370
you're gonna you're gonna create

00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:44,320
acceptance criteria for those items

00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:46,029
that's gonna fall into your Sprint's and

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,639
you do that just before your sprint

00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:50,410
planning you get the stories you see

00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:51,850
that I'm slicing the top of the backlog

00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:53,260
everybody everybody familiar with a

00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:55,120
product backlog is somebody is not

00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,160
familiar with a product backlog here not

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,990
familiar okay so a product backlog is a

00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:02,139
list of things that you want to done

00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:04,240
list of things that features okay so you

00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:06,579
slice that on the top top priority once

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,230
the things that we really want more Andy

00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:09,790
and this thing's gonna fall into the

00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:11,709
next iteration that you're going to be

00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:13,959
developing stuff too and for those

00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:17,709
things they're like this is these are

00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:19,480
these are the items as a user should be

00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:22,180
able to log in so that I can use the

00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,760
rest of the site and then I will create

00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:26,589
conditions I will create conditions of

00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,350
acceptance I will create acceptance

00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:31,600
criteria for those for those stories

00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:33,730
right and the beauty the beauty of this

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,260
that this is like a conversation this is

00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:39,459
like the what do you mean by this right

00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,350
requirements are not so vague anymore

00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:43,569
you get in the communication right you

00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:45,010
clarify that and another thing you can

00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:46,269
do with this that you can actually

00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,829
because this is written in this

00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:50,560
particular format it's called gherkin

00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:53,050
gherkin language if you write their

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,670
second schedule in this format you

00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:56,709
cannot I cannot to make that with

00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:58,779
test-driven development okay you can

00:10:56,709 --> 00:11:00,910
automate the conversation you can

00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:03,040
automate a conversation that's that's

00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,689
that's crazy it's unbelievable it's

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,310
beautiful and then you have you're

00:11:04,689 --> 00:11:09,010
prepared to go to sprint planning

00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:10,660
you know what a customer mean you know

00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:12,730
what they wants you know the reason why

00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,170
they want C you know the reason because

00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:16,870
it's connected to the valleys the goals

00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:18,420
of the project and now you know what

00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:23,170
they mean by each of the user stories

00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:25,540
right so what if the customer isn't

00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:28,750
available you ask the customs you wanna

00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:30,880
count Jonah come and enjoy our spring

00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,350
planning as I said no I just want the

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,650
product and end at the one a washing

00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:36,940
machine right so you already do is that

00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:39,580
okay so do you have someone that can

00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:41,110
represent you said no I don't care I'm

00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,820
paying you the money you know your stuff

00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,890
okay let me sit with you for a couple

00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,540
hours and then during the spring plan

00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:48,760
you're gonna represent you just let me

00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:52,300
get from you what you want okay and you

00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:54,220
act as a proxy it's a proxy it has to be

00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,750
someone who understand what the customer

00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:59,650
won if the customer can't be available

00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:02,230
okay so get access to offer a proxy for

00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:05,800
your customer right and then you have

00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:08,260
this you have your product backlog slice

00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,700
have the top prior items and then you

00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,810
have what they have a sprint backlog

00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,880
this is the stuff that you're going to

00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:14,230
do next and that's what you're going to

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,930
focus on a going to create tasks for

00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:18,670
those things along okay then what you

00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:20,200
got you and you have listened to the

00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:22,000
customer and what you're gonna develop

00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,100
is going to come really close to your

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,070
customer one closer to a customer want

00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:29,070
okay there's no silver bullet here but

00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:31,510
it works much better okay so this is

00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:34,000
impractical thing number one so I wanna

00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:35,200
share with you alright so there are the

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,490
places where you can listen to your

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,680
customer make sure that you're signing

00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:40,960
off your features doing the iteration

00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:44,200
don't wait for this bridge to finish and

00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,850
start acceptance test after that do that

00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,490
in the same sprint so that you can get

00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:51,670
your information about how fast you're

00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:54,790
going right and then also do a

00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:57,220
retrospective and try to find out if you

00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:58,600
paces right try to find out that you

00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,459
actually go in the right direction if

00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,720
building the right products from from

00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:03,190
your customer as well so is another

00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,890
point where you have to listen from your

00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:08,500
customer okay so impractical thing

00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:09,880
number two that's real development I

00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,560
don't talk about anything else I only

00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,910
talk about testing development every day

00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,370
every night that's during development

00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:16,950
okay so this is impractical how can I

00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:20,100
test something that I have not

00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:21,600
down yet I don't know what I'm gonna do

00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,040
what in attest AHA gonna test its

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,410
impractical myself please give me

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:29,220
something practical he takes time to on

00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:30,990
TDD write an argument next time so I

00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,700
have a project to deliver I don't have

00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:35,700
time to learn about testing now I just

00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:37,590
have to deliver this project right the

00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:40,230
team is not confident it happens

00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:43,860
our not comfortable can do this let's

00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:48,140
just get with the work right or it's

00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:48,140
legacy code we have the perfect excuse

00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:58,530
our Sun Festival is the best of all that

00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,270
God class connects to the database

00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:06,150
everything extend from it

00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:09,090
I can't test it customer it's not paying

00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:11,880
for the tests right customers not paying

00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:14,730
for the test my management doesn't give

00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:17,960
me time to test right it's my manager my

00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:20,730
management folds sorry

00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:22,380
hey man doesn't give it's this poet

00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:24,500
right it's not my foot so my manager

00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:26,960
doesn't give insight to that I haven't

00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,830
have permission not to write tests

00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:33,660
because my manager doesn't give me

00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:37,950
Titleist in practical to the TDD so

00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:44,940
impractical right so this is the

00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:46,890
alternative like 1970 idea someone came

00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:49,050
with this brilliant idea another the

00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:51,520
only beautiful things came out on i-70 I

00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:53,560
was born in 1970

00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,529
and what if all was born and I just

00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:58,750
haven't seen the only beautiful things

00:14:55,529 --> 00:15:00,399
not so if you do that for nine months

00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,779
you get the requirements right to get

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,610
the requirements right and then you go

00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:04,600
to the analysis phase because you don't

00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:06,100
the requirement you have everything

00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,959
ready for the analysis phase you've got

00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:10,060
you hire the analysts and they all

00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:11,350
involved and do all of the use case

00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:13,360
diagrams and everything comes

00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:15,459
beautifully go to the designers and they

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,190
do all the entity relationship diagrams

00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:19,300
you everything is going fine and they

00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,529
find out that something's wrong with the

00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,149
requirements let's get the requiring

00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:23,620
people we're there are here anymore

00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:25,180
what is the nulls people that we all

00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,589
search paths patch them there's no way

00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:28,080
okay let's fake something let's do

00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:30,760
something let's do some analysis and

00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,500
then we cannot go back doesn't work and

00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,560
then we have to go forward design done

00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:37,450
okay now I get to code it's getting to

00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:41,140
nine months the baby is gonna be born oh

00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:45,399
my god it doesn't look like the father

00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:47,170
you know that's not what I expected this

00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:51,370
would be wrong with the baby it's too

00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:53,589
light baby's born is born you can't put

00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:56,680
it back it's morning

00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:58,959
too expensive right it costs a lot of

00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:02,410
money to go back now right feedback

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:07,360
delay feedback delay it's the most

00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:08,740
expensive thing is how long you wait to

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,510
fix something in software development

00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:12,550
that's where the cost is in software

00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:14,950
development all the cost in software

00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:16,899
development is in feedback delay right

00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:18,370
if you're not making money in software

00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:20,920
it's because you think you too much time

00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:22,390
to learn that's that's the reason the

00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,850
reason why you're not making money

00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:27,040
software you need some short feedback

00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,329
cycle right so that you know you're in

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:33,070
the wrong direction and you can store it

00:16:28,329 --> 00:16:36,100
as soon as possible right so bunch of

00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:40,600
guys come together 2001 this is a more

00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:42,700
recent idea on a suburbia of not New

00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,010
Delhi no joking the one in the ski

00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,730
resort in Utah these people they have

00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:48,190
money

00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:49,270
agile people they are making money with

00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,310
software can you believe that

00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:53,220
making money with software why because

00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:56,620
they have a very short feedback cycle

00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:58,660
very very sort you know all you had to

00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:01,480
do is get feedback as soon as possible

00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:04,209
right a little bit of test by little

00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,089
code do a little bit of refactoring 20

00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:07,400
minutes and you get

00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:10,610
feedback right and if you break

00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,289
something that you wrote before bang the

00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:14,439
test breaks it get feedback immediately

00:17:12,289 --> 00:17:18,230
right you're not gonna wait nine months

00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:20,059
right so what do you do when you're

00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:21,380
writing a test this is the test thinking

00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:23,209
this is what it's gonna make it very

00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,100
easy for you to write your test it's

00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:26,900
this test thinking okay I'm gonna sit

00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:30,080
down what's the first thing I'm gonna do

00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:31,580
then I write my test okay so what do I

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,740
do when I write a test first thing I

00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:35,450
will range I will create a set up

00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:37,760
I will instantiate the object that I'm

00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:41,029
that I'm gonna test and then I'm going

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:44,090
to call a method on it I'm gonna write

00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:44,539
the code I wish I had when you write in

00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:48,380
tests

00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:50,360
you are the selfish man you can write

00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,990
beautiful api's because the code doesn't

00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:55,370
exist yet you can pretend it's wonderful

00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:56,960
right you can call a method that doesn't

00:17:55,370 --> 00:18:00,529
exist so you call it very expressive

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,590
method very perfect perfect naming right

00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:04,370
and you end up with this beautiful API

00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:05,630
right because you're gonna implement

00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,980
what your test is telling you that

00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:08,659
you're going to it's like a promise you

00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:12,649
can't break you can break the heart of a

00:18:08,659 --> 00:18:15,289
test can't do that all right so you

00:18:12,649 --> 00:18:16,760
write a code you wish you had and then

00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:19,309
you write some assertion say does that

00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:21,470
work and of course it doesn't it gives

00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:23,000
you read no it doesn't doesn't exist so

00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:25,909
then you're gonna go and write the code

00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,010
to make it work but when you do that you

00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:30,289
commit every scene you can you don't

00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:32,960
care how beautiful your code look but

00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:36,529
you don't care you just write the code

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,659
to make your test pass right that is a

00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:40,520
fear management right if you have a big

00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,809
task in front of you you just have to

00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,850
write this little bit of code that's

00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:44,960
gonna make a test pass you don't have to

00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:46,760
worry about the whole system that you

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:51,020
have in front of you and you can evolve

00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:52,460
that gradually right and now the next

00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:54,890
step is make it right

00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,809
first you make it green then you go back

00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,620
and make your right give you some time

00:18:56,809 --> 00:19:00,350
to make it right

00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,890
so okay that's that's very theoretically

00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:03,110
is nice

00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:04,840
how do I know how to make you right is

00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:07,580
there some steps that can take sure days

00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:10,850
is the four four rules of simple design

00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:13,100
right first thing all your tests must

00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:15,140
run in pass I'm telling you I only talk

00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,059
about tests all the time all your tests

00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:18,980
must run inside and you cannot be

00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:20,990
factored if your tests are not right

00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:23,570
in passing right what's the definition

00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:26,960
of refactoring changing the structure

00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:28,010
without modifying what the behavior how

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,350
do you know you're not modifying the

00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:32,120
behavior because your test is running in

00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:35,000
passing so there is no refactoring

00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,530
without tests okay so make sure that all

00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,169
your tests is running and passing and

00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:43,250
then remove the plication duplication is

00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:44,630
the mother are always smells okay

00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,919
duplication is the mother all smells

00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:47,059
everything that comes after that is

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,660
because you didn't remove the

00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:49,429
application

00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:51,049
okay duplication is going to make the

00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:53,780
code difficult to read and it's going to

00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:55,850
make the code complex so remove the

00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:57,320
plication okay you're going to have you

00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:59,750
movable code if you duplicate if you

00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,040
copy/paste everywhere then after you

00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:03,590
remove duplicate make sure that I have

00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:06,140
very expressive names make sure that the

00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:08,090
class means something and ask asks you

00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:11,000
appear as someone who whispering with

00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:15,740
pairing with you because we are very

00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:20,299
real lousy self evaluators 80% of the

00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:23,059
everyone think they're good kissers that

00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:25,650
the best kissers now you need someone to

00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:29,770
try that out right

00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:34,830
but that's not bad programming right ha

00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:37,420
ha okay and then we move up our city

00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:39,790
after you remove a paucity you're gonna

00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:41,260
it maybe perhaps you're gonna extract

00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:43,720
some methods and you're going to extract

00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,920
some classes and in doing that you may

00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,410
make things a little bit more

00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:50,350
complicated so what you have to do make

00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:52,390
sure that you simplify again okay last

00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:54,670
step is go back and simplify if you have

00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:57,010
over complicated stuff so refactoring is

00:20:54,670 --> 00:21:00,850
to achieve simple design it's not to

00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:02,320
make things very complicated okay so if

00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:04,000
you do that this is why all your code

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,820
looks like if you're testing your code

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,590
your code is testable right cuz all

00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:11,350
tests are running in pass it's modular

00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:14,820
you have removed the coop AC it's in

00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:17,470
mobility has gone right and now you have

00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:23,320
expressiveness your code is expressive

00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:24,730
and your code is simple right and if you

00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:28,720
don't do that what happened if you don't

00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:31,330
write your test the opposite okay the

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,420
opposite you viscosity you know we

00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:37,480
discuss it is when it's really hard to

00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:40,810
do the right thing really hard right and

00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:43,120
then you can say it's legacy it's it's

00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:44,500
viscosity it's very hard to test when

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,590
it's really hard to do the right thing

00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:51,610
have viscosity immobility when you have

00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:52,810
this controller with 500 lines and then

00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,040
have this code in the middle that you

00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:57,370
need somewhere else in your in your

00:21:54,040 --> 00:22:00,220
class in your system but you kind of the

00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:02,290
only way you can reuse that is by

00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:04,960
copying your face and you just committed

00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:07,750
a horrible scene of coffee faces that's

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,250
the mobility you can't rigidity is when

00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:13,360
the prominence comes to you and say hey

00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:16,300
can I add this feature and you say sorry

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,670
game over game over

00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:22,120
that's rigidity and fragility is when

00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:23,320
you say yeah you can write in the back

00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,610
of your head you know something's gonna

00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,760
break over there and something's gonna

00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:30,640
break over there familiar with that

00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:33,190
that's fragility okay and unreadable

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,730
code I'm sure you all know what I really

00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:37,140
would

00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:40,450
you're writing peach before three years

00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:43,060
complex right you have complexity

00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:44,350
unnecessary complexity I love that

00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,730
because you're not writing your tests

00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:47,620
right and you have this code that you

00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:50,170
have to leave after the deadline passes

00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:52,360
right because you have to rush you have

00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:56,230
to write all of these and then okay we

00:22:52,360 --> 00:23:00,610
released now go and fix this right it's

00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:04,420
like that Tetris you game over

00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:05,520
you can't add anything anymore right the

00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:07,840
code is terrible

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:11,590
can we please have one sprint for

00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:15,270
refactor have you heard that this

00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:17,490
doesn't exist you cannot refactor

00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:19,450
something that is not covered with tests

00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:21,370
because it you going to modify the

00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:23,710
external behavior and you cannot test

00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:25,810
without refactoring is one step of

00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:28,420
test-driven development okay they'll

00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:30,700
like bread and butter

00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:33,070
refactoring you test they don't exist in

00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,120
separation okay there's no refactoring

00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,530
without that you're doing something else

00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,290
I'm not doing refactoring I'm not gonna

00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:43,210
say it that is not polite but you know

00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:44,830
you're not refactoring okay no

00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:48,280
refactoring Delta s no testing the

00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:52,810
refactoring writing this guy there's a

00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:54,970
paper from 1991 Jack w riffs okay

00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:59,400
talks about this paper is actually the

00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:59,400
origin of agile development this paper

00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:07,330
from one point he said you cannot

00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:11,110
separate code and design code is a

00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:13,810
design activity write it when it's a

00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:16,300
representation of design he says code is

00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:18,040
a representational design previously

00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:20,130
before this that there was a the v-model

00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:23,230
1987 for the Ministry of Defense of

00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:25,240
Germany some guys came this man who

00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:27,370
great idea okay or what the fall doesn't

00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,020
work we had to write a test first so to

00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:31,930
create a V model familiar with it we

00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:34,270
model yes and this guy came in 91 and

00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:38,110
say hey we hang on a second no no it's

00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:42,310
not test first test code and design is

00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:43,660
one activity it's one activity okay and

00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:45,520
all the movement all their giant

00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:47,049
movement Springs from it small talks

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,059
take on ideas from it

00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:51,190
and the design patterns comes in yeah

00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:53,590
this is an equilibrium clearing or

00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:55,749
forces design and code is an equilibrium

00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:58,090
forces and you have to have the test

00:24:55,749 --> 00:25:01,840
phase in it to make sure that the design

00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:03,999
will emerge okay so refactoring when you

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,789
hear the word refactoring it's the

00:25:03,999 --> 00:25:09,279
design phase you know joy projects right

00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:10,590
the design design phase what is the

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,549
design phase in agile project

00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:15,100
refactoring you don't have a design

00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:18,460
phase of nine months you have five

00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:21,519
minutes of design phase every hour right

00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:26,470
it's a part of it it's not a separate

00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:27,940
effort so agile without TDD it's like

00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:30,730
going to the cinema not eating popcorn

00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:32,379
it's like pointless why would you go to

00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:34,450
the cinema not eat popcorn is like

00:25:32,379 --> 00:25:36,190
doesn't make any sense or something

00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:38,259
similar there are similar practices a

00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:40,600
valid as well here now I don't want you

00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:42,039
to think this did it is the only way

00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,350
that's test-first development as what

00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:47,980
which is similar practice and there's

00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:50,409
also ginger cake I don't know if you

00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:52,570
heard about it there's some practice is

00:25:50,409 --> 00:25:54,850
that you can look into the similar

00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:56,799
similar you can get the similar result

00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:58,720
but it's very you have to write your

00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:01,239
test all these practice is that you have

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,590
to write a test for immediately after

00:26:01,239 --> 00:26:05,019
you have written your code and it's

00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:06,639
within that limits the short baby stack

00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:11,320
that you are you falling with okay

00:26:06,639 --> 00:26:14,739
otherwise cinema without popcorn in

00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:20,889
practical thing number three focus on

00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:24,129
quality not on schedule right there is

00:26:20,889 --> 00:26:26,590
no time for quality we rush we have a

00:26:24,129 --> 00:26:30,159
project to finish here the budget

00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:34,809
doesn't cover quality we haven't paid

00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:38,769
for that it's a very simple project we

00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:40,419
have done this a thousand times they

00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:42,369
resonate with this you know have you

00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:44,919
heard these things before college is

00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:49,799
vague but it's quality deadlines

00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:52,450
deadlines are real what is quality right

00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:54,669
let's do the need let's do the needful

00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:57,580
now this needs to be done right now I'll

00:26:54,669 --> 00:26:59,889
think about fixing afterwards we just

00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:00,790
have to release this now and then after

00:26:59,889 --> 00:27:02,680
the raft of the

00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:07,090
Deadline we're gonna fix this x-rite

00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:10,560
heard about it so focusing on quality in

00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:15,130
our schedule is impractical right

00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:22,270
quality is like onions when you open

00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:24,130
quality you cry no there are layers to

00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:28,330
call it to this alter quality and it's

00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:30,580
inequality right so what what do you

00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:33,460
usually see what we usually people worry

00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:35,440
about and demands is all technology

00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:37,210
that's what people usually thinking

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,620
they're paying for right and that's the

00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:40,750
thing that your customers gonna look for

00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:43,030
and the project manager sees you can say

00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:45,970
ok software works as expected

00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:48,640
it looks like expected it works like

00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:51,160
expected it's beautifully it's not

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,470
costing me a lot of money and it's focus

00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:55,330
on the goals of the project right this

00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:57,010
is this is what the people will see

00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:58,150
people who pays for the software and the

00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:01,530
project managers they'll see the auto

00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:04,150
quality what they would not see is this

00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:06,550
they will not see if the code is

00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:09,010
testable if it's expressive if it's

00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:10,930
modular and fits simple only if they

00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:12,820
like they have technical stakeholders

00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:14,800
looking at it but typically they're not

00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:17,350
these are not the things are gonna you

00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,730
know are gonna be detrimental at the

00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:20,700
deadlines the other things are gonna

00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:25,120
count in deadlines right you with me

00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:27,370
okay so what happens if you don't have

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,070
the outer ecology because this is the

00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:33,550
movies most visible ones right you got

00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:37,420
sting in it or you get into a place

00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:39,130
where you don't wanna be right right you

00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:41,710
get we have to do rework you have to do

00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:44,380
everything again you get bugs you're

00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:47,020
going over budgets that the people are

00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:49,870
like morale goes down the team goes like

00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:50,830
on no more bugs and you fix the bugs and

00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:52,810
they ask you how long it's gonna take

00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:53,500
you have no clue cuz there's no test you

00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:54,730
don't know if you're gonna break

00:28:53,500 --> 00:29:00,910
something else when you fix those bugs

00:28:54,730 --> 00:29:03,280
right missing deadlines project abortion

00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:04,660
we have to stop the project now it's not

00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,700
maintaining when it we can't pay for it

00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:10,030
anymore and you like the saddest person

00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:11,950
in Planet unusable system you build a

00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:13,520
system and they put it away they don't

00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:16,580
even use it

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:18,140
and relationships deteriorate I don't

00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,490
want to test anymore you know every time

00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:22,250
you bring this stuff for me to test

00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:26,390
I just find more and more bugs I don't

00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:27,740
trust you anymore go away right this is

00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:31,070
the lack of outer quality it's very

00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:33,020
visible right but what is it what causes

00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:37,159
poor quality what caused poor outer

00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:39,169
quality what are the causes of it lack

00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:41,360
of ultimate acceptance tests will cause

00:29:39,169 --> 00:29:43,120
a lack of poor quality because these

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,679
will test the things that you can see

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:48,529
lack of customer involvement we call it

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:51,620
because that team not focus on the

00:29:48,529 --> 00:29:57,020
project mission and lack of inner

00:29:51,620 --> 00:30:01,429
quality and that's forgotten that's

00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:02,990
forgotten right that bit is forgotten so

00:30:01,429 --> 00:30:06,770
what happened if you focus on schedule

00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:10,549
right this is from Edward Deming guru

00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:13,789
quality he says that you start from a

00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:16,010
place of fear fear of underachieving and

00:30:13,789 --> 00:30:18,200
as a good developer you're gonna say can

00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:20,750
you do any gonna say yes I can and

00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,220
developer goes like sure can you don't

00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,870
want to disappoint developers are like

00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,820
that they like challenges like it enough

00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:28,070
sure can do but you are fearful that

00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:29,929
you're not gonna achieve it and you're

00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:31,490
gonna haste in the process of haste in

00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:33,049
your development you're gonna hide stuff

00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:35,419
that you know is not working quite so

00:30:33,049 --> 00:30:38,090
well gonna I'm gonna think about this

00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:40,070
thing later on you're gonna hide stuff

00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:42,950
and you know you're gonna hide what's

00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:45,020
going on there right and eventually when

00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:47,330
you're going to release on time and on

00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:48,260
budget everything's gonna be fine but

00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:50,090
then you're gonna have to rework

00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:51,350
everything gonna have to do all fix all

00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:53,289
the bugs and stuff and the project's

00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:56,539
gonna go and go and go and go and go

00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:58,039
right and they're all low morale because

00:30:56,539 --> 00:30:59,690
you're always working fixing bugs

00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:02,029
they're like tired of this situation

00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:04,520
this project I just want a new job right

00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:06,320
such a terrible place to be fall into

00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:08,330
this cycle schedule schedule schedule

00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,649
schedule you just don't want to be that

00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:12,799
anymore please take me out of this

00:31:09,649 --> 00:31:15,169
picture right this is from work 1988

00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:18,679
it's so important to focus on on quality

00:31:15,169 --> 00:31:21,710
otherwise distract productivity but if

00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:23,990
you focus on quality you start instead

00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:25,010
of on lying trying a fear of

00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:27,440
underachievement

00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:30,320
you encourage to align with the go

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:33,110
right the team is one page with the

00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,610
customer let's do the right thing you

00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:36,470
have this mood in a team let's do the

00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:38,060
right thing let's write tests let's do a

00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:41,420
static analysis continuous integration

00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:43,100
and let's achieve which a little bit

00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:45,110
maybe maybe less than the other people

00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:46,460
in the beginning why because you're

00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:48,350
doing tests you didn't use intubation

00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,970
you're pepra grabbing and you're not

00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:51,740
used to these things you're doing your

00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:53,360
learning so you're going to achieve last

00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,980
but you're going to achieve whatever you

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,710
commit to achieve you can achieve those

00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:59,570
things but the beautiful is that these

00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:01,280
things work when you start adding more

00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:05,420
things you're not gonna be fixing bugs

00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:07,550
because that bit is working and the last

00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:09,860
bit here is that you're now proud of

00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:12,080
what you achieved and your motivation is

00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:15,800
growing and you're gonna go faster and

00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:17,450
you're gonna improve over time right so

00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:22,190
how do you ensure how do you ensure

00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:24,080
outer quality by example workshops by

00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:26,090
automating acceptance tests by having a

00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,380
Sprint vision statement and by having a

00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:29,510
sign-off principle so working in

00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:31,610
collaboration with your customer and how

00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:35,810
do you ensure inner quality there's no

00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:37,670
way around it guys you had right ass yes

00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:39,920
and you have to have some continuous

00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:41,330
integration going on test if you're

00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,830
doing a trial project that is but

00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:44,270
otherwise you can have nine months of

00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:46,820
design and thinking about everything

00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:48,620
very thoroughly they in agile there's no

00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:50,090
other way to do design if you're not

00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:51,770
doing this thing if you're not emerging

00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:53,300
the design with vests there's no other

00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:55,970
opportunity for you because there's just

00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:59,060
no time continuous integration test

00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:01,550
static analysis from day one and pepra

00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:05,420
gramming or at least peer review at

00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:08,960
least be reviewing okay in practical

00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:12,530
thing number four pair programming very

00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:15,110
impractical to resources want are just

00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:18,320
do the math man this is not efficiency

00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:19,820
at all now even I didn't do add into

00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,700
economics and I know that this is not

00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:26,000
efficient right it's crazy idea to

00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:28,790
people want to ask as obvious is wrong

00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,920
something wrong with it why isn't

00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:32,930
everyone else do if it's so good why

00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:36,650
isn't every one of the companies in the

00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:39,920
world doing pair programming one they

00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:41,210
will chat and not get anything done

00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,840
that's what's gonna happen for

00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:47,630
programming here this is dine office

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,950
right and then the guys say I do all the

00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:54,890
work and these guys just looking at the

00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:56,390
screen how do you take the time if you

00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:57,890
have two people working on the same task

00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:59,149
how do you take the time and show the

00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:00,679
customer that you know you're actually

00:33:59,149 --> 00:34:02,419
working on how you're going to show the

00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:04,220
customer that your resource is working

00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:05,690
on two people working on the same thing

00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:10,040
how you gonna show that to the customer

00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:11,770
in practical and Geeks don't like to

00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:15,609
work with other people

00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:17,690
this is impractical ideas in practical

00:34:15,609 --> 00:34:20,929
yeah they're like you know they're like

00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:27,040
going lurking a lure full of cans of Red

00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:29,510
Bulls so very simple idea to developers

00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,099
sharing a screen I'm not even saying the

00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:32,960
same workstation because I did pair

00:34:31,099 --> 00:34:35,179
programming with ever that we're not

00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,440
even in the same country that's

00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:38,210
different countries you can do pepper

00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,280
grab it just you sharing the workstation

00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:42,760
but Camille can be remotely as well so

00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:46,190
two developers sharing a screen and

00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:47,690
working on the same task okay that poor

00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:50,260
isn't here there are a lot of poor ISM

00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:53,510
if you if you to go on Google if you see

00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:54,859
if you google good bad programming

00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:57,050
there's a lot of people saying a lot

00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:58,339
there is a pilot does another data and

00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:59,869
you had to like these and I have to do

00:34:58,339 --> 00:35:03,790
like that it's a lot of science and

00:34:59,869 --> 00:35:06,740
pepper grabbing two people okay

00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:09,859
communication collaboration sharing the

00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:11,869
screen working on the same task okay s

00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:15,800
anxious to focus on the essentials you

00:35:11,869 --> 00:35:19,280
get that okay so what is pepper gramming

00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:21,369
about and Marco Marco sorry I had to

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,369
hatch had to see your picture that

00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:24,369
foreground

00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:33,780
ah is the ad buckling arguments no you

00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:37,300
know it's not about that it's about

00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:39,160
improvements right I'm so lucky I live

00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:41,260
in London I get to go to this workshop

00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:43,720
there's a guy called John jaha he is

00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:45,670
typically he he speaks about the

00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,320
deliberate practice and the Liberal

00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:48,790
Party is all about continuous

00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,260
improvements and I went to one of his

00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:51,820
stocks that way he explains the

00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:53,500
principle of improvements and some of

00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:55,540
the Sprint's was a soul related to fair

00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:57,280
programming that I can't I couldn't stop

00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:59,260
myself from at in his light here you

00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,120
know company you know the company is a

00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:02,440
very nice word it means company

00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:04,360
organization but also means having

00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:07,420
someone accompanying you so having

00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:11,080
someone else with you because we are

00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:13,540
very lousy self evaluators right the

00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:15,400
laws of statistics statistics that shows

00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:17,230
that people think they're better than

00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,330
what they are and then having someone

00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:21,580
with you really open your eyes for

00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:23,650
things having someone who can be give

00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:26,050
you honest feedback is really important

00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:28,120
all right that's company addiction

00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:31,000
addiction is a principle to say that you

00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:32,740
can't just get a new habit out of the

00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,530
blue you can't just become a TDD

00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:37,990
developer because it's the first January

00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:41,440
and you make a promise to yourself you

00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:43,240
can't do that you have to the principle

00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,640
of addiction is that you have to replace

00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,320
a habit with another one right so get

00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,940
into the habit get someone else to do

00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:52,390
that with you and you get into the habit

00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:54,250
as well okay feedback is not feedback if

00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:55,840
it doesn't feedback into the system

00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:58,050
right so you have someone to help you

00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:04,210
feed the things back into the system

00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:05,560
visibility is about its you know some of

00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:07,990
these principles are really connected to

00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:10,060
each other so you have you have feedback

00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:13,090
and and and visibility but it's like

00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:15,040
have you tried to put throw a ball

00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:17,410
bowling and haven't curtain in front of

00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,120
the pins it's kind of you know you don't

00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:21,400
know how many things you have its

00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,990
useless right you need to see you need

00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,450
to see what how are you doing right so

00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:27,220
visibility is important and you see how

00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:28,780
all those things is connecting to it

00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:30,970
pair programming and they're also

00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:33,160
connected to learning success a lot of

00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:34,600
people say we've got to fail it's very

00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:38,470
important to fail have you heard that

00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:39,910
culture of failure failure is good open

00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:41,590
your arms to failure know that without

00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:44,280
failure there's no learning have you

00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:47,530
heard that it's very popular today no

00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:52,420
failure is good let's fail but let's

00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:55,120
fill as soon as possible right the idea

00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:57,130
here is that failure is not good if it's

00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:59,470
not a campaign by an idea of success

00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:00,940
there was this boy who is found in

00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:02,740
Germany he was being raised by wolves

00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:06,430
apparently and he didn't know how to

00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:09,250
talk or walk because his idea of success

00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:11,020
was not walking like us or talking like

00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:12,520
us for him to survive he had to talk

00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:15,130
like the wolves and he had to behave

00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:17,050
like the works so he eventually he was

00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:19,510
found by scientists who kind of used him

00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:20,650
like a guinea pig and tried to make him

00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:23,110
walk and talk again

00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:25,480
eventually he they made him walk but

00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:27,420
they were not able to make him talk ever

00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,470
the boy never learned how to talk

00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:32,560
because he didn't have for him it was

00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:35,050
incest ice wasn't success to talk right

00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,580
he didn't have that so if you had bad

00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:38,230
programming if you have the chance to

00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:40,720
pay program someone who is like senior

00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:43,780
to you and he knows how to do today

00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:46,360
that's brilliant right if you can see

00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:47,950
success you can learn it right it's not

00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,190
enough for you to fail doing it all the

00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,780
time

00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:51,340
you need to have an idea of how it's

00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:54,490
done properly okay

00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:56,290
use me did I lose you success

00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:58,000
provocation provocation you have to try

00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:59,800
to something which is a bit harder than

00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,180
you I used to all the time if you can if

00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,390
you want to continues learning all the

00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:05,230
time

00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:08,020
ok soap a programming is about improving

00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:10,270
fast and I hope you want to do that I

00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:13,480
swear to God I hope that you want to

00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:15,370
improve right there is a lot of data now

00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:17,470
I'm not gonna give you statistics if you

00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:19,080
are interested in statistics this is the

00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:21,520
only agile

00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:24,370
practice that has been proved to be

00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:26,020
efficient and effective that there are

00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:28,990
numbers there so if you want to read go

00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:31,270
on the web and read about it ok super

00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:34,690
program be the past should be keep

00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:38,800
together what do you think ok ideally

00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:40,360
ideally it's recommended a yes you

00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,040
should try and stick with the pairs

00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,750
because otherwise is a lot of if you

00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:46,750
swap them within the project there's a

00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:48,010
lot of contact switching no me working

00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:49,180
with this guy today one part of the

00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:51,580
system then you have to contact switch

00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:53,500
with another guy so and what you

00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:54,430
is that you try and if you're doing

00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,530
something that's gonna change

00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:58,780
drastically the system you have to raise

00:39:56,530 --> 00:40:00,520
get up and tell the other guys hey guys

00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:01,930
we got to change here some design that

00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:04,030
is going to impact you as well and talk

00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,740
to the scene right but try to stick to

00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:07,420
the past

00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:10,780
ideally there's no rule here right use

00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:14,200
your brain and who to pair with who a

00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:14,860
bad idea is junior with junior that's a

00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:19,290
bad idea

00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:19,290
alright anything else is good okay

00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:27,330
important stuff to remember focus on the

00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:30,280
code focus on the code not not really on

00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:31,720
hey you forgot the the semicolon be

00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,220
patient with that okay if someone just

00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:35,080
forgets them let the guy write a little

00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:36,190
bit of code focus on what he's trying to

00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,110
achieve with the code that's what I'm

00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:39,130
trying to say here okay focus on while

00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:41,770
you're trying to achieve be a little

00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:44,340
patient and use the test list have you

00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:46,660
heard about Tesla's button hands back

00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:48,400
okay so if you have an idea that you're

00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:50,110
not going to implement right now are to

00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,480
you're to do and write a test for that

00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:53,950
later but don't interrupt you of

00:40:52,480 --> 00:41:00,220
thinking all the time

00:40:53,950 --> 00:41:02,350
okay and don't go I show you don't steal

00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,680
the keyboard and go I show you don't do

00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:05,290
that

00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:07,840
be patient even if you have the senior

00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:09,670
can't be patient and time box your

00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,260
decisions if you can't kind of go into

00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:12,340
an argument I don't think you're right I

00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,390
don't think you're right I don't think

00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,070
you're right I don't think you're right

00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:18,100
it's like five minutes to it and it just

00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:19,800
pick one right pick something and then

00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:24,340
go back to that later

00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:27,430
okay how do I learn this stuff code

00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:29,050
Coty's in prayer number five okay who is

00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:30,640
gonna pay for pay code Coty's do you

00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:32,940
know a Coca tazza I'm gonna explain to

00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:36,040
you so it's a practice that you do

00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:38,860
deliberate practice you try one hour of

00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:42,340
pepero gramming with someone else who's

00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:46,420
gonna pay for that what writing code and

00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:48,010
then delete the code what I'm already

00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:50,650
working 9:00 to 5:00 and I wanna do

00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:53,500
anything on my own time solving a

00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:55,960
problem that has already been solved I'm

00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:58,090
committed to his prints now I cannot go

00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,640
to your code guitar thingy I have a

00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:03,520
release and I can't join you today

00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:05,210
this is impractical okay you need to get

00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,770
people to do some stuff

00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:08,090
to be able to change their thinking you

00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:12,320
can't ask them to think in a different

00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:15,530
way by forcing them to do something this

00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:18,770
is how adults work you have them do

00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:21,650
something and then you go ah right

00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:23,750
don't say think like this no it doesn't

00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:25,490
work like that right I want you to dupe

00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:27,020
a programming now I wanted to did it

00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:30,950
doesn't work like that get them to do it

00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:33,380
and again ah that's why you do it right

00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:33,770
get them to do it that's why you do this

00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:36,470
thing

00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:39,080
kata so what do you do one hour every

00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:41,720
week I choose to do these on Friday 4:30

00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:44,030
and my company and if the project

00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:46,010
managers go and say you could have this

00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:48,170
guy and go okay are you going to release

00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:51,920
something Friday 4:30

00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:53,540
oh no ok so I'm gonna have him okay and

00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,210
and if the developers I want to go just

00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:58,580
put some beers in the materials and for

00:42:56,210 --> 00:43:00,530
some beers at 4:30 Friday that's getting

00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:01,970
to the mood of the weekend developers go

00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:04,430
to a meeting room and then you're gonna

00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:06,980
practice titty for an hour 20 minutes

00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:08,900
three rounds of 20 minutes and at the

00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:10,580
end of each round you delete a code and

00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:12,080
then swap the pair's to get a little bit

00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:13,040
of confusion and they're gonna start

00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,360
from the beginning and they're gonna

00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,280
spare someone else we're gonna bring the

00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,360
idea from the previous pair and now that

00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,040
it's like as potential they're gonna

00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:23,150
learn more and more stuff every time

00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:25,550
they change it okay you can google bar

00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:27,550
code kata you're gonna find loads of

00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:31,340
code cutouts on the web

00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:34,340
okay someone said this do you know who

00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:38,080
said this we have a great tool in this

00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:41,900
language we can kill it by making a mess

00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:44,360
we can kill it by being arrogant we can

00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:51,020
kill it by ignoring the enterprise who

00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:53,150
say that you know Robert C Martin yes

00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:55,250
some people know so Robert C Martin said

00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:57,920
that but he didn't say that in relation

00:43:55,250 --> 00:44:00,560
to p2p he said that in relation to Ruby

00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:03,560
and he said that in relation to Ruby

00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:05,630
Ruby he stopped he was talking about how

00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:07,940
what kill small talk have you heard

00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:09,380
about small talk yeah everybody heard

00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,440
about small talk so small talk was like

00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:13,790
a big thing and very similar to PHP

00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,350
dynamic language taking over the world

00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:17,570
all the programmers wanted to call in

00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:18,490
small talk when Smalltalk died they

00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:19,720
liked the hair

00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:24,280
most wanted to kill themselves because I

00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:26,770
had to call in Java so and the language

00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:29,710
was cute because people didn't take care

00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:33,580
and people didn't consider the

00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:35,920
enterprise right and he said that in a

00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:37,740
in a conference a ruby conference I

00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,390
think it's very very much applied to us

00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:43,240
okay so we can kill it

00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:47,400
by not taking care right we should think

00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:50,020
about PHP cowboy code time is gone

00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,940
it's enterprise time now we're actually

00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:57,580
hitting the enterprise now so we have to

00:44:51,940 --> 00:45:01,180
be grownups now okay now my I just want

00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:04,780
to finish with this code be daring be

00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:07,090
different be impractical be anything

00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:09,820
that we assert integrity of purpose and

00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:12,400
imaginative vision against the plate

00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:14,380
seifer's the creatures of the

00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,330
commonplace and the slaves of the

00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:19,600
ordinary

00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:21,280
okay my name is Marcelo I work at Envy

00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:23,770
come the head of training even Vika I

00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:26,980
contribute to PHP spec and I treat a

00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:29,130
death handle there and I thank you very

00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:29,130
much

00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:36,050
you have time question

00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:42,520
is any time for questions okay got any

00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:44,200
time for questions yeah because they

00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:46,000
have a longer break so John say about

00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:48,250
five minutes is not unknown do you have

00:45:46,000 --> 00:46:08,440
questions you have any questions

00:45:48,250 --> 00:46:18,120
comments yes comment on yeah the bus

00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:20,710
yeah hit by the bus yeah yeah yeah yeah

00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:23,590
there's not one way of doing this right

00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:24,670
so the reason it's good to understand

00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:26,740
the reasons why we do that

00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:28,570
so if you have a system that it really

00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:30,670
requires everybody to know very well

00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:34,060
every part of the system it's probably

00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:36,760
good idea to share them and but if you

00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:38,770
find out you do measure and then change

00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,180
with respective right so if you find

00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:41,710
that you doing a lot of contest

00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:43,600
switching that's slowing you down

00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:46,000
then you go back to keeping pairs

00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,910
together right and else you get tired to

00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,130
work with the same guy all the time just

00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:53,260
you know it depends you have to say and

00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:56,500
it pair programming is very tiny very

00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:58,330
tiny so it probably won't be able to

00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:00,400
keep it up in the beginning six hours a

00:46:58,330 --> 00:47:02,500
day seven hours a day the same person

00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:05,740
can be retiring because you get a lot

00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:08,110
done so not tweeting anything not

00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:10,060
googling anything so we forgetting our

00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:15,010
time for like another question but is

00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:18,240
anybody gone I'll just run over say if

00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:18,240
anybody's next door they can hear it

00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:24,500
okay how do you relates to TDD with BDD

00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:36,800
right so how do you relate to the d2 to

00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:42,810
be de T TDD is TDD Don right now TDD is

00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:44,100
TDD Don right No DDD it steady did

00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:46,950
alright okay if you don't if you don't

00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:48,720
do TDD write another in TDD period now

00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:52,440
we had to create BDD to teach you guys

00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:55,080
the deal right we create BDD as a as a

00:47:52,440 --> 00:48:00,060
teaching tool so that you go you do TDD

00:47:55,080 --> 00:48:04,920
right okay

00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:06,360
it's answer your question cool let's say

00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:08,750
thanks so thank you very much and thanks

00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,750
