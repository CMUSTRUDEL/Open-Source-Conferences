	00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:10,980
so thank you very much for having me

00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:14,990
here it's four thirty in the morning and

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:17,550
I want to talk to you a little bit about

00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:20,999
experience today just a two stories

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:23,970
nothing more than that talking about the

00:00:20,999 --> 00:00:25,769
experience here not as and the thing is

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,009
that we learn what we should learn over

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:31,919
the years but rather the things that we

00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:34,649
feel whether the things that the people

00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:37,140
we write software feel much of what I'm

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,640
about to talk to you about is I'd like

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,590
to think common sense but if you want to

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,660
throw away some money there's an

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:48,390
excellent book called the experience

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:50,370
economy that covers a lot of the topics

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:54,239
that I'm going to talk about today so

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:59,879
when I talk about experience I refer to

00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:03,210
things that we feel and as engineers we

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:06,150
don't quite realize how the importance

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:10,200
of feeling connected to the usage of our

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:12,600
software is its part part of the problem

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,690
is that we tend everybody does this we

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:18,780
tend to build things that we would want

00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:20,910
to use but we are not most often the

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:25,080
typical use case scenario for the

00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:27,390
technology that we build and so instead

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,180
of building things that we want to use

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,400
most of the word test we're building

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,260
things that other people want to use and

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,110
we don't quite realize that those people

00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:40,620
they often think in a very different way

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:42,800
from the way we think so I want to start

00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:45,240
with this little story and to do that i

00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:49,320
started need to do a whole time machine

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:53,580
thing and really go all the way back to

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:55,260
nineteen ninety eight ninety ninety

00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:58,290
eight I was much younger much thinner

00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:02,400
much better looking I know that sounds

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:04,650
impossible but I swear I was and at the

00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,450
time I just quit my job I moved to

00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:08,959
Canada two years before that I just quit

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,830
my job and I had started a company and i

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,080
remember when i moved to canada i

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,420
decided i wanted to be a game developer

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,900
so of course two years later I started

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,750
the comp

00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:22,650
well tax software that seems like a

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:27,810
perfect transition to me and this was in

00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:32,549
a full-blown dot-com era startup and as

00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:37,939
Edna come here startup we had investors

00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:41,939
which we hated and which related us and

00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:45,120
so one evening I remember I was just

00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:46,590
driving home and my CEO calls and it

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,340
goes you know you have to go and talk to

00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:52,760
rod rod being one of our investors are

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,959
bigger than that biggest investors and

00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,120
you know is I just call me it's

00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:01,200
furiously it says our software doesn't

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,849
work and whatever rod and I don't know

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,470
why but all the people all the rich

00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:08,849
people that i know i read the call rod

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:11,579
dick or johnson i think i see a pattern

00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:14,099
there i'm not i'm not sure if there is

00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:17,810
one but i think i see a pattern and so

00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:21,389
rod is what I like to sing took a

00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:23,489
butchering approach to investment which

00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:27,419
did it really meant he gave you money

00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:29,549
and you gave him a pound of flesh bag so

00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:33,510
I wasn't particularly happy of going to

00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:35,819
to to to his house but I didn't even

00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,919
drove up and it was in my 1979 a honda

00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:40,709
accord and this guy lived in a mansion

00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:43,709
and you know complete with Butler opens

00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:49,049
the Dover and so and I remember thinking

00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:51,750
on the way there that you know this guy

00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:53,669
was bridge had lots of money let's put

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,560
it that way but was not particularly

00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:58,709
Sally from the point of view of the

00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,049
college and this seems to be a very

00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:02,519
recurring theme in that the people with

00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:03,780
my don't understand computers and the

00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:07,620
people who computers don't understand

00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:12,629
money so on the drive there I saw that's

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:15,209
awesome I look forward to spending my

00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:17,609
evening trying to teach a half drunken

00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:18,829
Irish investor how to turn on his

00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:21,169
computer

00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:22,699
so I get there and to make a long story

00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:24,229
short I think I'll go through the butler

00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:28,099
makes me wait because it's more

00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:31,310
important I am and it shows me his

00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:32,990
computer and this guy is probably worth

00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,069
and all half a billion dollars I don't

00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,800
know something like that and he's

00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:40,939
running at the time on a black and white

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,430
monitor so this gives you an idea of

00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:45,139
what I had to deal with and so a very

00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:47,000
first screen of our application or

00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:49,780
application was very simple was about

00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,330
doing your taxes online using a razor I

00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:55,969
know really enough innovative so the

00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:58,940
very first screen of our application had

00:04:55,969 --> 00:05:02,150
a piece of tech state that says press

00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:05,870
next to continue and underneath it there

00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:08,750
was a nice button so broad was trying to

00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:13,969
move on to the next screen and he kept

00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:16,789
clicking on the word next and you know

00:05:13,969 --> 00:05:18,830
the button was right there nice but that

00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:22,840
looked like a button up the guy had to

00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:26,150
hang on I got to click on the word next

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:29,090
so of course you know what did I think

00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:34,580
at that point of view what a freaking

00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:36,979
idiot and rod was very nice instead you

00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:40,699
know it wasn't I rate it was not drunk

00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:42,620
which obviously is always a plus and it

00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:44,979
was going to coherent then he taught me

00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:47,680
that night one of the most important

00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:52,550
lessons that ever learned in my life and

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:55,099
that is that developers never sink with

00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:58,490
the user in mind or almost never think

00:05:55,099 --> 00:06:02,300
with the user in mind and we tend to

00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:04,479
think that the user is stupid and there

00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:07,699
is even the word that we use foolproof

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:10,490
but the reality is that the user is not

00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:13,669
stupid users just wants to get something

00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:18,110
done the worst part about all this is

00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:19,490
that we do this ourselves imagine you

00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:22,580
walk in the morning and if you're

00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:23,870
locking your car looks like this if

00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:27,069
you're around lock your car looks like a

00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,069
piece of plastic which is my case

00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:33,400
imagine if you know there is very little

00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:35,440
here that you have to take him even if

00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,410
you've never seen a car before even the

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,840
first time that you step into a car as a

00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:43,060
kid when you're learning to drive there

00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:45,090
isn't a whole lot here to take it

00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:50,350
there's a steering wheel there is a

00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:51,730
gearshift and there are some dials it's

00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,410
not particularly complicated to

00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:55,900
understand that if you want to drive

00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:57,580
there are pedals and so on the whole

00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:01,600
thing can you explain about 10 minutes

00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:03,730
or less it's very intuitive but learning

00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,640
to drive is not particularly intuitive

00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:08,110
in fact it takes time the interesting

00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,990
part about letting the driver know if

00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:13,030
you noticed is that the actual process

00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:15,730
of driving once the car is start that is

00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:17,910
not particularly complicated I mean you

00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:20,530
have to be severely brain-damaged to go

00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,640
out of the road if you're honest you

00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:23,410
know it's going to highway something

00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:26,290
like that once the car's gone is just

00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:28,330
getting the garden to be to gear things

00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:30,280
like parkings basically starting and

00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:33,790
stopping a particularly complicated I

00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,470
imagine if you walked into into your car

00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:40,840
in the morning and you probably look

00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:42,940
like this this is what what ninety-nine

00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,740
percent of the user of the user base

00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:50,500
sees when they turn on any piece of

00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:53,020
software they go all my god what have I

00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,670
done here what am I getting into I into

00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,590
this it's not so much that it's

00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:58,990
complicated because believe me this

00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:00,670
looks extremely complicated but I have a

00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,770
pilot's license although I don't fight

00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:04,570
anything like this and it's not

00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:06,550
difficult once you're in the air fly an

00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:08,590
airplane something you can do without

00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:10,750
any major problem the very first lesson

00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:12,670
in fact the very first lesson of flying

00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,710
is not the theory lesson they could they

00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:16,750
have to get you hooked so they don't get

00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:19,210
you with the FAA regulations for the

00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:21,160
first fish Lester know they put into an

00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:24,550
airplane and they tell you okay now you

00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:28,480
take up and you go what

00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:30,060
and it seems extremely scary the

00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,350
beginning but the most difficult part of

00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,880
flying airplane is not flying the

00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:36,790
airplanes landing the airplane without

00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:39,490
you know splatting yourself on the

00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:43,750
driveway which happens more often you

00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:46,840
think so the same thing happens to users

00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,460
users are not stupid we we like to think

00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:52,240
that users are stupid but they're not

00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:54,910
stupid they're just uses and this is

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,700
this was the huge is the biggest lesson

00:08:54,910 --> 00:09:01,630
I've ever learned and rod about people

00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:05,200
taught it to me the average user does

00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:06,760
not look at computers as their way their

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,230
ticket to the moon that I want to get

00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,790
into orbit they don't want to cure

00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:11,460
cancer I'm talking about the avengers'

00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:14,980
you don't want to cure cancer with it

00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:17,140
they want to do simple things they want

00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:19,210
to know that they can write the

00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,560
PowerPoint presentation that doesn't

00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:23,740
look like somebody vomited on their

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,530
screen they want to to know that they

00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:28,900
can open a spreadsheet without causing

00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:30,310
third world war they know they can send

00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:36,850
an email without causing a diplomatic

00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:39,490
incident and yet engineers ask we still

00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:41,110
look at software as you know we gotta

00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:43,780
get these people on to the moon what do

00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:48,040
we do with it well we put on white

00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:51,250
dresses and smoke a pipe and have big

00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:54,280
machines with the bulbs of paid running

00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:56,230
around us that's by the way what you see

00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:59,410
if you go to just about any exhibit

00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:01,780
about the history of computing it seems

00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:04,560
to to me that every artist and Eric

00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:07,090
thinks that the biggest revolution in

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,180
the history of computing was smoking

00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:15,240
pipes wearing horn-rimmed glasses and

00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:17,800
having big magnetic tapes behind you the

00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,980
big problem that every engineer has

00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:23,500
they're forced to sink like a user this

00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:26,970
is extremely difficult to do because as

00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:28,810
I said we're not typical users and I

00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:30,640
understand why I mean being an engineer

00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:32,400
myself I understand what the problem is

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,190
engineers have a really rough life

00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:37,920
because half of the population

00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:40,260
doesn't understand what we do I've been

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,480
doing being thus business for 15 years

00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:44,640
my mother still does not understand what

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,320
I do for a living you probably think

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,590
some dealing drugs on the side because

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,600
who can make money out of computers the

00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:54,000
other half of the world thinks were

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,470
idiots because they understand computers

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,800
and of course they understand computers

00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:00,690
better than everybody else so thinking

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,730
like a user is a rough thing to do but

00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:05,790
it's not that complicated and we see it

00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:08,400
every day when we ourselves or users

00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:10,920
imagine as I said if you had to go

00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,750
through a thousand hours of training

00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,270
before you will be allowed in your car

00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:19,020
we all agree that those will be safer

00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:21,270
probably but that's thousand hours by

00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,830
the way is what a commercial pilot has

00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:26,400
to go through before they can be even

00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:28,710
allowed to fly an airline so eventually

00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,840
if it took you a thousand hours to learn

00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:32,280
to drive a car would you want to drive a

00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:36,030
car at that point I don't know about you

00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:37,200
I'll take the subway just like it took

00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:40,800
an airplane here instead of flying

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,690
myself so what do users want well they

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,610
want something that communicates an

00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:47,100
experience to that that gets them from

00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:49,620
point A to point B with this little

00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,900
learning curve as possible so thinking

00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:55,050
like user means making things clear and

00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:57,270
simple the biggest decision that goes

00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:59,190
into user experience development is not

00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:03,330
what to put into that the application

00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:06,240
but what to keep out of it we all have

00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:10,020
seen all sorts of weird software

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:13,860
contraptions with you know 10,000

00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:16,050
buttons all over the place I'm tempted

00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,700
to make examples out of some software

00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:19,530
packages that we all use but that's

00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:22,020
besides the point is but at some point

00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:23,280
or rather we probably every person in

00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:26,880
this room has probably made the same

00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:29,460
mistake having too much giving the user

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,830
too much and really you only want the

00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:34,680
user to see me what is necessary to them

00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:36,980
to get a task that because everything

00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:42,060
else has to side effects one is

00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:44,460
confusion if if you give the user choice

00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:46,100
we all we've all been trained to think

00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:48,209
that choice is a good

00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:50,309
that's why we use open source software

00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:52,110
that's why we may you have many

00:12:50,309 --> 00:12:54,179
different operating systems you

00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,920
different languages and so on choice

00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:57,449
from the point of view of somebody does

00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,509
not know what choice they're about to

00:12:57,449 --> 00:13:02,369
make is horrible thing to have you don't

00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:04,799
know if you don't know what exactly each

00:13:02,369 --> 00:13:07,410
choice you make will what the

00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:10,679
consequences will be of that choice you

00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:14,220
will be afraid that just like every

00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:15,600
single person in in offices worldwide is

00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,970
afraid of using their computer so

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,410
because computers are complicated it's

00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:21,179
because they are afraid of the

00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,799
consequences will pushing this button

00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:25,019
destroy all the work that I've done

00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:26,549
whether we can ask them myself we'll

00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:28,949
have to call customers technical support

00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:33,649
and they've been I'm looking at me with

00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:36,540
that strange IP look like they creepy

00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:40,049
you don't know anything look that they

00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:42,649
give you x this is what's called a

00:13:40,049 --> 00:13:46,019
famous 8020 rule the Pareto principle

00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:48,869
make sure that the options that you see

00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:51,329
satisfy eighty percent of your users and

00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:53,939
that any percent will be very grateful

00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:56,999
the remaining twenty percent obviously

00:13:53,939 --> 00:14:00,990
on the surface looks under underserved

00:13:56,999 --> 00:14:03,449
but the reality is that that amazing

00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:05,459
twenty percent has an incentive to dig

00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:09,149
into your application and learn more

00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:11,610
about what it does so you reveal

00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:15,119
information you reveal functionality to

00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:16,799
that those people in a way that makes

00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:18,269
them feel like they've learned something

00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:22,079
it gained something when they feel like

00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:26,369
they've earned the right to access that

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:27,660
functionality then you can in fact you

00:14:26,369 --> 00:14:30,179
know they feel empowered what should be

00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:34,470
use it more than anything else be

00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:36,569
consistent make sure that the causality

00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:39,600
of action and reaction is always

00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:40,980
consistent once again I see websites and

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,949
unfortunately I'm sorry to say I own

00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:47,669
websites that are not very consistent

00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:50,360
the way they would but if you teach you

00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:55,139
uses that to every action there is a

00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:58,420
predictable outcome they will they will

00:14:55,139 --> 00:15:01,999
definitely want to deal with it more

00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:04,970
so that was story number one starry

00:15:01,999 --> 00:15:08,509
number two is much more recent in fact

00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:12,439
it goes all the way to to just a couple

00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:17,240
of months ago and when we talk about

00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:19,100
experience the example that always comes

00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,019
to my mind is the in the world I know if

00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:23,480
anybody hears have the opportunity to go

00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:26,389
to Disney World War two your give me

00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:29,240
your name Paris please in the world is

00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:32,059
the perfect example of all experience

00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:35,360
when you think about getting into Disney

00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:37,160
World or your gives me I always felt

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:42,199
that it's like entertainment of the

00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:44,089
universe and the things you can actually

00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:47,990
do is side easily whether they

00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:51,019
restricted in in Florida you can't smoke

00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:53,569
almost anywhere you can only buy you

00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:55,759
these new favorite of words the the

00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:57,829
rides are they are they but you know

00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,449
once you actually look at the rides

00:15:57,829 --> 00:16:01,600
they're actually kind of quite lame

00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:04,490
there's nothing particularly adventurer

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,339
adventurous or risky inside these new

00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:10,040
work but everything feels like he's

00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:12,470
being prepared and made available just

00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,240
for you I always looking like an idiot

00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:15,769
when I'm invisible I look like an idiot

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,949
normally but when I'm a disney world and

00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:19,790
particularly looks like an idiot because

00:16:17,949 --> 00:16:22,490
everybody else is like oh look it's

00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:24,800
making us and I'm like and they keep

00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:27,620
repeating oh I can't see this pictures

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,300
here what are the music coming from what

00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:33,589
are the cameras you know how do these

00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:35,629
people show up out of nowhere from the

00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:38,829
perspective of an engineer the in the

00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:42,500
world is imagined it really is magic and

00:16:38,829 --> 00:16:44,720
I took a once took a backstage tour of

00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:47,569
these new world and I was amazed that

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:51,110
the length at which they made did they

00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:53,899
go to make sure that what you feel when

00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,370
you walk around evening world is exactly

00:16:53,899 --> 00:16:57,410
what they want you to feel in other

00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:59,749
words they make you make it sure that

00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:04,280
whatever you do is being planned even

00:16:59,749 --> 00:17:06,890
though you can't tell there is a network

00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,149
of underground which are actually about

00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:10,459
ground these new world is built on the

00:17:08,149 --> 00:17:11,809
second floor because the water table in

00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:14,709
Florida is so high that they can

00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:16,789
okay there's an underground network of

00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:18,919
corridors called Attila doors in the

00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:20,720
knees disney world that allow these new

00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:24,339
employees to go around the park without

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,809
being seen so you'll never see a cowboy

00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:30,139
walking around tomorrow land or

00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:32,840
something like that when you go from one

00:17:30,139 --> 00:17:35,269
land to the next this was the best bit

00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:37,070
in my opinion on the entire tour when go

00:17:35,269 --> 00:17:39,590
for a walk from one line to an axis

00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:41,120
usually over a bridge and the reason for

00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:43,399
that is that if you go over the bridge

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,259
they have to build up the bridge goes

00:17:43,399 --> 00:17:47,980
happen when it goes down and what

00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:50,809
they've learned is that if you walk up

00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:52,789
instinctively your head tilts up as well

00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:54,429
and so you look up and you realize that

00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:56,539
you're about to enter a different world

00:17:54,429 --> 00:17:58,039
so you don't suddenly you know work

00:17:56,539 --> 00:18:00,259
around your map like this and find

00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:01,549
yourself in a different part of the park

00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:06,409
without understanding how you go out

00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:09,919
there so when people tell me oh I hate

00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:12,679
these new work because it's also fake it

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,019
kind of makes me laugh because from the

00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:18,169
point of view of engineering the point

00:18:15,019 --> 00:18:22,519
of view how it works it's such a marble

00:18:18,169 --> 00:18:25,759
such a plan choreographed well developed

00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:27,860
if you will plan just letting you enjoy

00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:29,809
to just let you enjoy your day without

00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:32,629
thinking about now I hear the kind of

00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:35,059
guy who likes to spend their their

00:18:32,629 --> 00:18:37,490
summers whitewater rafting in the Amazon

00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:42,799
or resting piranhas or something like

00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:44,320
that obviously obviously disney world is

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:47,240
not going to need the best place for you

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:49,159
but if you're the kind of guy who just

00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,419
wants to have a good time you went to go

00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:54,129
in there with their children knowing

00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:56,840
that they won't come out missing limbs

00:18:54,129 --> 00:18:59,269
this is where is the perfect place and

00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:03,110
it's a such a perfect parallel to the

00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:05,330
world of computers people look at softer

00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:07,429
look at computers and they see the

00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:11,990
amazon they see piranhas in the form of

00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:16,820
buttons and icons we want them to see

00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:20,119
computers as aids as friendly Mickey

00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:20,890
mouse-shaped aids whatever it is that

00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:26,020
they want to do

00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:28,410
and so as it was the corruptor painless

00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:31,420
desktop I said what's the best possible

00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:33,610
example that I can give you what I

00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:37,060
actually mean by this I thought about

00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:42,370
the most put a typical user that I've

00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:44,590
ever encountered my mother if technology

00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:48,610
were a religion my mother will be the

00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:50,740
Antichrist she's not a Luddite or

00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:52,960
anything of the sort it's just that

00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:56,640
she's not compatible with the ecology

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:59,620
staff actively breaks around her we

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,570
actually after 15 years of begging I

00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,950
finally took my mother you know I only

00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:05,830
see my mother she still lives in Italy

00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:09,090
and I only see her every few years ago

00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:10,960
every year so so which is fine with me

00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:12,880
what were the fact that she doesn't like

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,840
to travel I don't like to travel to

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,580
Italy he only see every three years so

00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:22,900
it finally took her to Disney World this

00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:24,460
past Christmas season and I swear to God

00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:28,450
when I tell you that I had never had

00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:29,860
such a bad time at disney world as when

00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:31,810
my mother it was not my mother's father

00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:36,610
stop get breaking the weather was

00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:38,170
horrible the hotel kept reprogramming

00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,320
our cars so there's nothing like walking

00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:42,970
for 10 hours a day and then get into the

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:47,410
resort at night and your hotel card

00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:49,690
doesn't work so anyway a Christmas since

00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:53,410
they were there we gave my mom an iPad

00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:56,650
and oh my god created the monster in

00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:59,320
this kind of 48 hours now my mother's a

00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:04,440
person who has never done email okay she

00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:08,080
delegates him out to my dad in 48 hours

00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:10,000
she became and I've had feet she would

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,250
you know walk around with this thing and

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,460
if he wasn't taking the kids out she

00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:19,210
would just be browsing around the web

00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:20,950
like a seasoned professional so I kept

00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,960
that you know I couldn't help but but

00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:25,000
realize that there was something in

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,460
there that that I had to learn and so I

00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,900
asked my mom well you know what what's

00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,750
so different about different about the

00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,780
ipad

00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:34,580
and then she pointed at the home but of

00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:37,400
all things she pointed to the home bath

00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:41,060
and so I noticed you know I have a an

00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:42,800
iphone there's the home button I have a

00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:47,240
windows phone there's the windows button

00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:48,800
same thing and I've been thinking in

00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,570
both Apple and Microsoft I've been

00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,160
extremely smart about what these buttons

00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:55,580
me because they tell you it's the home

00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:58,130
but it just takes you back to home my

00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:02,120
mom sees this and thinks it's the oh my

00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:03,770
god button and if you look at this see

00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,540
that that little square round the square

00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:09,980
it almost looks like that face of

00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:12,290
somebody was going oh my god and if you

00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:14,360
lie is that my mom looks at the ipad and

00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:17,420
things the worst possible thing that I

00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:19,520
can ever do on this on this device is

00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:22,430
that I push the home button and

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,740
everything goes back to normal it's a

00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:28,400
safeguard it's a panic button for the

00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:31,100
user the function itself is sort of

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:35,140
irrelevant it's what it means to the

00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,140
user that makes it so important and

00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:40,460
engineers we just don't get that because

00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,830
we want choice we want options we want

00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:46,400
to know that this thing can be broken

00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:48,080
can be submitted to a will and can be

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,150
mean to walk backwards if we wanted to

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,100
okay and the users don't care they just

00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:55,160
want to be able to get whatever the

00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:58,760
cases they want to be to get done done

00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:01,730
and yet you see examples all over the

00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:05,540
place of engineers who keep treating

00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:07,850
users and if they were chimpanzees it's

00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:12,020
horrible it's a horrible experience to

00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:15,080
do and it's horrible experience even for

00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:16,730
a person who does this for a living so

00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:22,240
let me take you all the way forwards

00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:24,680
from 1998 back to know present day and

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:29,140
present day it goes back to about a

00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:31,610
month ago or so i recently switched my

00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:33,380
my computer setup and i have multi

00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:35,930
monitors which I you know then usually

00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:39,560
like very much but I went and bought

00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:42,700
this little app called which which is a

00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:47,810
wonderful utility that sort of a

00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:51,410
replaces the standard of tab screen near

00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:56,630
your computer and sort of gives you more

00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:59,300
options okay but to buy that I had to

00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:02,030
obviously go through their website and

00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:04,700
the website uses google checkout for

00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:06,770
purchases I I'm not entirely sure if

00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:11,450
Google Checkout is available here in the

00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:13,660
UK any hands yes it is good thank you so

00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:17,450
Google Checkout in a think paypal only

00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:19,550
were annoying were obnoxious and I came

00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:21,380
across this wonderful wonderful little

00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:23,270
thing I was just going in putting my

00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:26,090
credit card number and putting my

00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:30,460
address and as a cycle through the

00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:35,090
fields in the web form I end up one on

00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:38,210
this gem that asks you that tells you

00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:40,790
you know if you're from Canada you may

00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:42,590
not know this you may not be you know be

00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:47,720
aware of the fact that your postal codes

00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:49,550
look like this and i look at this and i

00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,200
took a screenshot of it then you know

00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:54,920
them usually take screenshots of things

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:57,350
for no reason but i can't think why why

00:24:54,920 --> 00:25:00,830
do you do this to me do you have to make

00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:03,020
me feel like an idiot at all costs think

00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:06,170
about the last ten purchases you've made

00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:08,600
online and the last ten web forms you

00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:10,910
went through and ask yourself am I being

00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:13,220
treated like a human being here or am I

00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:15,410
being treated like a chimp typical

00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:17,800
example is enter your credit card the

00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:20,060
number no dashes or spaces please I

00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,830
guess to these people regular

00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,890
expressions are just things that happen

00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:25,600
to other people I don't know

00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:27,700
this is this is the kind of thing that

00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,020
did just drags me out the world i'm not

00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:32,890
having a laugh at it but it's actually

00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:35,590
tragic it's horrible it's a it's a

00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:37,510
horrible way the treating users when you

00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:40,930
start with the assumption I'm giving

00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:43,210
with idiots obviously they're going to

00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:45,520
feel intimidated by this you may not

00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:47,620
have that intention I don't think it you

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,080
know most people don't have any tension

00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:53,050
when they build web forms but the end

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:55,210
result is that your users feel like you

00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:57,100
you know okay you know what they have to

00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:59,020
tell me this so I guess I'm a bit of an

00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:03,550
idiot and it should be maybe go no

00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:05,950
easier on things initiation in all sorts

00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:09,670
of things credit card numbers telephone

00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:11,950
numbers numbers only because there must

00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:16,720
be countries where they have in a full

00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:18,730
qwerty keyboard on their telephones and

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:23,620
so the question to the answer to why is

00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:26,290
obviously well user is stupid and from

00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:27,850
the point of view of this asset when the

00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:32,200
point of view of the user that makes you

00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:34,480
feel less than worthy of being with the

00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,880
computer but from the point of view of

00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:40,300
the engineer what does this mean this

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,700
means that we have to start really

00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:44,920
thinking about the experience that our

00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:46,360
software does remember I mentioned at

00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,550
the beginning of this of this

00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:51,370
presentation about half an hour ago for

00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:54,520
those of you have not keeping track that

00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:57,370
I was talking about a book called the

00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:58,870
experience economy and if you've never

00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:00,790
read the book where or if you never

00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:03,490
heard about the term experienced economy

00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:05,230
you should definitely check it out the

00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:08,140
experience economy predicates that

00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:12,370
people place value not on functionality

00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:14,260
not on what the tools that they buy the

00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:18,760
product that they buy allow them to

00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:22,930
solve but on how the solution makes them

00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:25,450
feel this is why you know you can go and

00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:27,070
buy an iPhone and will cost you I know

00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:28,390
what it costs here but in the states in

00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:30,880
Canada it's six or seven hundred dollars

00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:31,990
for one of these that's why Apple can

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,850
send you this thing for stone hundred

00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:36,220
dollars they're not telling you hardware

00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:37,779
yeah sure it's a nice device you know

00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,399
it's solid if you

00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:42,369
forget button you can probably kill

00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:43,929
somebody with this thing but it's not

00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:48,989
what they're selling what they are

00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:53,499
selling you is peace of mind this is the

00:27:48,989 --> 00:27:56,259
2011 version of racketeering they are

00:27:53,499 --> 00:27:57,879
selling you the knowledge the impression

00:27:56,259 --> 00:27:59,469
that when you use yourself did their

00:27:57,879 --> 00:28:03,460
software there's nothing that can

00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:05,259
possibly go wrong and the the thing that

00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:07,479
amazes me about a company like Apple is

00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:09,399
a slider you are about the way they sell

00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:14,109
this they sell it in such a way that

00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:15,969
their competitors don't get it you know

00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:18,519
they tell it's the home button even

00:28:15,969 --> 00:28:21,549
though that's not what it is they tell

00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:25,989
you it just works even though anybody

00:28:21,549 --> 00:28:28,210
has a Mac knows it doesn't just work to

00:28:25,989 --> 00:28:31,119
the user though what it means is that

00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:32,859
they're treated with respect they are

00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:35,739
given a tool that they know they can

00:28:32,859 --> 00:28:38,859
master because there is no secret code

00:28:35,739 --> 00:28:41,259
there's no there's no spell that's going

00:28:38,859 --> 00:28:43,239
to make it to make it work there's no IT

00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:45,820
tech guy that comes and give you the

00:28:43,239 --> 00:28:47,950
creepy smile and that tells you to

00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:49,809
extend the side only fixes whatever it

00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:52,539
is that you screw up screwed up in your

00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:56,830
on your computer if you go to an apple

00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:59,349
store it's kind of surreal actually they

00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:03,580
did the guy totally it probably is half

00:28:59,349 --> 00:29:05,049
your age and there's no there's no

00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:07,059
secret go to the back whatever it is

00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:09,309
that they need to do and they come back

00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:13,179
and your device works again they screw

00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:15,460
up as often it's not but but when the

00:29:13,179 --> 00:29:17,499
guys working just easier the impression

00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:22,119
that you don't need to worry about what

00:29:17,499 --> 00:29:23,799
goes on behind the screen and front of

00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:25,629
the backing you just need to worry about

00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:28,179
the fact that you want to get something

00:29:25,629 --> 00:29:29,919
done and you get it done and you look at

00:29:28,179 --> 00:29:32,379
devices like this you look at devices

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:35,289
like Windows Phone for example I just

00:29:32,379 --> 00:29:39,070
got this one on Friday I'm sorry today

00:29:35,289 --> 00:29:42,330
is Friday I just got this on Wednesday

00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:44,019
yes let's cook this on Wednesday and I

00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:46,460
kind of like it better than the iphone

00:29:44,019 --> 00:29:49,480
from anita's face perspective actually

00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:52,100
and again well you look at this thing

00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:57,950
there's then little that you can do on

00:29:52,100 --> 00:30:02,300
the phone compared to prepare to we know

00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:05,900
a computer it's very limited even as a

00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:09,140
developer just a working on life I was a

00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:13,940
just lazy where I you go emo you where

00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:15,770
are you it's not here oh yes all the way

00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:17,420
back there I was just checking with you

00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:20,060
asked this morning in anyways tellin me

00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:22,730
you know is building iOS applications

00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:26,360
too and we were just discussing how it's

00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:27,680
both very fun and they unfun it's fun as

00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,990
long as you're doing things that Apple

00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:32,570
wants you to do it becomes extremely I'm

00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:34,520
fun the moment you hit up against one of

00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:36,080
their mutations I'll computers of course

00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:41,150
you don't usually have to deal with this

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:43,850
certainly not anymore but it's even more

00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:46,430
the reason especially as uses of open

00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:49,580
source software uses of PHP we have a

00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:51,920
huge advantage in that is that we're

00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:53,810
working with systems are completely open

00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,820
with working with systems that give us

00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:58,940
complete freedom yet we feel that the

00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:02,080
advantage of that freedom to give our

00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:03,950
users the experience that they want and

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,300
giving the experience that they want

00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:07,250
it's not just a matter of being

00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:09,740
condescending and tell ya okay you know

00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:11,450
what here's a computer if you don't

00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:15,260
patch it strange ways it won't blow up

00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:17,630
on you it means empowering them and

00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:19,880
giving them that experience that feeling

00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:22,070
of accomplishment that they amassed as a

00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:23,960
computer because remember they don't

00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:26,810
want to become developers they don't

00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:29,890
want to understand how software works

00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:34,190
they just want to be able to use it and

00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:35,720
the unfortunate thing is that treating

00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:37,700
user as you would like to be treated

00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,610
does not always seem to be the focusing

00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:44,510
on people who consider themselves user

00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:49,400
experience experts they you know no more

00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:53,000
often than not there is a patina of

00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:55,100
superficiality to user experience a lot

00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,410
of people think oh it's about making

00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,509
things look good and I remember there

00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:01,209
was a

00:31:58,509 --> 00:32:05,019
that or once a year in the united states

00:32:01,209 --> 00:32:10,449
are called code works and this year we

00:32:05,019 --> 00:32:11,589
had an Adobe evangelist with us and so

00:32:10,449 --> 00:32:12,639
we were doing our first round of

00:32:11,589 --> 00:32:13,989
presentations and of course you the

00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:17,079
first time ago presentation it's always

00:32:13,989 --> 00:32:19,059
a bit rough it's a cut of a given cake

00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:20,259
and trying to figure out exactly what

00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:21,519
makes the audience click that for

00:32:20,259 --> 00:32:24,909
example I can feel right now your boy

00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:26,399
valid earbuds and see you didn't even

00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:32,559
laugh of that which makes it even worse

00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:34,779
yeah that's benefit so yeah this Brian

00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:36,399
Stewart the adobe evangelist was digging

00:32:34,779 --> 00:32:37,599
atop that was very much long lines of

00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:41,649
what I was eating here without putting

00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:43,989
people to sleep and he said something I

00:32:41,649 --> 00:32:46,989
half jokingly like the user experience

00:32:43,989 --> 00:32:50,519
guys make it look good and so somebody

00:32:46,989 --> 00:32:53,409
tweeted that and you know out of a

00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:56,049
140-character quote completely out of

00:32:53,409 --> 00:32:58,359
context and grew this entire discussion

00:32:56,049 --> 00:33:00,909
about user experience in what it means

00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:03,159
or what it does there are in fact a lot

00:33:00,909 --> 00:33:05,349
of people think that design application

00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:07,479
design uses a user experience design is

00:33:05,349 --> 00:33:08,859
about making things look good but that's

00:33:07,479 --> 00:33:12,309
not what it is about it's about making

00:33:08,859 --> 00:33:14,829
things feel good there's also a large

00:33:12,309 --> 00:33:18,279
number of people disconcertingly large

00:33:14,829 --> 00:33:21,699
number of engineers who somehow think

00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:23,889
that user experience is about making the

00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:28,929
user feel just how good the developer

00:33:23,889 --> 00:33:30,339
was and so they think that user

00:33:28,929 --> 00:33:32,440
experience he has nothing more really

00:33:30,339 --> 00:33:35,079
than showing off their really cool

00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:37,449
things into the college you can do but

00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:39,519
that's not at all what it's about it's

00:33:37,449 --> 00:33:42,309
about making people feel that they can

00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,989
get things done this is true whether

00:33:42,309 --> 00:33:49,359
you're driving a car flying an airplane

00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:51,940
or or you know trying to as I said

00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:55,029
before right the PowerPoint presentation

00:33:51,940 --> 00:34:00,449
doesn't look like somebody died and they

00:33:55,029 --> 00:34:03,690
got splattered all over your screen so

00:34:00,449 --> 00:34:07,809
those are two stories and the more the

00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:09,850
overarching idea is that as engineers

00:34:07,809 --> 00:34:12,910
we're now entering a phase

00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:16,090
is which staff the development is less

00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:18,370
about it's really less about engineers

00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:21,690
that's about the mechanics of about

00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:24,150
afterwards it's what about the

00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:28,330
experience that stuff that communicates

00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:31,300
so before I kind of shut up that you go

00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:35,290
on with your day the final thought that

00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:38,230
I wanted to pass along is but again we

00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:40,120
are in a blessed position as PHP

00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:42,460
developers I'm assuming everybody here

00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:45,340
is a PHP developer otherwise the stamp

00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:48,070
collection presentation is down the hall

00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:53,050
get away we're all doing old people in

00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:54,720
Tweedy time we're blessed because we're

00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:59,050
working with a technology that is

00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:02,710
completely wide open to us there are no

00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:04,270
real limitations put on us by PHP which

00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:07,690
is I don't know about you but that was

00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:10,000
what attracted me to PHP 10 years ago it

00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:13,360
was just as in time it was building

00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,650
websites in ASP and I kept hitting

00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,150
against the fact that if we wanted to do

00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:17,380
with this have to buy a component

00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:19,660
afforded to do that I have to buy

00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:21,100
another component and the worst part of

00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:23,320
course is that you don't know whether

00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:26,080
the component does exactly what you want

00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:29,380
until you tried it out and spent all the

00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:31,300
money so PHP needs us all these

00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:33,160
opportunities and we should take

00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:35,740
advantage of these opportunities because

00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:38,230
they allow us and again this is all good

00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:43,210
engineer experience they should be allow

00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:45,580
us to stop worrying about the mechanics

00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:48,370
of making things happen and start

00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:52,960
worrying about the feeling that that

00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:55,570
happens now you may think well I'm just

00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,420
a cog in a larger machine and just a

00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:59,980
developer and just employed I write code

00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:04,030
that i have to worry about this stuff we

00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:06,730
have you XX experts experts that do this

00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:08,740
for us but the reality is that you

00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:12,970
communicate that experience regardless

00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:16,240
of what position you are in in a softer

00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:19,120
development process you may be that your

00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,860
experience is not communicated to an end

00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,580
user might be communicated to your

00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,630
manager may be

00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:26,700
you can eat two other people in your

00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:29,440
team in all cases you should try to

00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:32,560
deliver an experience to the people who

00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:35,890
are at the terminal of your message and

00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:37,810
you'll see that the the result the

00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:42,250
consequences are doing that is that your

00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:45,960
work will be more valuable more not just

00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:48,850
in terms of money which you know is good

00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:53,170
but also in terms of recognition people

00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:55,570
are more likely to enjoy using your

00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:58,240
software if they do not feel intimidated

00:36:55,570 --> 00:37:00,220
by it and that's really all I wanted to

00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,430
talk to you about today thank you very

00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,430
