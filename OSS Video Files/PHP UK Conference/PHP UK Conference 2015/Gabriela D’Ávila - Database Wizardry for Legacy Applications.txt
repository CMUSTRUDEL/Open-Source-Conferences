Title: Gabriela D’Ávila - Database Wizardry for Legacy Applications
Publication date: 2015-04-02
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2015
Description: 
	In my experience, one of the major bottlenecks in building an Application lies in the database. This crucial piece of your app is also the most difficult to alter. If you have high availability software, how do you improve from spaghetti code without being able to do major changes to its database? You may refactor your spaghetti into beautiful, hexagonally layered lasagne, but if your database sucks, your data sucks. In this talk you will learn how to improve your legacy application by discovering the benefits of NoSQL to consolidate your data, and how tools like MapReduce can increase your project performance.
