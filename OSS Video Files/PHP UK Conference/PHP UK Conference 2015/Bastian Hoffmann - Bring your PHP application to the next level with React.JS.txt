Title: Bastian Hoffmann - Bring your PHP application to the next level with React.JS
Publication date: 2015-04-02
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2015
Description: 
	React.JS is a very powerful library for building user interfaces and the new, cool kid in the JavaScript world. But it is also very interesting for creating a fast, maintainable and interactive PHP application. In this talk I'll show what React is all about and how you can combine itâ€™s power with your PHP application, even if you have to render out HTML on the server side. The result will be a flexible, component based architecture that enables developers to take page elements, like a single "follow" button, and place it everywhere on the site without having to duplicate any PHP, JS, HTML, CSS or AJAX endpoints in the process.
