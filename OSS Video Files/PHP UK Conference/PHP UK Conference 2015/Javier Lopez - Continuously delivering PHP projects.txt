Title: Javier Lopez - Continuously delivering PHP projects
Publication date: 2015-04-02
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2015
Description: 
	For the last few months we've been implementing a Continuous Delivery pipeline for the redesign of Time Out. In this talk I will demonstrate a real life example of what our pipeline looks like, the different tools we've used to get it done (phing, github, jenkins, ansible, AWS S3, ...), and peculiarities for PHP and Symfony2 projects. Most importantly, I'll be looking at things we've struggled with along the way and the lessons we've learnt.
