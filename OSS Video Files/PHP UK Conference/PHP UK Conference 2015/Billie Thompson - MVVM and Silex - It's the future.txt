Publication date: 2015-04-02
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2015
Description: 
	There's two things that every cool new start-up wants to provide. A rich application like website, and an API. I'll be talking about how to use Silex and an AngularJS to create one. With lots of demos to go wrong, this talk is aimed at PHP developers that work closely with the frontend, some some knowledge of JavaScript is assumed. We'll touch on the cool things happening in the frontend space like Bower, Grunt, MVVM Frameworks, and how that might change how you write PHP.
