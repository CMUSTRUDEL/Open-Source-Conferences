Description: 
	The web has changed. Users demand responsive, real-time interactive applications and companies need to store and analyze tons of data. Some years ago, monolithic code bases with a basic LAMP stack, some caching and perhaps a search engine were enough. These days everybody is talking about micro-services architectures, SOA, Erlang, Golang, message passing, queue systems and many more. PHP seems to not be cool anymore but... is this true? Should we all forget everything we know and just learn these new technologies? Do we really need all these things?
