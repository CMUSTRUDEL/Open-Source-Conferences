Publication date: 2015-04-02
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2015
Description: 
	Handling RESTful API requests with Laravel PHP Framework resource controllers is already a cinch. With the arrival of Laravel 5, handling request routing has been made even easier by using a configuration-as-annotation approach. Controller annotations may take advantage of doc block-style syntax and then be compiled using Laravel's artisan command-line tool. I'll present this approach by providing a few examples and discussing some of the pros and cons.
