you

00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:10,480
so good afternoon I hope everybody had a

00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,860
good date I'm really really honored to

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,200
be keynoting here this year I've been

00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:16,810
speaking at this conference for three

00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:20,500
and four years now and it's nice to be

00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:22,180
up on the big stage so thank you I meant

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,529
in a lot of you probably met me over the

00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,239
course of the last couple of days if

00:00:23,529 --> 00:00:27,189
you've been down in the cloud bar or the

00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:31,059
actual bar last night you probably had a

00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:32,920
conversation with me so my name is Davy

00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:35,290
traffic I'm a community engineer at

00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,730
Engine Yard engine yard is a cloud

00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,590
access management platform which means

00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,030
we take your PHP apps and we scale him

00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:43,240
the cloud great twenty four seven

00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:44,530
support so I've been attending yard for

00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:47,800
three years now and over those three

00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:49,980
years I've been very very fortunate to

00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,240
be able to spend most of my time just

00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:56,410
interacting with and hopefully helping

00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:59,640
this community so the first time that I

00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:03,310
spoke at engine yard was 2012 right here

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,790
at PHP UK and I was speaking about what

00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:08,770
was new in PHP 54 and Rasmus was key

00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:10,479
noticing that morning and he mentioned

00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:13,240
in his keynote that I was giving this

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,340
talk and then he turned up right in the

00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,780
front row of my first speaking

00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,729
engagement in two years and I was very

00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,490
nervous and actually spent like months

00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:22,930
on my slides I was so prepared but I

00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:25,120
finished them in December and didn't

00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:28,510
look at them till februari wasn't very

00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,549
small but so Rasmus is there and SAT

00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:32,500
right behind him is yohance luta who was

00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:35,890
the release manager for 54 lot of

00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,570
pressure and you can imagine you know

00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:41,020
they're filming and all the social stuff

00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:42,970
that was great um speaking of people who

00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,890
put the pressure on my mom is sitting

00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,799
right here in the front row this is the

00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:56,970
first time that she's ever seen we speak

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:56,970
so I better not it up sorry mum so

00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:06,049
so while speaking here three years ago

00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,250
was was fun there's been a couple of

00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:08,720
other events over the last few years

00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:11,000
that have been really really important

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,130
to me the first one and the most

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,380
important is the birth and adoption of

00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,790
my son Gabriel as you can imagine that's

00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:19,760
quite a big deal changes your

00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:21,260
perspective quite a bit on life for me I

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,030
I started thinking about you know who

00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,340
who is my son going to be when he grows

00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:29,510
up and how can I help him sort of

00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:30,860
realize his dreams the second was almost

00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:33,019
as important to me but it wasn't just

00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,750
for me and that is the engine yard

00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:37,489
launched prompt and for those of you who

00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,370
don't know prompt is an initiative that

00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:42,260
we started to get people talking about

00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:44,390
mental health and to try and remove the

00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,040
stigma around talking about mental

00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,680
health because a lot of people in our

00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:54,200
community do suffer from some sort of

00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:56,000
mental illness and it's it mean it kills

00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,069
people like this the the the highest

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,019
rate of death are not in the planet is

00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:01,459
like suicide from like depression and

00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:03,680
things like this and it's because we

00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:05,420
don't talk so this was this was really

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,430
important to me and and both of these

00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,829
events had a very similar effect on me

00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:12,650
they sort of made me start to think how

00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:15,920
can I leave the planet just a little bit

00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:19,489
better than than when I got here so

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,650
Martin Luther King famously said life's

00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:24,859
most persistent and urgent question is

00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:26,959
what are you doing for others so I got

00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:29,299
involved in prompt and that's that's

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,060
been great I got more involved in PHP

00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:35,269
women I'd been part of the group since

00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:39,880
day two literally and became lead in the

00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:42,049
US and those are both been amazing but I

00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,790
felt like it wasn't enough like it's

00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:46,310
helping a small subset of people it's

00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:48,650
helping our community which I love but

00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:50,090
it doesn't help the world and let's be

00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:53,209
honest like we make up a very small

00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:54,889
percentage of people on the planet and I

00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:56,630
felt that I had a platform this is a

00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:58,459
platform I get to speak to you people

00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:01,340
and I have a skill set I've been a

00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:03,530
developer for 15 years and i hope that

00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:08,060
i'm quite competent at this point and i

00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:09,860
can do things so i wanted to

00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,569
figure out what I could do to really

00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:14,989
help people and that's what I'm going to

00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:17,000
talk to you about today so I'm going to

00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:19,040
talk about open source I'm going to talk

00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,320
about passion and love and this

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,080
community that we're a part of and I

00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,980
hope that you will go away just thinking

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,900
about things that are bigger than

00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:30,080
ourselves and kind of our jobs in our

00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,040
day-to-day lives but I'm going to start

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,770
by talking about something very familiar

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,540
to most of us which is lines of code so

00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,860
i apologize because i'm gonna ask people

00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,500
to put up their hands and have you know

00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,870
audience participation but who thinks

00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,880
they have the largest code base terms of

00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:46,490
lines of code then why don't we brave

00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,229
enough to so i hear that that facebook

00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,880
is somewhere between 10 and 50 million

00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:53,210
lines of code which is kind of

00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:58,100
incredible so who has at least a hundred

00:04:53,210 --> 00:05:02,270
thousand lines of code 200 who has more

00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:04,250
than facebook anybody all right so my

00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:06,320
biggest project ever that I worked on

00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:10,160
personally was about 330,000 lines of

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,680
code and I've done some research and

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,940
basically you're all liars so we'll go

00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:19,220
into that so who use a symphony to quite

00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:24,010
a few how many lines of code you think

00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:27,140
symfony2 has anyone want to guess I

00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:28,669
can't hear yourself so it has three

00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:35,849
hundred and eighty two thousand lines of

00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:38,099
code anyone use laravel come on

00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:40,439
I'm so laravel is actually tiny it's

00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:42,179
only ninety thousand lines of code and

00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:49,939
then my personal favorite zend framework

00:05:42,179 --> 00:05:51,629
to anyone want to guess so it's 650,000

00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:52,770
actually I thought about this I'm like

00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:54,240
that's quite a lot but they've got a few

00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,289
concrete implementations of web servers

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,389
and such I think that's where it comes

00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:59,069
from but what this means is if you're

00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:01,559
using either symphony or zend framework

00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:04,409
your code base is already as big or

00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:05,819
twice as big as my largest project and

00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:06,959
you've never even written a line of code

00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:09,809
yet right so before you even get started

00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:12,629
your project is huge but what if you go

00:06:09,809 --> 00:06:18,449
a little bit further who wants to guess

00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:20,279
how many lines of code PHP has it has

00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:23,639
about one and a half million lines of

00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:26,459
code it's quite a lot but we don't use

00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:34,139
PHP alone we use engine X or Apache

00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:38,399
maybe MySQL PostgreSQL if your web scale

00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:40,249
maybe you're using and memcache I

00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:45,209
don't know if you can see like the pixel

00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:47,129
yeah there we go just twenty two

00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:49,499
thousand lines of code this animation

00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:51,569
actually crashed my laptop to scale that

00:06:49,499 --> 00:06:55,649
big circle that big I had to do it

00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:57,029
differently but of course we can take

00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:58,229
this one step further which is that

00:06:57,029 --> 00:07:00,509
they're all sitting on top of an

00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:03,149
operating system and it's probably Linux

00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:05,099
sorry Microsoft it's probably Lennox and

00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:06,689
that sits on top of the Linux kernel so

00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:08,879
the Linux kernel is seventeen point

00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:11,339
eight million lines of code which is

00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,559
just a huge number I would not want to

00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:14,849
be maintaining that but there are some

00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:17,519
other important numbers that we should

00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:19,679
be thinking about so PHP has 224

00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:20,729
individual contributors that's people

00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:23,429
that have actually committed to the

00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:25,050
repository so they've got karma MySQL

00:07:23,429 --> 00:07:30,199
has just 28 which I find quite

00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:34,309
incredible Apache has 25 has 204

00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:39,360
postgres has 21 and memcache d has 71

00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:41,069
laravel has 526 Zen framework has 629

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,589
and symphony has over a thousand

00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:45,300
contributors and what that means is is

00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:47,479
that if your app is sitting on top of a

00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,590
standard LEM stacks or Linux engine X

00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:52,260
mysql and PHP

00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:55,080
it's made possible by over 23 million

00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:57,480
lines of code and forty eight hundred

00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,550
people is that these are kind of

00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,750
incredible things to think about as a

00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,610
side note when I was gathering all of

00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:05,610
these statistics I noticed that engine X

00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:09,360
has exactly 404 files for that was quite

00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:10,800
amusing for our web server but I decided

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,150
that this wasn't enough and I decided to

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,540
take it one step further because maybe

00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:17,130
I'm a little bit neurotic about these

00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:19,920
things but i installed ubuntu trusty

00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:21,390
server on vm and i wrote the script that

00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,010
went and got all of the source packages

00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:25,710
for everything that was installed with

00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:28,980
PHP and the lamp stack and the number

00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:32,490
that i came away with was sixty nine and

00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:34,470
a half million lines of code and then if

00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:36,840
you add to that the 1.4 million lines of

00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:40,170
code that is the PHP manual which we all

00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:42,720
use we actually another over 70 million

00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:45,090
lines of code that's what it takes to

00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:51,620
get an app before we've even written any

00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:53,940
of our code out on the internet so I

00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,740
think that we owe all of these

00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,210
contributors all of these people huge

00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,320
round of applause for all that they do

00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:00,680
for us they give it away for free

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,760
there's a bunch of us in the room today

00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,000
so random applause for all of those

00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,000
people

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:14,290
and I think we are without doubt we're

00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:15,940
standing not on the shoulders of giants

00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:17,500
which is what I got up here but we're

00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:20,250
actually at the top of a very large

00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:23,050
human pyramid better way to think of it

00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:25,120
never before in our history like of the

00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:28,839
planet we had such a readily available

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,699
body of work upon which to base our work

00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:32,860
unlike to get us forward further and

00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:34,660
quicker it would kind of be as if the

00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,769
actual pyramids had been pre built and

00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,089
they were just hanging from a crane and

00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:38,709
you just got in and sort of position

00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:41,110
them and put them down right that's

00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:46,980
where we're starting from and what do we

00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:49,360
use this for right yo app tinder

00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:52,870
instagrams for gerbils and uber for

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,490
figuring out what to eat for lunch and I

00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:58,329
think these things are fun like we laugh

00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:59,860
about it but they might improve our

00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:01,829
lives in a very small way and it's

00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,000
obviously a very first 12 thing isn't it

00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:06,060
and I think they're kind of wasting this

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,350
amazing gift that we've been given I

00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,089
think we're really privileged to have

00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:13,240
all of this open source body of work to

00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:16,149
work upon and I think that we owe it to

00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,709
ourselves and to those contributors into

00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:21,250
society to use it for something that's

00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:24,339
really meaningful so why should we care

00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:26,259
um I think that there's one thing that

00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:28,810
drives literally thousands of people

00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:31,480
over multiple decades to write millions

00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:33,009
of lines of code you know we miss family

00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,329
dinners we missed vacations we miss

00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:36,009
drinks with friends and dinners with

00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:40,600
spouses and then we give it all the way

00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:44,160
for free we're not so what drives that

00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:47,050
it's its passion and it's it's love

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,699
passion for the art of programming or

00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:50,949
the challenge or just you know an

00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:53,560
interesting technology passion for

00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:56,699
society for whatever reason that we do

00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,839
it we do it because we love to do it I

00:10:56,699 --> 00:11:00,069
really think that love is what drives us

00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,750
to participate in this living breathing

00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:06,220
organism that is open source we got a

00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,509
lot of crap fling at us you know flag

00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,500
attacks you know for open source and

00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:10,240
maintain as you know we got a lot of

00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:13,240
criticism we get a lot of entitled users

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,130
mailing list and everything else and we

00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,579
keep doing this because we love sharing

00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:21,340
these things that we love wil wheaton

00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:24,280
was once asked why it's awesome to be an

00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:26,170
and he had this to say said it's not

00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:28,930
about what you love it's about how you

00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:31,210
love it the way you love it and the way

00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:33,700
that you find other people who love that

00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:36,310
thing the way you do is what makes being

00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:38,110
a nerd awesome and the defining

00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:40,390
characteristic of us the people in this

00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:41,980
room the defining characteristic that

00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:45,040
ties us all together is that we all love

00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:49,120
things find the things that you love and

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,470
you love them the most that you can so

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,200
for me the thing that I love is I love

00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:55,450
to teach doesn't matter if it's up here

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,800
on stage at a conference or I'm standing

00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:59,530
front of a user group or doing it

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,140
remotely Vyra hang out blog post podcast

00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:05,050
it doesn't matter I love teaching and I

00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:06,750
also genuinely love this community it's

00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:09,790
been there for me for almost two decades

00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:11,700
I really think that this community has

00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:14,440
enabled me to get where I am today

00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:17,230
moving to the United States getting

00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,760
married twice adopting my son working at

00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,260
engine yard and being on this stage

00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:25,420
right now is all because of this

00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:30,700
community so for me I call this my

00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:33,550
family I love you guys so my first

00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:37,420
mentor Joey Smith goes my tml on

00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:38,740
freenode I met him at 16 years old and I

00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,670
actually got to meet him in person for

00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:45,460
the first time last May it was amazing

00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:47,170
and then after that I moved to America

00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,900
and my wife had lost her job I wasn't

00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:50,980
able to work I didn't have my visa and

00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:53,230
when I did get my visa right blogged

00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,850
about it and this guy Rob Richards he's

00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:58,120
the guy who created all things XML and

00:12:54,850 --> 00:13:01,080
php5 he emailed me and he said another

00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:04,090
job they kind of dicks but they pay well

00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:06,250
so I went and I interviewed and I had

00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:10,900
the job on that Thursday and I was there

00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:13,210
for six and a half years so in 2006 my

00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:15,400
my first wife passed away and I pretty

00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:16,810
much dropped out of the community but

00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,130
despite that the members of the

00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:21,010
community came and they found me and

00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:23,200
they helped me people like Elizabeth

00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:25,750
Smith and Sara Gorman than my internals

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,940
mentors Elizabeth narramore who I

00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:31,420
consider my community in my life mentor

00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:33,279
and Beth tuck along who's here today she

00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:36,550
sort of my writing mental

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:39,790
matthew thailand he's one up one of my

00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:42,160
many code mentors my co-author ven

00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:43,720
Ramsey he stepped up because I couldn't

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,699
and he wrote the second revision of

00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,810
these n certification study guide the

00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:49,089
third version of which came out last

00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:52,480
week we're giving one away I'm really

00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:54,970
proud of it and then the guy here turmel

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,980
is my mysql mental and she actually went

00:13:54,970 --> 00:14:02,139
on to be the best man at my second

00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:04,449
wedding and last wedding so even today

00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:07,180
it's still helping me like this is not

00:14:04,449 --> 00:14:09,759
something that stops so last year at PHP

00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:12,360
tech engineered sponsored the mental

00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:14,649
health summit prompt an engine yard and

00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,300
Paddy foreign gave a very passionate

00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:19,389
monologue about living with depression

00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:21,689
and it struck a chord with me and four

00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:24,430
months later I finally started therapy

00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:25,930
which by the way is amazing you pay

00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,670
somebody like a little bit of money and

00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:33,910
they can't tell you to shut up for an

00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:37,899
hour right so um right now oh that's my

00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:40,059
therapist so right now I'm trying to

00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:42,040
lose weight so that's one of the reasons

00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:47,439
I'm facing the stage my phone is

00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:51,790
counting every step okay but it's not

00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:52,959
just me last year Cal Evans a lot of you

00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,480
probably have heard of the great kyle

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,339
evans set up a collection to try and

00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,050
raise funds to bring a guy we all know

00:14:57,339 --> 00:15:01,269
as seven PHP because nobody can say his

00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:03,189
real name wanted to bring him off his

00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:04,750
tiny island of Mauritius which is if you

00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:06,639
don't know off the coast of Madagascar

00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:09,189
which is itself a tiny island off the

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,870
coast of Africa and we wanted to bring

00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:13,750
him to sunshine PHP which was this last

00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:16,420
februari in Miami and as you can see we

00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:18,579
managed to meet we got in there and this

00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:21,279
is just one of many stories that happen

00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:23,170
in this community we got together and we

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,059
bought a one-handed keyboard for a

00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:27,790
disabled member of our community and she

00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:31,779
now types at 90 words per minute with

00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:33,910
one hand one of our community members

00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:36,459
lost his unborn daughter and we made a

00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:38,170
memorial for her and a new internals

00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:39,879
contributor we brought her into a very

00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:43,079
first conference at PHP Northwest in

00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:43,079
October this last year

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,930
you may remember back in 2004 there was

00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:54,259
a tsunami that hit Indonesia and it

00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:56,839
killed 225,000 and displaced 1.7 million

00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:59,389
people and within hours of that

00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:02,000
happening a web app sprung up and

00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:04,519
specifically a PHP web app and it was

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,709
written to help people find displaced

00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:09,769
family members and I was so incredibly

00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:10,939
proud that they used PHP because this is

00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:14,889
the language that I've had some very

00:16:10,939 --> 00:16:17,870
tiny insignificant part in building and

00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:21,980
it's something that really made a

00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:23,420
meaningful impact in people's lives so

00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,639
every person in this room who has

00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:27,230
contributed to peuterey internals to the

00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:29,569
documentation any open source project

00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:32,300
any person who has been a mentor written

00:16:29,569 --> 00:16:35,240
a blog post of article PHP architect or

00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:37,040
is in any way contributed this to this

00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,600
community we should all be very proud of

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,889
the fact because it isn't just the

00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,810
people that write the C code on the

00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:45,110
internals it's all of us that make this

00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:46,939
possible and just like those people I

00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:49,850
believe that the challenges that we face

00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:51,829
on this technology solve by technology i

00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:53,480
really think that every problem that we

00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:55,279
face in this world can be solved by the

00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,170
application of technology and not web

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,360
technology of course in every case but

00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:00,920
technology is the answer to all of our

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,449
problems and I mean real things like

00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:06,650
world hunger or animal extinction hey

00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:09,439
and I'm not the only one I thought that

00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:10,850
would go a lot better i'm sorry i'm not

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,669
the only one that feels this way though

00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:15,559
in recent years has been the growth of a

00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:18,770
new kind of cooperation the benefit

00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:21,199
corporation will be corpse and unlike

00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:23,510
traditional LLC or ltd tech corporations

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,860
which these companies still are being a

00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:28,130
B Corp actually just means being

00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:30,470
certified in that your company pledges

00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:33,169
to do and be good for the world and

00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:35,450
every company that signs up signs a

00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:37,130
declaration of interdependence sounds

00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:39,890
very American but it's not which holds

00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:41,659
these truths self-evident that we must

00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:44,299
be the change that we seek in the world

00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:47,299
that all business ought to be conducted

00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:49,010
as if people and place mattered and that

00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:51,740
through their products practices and

00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:54,860
profits businesses should aspire to do

00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:57,840
no harm and benefit all and finally that

00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:59,730
to do so requires that we act with

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,279
understanding that we are each dependent

00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:05,419
upon each other and others responsible

00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:09,809
for each other and future generations

00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:12,090
over 900 companies in 29 countries are

00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:17,100
now participating including one large

00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:19,080
PHP shop which is etsy so etsy supports

00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,539
a community of micro enterprises and

00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:24,270
they allow underprivileged people access

00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:26,760
to a global marketplace and by doing

00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:29,130
that it allows creators to sell directly

00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,020
cutting out the middleman and they can

00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:32,010
undercut because the middle men usually

00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,960
makes all the money but now they're

00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,909
selling directly so they can undercut

00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,520
but they're still making more money than

00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:40,919
they ever did before and it's a huge

00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:44,580
change to their quality of life they can

00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:46,649
really make a proper living wage but at

00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:49,380
C&B corpse are not the only ones

00:18:46,649 --> 00:18:51,860
participating in response to superstorm

00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:54,779
sandy that hit the east coast in 2012

00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:57,570
Airbnb created a disaster response at

00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:59,880
all and it could be activated within 30

00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:04,380
minutes of some sort of natural disaster

00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:07,200
and since 2012 this tool has been used

00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:09,529
in numerous places to allow hosts to put

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,760
up their rooms for free and air B&B

00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:13,110
doesn't take their cut and people can

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,210
stay and find somewhere to stay when

00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:17,640
they've been this place and it's been

00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:21,029
used in San Diego and they had major

00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:22,850
fires Serbia Bosnia and Croatia for

00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:25,980
people affected by the Balkan floods

00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:27,919
London Sardinia in Colorado after

00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,270
serious flooding hit those regions

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:33,059
kefalonia after an earthquake hit the

00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:34,770
island Toronto in Atlanta which is just

00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:37,049
north of me when they were hit by severe

00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:41,429
ice storms and the Philippines following

00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:44,690
typhoon Haiyan another great example is

00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:47,100
ibm's big data for social good challenge

00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:49,080
it invites developers and data

00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:52,440
enthusiasts to take a deep dive into

00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:55,500
real-world Civic data sets using IBM s

00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,390
Hadoop and analytic service and you can

00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,830
supply your own data set or you can use

00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:01,500
one that they provide for you like

00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:05,270
information on the Ebola outbreaks us

00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,270
traffic light data and bike share data

00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:11,490
so most of us work with first world

00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:14,670
problems but what if we look at the real

00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:17,520
issues that our planet faces so EF

00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:20,310
schumacher wrote the poor can be helped

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,780
to help themselves but only by making

00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:23,850
available to them a technology that

00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:27,270
recognizes the economic boundaries and

00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:28,680
limitations of poverty and what this

00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:30,780
means is that when we're looking at

00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,280
these kind of third world issues we have

00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:35,970
to attack them using readily available

00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:38,340
local technologies so to help a farmer

00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:40,860
we could drop this wonderful tractor in

00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:42,240
his field off one day but honestly it's

00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,470
only gonna be about as powerful assuming

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,360
he could even figure out how to use the

00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:47,640
thing it's only going to be useful to

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:51,390
him for about as long as the gas in the

00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:54,840
tank is they're right but if you give

00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:56,490
them an ox and a plow this is a

00:20:54,840 --> 00:21:00,900
technology that is sustainable and

00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:02,310
maintainable for the locale so who can

00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:05,660
tell me what the most popular cell phone

00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:11,070
on the planet is I'll give you a him

00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:16,620
doesn't have this logo or this one as

00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:19,020
this one so doesn't have a four inch

00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:23,730
touchscreen as a four line text green

00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:26,190
and it is the nokia 1100 and it's

00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:28,050
popular because the battery life lasts

00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:32,100
for weeks and it's durable and it's

00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:33,420
cheap and it's tough as well a nokia it

00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,040
also includes a flashlight which is

00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:37,290
incredibly indispensable in places that

00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:41,040
don't have access to consistent and

00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:43,830
available electricity so over half a

00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:47,940
billion of these devices have sold since

00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:49,050
it was created in 2003 you may have

00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,670
heard a couple of months ago Microsoft

00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:52,830
announced a new phone amid a very big

00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:54,360
splash about it was the new $27 phone I

00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:57,950
think I was Australian dollars which is

00:21:54,360 --> 00:22:01,050
like nothing which was the Nokia 130 and

00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:02,190
this is the first new phone since 2003

00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:04,380
that has actually had a shot at

00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:06,630
replacing this phone as the most popular

00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:11,250
phone on the planet and it's barely even

00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:13,680
a feature phone so it has this is it it

00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:16,310
has an FM radio it has video playback

00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:19,420
but it can't do images like still images

00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:22,240
find that odd and

00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:29,140
has a flashlight stuff doesn't have a

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:31,750
web browser can't do mms so this is a

00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:33,430
picture of every single device that is

00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:36,640
connected to the internet at the time

00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:39,100
this was made and according to 2011

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,650
research only 13 and a half percent or

00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:43,120
150 million Africans have access to the

00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:45,160
internet that's about six percent of

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,510
their population when you compare that

00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:49,110
to developed countries we're at about

00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:53,080
seventy three percent that's a huge gap

00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:54,820
and you look at this and go well

00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,840
obviously web pages are not how we're

00:22:54,820 --> 00:23:00,310
going to reach these people they don't

00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:05,170
have access but in 2014 770 million

00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:06,100
Africans activated cell phones that

00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:08,560
means about seventy percent of the

00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,760
population has a cell phone so what that

00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,500
means is if you want to solve problems

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,780
in third world countries like those in

00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:16,390
Africa you're not going to do it with

00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:18,160
web pages but you might might be able to

00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:22,570
do it with text messages because you'll

00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:24,550
have access to those SMS is huge yes

00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:27,490
it's going to bring entirely different

00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:29,560
problems in terms of usability and with

00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:32,440
but it is possible I believe it's

00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:35,010
possible there's also a great example of

00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:37,330
using locally available resources

00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:39,940
alright so what can you do like what

00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:40,990
what practically can you do so I look to

00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,070
some real world problems and it came up

00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:44,350
with some ideas I don't know if they're

00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:46,300
any good but these are real so

00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:48,370
approximately every 15 minutes an

00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:51,130
elephant is killed by poachers that

00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:54,450
means that by 2011 they could be extinct

00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:56,920
sorry in 11 years they could be extinct

00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:58,810
so can you imagine an app that allowed

00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:01,390
people to text the authorities in real

00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:03,220
time about the location of poachers this

00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:06,480
is an actual possible thing that we

00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,480
could do and it would be fairly trivial

00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:10,540
every day eight hundred and forty

00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:14,140
thousand people die from water-related

00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:16,990
diseases what if you could blast out a

00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:18,850
warning via text message to a village of

00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:21,610
people to tell them that their water

00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:23,260
resource has been polluted that today is

00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:24,700
not safe to drink or make sure you use

00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:27,670
your tablets or whatever filtering

00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:29,100
you're half right and every year one and

00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:31,389
a half a million children die from

00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:33,399
vaccine-preventable diseases

00:24:31,389 --> 00:24:35,499
and the big problem actually with this

00:24:33,399 --> 00:24:37,269
is not that the vaccines aren't even

00:24:35,499 --> 00:24:39,639
available is that we can't disperse them

00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:42,219
it's very hard so what if you could text

00:24:39,639 --> 00:24:44,049
a mother and say hey there are vaccines

00:24:42,219 --> 00:24:46,779
available within a day's walk of where

00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:49,629
you are take your kids we can reach a

00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:53,129
lot more people that way and these are

00:24:49,629 --> 00:24:56,859
things that can really change the world

00:24:53,129 --> 00:24:59,009
so our fully admit that I don't know all

00:24:56,859 --> 00:25:03,059
the problems never mind the solutions

00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:05,109
part of our jobs is to ask questions

00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:07,119
make the tools and the learning

00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:10,929
resources available and to help these

00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:13,200
people help themselves how many of you

00:25:10,929 --> 00:25:15,339
when I was describing those three

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,509
actionable things thought I could I

00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:21,269
could really do that I could go home and

00:25:16,509 --> 00:25:27,329
do that right now what's stopping you

00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:27,329
get out there and change the world thank

00:25:38,659 --> 00:25:40,720
