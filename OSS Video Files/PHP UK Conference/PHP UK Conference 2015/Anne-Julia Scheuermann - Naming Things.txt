Publication date: 2015-04-02
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2015
Description: 
	For us developers it is a constant struggle to find the right words to describe things. Naming classes, functions and variables correctly and giving them context helps to create a meaning, and to convey that meaning to other developers. In this talk we will discuss guidelines to find good names for the building blocks we use, to aid in our daily challenge to transport our knowledge by leveraging well worded sourcecode.
