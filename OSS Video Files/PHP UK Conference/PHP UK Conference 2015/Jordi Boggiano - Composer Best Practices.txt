Description: 
	Composer has grown into the de-facto standard PHP dependency manager. While we struggle to make it easy to use, mastering dependency management and packaging in general remains tricky. In this session you will learn how to leverage Composer version constraints, grasp stabilities and semantic versioning along with a few more tips on being a good OSS citizen. You should already be comfortable with Composer basics and eager to learn about it some more.
