Title: Ben Waine  - My Debugging And Performance Toolbox
Publication date: 2015-04-02
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2015
Description: 
	In addition to PHP I use a number of tools on a day to day basis to debug and QA my work. This talk is an opinionated overview and live demo of these tools, what they do and how they fit together. The tools I'll be demoing are: Charles Proxy, XDebug, Xhprof and JMeter. I will also demo integrating these with Behat and PHPUnit. The aim of the talk is to show that by using testing, a proxy and Xdebug an engineer can get to the bottom of most PHP problems very quickly. Building on this approach using testing, Xhprof and JMeter it's possible to understand the performance characteristics of your code at scale.
