you

00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:16,949
good morning the would-be public speaker

00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:20,580
finds guidance in the Talmud place can

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:24,990
be avoided Sonia open by honoring the

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:27,269
host it would be remiss not to begin by

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,710
publicly acknowledging the tremendous

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:32,579
effort that an event of this magnitude

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:36,090
requires from the organizers volunteers

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:38,640
and sponsors what makes this event

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,630
unique however is the tremendous care

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,120
that Joanna and her team put in as well

00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:47,580
from the initial email telling me that

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,120
you're going to London it was

00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:55,760
exceedingly obvious that everyone is

00:00:51,120 --> 00:01:00,330
fully fully invested in making PHP UK

00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:03,060
truly a special event friends I think

00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:05,309
you're in for a real treat I'd like to

00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,830
also take this opportunity to thank the

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:10,109
organizers for inviting me to

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:13,710
participate in this very special way

00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:18,450
it's an honor to be here with you I'm

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:22,560
humbled and you have my appreciation the

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:26,609
Talmud observes a melon Liam a sovereign

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,579
does not rule without a populace and

00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:32,549
while I would be the last to compare a

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:36,200
public speaker to a king the fact of the

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:40,469
matter is that without an audience I'm

00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,749
just a guy up here talking to himself so

00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:44,880
I'd like to thank each of you for

00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:49,139
joining me this morning and entrusting

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,399
me with your time and your attention for

00:01:49,139 --> 00:01:51,959
those of you who may not know me as

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,560
Joanna said my name is gets will

00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:59,369
rough but if it's easier for you you can

00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:03,509
call me just yet I've found that that

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:06,479
tends to keep me dryer you might be more

00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:09,990
familiar with me as code rabbi for I

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,120
spends all too much time in all of the

00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:17,400
obvious places on the internet hiding

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:18,720
behind this guy I build stuff and in the

00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,140
past few years I've been fortunate

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,780
enough

00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:26,459
that others have asked me to help them

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:29,850
build stuff but it wasn't always this

00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:33,569
way software development is actually my

00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:36,209
third career following college I found

00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:39,060
myself running the hamster wheel of

00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:43,470
Corporate America where I worked for

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:46,260
this guy and that continued somewhat

00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:49,140
predictably for several years until one

00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:52,170
day I decided that I was spiritually

00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,850
impoverished I promptly resigned sold

00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:56,970
everything I owned at a massive garage

00:02:53,850 --> 00:03:00,060
sale I moved to Jerusalem and I enrolled

00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:03,930
in yeshiva a traditional Talmudic

00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:08,700
Academy rebenok Oh school where I began

00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:10,980
working for this guy now in case you're

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,989
vague at this point about the Talmud the

00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,720
Talmud is the written record of the

00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:17,310
conversations of the ancient sages

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,350
serving as the primary repository for

00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,600
the law legend and lore of the Jewish

00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:24,720
people and it's the essential focus of

00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:27,360
rabbinic scholarship as for me

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,590
ultimately I returned to America and I

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,709
was fortunate enough to spend over a

00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:37,910
decade in full-time talmud study until i

00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:42,329
came to the slow realization that i was

00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:43,890
financially impoverished now a computer

00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:46,440
had been part of my life since my mother

00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:48,540
sent me to a college for Kids program at

00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,150
a local business school when I was eight

00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:53,220
where I learned rudimentary program at

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:56,790
basic programming on the trs-80 model

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:59,340
one so faced with the prospect of

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:02,130
leaving rabbinical school and really

00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,110
with little in the way of options I made

00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:10,290
the decision to begin working for this

00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:12,750
guy as a software developer now I have

00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:17,600
to tell you about this guy working for

00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:21,060
him is not so simple high expectations

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:25,229
limited background no formal training

00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:29,300
and perhaps worst of all beginning in my

00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:32,630
30s squarely behind the financial 8-ball

00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:34,920
zero margin for error

00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:37,650
now almost immediately I recognize

00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:41,460
parallels between software development

00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:44,250
and Talmudic study the Talmud escribes

00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:47,490
rabbinic analysis as maven da varmitech

00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:51,420
d'ivoire understanding one thing from

00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:55,530
within another teasing out abstractions

00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:57,870
from concretions both disciplines are

00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:00,150
highly analytic in nature yet also

00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:03,420
possess an undeniable creative component

00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:06,740
as well both require extended periods

00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:10,610
with high cognitive load and often in

00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:14,360
incredible ability to maintain context

00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:17,910
interestingly I also found that both our

00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:21,630
vocations whose practitioners also

00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:23,790
pursue them as vacations you'll very

00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:27,030
often see someone come home after a long

00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:30,420
day at toiling in their craft only to

00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:32,970
relax by engaging in an activity very

00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:35,850
very similar to that which consumed

00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:37,470
their day now recognizing these

00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:39,870
similarities when faced with challenges

00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:42,090
as a growing software developer my

00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,920
instinct was to look to the insights and

00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:47,190
experiences that I gained in rabbinical

00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:49,410
school for guidance now perhaps

00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:52,020
surprisingly I found that the analogy

00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:55,650
between the disciplines it was more than

00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:58,500
merely superficial that the wisdom of

00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:01,590
the sages could be readily translated

00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:04,380
into relevant and practical advice for

00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:06,630
the software developer ultimately I

00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,930
found what serves as the title for our

00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:11,900
conversation this morning that

00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:16,470
everything that I really needed to know

00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:18,270
has learned in rabbinical school now if

00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:21,060
you're wondering at this point and fair

00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:25,440
enough what to expect this morning our

00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:29,730
session is primarily about advice after

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:32,070
all why else do you visit the rabbi in

00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:35,010
the next 30 minutes I hope to share with

00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:37,830
you my experiences the wisdom of the

00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:40,320
sages as I've been able to apply it to

00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:44,210
grow as a software developer what the

00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:46,080
Talmud calls yawn yawn become confident

00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:50,400
aged wine

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:54,229
in New flasks classic wisdom but with

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:58,280
novel application let's begin shall we

00:06:54,229 --> 00:07:01,800
the sage Yeshua been prophet advises

00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:05,389
asada Rev but kind of the hawk

00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:10,229
father cultivate for yourself a mentor

00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:12,419
acquire for yourself a colleague the

00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:14,629
wisdom of the sages advice and its

00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:18,690
application to the challenges we face

00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:22,889
should be evident our growth as software

00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:24,960
developers is a journey and what journey

00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:28,250
isn't enhanced by the counsel of a

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:32,669
wizened guide and the Fellowship of

00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:36,629
trusted companions cultivate for

00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:40,169
yourself a mentor we work in an industry

00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:43,650
where the domain knowledge required to

00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:48,300
function at a high level is so vast and

00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:50,729
so fast changing that a Gladwell Yin

00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:53,370
10,000 hours approach to its acquisition

00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:56,759
it isn't merely inefficient it's

00:07:53,370 --> 00:08:00,979
impossible we really who has time for

00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:03,930
that the single most effective way to

00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:07,650
accelerate that learning curve is to

00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:10,349
receive meaningful timely and personal

00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:15,419
guidance from someone who has tried that

00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:19,440
path before young craftsman they learn

00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:22,560
from journeyman doctors they serve as

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,889
interns for many years before practicing

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:29,129
on their own and this next one gets me

00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:33,089
every time professional golfers even

00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:37,019
have swing coaches why should our

00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:38,399
discipline be any different fortunately

00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:40,440
in our community we do have an

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,539
incredible resource which connects

00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:48,449
willing mentors with potential

00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:51,690
apprentices PHP mentoring org I've taken

00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:54,690
advantage of the initiative twice as an

00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:57,120
apprentice and both were very powerful

00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:59,190
experiences which made an immediate and

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,380
measurable impact on my proficiency as a

00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:03,610
developer and

00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:08,480
now a few years later looking back

00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:12,640
accelerated my growth tremendously note

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:17,210
however the language cultivate a mentor

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:20,270
know that the very best mentors like

00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:23,690
Yoda here they aren't always openly

00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:26,030
looking to take on an apprentice likely

00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:28,580
because they understand the tremendous

00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:30,560
commitment involved taking partial

00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:33,680
responsibility for the growth and

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,560
success of another incredible irony

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,600
though is that the same appreciation for

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,720
the weight of the undertaking that makes

00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:45,650
them reluctant is also what makes their

00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:48,320
mentorship so valuable the simple recipe

00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:52,840
from enter cultivation involves just

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:56,270
three steps identify potential mentors

00:09:52,840 --> 00:10:00,170
interact and grow your relationship with

00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:04,160
them and take initiative identify

00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:05,930
interact initiate in all likelihood you

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:10,090
already have relationships with

00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:12,230
potential mentors a seasoned teammate

00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:14,210
someone who you know your local user

00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:17,510
group or have worked with on an open

00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:20,480
source project someone you perhaps met

00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:23,980
at a conference once you've identified

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:28,970
them grow your interaction with them

00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:32,750
chat them up ask them questions do it

00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:34,940
again and then do it again once you've

00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:39,470
established a history of going to them

00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:41,810
for advice this is the tricky part we

00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:45,460
have to extend yourself ask them if they

00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:49,310
consider formalizing the relationship

00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:51,620
yeah it takes courage but you would be

00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:55,040
amazed and how frequently it's

00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:57,710
successful that language cultivate a

00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:01,730
mentor it also implies that a mentoring

00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:04,850
relationship need not be formal nor does

00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:07,930
it need to be exclusive I'm constantly

00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:11,510
cultivating ad-hoc mentors for myself

00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:13,649
always on the lookout for people that

00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:16,199
have the knowledge and the disposition

00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:19,079
to serve as personal subject matter

00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:22,019
experts that I can call on if I need

00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:24,269
guidance in a particular area most of

00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:26,790
them they're not even aware of it but

00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:31,019
they're stored in my mental rolodex of

00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:35,600
who to call in case of emergency there

00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:39,569
are quite a few in this room right now

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,939
my friend Gary hakan recently tweeted

00:11:39,569 --> 00:11:44,040
this about his interaction with Mark

00:11:41,939 --> 00:11:46,889
Oprah vetta over some questions that he

00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:51,569
had regarding doctrine the amazing thing

00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:53,550
here it's not that Marco gave Gary 30

00:11:51,569 --> 00:11:56,160
minutes of his time just because Gary

00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:57,540
asked know you'll quickly learn that

00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,100
that's the rule rather than the

00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:01,679
exception with members of the open

00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:08,730
source community the amazing part is

00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:11,999
that Gary asked yeah Gary gets in the

00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:15,959
value of a mentor even a mentor for a

00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:18,360
minute is immeasurable so whether you

00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:21,480
apprentice yourself formerly either via

00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:25,230
PHP mentoring org or the old-fashioned

00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:27,929
way or you cultivate fields of ad hoc

00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:31,019
mentors they're not mutually exclusive I

00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:33,029
suggest you do both the primary takeaway

00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:36,120
is that there are people out there who

00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:39,360
are able and far more cases than you

00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,999
think willing many times very very

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,449
willing to help you accelerate your

00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:49,670
growth as a software developer simply

00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:49,670
negligent not to take advantage of them

00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:56,399
acquire for yourself a colleague the

00:12:54,029 --> 00:13:00,360
pairing of this advice with that of

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:02,429
cultivating a mentor is significant it

00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,040
means that the key takeaway from the

00:13:02,429 --> 00:13:08,220
sages direction is to view people as

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,920
your most important resources now that's

00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:13,829
perhaps more obvious in the case of a

00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:16,350
mentor but we mustn't underestimate the

00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:18,420
value of strong relationships and

00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:20,910
meaningful interactions with our fellow

00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:24,420
developers in terms of advancing our

00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:26,200
personal growth one way that this can

00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:31,630
manifest

00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:34,330
is via pair coding yeah the technical

00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:37,270
benefits of pair programming aside the

00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:39,540
opportunity to mind-meld with another

00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:42,520
developer over an implementation is

00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:45,070
incredibly incredibly powerful to

00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:47,830
experience firsthand and in real time

00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:50,500
how another developer analyzes a problem

00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:52,510
breaks it into manageable parts the

00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:55,420
decisions and trade-offs that they make

00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:57,970
when implementing a solution the benefit

00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:03,070
of this sort of direct cross-pollination

00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:07,470
is immeasurable whether it's a new

00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:12,400
algorithm a debugging technique maybe an

00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:15,430
expanded naming vocabulary even helpful

00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:18,610
keyboard shortcuts for your IDE it's

00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:21,100
difficult to pair at any level and not

00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:23,200
walk away from the experience having

00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:27,310
integrated something new and valuable

00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:30,990
into your practice now the most obvious

00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:33,610
place to pair code remains the workplace

00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:36,010
everyone is in the same place at the

00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:40,510
same time and working on the same things

00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:43,600
I understand that's not an easy sell but

00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:45,790
know that even occasional pair coding

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:49,420
can be tremendously beneficial for your

00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:53,290
teams whether as a way to onboard new

00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:56,200
developers or to diffuse tribal

00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:59,290
knowledge throughout the team you

00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:01,240
increase your bust factor perhaps as a

00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:03,940
force multiplier allowing junior

00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,500
developers to easily leverage the

00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:09,010
knowledge and experience of those more

00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:12,730
senior your teams should be pairing in

00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:14,590
at least some fashion now if you're

00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:18,010
unable to introduce even occasional

00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:19,930
pairing to your team perhaps your local

00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:23,530
user group is an excellent place to

00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:26,920
start pair programming night is a

00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:29,770
fantastic recurring activity for a user

00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:33,280
group what about open source

00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:35,260
collaborators I am sure that there are

00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:38,020
people who contribute regularly to the

00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:39,520
same projects that you do who would be

00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:42,070
thrilled with

00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:46,090
the idea of remote pairing on a feature

00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:48,430
or two if only it was suggested perhaps

00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:51,810
approach someone here about pairing

00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:51,810
during the conference's hackathon

00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:57,850
Marcelo Jacob asst even posted an

00:15:55,570 --> 00:16:03,180
invitation to pair open invitation on

00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:07,860
PHP mentoring org I don't know Marcelo

00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:12,850
but Marcelo gets it there is power in

00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:16,210
pairs now if you're unable to pair with

00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:20,530
a colleague perhaps the next best thing

00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:22,930
is to engage in regular code review I'm

00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:25,960
sure that most of you have some sort of

00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:28,510
code review process in the workplace but

00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:34,180
how many of you engage in regular code

00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:37,360
review outside of the workplace ask that

00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:41,590
question a lot and I find that it's a

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:45,880
very very small percentage think about

00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:50,290
it for a moment our employers are more

00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:55,570
heavily invested in code review than we

00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:57,820
are not entirely surprised the fallacy

00:16:55,570 --> 00:17:00,490
of viewing code review merely as a

00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:05,250
mechanism for enforcing coding standards

00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:08,020
or protecting the build is a common one

00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:10,600
the fact of the matter however is that

00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:14,170
those are at best ten gentle benefits to

00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:16,330
the practice of code review yeah the

00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:21,040
primary beneficiary of code review is

00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:22,480
the coder rather than the code and if

00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,839
you're not engaging in regular code

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,760
review both inside and outside the

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,370
workplace you're missing an excellent

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,410
excellent opportunity for growth both

00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:34,840
the process of having your code reviewed

00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:37,690
by appear and by reviewing another's

00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:39,040
code regularly offers considerable

00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:43,840
leverage in terms of growing your

00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:46,900
tactical skills as a developer find a

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,570
code review buddy offer to review the

00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:52,690
code of someone else if they'll return

00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:53,580
the favor approach them on your local

00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,960
user group

00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:58,539
someone who contributes the same open

00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,890
source projects that you do someone you

00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:05,710
know from an IRC chat room will wherever

00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:07,990
my friend yet Schaffer he recently even

00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:12,539
went so far as to tweet an open offer to

00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:16,120
review other people's code it's cats it

00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:18,880
he recognizes the code review benefits

00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:22,059
the reviewer as much as the review II

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,890
and he took the initiative to put

00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:27,760
himself in a place where he would be

00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:30,760
able to engage in more of it side

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,130
projects another fantastic opportunity

00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,980
to leverage your peer relationships to

00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:39,640
foster your growth the next time you

00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:42,340
begin a side project resist the urge to

00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,640
work on it alone or to invite

00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:49,000
contributions from the greater community

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:53,500
instead invite just one or two others to

00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:56,400
work with you closely on it perhaps form

00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:59,470
a learning group with view of your peers

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,990
my friend Jeff Carruth co-host of the

00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:04,419
loosely coupled podcasts he's currently

00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:08,100
organizing the second iteration of the

00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:10,870
dev look Club a bi-monthly discussion

00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:13,960
focused on key software texts using

00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:15,549
Google Hangouts it's been a tremendous

00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:19,179
tremendous learning experience for

00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:23,110
everyone involved in the group Jeff gets

00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:26,380
it hence these groups they need even be

00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:28,390
ongoing my friend Sean McCool over the

00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:31,809
past few months has initiated a number

00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:35,530
of ad hoc topic focused hangouts very

00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:40,720
much like the open spaces gatherings at

00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:43,120
conferences Sean gets it and know that

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,450
the power of peers it's not limited to

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:49,840
learning my friendly chengam the author

00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:51,610
of the excellent 11 k io newsletter he

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:58,960
looked to leverage a peer relationship

00:19:51,610 --> 00:20:01,659
for accountability Lee gets it the

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,809
possibilities they're literally endless

00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:06,179
but it all begins with your viewing your

00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:11,850
peers

00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:13,980
as valuable resources the Talmudic say

00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:17,850
drew Bethany nuh reflects harborough

00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:21,389
maritima rabasa much have I learned for

00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:24,629
my mentors umma kuvira yo sir mera voice

00:20:21,389 --> 00:20:28,379
I and more for my colleagues then from

00:20:24,629 --> 00:20:31,950
my mentors who me tell me die yo sir

00:20:28,379 --> 00:20:34,769
michael on and from my students more

00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:37,080
than all of them here the sage

00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:39,240
recognizes the benefit of both

00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:42,600
cultivating a mentor and of acquiring a

00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:45,179
colleague but suggests that even more

00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:53,999
empowering is sharing your knowledge

00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:56,220
with others look familiar every one of

00:20:53,999 --> 00:20:59,159
you should be listed at PHP mentoring

00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:03,119
org and actively looking for an

00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:09,710
apprentice not because it's a great way

00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:13,080
to give back to the community it is but

00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:15,059
more because it'll impact your growth as

00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:18,330
positively as it does that of your

00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:22,679
apprentice see the Talmud instructs the

00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:26,190
teacher conical anar LP darkly teach the

00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:28,289
student according to their way if one

00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:31,049
wishes to truly reach a student to make

00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:34,230
a connection perforce they must speak in

00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:37,980
the students vernacular now the wisdom

00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:41,340
here isn't merely prescriptive but

00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:44,549
descriptive as well the process of

00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:47,100
teaching another causes you to view the

00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:49,710
material as they would which opens your

00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:52,740
mind to new insights and greater

00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:53,909
understanding and don't think that

00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:57,389
you've got nothing to offer an

00:21:53,909 --> 00:22:00,960
apprentice know that by being here today

00:21:57,389 --> 00:22:05,369
at an international PHP conference by

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:09,299
attending this session you are the one

00:22:05,369 --> 00:22:11,940
percent the people you see and interact

00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:16,340
with here this weekend and I'm talking

00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:20,000
about attendees as well as presenters

00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:23,460
they're not the PHP community

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,880
they are the leaders of the PHP

00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:31,290
community and that includes each and

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:33,690
every one of you you know far more than

00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:35,940
you think you know and sharing that

00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:40,559
knowledge with others will advance your

00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:43,049
knowledge even further now if formal

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,210
mentoring isn't for you perhaps invite a

00:22:43,049 --> 00:22:49,200
junior developer to work closely with

00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:51,590
you on a side project maybe prepare a

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,990
presentation for your local user group

00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:57,720
submit it to a conference you'd be

00:22:54,990 --> 00:23:01,440
amazed how much you gain simply from the

00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,910
process of preparation my friend Eric

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,570
Hogue tweeted this a few months ago

00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:08,280
about the amazing side benefit of

00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:10,530
growing his own understanding while

00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:16,140
preparing a talk for November's True

00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:18,570
North PHP Eric Gatson if public speaking

00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:22,710
isn't your thing consider writing

00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:25,080
instead the same phenomenon exists you

00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:27,960
will be the primary beneficiary of the

00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:31,950
process submit an article to PHP

00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:35,880
architect start a blog if you have a

00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:38,070
blog blog more even put some ideas

00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:41,070
together in a github gist and share it

00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:44,910
publicly for discussion if you're

00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:46,890
ambitious write a book yeah my friend

00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:48,990
matt frost the other co-host of the

00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:51,650
loosely coupled podcast he recently

00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:54,000
completed work on a book on o auth and

00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:57,150
Matt would tell you he'd be the first to

00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:01,730
tell you that he was not an OAuth guru

00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:09,360
when he started nor was he a writer

00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:13,290
today 10 months later he's both at gets

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:15,650
it the possibilities are limited only by

00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:17,850
your creativity and your inhibitions

00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:21,419
learn from your mentors and your

00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:26,010
colleagues but grow the most by sharing

00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:27,179
your knowledge with others the talent

00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:31,410
takes the existence of a vibrant

00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:33,450
community pretty much for granted even

00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:37,080
going so far as to suggest that

00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:41,549
real learning doesn't exist ellaby

00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:44,269
kabura but as part of a group the sage

00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:50,159
Shimon benzema taught is a hookah home

00:24:44,269 --> 00:24:53,250
hallo mede McCollum who is wise one who

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:56,309
learns from everyone this is another

00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:58,889
maxim which is both descriptive as well

00:24:56,309 --> 00:25:01,049
as prescriptive it's traditionally

00:24:58,889 --> 00:25:02,970
understood as a prescription to view

00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:05,220
everyone you encounter as having

00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:08,549
something to contribute and that's

00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:10,860
incredible advice on its own but I think

00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:14,010
that it can also be understood as a

00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:17,720
description of the wise approach to

00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:22,740
knowledge acquisition crowdsourcing

00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:27,360
learning from everyone you're already at

00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:30,830
a conference that's a big one if this is

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:35,279
your first conference congratulations

00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:39,419
soak it up and come again if you

00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:41,330
regularly attend Bravo keep it up you

00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:43,350
likely already understand their benefit

00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:45,990
conferences they allow you to stay

00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:47,970
abreast of new tools and technologies

00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:50,730
for an investment of days instead of

00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:52,500
weeks or months which gives you more

00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:53,970
time to focus on growing your skills in

00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,980
the areas most immediately relevant

00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:57,539
while still staying ahead of that

00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:01,980
incredible piece of change in our

00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:04,370
industry now regarding conferences don't

00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:07,950
overlook the value of the hallway track

00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:10,710
the sessions are fantastic I mean look

00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:13,380
at the lineup this week but the ability

00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:15,659
to cross pollinate with such a wide

00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:18,659
cross-section of the community should

00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:22,559
not be underestimated nor should it be

00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:25,470
missed similar in many ways are your

00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:27,870
local user groups while the cross

00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:30,899
section may not be as large they still

00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:33,059
serve to expand your ecosystem and their

00:26:30,899 --> 00:26:35,250
repetitive nature allows you to form

00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:39,149
significant relationships with other

00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:42,210
developers more quickly and what if you

00:26:39,149 --> 00:26:45,330
don't have a local user group to the

00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:47,250
simple answer start one

00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:51,360
I recently launched the group in New

00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:54,950
Jersey called Shore PHP people often ask

00:26:51,360 --> 00:27:00,900
why I did it the answer is pretty simple

00:26:54,950 --> 00:27:04,950
we had no local user group mmm Cal Evans

00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:06,930
told me to in following Cal's advice I

00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:09,270
fulfilled the talents directive the

00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:13,110
Malcolm Shane an awesome least a del

00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:19,680
lleó ish in a place where there is

00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:23,280
nobody endeavor to be somebody Cal Evans

00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:25,830
gets it as a community person he

00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:28,500
innately understands that the more one

00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:31,890
interacts with the community the more

00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:37,590
one gives to the community the more one

00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:41,010
receives in return let's not forget open

00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:44,010
source if you're not contributing to

00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:48,090
open source you are doing yourself a

00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:51,920
disservice I'm gonna let you in on a

00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:58,560
little secret the open source community

00:27:51,920 --> 00:28:02,610
does not need any single developer but

00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:05,100
every single developer professional

00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:08,670
developer needs the open source

00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:10,620
community yeah developing software with

00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:13,320
a large group of your peers it's a

00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:15,420
transformative experience and as

00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:19,110
professional developers you need to be a

00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:22,560
part of it the talons wisdom regarding

00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:25,380
community is pretty straightforward it

00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:28,230
admonishes us LT fresh me and hot

00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:32,040
seaborne do not separate yourself from

00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:34,980
the community the Talmud recognizes that

00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:41,040
the community is your lifeline and that

00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:44,700
without it you're lost finally let's

00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:47,910
consider the individual the Talmud tells

00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:51,630
the story of rebbi akiva who after being

00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:55,080
away from home for 12 years to learn in

00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:57,360
a distant yeshiva he returns along with

00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,260
several of his students when they

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,720
reached the porch of his

00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:02,670
home he overhears his wife answering

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,680
someone would questioned her judgment in

00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:07,560
allowing him to be gone for so long in

00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:10,110
pursuit of his studies if it were up to

00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:13,590
me she says proudly he could stay

00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:15,480
another 12 years the Talmud relates that

00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:17,820
upon hearing this Ribbeck even his

00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:21,180
students they immediately return to the

00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:23,340
distant yeshiva and they stayed immersed

00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:26,310
in their learning for an additional 12

00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:28,200
years now if you're following there's

00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:31,790
obvious question here the question is

00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:35,370
famously asked he had traveled so far

00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:39,450
after being away so long I mean he

00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:41,940
couldn't stop in for a visit the

00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:45,420
insightful answer is that according to

00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:49,770
tell mudak arithmetic the growth of 12

00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:54,390
and 12 it's not the same it doesn't

00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:55,800
compare to the growth of 24 the Talmud

00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:57,960
is perspective on growth in

00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:00,510
understanding and that's really one of

00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,800
the things that we're aiming for when we

00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:03,990
talk about our growth of software

00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,480
developers not simply growing our

00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:10,140
knowledge or our skills but wrong our

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:14,040
understanding is that retention is a

00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:17,280
myth understanding which is nurtured

00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:21,420
grows an understanding which is

00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:25,140
neglected withers and that's rebbi akiva

00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:26,580
is logic traveling with his students at

00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,990
that point he's immersed in learning

00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:31,260
right up until the moment that he

00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:33,270
overhears his wife and at that moment he

00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:39,540
can either return and continue his

00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:42,030
growth or stay and regress now for

00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:47,880
professional software developers this

00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:51,750
means always be coding there's really no

00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:54,510
way of escaping it to grow our craft we

00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:58,370
have to practice our craft we have to do

00:30:54,510 --> 00:31:02,400
it a lot we have to do it consistently

00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:04,500
my friend Joe kazia kennis gets it he

00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:11,520
recently extended his personal unbroken

00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:13,980
streak of coding every day to 500 days

00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:19,650
now that's not going to work for all of

00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:23,850
us sometimes you just need a break but

00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:28,470
Joe gets it consistency is the key to

00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:31,110
growth reb akiza Kiva's logic it also

00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:34,130
applies to maintaining context for

00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:36,690
context is really just micro consistency

00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:38,370
we're all aware of the impact of context

00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:41,130
switching and interruption on our

00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:43,650
productivity in the workplace we get

00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:46,020
really creative we set aside coding only

00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:47,130
hours I know people who actually in

00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:49,770
large buildings they work away from

00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:52,550
their desks to avoid interruption we

00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:55,770
have social media blackout periods

00:31:52,550 --> 00:32:00,810
private offices noise canceling

00:31:55,770 --> 00:32:04,590
headphones ask yourself a question does

00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:07,410
your coding at home resemble your coding

00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:12,420
in the workplace in terms of isolating

00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:14,610
yourself from distraction just as an

00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:17,070
athlete builds muscle memory through

00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:20,660
repetition with proper form we build

00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:23,340
mental muscle memory every time we code

00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:26,400
so if you want to grow your ability to

00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:29,610
maintain context and focus while coding

00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:33,870
professionally be as diligent about it

00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:35,190
when coding casually your vacation alcoa

00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:37,710
ng habits should resemble your

00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:43,160
vocational coding habits if you wish

00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:47,490
them to be strengthened aside from

00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:48,870
rigorous analysis the most salient

00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:51,030
features perhaps if Tom modic

00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:55,680
methodology can be summed up in two

00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:58,290
words verbalized repetition will start

00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:02,490
with verbalization the application is

00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:07,140
simple good developers talk to

00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:09,240
themselves verbalization it involves

00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:12,360
different parts of the brain than

00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:14,670
thought so the process of rubber ducking

00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:18,690
an understanding which was previously

00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:22,140
entirely mental necessarily increases

00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:24,030
that understanding it's not an issue of

00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:25,110
if you can't explain it you don't

00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:29,070
understand it

00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:32,040
no rather by explaining it you come to

00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:34,290
understand it better and by rubber

00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:36,230
ducking regularly we also gain one of

00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:40,320
the primary benefits of pair coating

00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:41,640
even when coding alone I found that

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,070
verbalization also improves

00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:46,590
concentration if I'm having difficulty

00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:49,290
maintaining focus or context I'll

00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:51,570
actually narrate as I code I do my best

00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:55,250
Jeffrey way impersonation and I describe

00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:59,220
every line of code as I write it

00:33:55,250 --> 00:34:01,830
fortunately I work at home I really

00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:03,990
should do that all the time because my

00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:06,270
focus improves and the quality of my

00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:08,190
code improves as well as I gain

00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:10,970
additional clarity and insight from the

00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:13,320
from the process of verbalization

00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:17,570
another great strategy which works very

00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:20,760
similarly pre-emptive commit messages

00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:23,850
writing your commit message prior to

00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:26,700
beginning coding you'll find that your

00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:30,060
solutions are cleaner and your commits

00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:33,869
more granular by adopting that one very

00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:35,580
very simple practice I've also found

00:34:33,869 --> 00:34:38,940
that being disciplined about diagramming

00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:41,730
solutions even the simplest solutions

00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:43,950
prior to the implementation has an

00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:48,570
observable impact on the quality of my

00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:51,600
code you simply cannot cannot use the

00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:53,340
whiteboard enough don't think however

00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,020
the verbalization is a tool only help

00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:59,280
you plan solutions or work through

00:34:55,020 --> 00:35:02,070
challenges to an experiment for an

00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:06,619
entire afternoon every time you're about

00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:09,869
to commit code just see what I did there

00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:12,540
entire afternoon every time you're about

00:35:09,869 --> 00:35:14,520
to commit code the implication being

00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:17,250
that we're code we are committing code

00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:20,100
multiple times in an afternoon yeah

00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:22,260
granular commits is really key but every

00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:25,140
time you're about to commit code rubber

00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:29,000
duck first explain your implementation

00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:31,200
to yourself as you would to a teammate

00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
not only will the other members of the

00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,920
team love you because you're commit

00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,339
messages will actually be descriptive in

00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:39,519
meaningful

00:35:36,339 --> 00:35:43,089
but you'd be shocked how frequently the

00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:45,400
exercise causes you to take your finger

00:35:43,089 --> 00:35:47,859
off the proverbial trigger to go back

00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:51,549
and reconsider and improve your code

00:35:47,859 --> 00:35:53,229
prior to making the commit a similar

00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:55,210
practice which can dramatically improve

00:35:53,229 --> 00:35:58,329
the quality of your code is to be

00:35:55,210 --> 00:36:00,460
disciplined about reviewing a diff prior

00:35:58,329 --> 00:36:02,799
to each commit and I don't mean just

00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:05,799
looking for you know debugging messages

00:36:02,799 --> 00:36:10,650
and coding standards reviewing your

00:36:05,799 --> 00:36:13,150
changes file by file rubber ducking them

00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:15,339
doing it file by file rather than in

00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:17,140
their logical context it serves as a

00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:20,140
tremendous sanity check on our

00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:22,450
implementation it almost magically

00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:25,299
removes blind spots that you may have

00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:29,589
been unaware of along the way it's like

00:36:25,299 --> 00:36:31,989
a one-person code review now revoked

00:36:29,589 --> 00:36:34,660
guarding repetition the Talmon observes

00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:37,059
a nadeema Sean appear Kumail LeSean

00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:40,660
appear who may have a thought when we

00:36:37,059 --> 00:36:42,249
use their learning 101 x cannot be

00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:45,789
compared to one who reviews they're

00:36:42,249 --> 00:36:47,440
learning only 100 times now obviously

00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:49,329
the talmud doesn't consider repetition

00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,680
to be about retention the one who

00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:53,289
reviewed their learning a hundred times

00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:56,219
certainly retained it rather about

00:36:53,289 --> 00:36:58,539
increased insight and understanding and

00:36:56,219 --> 00:37:02,019
an application for us to software

00:36:58,539 --> 00:37:03,640
developers is code contests for the

00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:06,489
professional software developer Coty's

00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:08,079
are akin to a musician rehearsing or a

00:37:06,489 --> 00:37:11,680
baseball player taking batting practice

00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:13,920
as they offer us i think our only real

00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,269
opportunity to practice our craft

00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:19,660
unfettered from external influence from

00:37:16,269 --> 00:37:21,609
the project stakeholders deadlines when

00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:25,599
our own projects are our vision for the

00:37:21,609 --> 00:37:27,849
next feature their focus on process the

00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:30,369
analysis and decision making use to

00:37:27,849 --> 00:37:32,469
arrive at a solution is invaluable and

00:37:30,369 --> 00:37:36,789
it's something that really cannot be

00:37:32,469 --> 00:37:41,400
experienced any other way I don't yet

00:37:36,789 --> 00:37:44,410
know Johann broadwell the Johann gets it

00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:48,150
coding contest as the programmer

00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:48,150
equivalent of push-ups

00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:58,880
this age Hillel is oft quoted loja by

00:37:53,480 --> 00:38:01,160
xin loi made the timid does not learn to

00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:05,270
get where you want to go as a developer

00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:10,480
to get where you ought to want to go as

00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:10,480
a developer and to get there quickly

00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:20,500
takes a little hutzpah don't be afraid

00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:25,550
to ask questions don't be afraid to

00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:31,300
challenge assumptions don't be afraid to

00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:34,190
ask for help don't be afraid to fail

00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:36,830
ultimately we are responsible for our

00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:39,109
own growth so it's imperative not to

00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:47,030
allow our inhibitions to slow our

00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:48,800
advance the timid does not learn the

00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:50,990
Talmud relates the story of another

00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,700
story of reverie Akiva how he was

00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:54,560
inspired to begin his studies at what

00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:57,290
was considered then the advanced age of

00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:59,630
40 when he encountered a large a boulder

00:38:57,290 --> 00:39:02,930
with a hole drilled through its entirety

00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:06,830
by the steady drip of water from an

00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:11,000
overhang rebbi akiva learned from this

00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:14,599
the value of small beginnings and that

00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:18,380
steady effort no matter how limited can

00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:22,550
accomplish great things the Talmud

00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:26,930
observes that call has scoliosis all

00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:29,270
beginnings are difficult the antidote to

00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:31,670
difficult beginnings is to recognize

00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:35,119
that even small beginnings have value

00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:40,250
and that steady effort can overcome even

00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:43,790
the most imposing obstacle confession

00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:47,540
time this is my first open source

00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:52,400
contribution yeah a grammar and style

00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:54,820
edit to PHP the right way small

00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,820
beginnings

00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:59,410
our growth is software developers should

00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:01,840
be understood and approached as we

00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:04,840
approach software development as an

00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:09,280
iterative process best measured over

00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:14,620
time it's not easy but as the talmud

00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:18,700
observes laffoon saara agra according to

00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:20,350
the difficulty is the reward I'll leave

00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:25,440
you this morning with the words of the

00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:29,710
sage hill Oh in three parts a mainly

00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:32,890
melee if I'm not for myself who else

00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:35,440
will be for me know that it takes

00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:37,930
hutzpah to avoid the fate of the timid

00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,450
that you have to ask questions and ask

00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:43,150
for help question assumptions and risk

00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:45,490
failure to value small beginnings to

00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:48,580
practice as you wish to perform and to

00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:50,620
leverage consistency need to keep in

00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:53,140
mind the benefits of rubber ducking and

00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:56,520
other verbalization techniques of coding

00:40:53,140 --> 00:41:00,600
contests and of cultivating mentors

00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:07,920
hillel continues Luke ishani lots me

00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:11,740
money from only for myself what am I

00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:13,870
it's imperative to interact with the

00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:16,210
community to value learning together

00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:19,350
with our peers pair coding and code

00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:21,870
review conferences and user groups

00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:27,160
sharing our knowledge with others and

00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:30,340
stepping up to fill a void my time is

00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:33,070
drawing to a close I hope that each of

00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:36,790
you have been able to glean something

00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:39,490
that you can take away and implement

00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:40,780
immediately such that the time that

00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:43,390
we've spent together here this morning

00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:47,860
can accelerate your growth as a software

00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:50,140
developer for that's it that's that's

00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:55,180
all I've got that's I've done what I can

00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:59,380
do the rest is up to you so I'll

00:41:55,180 --> 00:42:05,580
conclude as did hillo by asking Emily

00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:05,580
Akshath a Maasai if not now when
