Title: Jenny Wong - Integrating Communities
Publication date: 2015-04-02
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2015
Description: 
	Is PHP one community or many? Frameworks and CMSes created in PHP are popular enough to have self-sufficient communities, but this can often result in a lack of crossover between communities. The result of the fragmentation can be wasted effort and time as a developer but also a lack of knowledge transfer that extends outside of our own subgroup bubble. This talk will bring some practical suggestions and solutions on how to look outside our comfort zones, widen our technical circles, and ensure that we learn from other peopleâ€™s mistakes whilst bridging the gap between communities. As a result, we can make our communities more diverse and stronger.

00:00:16,689 --> 00:00:20,470
therefore you got to listen to me and

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,140
I'm going to start with an apology

00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:25,570
because quite a few of you are going to

00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,669
start feeling a little bit old there's

00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:31,989
nothing I can do about that it's just

00:00:27,669 --> 00:00:35,620
life we can embrace age as much as we

00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:38,410
want but it will happen to us so yeah

00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:41,650
let's get going my name is Jenny I am a

00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:44,260
web developer not HR person not a

00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:46,600
marketing person I do code and let's

00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:50,470
just get this out there right now and I

00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:52,090
like wearing dresses a lot so why is it

00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:55,960
that I'm about to make a lot of you feel

00:00:52,090 --> 00:01:00,850
rather old it's because when my clicker

00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:03,420
works hang on turn it on five years ago

00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:07,329
I was a second-year student at

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:12,460
university it was the very first time I

00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:14,729
learnt PHP five years ago it was a

00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:17,380
module and server-side programming and

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:19,900
the lecturer thought hey we're going to

00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:23,500
use PHP and in fact he's one of the

00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:26,560
co-organizers of PHP Northwest so in his

00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:29,740
awesome wisdom he would encourage us as

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,770
students to go and embrace the local

00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:38,950
community and as good old students we

00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:41,860
thought he's so boring and he knew this

00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:45,729
and he was persistent poor guy so

00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:48,670
persistent and one day I was so sick of

00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:50,260
him I said look if I go to this user

00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,270
group will you please just shut up about

00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,799
it will you just leave us alone with the

00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:57,100
students we just want to pass a degree

00:01:53,799 --> 00:02:00,490
and go home and he agreed to this this

00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:03,280
crazy person agreed to this and so yeah

00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:07,090
I took one for the team I went to this

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,489
user group beach me Northwest I kept on

00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:12,540
going it was the encouragement of that

00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:15,129
lecturer that actually made me go there

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,319
at that user group I asked my first

00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:18,819
question they were discussing about

00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:22,170
arrays

00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:24,780
about array pups and arrayed push I

00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,709
remember putting my hand up and going

00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,530
why are you talking about our way

00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:33,159
pushing and popping why is it not

00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:35,500
pushing and pulling I mean you push and

00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:40,120
pull doors so why don't you push and

00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:43,480
pull a raise the room and silent deadly

00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:46,840
silent and as a student I was like why

00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:50,230
have i done every broken something and

00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:53,409
the reality of it was I just questioned

00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:55,540
something because I had no conceptions

00:02:53,409 --> 00:03:00,639
or preconceptions of what programming

00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:05,079
was later that year I volunteered for

00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:06,609
PHP Northwest 2010 second year uni they

00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:09,519
always tell you go and find an

00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:14,159
internship you need to get some at work

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:17,469
experience typical student didn't do it

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,569
so come to the summer I was like hey

00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:22,000
I've got nothing to do i'm bored I'll

00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:26,169
volunteer for the local user group for

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:32,049
the conference and in the process I got

00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:34,239
myself an internship yes the conference

00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:35,620
that year was amazing I've met loads of

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,239
people there loads of people that

00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:44,439
actually see in the audience today so

00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:46,239
hello and then 2011 turned up as part of

00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:48,250
my internship I was tasked with

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:52,120
migrating all the PHP northwest

00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:54,459
conference website and upgrade them they

00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,009
were all built on wordpress wordpress

00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:59,459
three points Oh had just turned up and

00:03:57,009 --> 00:04:01,989
it meant that they had a new feature

00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:04,030
WordPress multi sites it meant that you

00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:07,930
could have all your WordPress projects

00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:10,719
on one installation of WordPress so I

00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,489
took it upon myself to migrate all the

00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:16,449
PHP Northwest Conference websites into

00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:20,139
one installation because of this because

00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:27,690
of a PHP conference website I ended up

00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:29,490
working on WordPress 2012

00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:32,640
the year that I became the first person

00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:36,870
in my family to graduate it was a super

00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:39,030
proud moment it's also the year that I

00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:41,010
went to my first word camp in Edinburgh

00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:44,540
now if you don't know what a wordcamp

00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:47,610
airs it's a conference of sorts for

00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:52,260
WordPress people uses all the way to

00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:54,240
developers and being in Edinburgh there

00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:57,060
was a Scotsman there who taught a group

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,370
of attendees about all the whiskey's

00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:04,860
available in Scotland and they go in all

00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:07,680
the drunk in this happy state that I was

00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,980
I went out to make little how many

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,430
people had know who might Knittel it is

00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:17,940
only a few of you might metal is a

00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:21,270
British developer he's also the

00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:24,360
co-founder of WordPress he lives up

00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:27,930
north and he runs the Manchester

00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:31,830
wordpress user group and there's me just

00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:34,980
graduated tell him Mike I love user

00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:37,260
greets Mike but user groups to use

00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:39,030
eccentric it's like going back to work

00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:41,100
after finishing work and talking to

00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:44,610
clients again I don't want to do that

00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:47,640
and between a load of drinks and a lot

00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:50,100
of talking we came up with a solution in

00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:56,669
fact that solution is still in place

00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:59,550
today time ticked on and 2000 turn 13 to

00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:05,280
end up on my doorstep it turned out to

00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:10,260
be the hardest year in my career 2013

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:13,050
became the year that I nearly quit it

00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:17,280
became the year I nearly quit because i

00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:19,560
was at work and let me just be clear

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,900
about this this is nothing to do with my

00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,030
company I was working for all the people

00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,790
I was working with it was one individual

00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:30,270
and whatever they did was wrong just

00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:33,000
plain wrong they were having a hard time

00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:36,840
at home in their own life and then

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,500
decided that I was a suitable vocal

00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,960
punch bag

00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:45,050
in fact if it wasn't for the amazing

00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:48,620
people that I met in the PHP women group

00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:51,410
I would not be in this industry at all

00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:55,580
to this day I would not be in front of

00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:57,170
you today one message of despair after

00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:00,410
another thinking it was my own fault

00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:02,540
this person was shouting at me yelling

00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:05,330
at me across the office in front of the

00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:08,870
rest of my co-workers it was

00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:12,860
heartbreaking the people in the PHP

00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:16,700
women IRC channel slowly helped me walk

00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:22,910
away from quitting and for that for all

00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:26,360
you people out there thank you in 2014 a

00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:29,720
year ago in fact six months ago I left

00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:32,840
my hometown as you probably guessed our

00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:35,990
Mancunian born and bred and super proud

00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:39,169
of it so when I left my hometown moved

00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:43,100
200 miles down south to a place where

00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:45,500
the water tastes really weird I know and

00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,850
there's no local PHP user group because

00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,430
I actually don't live in the Greater

00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:52,430
London area i live like in a key one of

00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:57,380
those commuter towns and I realized a

00:07:52,430 --> 00:08:00,290
few things and this is why I've told you

00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:03,200
about the last five years it's a few

00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:07,850
things that I've realized that I want to

00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:12,800
share with you today I Jenny Wong I'm a

00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:14,990
community addict hi I didn't realize how

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,560
much of a community addict I was until I

00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:21,950
was moving down south and unhooking all

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:25,490
my lanyard which I now have stuck on my

00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:26,900
wall in my office there's a lot in fact

00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,690
I'm not just a community addict of

00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,490
conferences and events I love user

00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:33,620
groups and the great thing about living

00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:36,080
in Manchester was there was practically

00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:40,400
a user group every other night so I mean

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,530
it was never home it was amazing for the

00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,150
last five years at every step in my

00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:46,310
career from the very beginning when I

00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:49,850
was learning PHP to where I am now

00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:52,100
there's been a user group whether that

00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:53,329
was PHP Northwest the Manchester word

there for me and this is why I'm so

00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:08,119
passionate about communities I've

00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:12,139
already taken so much from the community

00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:14,689
and I want to give something back I want

00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:16,730

have the same if not better experience

00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:29,689
than the sport that I got when I started

00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:32,540
and over this time I have met people

00:09:29,689 --> 00:09:38,269
both in the PHP and the WordPress

00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:40,670

like it no no no no you you have no idea

00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:54,410
how hard PHP is and they asked me a lot

00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:57,170
how did you get started with PHP where

00:09:54,410 --> 00:10:00,559
did you learn from what resources the G

00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:04,249
is and I always tell them i went to my

00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:08,720
local PHP user group I went to PHP

00:10:04,249 --> 00:10:13,549
Northwest I asked questions and the

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:16,160

everything just go over your head Amy

00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:29,329
answer to the very last question is yes

00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:30,949
when I first went to conferences I used

00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:35,419
to have to take pain killers with me

00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:38,600
because my head hurts so much so much

00:10:35,419 --> 00:10:41,720
information but when I'm in the PHP

00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:45,860
community the community that I first

00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:50,209
started in I hear this a lot are you

00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:52,879
working WordPress our painful man it's a

00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:58,369
rubbish so insecure you won't even drop

00:10:52,879 --> 00:11:00,339
the 52 mini million support thing you

00:10:58,369 --> 00:11:05,119
won't break backwards compat

00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:05,930
compatibility and when I try and explain

00:11:05,119 --> 00:11:09,410
how

00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:13,600
a if it was up to me I would drop five

00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:16,640
four nevermind 52 if it was up to me

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,779
yeah maybe i would do stuff differently

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,720
but it's not up to me ultimately

00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:27,560
wordpress is a twelve-year-old

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:31,010
user-centric project by choice and the

00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:34,010
reason behind that is because let's face

00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:37,160
it if there's a problem with the

00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:42,740
software it's going to be developers who

00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:45,410
are going to solve the problem now I

00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:47,149
Love You Don't Know Who I am or my

00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:49,250
background but for a number of though

00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:52,040
she is I ended up becoming an organizer

00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,990
of PHP Northwest I was that much of an

00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:57,860
addict they figured hey we might as well

00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:59,450
make her an organizer so when I went

00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,279
around the WordPress community and when

00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:04,100
I met people who were wordpress

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:07,790
developers who are actually really PHP

00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:10,040
developers I would invite them to my

00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:11,660
conference to my user group and say hey

00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,970
if you're ever in the city if you ever

00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:18,620
want to come along for your free this is

00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:23,570
when it happens and I would always got

00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:25,520
that face of or I'm not sure the word

00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:29,140
press developers concerns would increase

00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:32,089
the flight be marked by PHP developers

00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:34,930
beam PHP developers being rude to them

00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:38,240
be mean to them they were scared of us

00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:40,130
and I would tell them hey i know this

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,750
community that an Isis bunch in the

00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:43,580
world they're like they love having a

00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:48,650
good fern they're the same as the

00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:51,500
WordPress community in reality and to

00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:53,440
kind of put the cherry on the big

00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:57,740
massive cake I was trying to give them I

00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:00,560
would say if anything did happen then

00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:08,839
please come and see me I will personally

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:11,899
handle it so when last year at my own

00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:14,770
conference a speaker gotten stage and

00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:17,770
spoke about a lot of open source

00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,770
projects

00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:26,210
but when they mentioned WordPress the

00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:39,380
room would with laughter and my heart

00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:41,780
sank for those wordpress developers that

00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:46,820
I had personally invited to the

00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:51,230
conference I felt guilty my conference

00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:54,560
the community that I trusted just proved

00:13:51,230 --> 00:14:00,710
all their fears right word pressures got

00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:03,980
laughter and the reality of it is the

00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:06,530
marking of WordPress by PHP is like

00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:14,570
watching my parents have a fight every

00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:19,340
day I don't know why everyone one

00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:26,450
laughed at WordPress but what I do know

00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:29,690
is that as somebody who's first in fight

00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:31,870
to the PHP community was from a

00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:34,490
wordpress developer from a PHP developer

00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:40,070
from someone who had given their trust

00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:42,320
away it made them feel uncomfortable it

00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:45,500
made me feel uncomfortable and I've been

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,630
in this community for years they're

00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:52,880
taking a chance with us we had abuse

00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:55,940
their trust how would you feel you went

00:14:52,880 --> 00:15:00,230
to an event just to be laughter for the

00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:02,570
technology choices you made and we can

00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:05,210
take this one step further look at the

00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:08,920
bigger picture the marking of any

00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:13,670
technology by anyone it's like watching

00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:17,660
my parents having a fight every day now

00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:21,260
I know you guys don't know my parents

00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:23,750
but I'm sure you know what it's like to

00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:27,590
watch your parents of children having

00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:32,590
arguments it's not pretty it's bloody

00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:40,510
it's messy and ultimately nobody wins

00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:45,230
it's a broken home if we think about it

00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:50,390
we can pick any technology any language

00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:52,670
and point to floor it if we can even

00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:58,430
look at the English language there are

00:15:52,670 --> 00:16:00,350
loads of flaws in it the way we interact

00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:04,730
with each other the way we shout our

00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:09,550
peers have faced digitally physically

00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:12,560
talk over each other talk for each other

00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:16,670
it doesn't help our community doesn't

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:19,640
help us as developers grow where have

00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:24,950
our manners and I respect gone for one

00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:29,000
another how many people here have

00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:33,380
complained about being overworked how

00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,360
many put your hand up Wow for the people

00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:39,590
who haven't put their hand up can I have

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:41,420
your job please how many people here

00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:45,010
have felt guilty for going on holiday

00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:48,020
because you knew by taking time off

00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:52,040
there was less people at work allow us

00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:54,350
one less pair of hands to help out we

00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,570
are a community of people and in an

00:16:54,350 --> 00:17:00,140
industry where there are not enough

00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:02,480
developers where burnout is almost a

00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:06,140
standard when it shouldn't be a mental

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:09,140
health is a major issue why is it that

00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:14,320
we spend so much time belittling a

00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:14,320
subset of developers that we do have

00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:22,430
maybe some of those people are not yet

00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:26,840
currently good developers but good is

00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:31,760
relative if you don't help them how are

00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:34,100
they ever meant to become great in an

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,890
industry that's constantly changing I

00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:39,110
swear I go to sleep wake up and

00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:42,130
something new comes out oh hang on isn't

00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:45,240
there a new version of PHP out today I'm

00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:48,240
sure we've all written bad code

00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,100
food before and in fact if we really

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:55,590
think about it i'm sure some of us are

00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:59,760
still doing it i am just one person on a

00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:02,670
stage but together we can change this

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:05,640
I'm sure of it and I'm going to believe

00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:08,460
it until someone tells me otherwise if

00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:13,830
we all choose to improve our tiny corner

00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:19,440
and neil tiny corner what difference

00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:22,230
would that make together it's not easy

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,840
changing people's perspective trust me I

00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:28,920
know telling people that word bet is not

00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:30,300
so bad it's a really hard job but if we

00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:34,650
are willing to waste our time

00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:36,300
complaining about something then what

00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:40,290
would happen if we spend all that time

00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:43,500
and energy supporting the growth and

00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:45,480
learning process of other people of the

00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,559
next generation of developers that walk

00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:51,570
into our community of the general of the

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:57,120
developers are the new developers who

00:18:51,570 --> 00:19:00,900
are here today this is a big problem a

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,970
huge problem and there is no silver

00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:05,340
bullet I looked for it and I couldn't

00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:07,830
find it so if anyone finds it let me

00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:11,280
know cuz I'll be interested but I

00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:16,140
believe that multi-dimensional problems

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:21,210
need a multi-dimensional solutions so

00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:25,520
let's have a look at some events there's

00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:28,790
word camps drupal camps bar camps

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:31,620
conferences like the one we're in today

00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:36,300
more regular events like user groups are

00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:39,120
meetups can we please avoid putting them

00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:41,160
on the same date how many times have we

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:48,450
won oh yeah when I've got to that one oh

00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:51,210
no no I'm going oh I give up there is a

00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:55,740
project cod open Tek calendar pretty

00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:58,650
cool project where you can all put your

00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:01,650
dates in I'm not saying it's the perfect

00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:03,450
addition to the problem but it's a start

00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:12,780
and if we can find a better solution

00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:17,130
please share inclusiveness why don't we

00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:19,800
invite everybody to the poly how many

00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:21,900
people had a good time last night yeah

00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,640
quite a few of you apparently some of

00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,660
you didn't put your hand up so I'm sorry

00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,950
if you didn't have a good time but I did

00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:32,280
there's a lot of people here today who

00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:34,740
came alone they're the bravest people in

00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:37,700
this room right now even braver than me

00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:40,680
because I have a team of people with me

00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:43,440
they are here for the first time they

00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:45,750
might not know anyone how many of you

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:49,050
have gone outside your little groups

00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:51,150
your company groups and said hello to

00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:52,710
the people that you're SAT around you'll

00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:54,660
probably sat next to somebody you know

00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:57,930
but what about the people in front of

00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:02,850
you the people behind you let's include

00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:06,510
everyone in the conversation for the

00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:09,090
Christmas party of PHP London they

00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:13,410
invited women who code London to their

00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:15,810
Christmas party it was super cool it was

00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:18,570
a really informal event at a pub with

00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:23,190
food and a cake because obviously unique

00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:26,550
cake and enabled everyone to get to know

00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:28,950
each other I met PHP developers their

00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:32,160
word press developers there dotnet

00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:34,650
developers and what I found out was that

00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:37,320
even though they were in this women who

00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:39,960
code group they didn't ever know about

00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:44,250
the PHP user group or the wordpress user

00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:46,710
group or the dot net user group by

00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:49,890
inviting someone from outside our

00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:53,490
community in you are making the first

00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:58,310
step you're saying to them hey why don't

00:21:53,490 --> 00:22:01,320
you come along you're welcome and if

00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:03,630
this month they say oh no I'm busy I

00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:07,530
don't want to come try again next month

00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:09,890
keep the invitation open maybe they were

00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,890
just busy

00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:15,699
now let's look at the words we choose to

00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:18,339
use words are one of the most powerful

00:22:15,699 --> 00:22:21,489
tools we have way more powerful than

00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:23,399
source or source control or any other

00:22:21,489 --> 00:22:25,989
tool that we use in our daily lives and

00:22:23,399 --> 00:22:28,389
let's think about it think about the

00:22:25,989 --> 00:22:31,629
words we choose to use when we

00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:36,729
communicate with each other online and

00:22:31,629 --> 00:22:38,769
in reality when someone at the

00:22:36,729 --> 00:22:41,679
pre-conference social for this

00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:44,409
conference asked me if I was

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:49,029
gate-crashing the social it made me feel

00:22:44,409 --> 00:22:51,369
like what am I not welcomed here am I

00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:55,839
not meant to be here and he took me a

00:22:51,369 --> 00:23:00,729
second I'm keynoting of course I meant

00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:03,940
to be here we never know what state of

00:23:00,729 --> 00:23:06,609
mind the people around us are in we have

00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:11,549
no control of that but what we do have

00:23:06,609 --> 00:23:11,549
control of is the words we choose to use

00:23:12,749 --> 00:23:19,229
Drupal they did a really cool thing in

00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:23,559
2013 they did an initiative called

00:23:19,229 --> 00:23:25,929
getting off the island now for the

00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:32,559
people who don't know what it is it was

00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:34,839
a very cry from inside roopal where they

00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:38,229
said hey we have an amazing community

00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:40,899
here and we love you all but what would

00:23:38,229 --> 00:23:43,690
happen we spread our wings a little bit

00:23:40,899 --> 00:23:47,169
got off what they called the Drupal

00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:49,509
island and went further afield in fact

00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:52,449
when I was in work on San Francisco I

00:23:49,509 --> 00:23:55,299
melt Drupal developers there they were

00:23:52,449 --> 00:23:57,489
there to see how we worked internally as

00:23:55,299 --> 00:24:00,190
well as externally they were there at

00:23:57,489 --> 00:24:06,909
the community summits that we hold every

00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:09,099
year diversity now I know Joanna has

00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:12,579
talked about the diversity of this

00:24:09,099 --> 00:24:16,599
conference but let's look a little wider

00:24:12,579 --> 00:24:19,149
perspective if we as a community are

00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:23,650
serious about wanting to improve the

00:24:19,149 --> 00:24:26,050
diversity of this or any other community

00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:30,130
then it has to be part of the plan not

00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:34,000
an afterthought and this is about

00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:38,590
diversity of technologies of two choices

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:41,550
of operating systems just because

00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:45,210
someone uses microsoft and Dreamweaver

00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:50,850
doesn't mean you get to laugh at them

00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:56,560
gender race background whether you are a

00:24:50,850 --> 00:25:00,150
cyborg or human just include all people

00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:05,320
and that way you won't miss any one out

00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:07,810
I've mentioned this before people want

00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:12,430
to learn PHP they know there is value in

00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:18,370
it so why don't we help teach them help

00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:22,030
support them let's set the example of

00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:27,550
how we want to want our community to

00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:34,360
behave let's go to their user groups and

00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:39,880
invite them in or let's go to their user

00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:44,800
groups and do a talk on PHP basics what

00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:47,290
is a raise can someone tell me that let

00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:50,110
them know about PHP mentoring let them

00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:52,120
know about PHP the White Way let let

00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:55,380
them know about all those resources that

00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:59,140
I've gotten you to this room today and

00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:03,070
if you want to learn something new then

00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:05,110
please speak up ask your local user

00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:07,510
group to find someone with that

00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:10,600
knowledge internally in your current

00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:12,850
community or externally from another

00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,980
community ask them to share that

00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:21,610
knowledge with you with the rest of your

00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:23,710
community or you could decide that thing

00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:28,810
that you want to learn go to that

00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:31,630
communities user groups meetups you meet

00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:35,879
the move and if you don't have a local

00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:38,669
user group just start one

00:26:35,879 --> 00:26:40,079
and now this is the most important thing

00:26:38,669 --> 00:26:43,440
this is something that we can all do

00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:48,809
today it's all about attitude the way we

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:51,329
welcome people into our group if we can

00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:54,509
be a bit nicer to each other say hi to a

00:26:51,329 --> 00:26:56,669
new person then we want to come back

00:26:54,509 --> 00:27:01,049
they'll go out and tell people about how

00:26:56,669 --> 00:27:05,759
amazing this PHP conference was don't

00:27:01,049 --> 00:27:07,889
belittle people it's a really hard thing

00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:10,709
we already think we don't know enough

00:27:07,889 --> 00:27:14,519
all the time so why is it that we need

00:27:10,709 --> 00:27:16,799
to put ourselves down even more let's

00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:19,999
leave that door open keep our invite an

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:23,759
open invitation with no expiry date

00:27:19,999 --> 00:27:27,959
let's educate them to what is right what

00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:29,999
is wrong or what your opinion is let's

00:27:27,959 --> 00:27:32,519
support them on their journey the same

00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:37,259
way all those user groups before me have

00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:43,799
supported me let's mentor them tell them

00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:46,139
that it's ok be cheerleaders when was

00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:48,179
the last time you said that's cool it's

00:27:46,139 --> 00:27:54,089
cool that you tried doesn't matter that

00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:57,329
you got it wrong and be respectful of

00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:59,459
each other having different opinions is

00:27:57,329 --> 00:28:02,190
what makes this industry really

00:27:59,459 --> 00:28:06,209
interesting listening to people's

00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:10,499
stories and experiences it all makes the

00:28:06,209 --> 00:28:12,389
person and your opinions count but when

00:28:10,499 --> 00:28:14,759
we're having discussions we don't need

00:28:12,389 --> 00:28:18,139
to turn them into flame wars and we

00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:21,419
don't need to make everyone's blood boil

00:28:18,139 --> 00:28:24,299
we have the right to our air all our

00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:26,969
opinions and if we hear something that

00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:30,629
we disagree on it's absolutely fine to

00:28:26,969 --> 00:28:35,190
say I disagree boro respect that your

00:28:30,629 --> 00:28:37,109
own opinion by being respectful it does

00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:41,009
not mean you have to agree with

00:28:37,109 --> 00:28:43,979
everything that somebody says be

00:28:41,009 --> 00:28:46,829
empathetic is one thing to listen to

00:28:43,979 --> 00:28:50,029
someone it's another thing to put

00:28:46,829 --> 00:28:50,029
yourself in their shoes

00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:57,790
and let's guide them guide them to the

00:28:54,790 --> 00:29:01,600
resources that we already know we might

00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:03,670
think that is really obvious but they

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,670
come from a different background they

00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:11,460
have a different history and if you're

00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:14,290
doing this already then that's amazing

00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:19,570
please let me know about it let's share

00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:22,120
our stories and let's remember yes there

00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:25,350
are barriers between communities at the

00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:28,600
moment but we can build bridges together

00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:32,530
this will not be fixed overnight but

00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:35,800
brick by brick we can start a two-way

00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:39,309
dialogue we can start to a dialogue with

00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:42,250
our sister communities and we can share

00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:46,960
that knowledge that experience and that

00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:50,910
wisdom that we all have with insiders we

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:53,500
can improve this one step at a time

00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:56,860
multi dimensional problems need a

00:29:53,500 --> 00:30:00,000
multi-dimensional solutions so I'm

00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:03,179
asking you what solution do you have

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,179
thank you

00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,220
