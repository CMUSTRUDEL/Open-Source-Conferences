Title: Jenny Wong - Integrating Communities
Publication date: 2015-04-02
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2015
Description: 
	Is PHP one community or many? Frameworks and CMSes created in PHP are popular enough to have self-sufficient communities, but this can often result in a lack of crossover between communities. The result of the fragmentation can be wasted effort and time as a developer but also a lack of knowledge transfer that extends outside of our own subgroup bubble. This talk will bring some practical suggestions and solutions on how to look outside our comfort zones, widen our technical circles, and ensure that we learn from other peopleâ€™s mistakes whilst bridging the gap between communities. As a result, we can make our communities more diverse and stronger.
