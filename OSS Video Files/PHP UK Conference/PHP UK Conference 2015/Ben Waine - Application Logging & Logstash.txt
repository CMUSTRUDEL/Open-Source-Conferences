Description: 
	Modern web applications are complex, have many layers and usually integrate many technologies. A well structured application log is invaluable for debugging your application in development and monitoring it in production. All this being said itâ€™s amazing how many applications don't have an application log or have a poor, inconsistent one which is little use to anyone! This session takes a brief look at the basics of logging (libraries and tools) and moves on to look at how to plan an effective logging strategy for your application. Questions like: What to log, logging levels, how much to log and how long to keep historical logs are all addressed. In the second half of the session we consider logs as a stream of events and how we can use Logstash and Kibana to surface a wealth of interesting information about our applications.
