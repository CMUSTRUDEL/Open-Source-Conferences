Title: Beth Tucker Long - Be a Bold Coder
Publication date: 2015-04-02
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2015
Description: 
	Do you cringe when you have to show someone else your code? Have you ever complained about terribly written code only to discover it was yours from six months ago? Coding is a constantly evolving field. How can you keep up? Learn what standards are out there to help you keep your code clean, what tools can help you proof your code, and where to find information on best practices so you can stay current and boldly share your code with others.

you

00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:09,550
so welcome this is be a boat bold coder

00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,130
and i'm going to try really hard to not

00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:14,650
say bode coder the whole time I've been

00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:17,619
trying to practice so so welcome to be a

00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:20,710
bold coder a little bit of information

00:00:17,619 --> 00:00:22,929
about myself I am Beth Tucker long i am

00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:25,060
a PHP developer for a company called

00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:27,820
code climate we do automated code review

00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:29,529
we have these amazing t-shirts and i

00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,839
have a ridiculous and out of them that i

00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:33,430
do not want to take home so please come

00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:34,840
get a free t-shirt take several if you

00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,880
have a usergroup take some for your user

00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,740
group if I don't have the size you're

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,450
looking for I can ship you one in your

00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,760
size so just let me know if I don't have

00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:47,290
the size you want i also have stickers

00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:49,120
ok so i'm also a stay-at-home mom I'm a

00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:52,180
user group leader and I'm a mentor and

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,680
I'm also no apprentice so it's important

00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,480
to do both sides of the mentorship

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,260
relationship but we'll talk a little bit

00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,910
more about that later I am totally fine

00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,890
with audience participation during my

00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:05,199
talks so if you have a question ask it

00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:06,970
before you forget it so feel free to

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,790
raise your hand wave it around if I'm

00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:11,680
not noticing let me know I'm fine asking

00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,240
questions any time I will have questions

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,340
also at the end or come up and talk to

00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:19,660
me afterwards or find me throughout the

00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:23,080
conference talk to me anytime so why am

00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:24,880
I doing this talk so a lot of us work on

00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,560
closed source projects no one is ever

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,110
going to see our code but us and perhaps

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,750
a few teammates so why is it important

00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:34,600
to be a bold coder why is it important

00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:36,670
to care about the state of your code so

00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,820
how many of you have written code for

00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:41,500
longer than two years okay a large

00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:44,200
number of you okay wait keep your hands

00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,760
up okay now put your hand down if you

00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,990
would like to take some code from two

00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:52,240
years ago and put it up on the screen

00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:53,620
for everyone to see see a lot fewer of

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,950
us there are a few people who wouldn't

00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:58,420
mind but a large number of us really

00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,270
don't want anyone to see our old code

00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,830
now why is that give me give me one

00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:06,430
reason why you don't want people to see

00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:08,049
your code from two years ago yeah we

00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:12,159
know a lot more now we're constantly

00:02:08,049 --> 00:02:15,500
learning it's embarrassing why is it

00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:19,430
embarrassing it's horrible

00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:21,440
yeah yeah so our code from a long time

00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,120
ago is not what we want to show people

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,060
today because we've learned a lot more

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,160
things coding standards have changed the

00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,200
things the tools we use have changed and

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,560
so that code becomes out-of-date very

00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,840
quickly so what we're going to talk

00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,060
about today are ways that you can help

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,120
build confidence in your code keep that

00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:43,580
code cleaner longer improve the quality

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,000
and security of your code and make it

00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:48,800
easier to integrate with other projects

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,380
now what this talk is not going to be is

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,390
it's not going to be me putting code

00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,890
samples up and talking about refactoring

00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:56,660
existing code samples i'm not going to

00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,760
show you code samples what i'm going to

00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:01,550
be talking about is how do you as a

00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,650
developer keep learning keep up on

00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:05,900
up-to-date things find the information

00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:09,320
there's tons of information out there on

00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:11,600
the internet how much of it is true mm

00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,160
maybe two to three percent okay there's

00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,630
a lot of bad information out on the

00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:18,980
internet so where do we find those

00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:21,019
trusted sources so I've been coding for

00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:23,930
a very long time well would I consider a

00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:26,450
very long time I started coding on PHP 3

00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:28,790
and I have been through several

00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:30,620
iterations of PHP since then I'm happy

00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:33,560
to report all of my code is now at least

00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:35,989
on 52 I have a few clients that are very

00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,000
strongly resisting upgrading past 52 but

00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:39,950
I'm working on them so I've been through

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,170
a lot of changes in the language and a

00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:44,410
lot of changes and how we expect things

00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:47,180
to look and how we expect things to work

00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:49,910
now I've also collected a lot of bad

00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:52,940
habits along the way so about a year ago

00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:55,010
I was reading an issue of PHP architect

00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,480
which I used to be the editor of PHP

00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:59,989
architect so I've read most of the

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:03,049
issues of PHP architect so I was reading

00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:04,940
an article by Aaron sarey and he was

00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:06,410
calling his his column was called the

00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,299
confident coder and he was talking about

00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:10,100
different small things you can do to

00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:11,570
improve your code so you can feel more

00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,280
confident sharing it with other people

00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:14,989
and that was the inspiration for this

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,090
talk because I thought that is a great

00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:20,299
idea I would love to feel more confident

00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:23,270
sharing my code with other people and so

00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:25,820
I set out to try to find resources and

00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:27,349
ways to improve things that are small

00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,300
enough that I can implement them in my

00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:33,080
day-to-day

00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:34,849
so if you have ever heard of or have

00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,379
ever heard any of my talks you have

00:04:34,849 --> 00:04:38,780
heard me talk about an S word quite a

00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:42,580
bit it is my favorite s word to talk

00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:45,110
about during talks and it is standards

00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:48,440
now there are a lot of standards out

00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:49,970
there and I will admit that I was with

00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,659
all of you several years ago when I

00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:55,009
heard standards i thought okay yes i

00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:56,870
should follow a standard but it's

00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:58,940
obnoxious and I like the way I code and

00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:00,440
it's easy for me to read and I don't

00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,090
share my code with other people so why

00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:06,199
do I care if other people can read my

00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:07,879
code okay well that's fine but in this

00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:09,500
day and age it's really hard not to

00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:12,050
share your code with other people it's

00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,240
really hard to stay in a project where

00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:17,240
no one else will ever see your code and

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,430
it's a very very dangerous situation to

00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,310
be in if no one ever sees your code if

00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:24,110
no one ever sees your code there's no

00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:26,449
one giving you new ideas about your code

00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:27,979
there's no one giving you inspiration to

00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:29,270
improve your code and there's no one

00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:32,000
pointing out things that maybe you

00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:34,250
didn't know about so sharing code is not

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,199
just a matter of oh I wrote this library

00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,479
and I'm open sourcing it to the world

00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:41,419
even the code you working on is

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,219
important to share even bits of it maybe

00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:44,960
you can't actually share the source code

00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:46,940
itself but you can talk about what

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,469
you're doing and have that sort of back

00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:51,139
and forth with other developers to

00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:53,360
improve things now there are a lot of

00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:54,889
standards out there and i'll be honest i

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,750
don't care which one you use I have a

00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:58,699
small opinion but I honestly don't care

00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:01,669
which one you use now that may seem a

00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:02,990
little strange why have lots of

00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:05,539
different standards shouldn't we all

00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:07,759
just have one standard well in an ideal

00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:09,680
world yes but we don't live an ideal

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,029
world we live in the real world and in

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,710
the real world people have different

00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:14,270
opinions on what is the correct standard

00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,759
to use and what's the correct way to

00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:18,860
format code so I'm going to tell you

00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:20,330
here and now that it doesn't matter

00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,400
which standards you use but it's

00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:24,529
important that you use a standard and

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,349
the reason for that is even if you and I

00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:29,389
don't use the same standard just knowing

00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:31,699
which standard each of us uses gives us

00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:33,800
insight into the other person's code we

00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:35,509
know what to expect from the code we

00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,520
know what to expect from the formatting

00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:40,339
and it's going to be consistent as we

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,899
read through it so even if you are using

00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:43,100
a different standard than someone else

00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:48,800
there's still a

00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:51,010
to each of you using that standard sorry

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,350
I should have flipped this slide earlier

00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:55,730
so one of the basic standards that you

00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:58,190
can use and this is the one I have

00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:01,700
slight preference that you pick is the

00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:03,650
PSR standards from PHP fig PHP fig is

00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,600
the framework interoperability group and

00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:07,160
it's a group of project owners or

00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,990
representatives who have come together

00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,780
to try to set up some very basic

00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:14,000
standards for projects to follow this is

00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,290
to help unify the projects make it

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,990
easier to share code between the

00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:20,150
projects but also to make it easier for

00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:22,040
you as developers to move back and forth

00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,630
between projects because let's be honest

00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,240
how many of us get to only use one

00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:28,040
project ever in our career no we have to

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,840
use lots of tools so let's make it

00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,690
easier for developers to switch back and

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,840
forth between tools they have two basic

00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:37,730
coding standards PS r1 and PS are two

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,830
they're both pretty brief they're not

00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:41,660
very detailed they're pretty simple it's

00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:45,470
a pretty easy switch over for most

00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:47,060
people they do have other PSRs as well

00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,740
but they refer to other things besides

00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:53,390
your coding style so these are the two

00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:55,010
coding style ones now if you want to go

00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:57,410
through and fix all of your code to

00:07:55,010 --> 00:08:00,590
match these it can be very very tedious

00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:02,270
it is a good way to learn the coding

00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:05,240
standard very well having to go through

00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:08,240
and reformat your code but there are

00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,430
tools out there to help so senseo Labs

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,620
has created the PHP coding standards

00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:15,050
fixer it will go through now it create

00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:17,630
fixes most issues it is not going to

00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:19,490
make it perfect but it will do a lot of

00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:21,920
the spacing and the more tedious things

00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,660
for you so this is a very very easy way

00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,790
to get your code up to date on a

00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:29,330
standard without having to spend a lot

00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:34,340
of effort yourself doing it it is p sr 1

00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:37,010
and p sr to compliance also if you're

00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:38,990
using an IDE since your labs the PHP

00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:42,320
coding standard fixer has plug-ins for

00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:45,680
many of the major IDEs like vim and

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,590
sublime text NetBeans and phpstorm and

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,350
so on so it can even go right into your

00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:55,140
IDE and sort through your code and make

00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:57,120
things formatted nicely for you

00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,350
if you'd like a way to make sure that

00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,700
you're following the standard because

00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,990
who doesn't want someone telling them

00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,940
that they're not following the standard

00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,910
right so if you would like someone to

00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,290
tell you every time you miss something

00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:09,150
PHP code sniffer will go through and let

00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:11,340
you know everything you've missed for

00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:13,170
matching your standard PHP code sniffer

00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:16,560
follows all of the major standards if

00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:19,350
you're using zend pair the PSRs from fig

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,910
all of those are already built in you

00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,220
just select it in the config file and

00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,450
you're good to go PHP code sniffer will

00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,770
also allow you to choose multiple

00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:29,460
standards so if you need to follow

00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:32,700
multiple standards as well PHP code

00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,930
sniffer will go through and you put

00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,820
something through it and it gives you an

00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:37,530
output and it tells you the line number

00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,060
and what's wrong and it's pretty

00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:42,270
detailed about what's wrong so you know

00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:45,240
what to fix also it has a handy little

00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:47,400
column here with X's in it well you hope

00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,930
there's X's and a lot of them and PHP

00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,240
code sniffer will actually fix those

00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:53,910
items automatically for you if they have

00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,710
an X there so PHP code sniffer can also

00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:59,370
automatically help you reformat your

00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:01,620
code so even though a standard can be

00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:03,030
very very painful to switch to you have

00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,160
to relearn muscle memory when you're

00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:06,720
typing you have to remember lots of

00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,000
little tedious things that don't seem

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,800
important at the time there are tools

00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,770
out there to help make the switch easier

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:17,850
so take advantage of the tools and get

00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:20,700
to know the new formatting going along

00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:22,710
with that there's lots of IDEs out there

00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,240
that will help enforce coding standards

00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,950
as you type or will help you do the

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,830
formatting especially spacing and things

00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:31,440
like that so if you take a look sublime

00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:35,400
text phpstorm vim all of these will help

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,230
you format IDEs again I don't care which

00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,820
one you use a lot of people have a lot

00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,990
of opinions on which one is best and I

00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,480
will let them tell you about their

00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:44,850
favorite one but it doesn't matter which

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,850
one you use but take a look at ids and

00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:49,830
see IDEs are just like standards they

00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:52,650
take a big amount of effort to get

00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:54,300
started but once you are going they make

00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:56,490
things easier if they make things faster

00:10:54,300 --> 00:11:01,020
especially following standards and

00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:03,810
things like that and now we're up to my

00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:07,020
second favorite S word so my second

00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:08,209
favorite s word is security security is

00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,009
one of those things that

00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:12,290
has been around a long time we all know

00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:14,600
about security and yet somehow the world

00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:16,490
keeps having tons and tons of security

00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,249
problems and the reason for that is

00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:21,490
security is often pushed off it is often

00:11:19,249 --> 00:11:24,170
skipped because of time constraints

00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:25,819
money constraints Oh we'll add it in

00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:27,619
later right now we just need to get the

00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:30,499
functionality out there so people will

00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:33,050
start using it and so security becomes

00:11:30,499 --> 00:11:34,850
sort of this tack on thing that we worry

00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:36,800
about after the project is done and

00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:39,589
that's the wrong way to be talking about

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,309
security part of being a bold coder

00:11:39,589 --> 00:11:44,720
needs to be that you put security first

00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:47,029
security needs to be at the forefront of

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,100
development not afterwards it is so much

00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:51,199
easier to build security and from the

00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:53,269
start than to try to add it in later

00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:56,029
when you try to add it in later things

00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:59,329
get messed things get messy so it's

00:11:56,029 --> 00:12:01,399
important to build it in up front now

00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:03,290
security is constantly changing some of

00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:04,910
it stays very much the same and we still

00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:06,920
miss those things but a lot of it

00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:09,050
changes so how do you stay current on

00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:11,149
security there's a lot of different

00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:14,179
things out there now this first link on

00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:16,970
the PHP net manual this page is so

00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:18,589
horribly out of date but it still has

00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:20,389
some things that are very very useful

00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:23,449
for today and it's important to know

00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:25,279
what kinds of things are vulnerable so

00:12:23,449 --> 00:12:27,649
take a look at that page but like i said

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,709
it's very up-to-date so don't think that

00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:32,990
that page gives you everything you need

00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:34,519
the OWASP site as well they have a PHP

00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,549
security cheat sheet that they just

00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:38,480
recently updated a few weeks ago and

00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:41,509
that will give you some more information

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,189
on current PHP security vulnerabilities

00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:45,740
things you should watch out for things

00:12:43,189 --> 00:12:47,779
you should use in your code owasp also

00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,939
does their top 10 project every year if

00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:52,220
you look through the top 10 project for

00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:53,990
the past few years it's the top 10

00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,970
security vulnerabilities you'll notice

00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:58,879
the list is pretty similar every year

00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:01,249
and that's because so many people still

00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:04,009
put off security and so what we need to

00:13:01,249 --> 00:13:05,899
do is really take a good hard look at

00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:07,369
these items and make sure that we start

00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:11,209
formatting our code to prevent these

00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:13,519
things web sakiyo does application

00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:17,410
security as well so that one's a little

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:19,999
more a little more broad than just PHP I

00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:21,510
won't point out individual people too

00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,250
often but I'm going to point out

00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,930
Chris coordinates stuff here when it

00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,970
deals with security he is very very

00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:29,610
passionate about security and PHP and

00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:32,130
has some great resources out there he

00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:34,350
has a book available on lean pub he also

00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:36,990
has a number of presentations that you

00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:38,880
can watch up on speaker deck and he also

00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:41,880
runs a website that's a division of

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,800
website do called securing PHP calm and

00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:46,110
they have a lot of great information

00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,940
there and a mailing list that you can

00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:49,290
sign up for security information right

00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,970
in your email box you don't even have to

00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:56,220
remember to go look for it it shows up

00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:57,630
right in your email so once our code is

00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:00,570
secure we need to make sure it actually

00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:03,600
runs so we need to test our code so unit

00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:06,450
testing is very important now unit

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,680
testing is extra work up front all of

00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:09,660
these things that I talked about our

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,110
extra work up front and sometimes it's

00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:14,730
really hard to sell people on that but

00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:16,770
putting in the extra effort up front is

00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:19,590
going to save you so much time later on

00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:21,420
so take the time upfront do some unit

00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:22,800
testing make sure your code does what it

00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,810
needs to do and when you make changes

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,850
later on you can run those unit tests

00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:28,380
very quickly and feel more confident

00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:32,040
that the changes that you're making are

00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:34,980
not harming the code now writing unit

00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,660
tests like I said takes a long time so

00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,730
if you do not have time to write a unit

00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:41,070
test for everything that doesn't mean

00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:43,170
you should not unit test your code that

00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:45,300
means start with the items that are most

00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:48,150
critical what is the most critical part

00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:50,400
of your app which part of your

00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:52,440
application if it goes down will someone

00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,780
lose their job okay take a look at that

00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,660
part first which part handles money

00:14:54,780 --> 00:15:00,180
which part handles personal information

00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:02,190
for your clients start with unit testing

00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:05,460
those sections of your application if

00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:07,470
you unit tests even just those few parts

00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,420
you are making your application more

00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:13,410
secure and more stable and more reliable

00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:14,970
for you to make changes to it which part

00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:17,280
of the application do you change most

00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:18,930
often unit tests that part and you're

00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,820
going to save yourself testing time in

00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:22,920
the long run the more changes that you

00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,930
make to something the more handy it can

00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,910
be for you to have unit tests so don't

00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:29,040
feel like it has to be this mountainous

00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:31,200
task where you have to unit test

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,090
everything or nothing it's not an

00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,279
all-or-nothing game start with the

00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:38,639
things are going to benefit the most

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:41,310
unit test those if you need help with

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,110
unit testing if you've ever looked up

00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:44,939
unit testing online you'll probably hear

00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:47,069
about Chris heart says he is the grumpy

00:15:44,939 --> 00:15:49,499
programmer on Twitter I swear he's

00:15:47,069 --> 00:15:51,029
honestly a very very nice person and he

00:15:49,499 --> 00:15:53,850
would love to help you with testing and

00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:55,559
he has lots of resources available as

00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,809
well so if you have a question about

00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:59,459
testing hit him up on Twitter he's very

00:15:57,809 --> 00:16:01,620
responsive very good at answering

00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:04,350
questions there is help out there for

00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:06,809
unit testing so give it a try and get

00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:08,970
started if you're looking for a little

00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:12,180
bit more complete system you can use a

00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:15,089
testing framework phpunit is one of the

00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:17,519
most popular PHP testing frameworks lots

00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:19,559
of plug-ins for it lots of easy ways to

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:25,649
install it lots of good tutorials online

00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:27,569
so it's pretty easy to get started next

00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:29,550
up another thing that everyone hates to

00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:32,519
talk about but everybody needs to do is

00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:34,350
documenting your code now I don't know

00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:36,809
about you but I really hate documenting

00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:38,249
my code because what I would always do

00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:39,629
is wait until i was done writing

00:16:38,249 --> 00:16:41,189
everything and then I'd have to go back

00:16:39,629 --> 00:16:45,240
and figure out what I was doing and

00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:48,300
document it so what I like to do is use

00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,519
PHP documenter now it says it automates

00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:53,459
documentation which I really wish meant

00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:55,199
it wrote your documentation for you but

00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:56,579
what it does is it forces you to write

00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,430
your documentation as you're writing

00:16:56,579 --> 00:17:01,170
your code and what that does puts the

00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:03,689
documentation right in your code block

00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:05,100
right where the information is so when

00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:07,230
you go back and you make changes to that

00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:09,209
section of code later on the

00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:13,850
documentation is right there for you to

00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:16,620
update it goes through and it takes

00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:20,309
comment format here you can use markdown

00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:24,539
in it you can be very specific yeah yeah

00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:27,449
it's very similar mm-hmm so goes through

00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:29,100
you can use markdown in it it's very

00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:30,830
very specific and how you want it

00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,059
formatted or you can make it very simple

00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:35,070
but as long as you have something just

00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:37,049
documenting a little bit about it it's

00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:38,970
important for other people to be able to

00:17:37,049 --> 00:17:40,380
figure out what your code is doing but

00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:42,000
it's also important for you to be able

00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:44,220
to figure out what your code is doing a

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,780
lot of the code that you wrote two years

00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,980
ago it's going to take you a little

00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,940
while to read through it and figure out

00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,800
why exactly did I do this straight

00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,570
thing I know there was a reason and I

00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,580
can't remember just make a little note

00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:57,670
to yourself let you let yourself know

00:17:54,580 --> 00:18:00,160
okay you know marketing said we had to

00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:01,900
do it this way and this piece is too old

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,700
to interface with this so I had to do

00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,930
this kind of a thing you know write

00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,790
yourself a little note about why

00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:10,420
anything out of the ordinary had to

00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:12,460
happen PHP documentary then takes those

00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:15,120
comments and gives you a nice HTML

00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:18,190
output this is very nice it's it's

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,230
searchable it is table of contents and

00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:21,910
structured everything's very nice when

00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:25,800
you go back in and update the document

00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:28,510
comment with your code you rerun the

00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:31,030
didn't you rerun the documentation and

00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:32,890
now everywhere that is mentioned is

00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:34,900
automatically changed no more long

00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:36,610
finding replaces trying to figure out

00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:40,930
where you mentioned whatever you need to

00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:42,430
change it's all done very very handy so

00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:45,040
it makes documenting your code easier

00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:46,630
and if someone wants to invent something

00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,700
that self documents that would be

00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:50,680
awesome but in the meantime at least

00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:52,600
this will force us to do it a little bit

00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,850
by little bit and once you get in the

00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:57,490
habit of commenting your code as you

00:18:54,850 --> 00:19:01,840
write it it becomes habit and it becomes

00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:05,710
very easy to do the next step is knowing

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:08,170
the language now we all know PHP that's

00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:09,910
why we're here right but PHP is

00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:12,670
constantly changing and constantly

00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:15,730
evolving and it is a huge language with

00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:19,200
lots of features lots of tools but the

00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:21,490
base language is something that everyone

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,520
could use a little refresher on I'm

00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:27,040
guessing I know even after 15 years of

00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:29,740
PHP i still need refreshers on some of

00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:31,540
the things i don't use very often or new

00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,620
functions that have been added there's

00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:35,920
lots of different things out there

00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:37,960
things become deprecated things you know

00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,610
security vulnerabilities are discovered

00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,280
there are lots of reasons to stay

00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:45,160
current and PHP net is an amazing

00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:48,010
website as a language we are so lucky to

00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,960
have PHP net other languages have lots

00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:52,650
of paid resources that are great but we

00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:55,120
have a free resource that's amazing if

00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:57,280
you haven't looked at php.net in a while

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,280
it has gotten an overhaul recently but

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,650
it still has tons of great information

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,919
but don't just stop there even if you

00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,179
know

00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:05,919
the function that you're going to be

00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:07,350
using take a quick look at the manual

00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:11,409
page and just see if anything's changed

00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:13,330
see if they've added any new notes check

00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:15,309
the see also if this function does

00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:16,869
almost what you want but not quite and

00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:19,210
you're about to write a function to

00:20:16,869 --> 00:20:21,039
modify what it does to try to make it do

00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:23,259
what you want it to do just take a quick

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,999
look at this see also see if there's a

00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:27,159
related function that actually already

00:20:24,999 --> 00:20:30,759
does what you want it to do new things

00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:32,879
are being added all the time but don't

00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:35,859
just stop there keep scrolling down we

00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:38,259
have user contributed notes on all the

00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:40,570
document pages are all the manual pages

00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:44,409
now not all of these are good user

00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:46,210
contributed notes okay but but each of

00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:49,269
them can teach us something even if it's

00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:50,830
what not to do so take a look at the

00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:52,269
user contributed notes if you are

00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:54,369
struggling with something and you cannot

00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:55,840
figure out why this won't work take a

00:20:54,369 --> 00:20:57,940
look at the manual page and see if

00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,399
somebody else has also struggled with

00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:02,470
this and if they have what did they do

00:21:00,399 --> 00:21:04,809
to fix it or perhaps they struggled with

00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,460
something slightly different but it's

00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:08,649
going to spark an idea that helps you

00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:12,279
figure out what's going on so these

00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:13,899
manual pages are so important and if you

00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:15,580
have some strange bug and there's no

00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:18,720
user contributed note for it but you

00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:21,159
figure it out please tell the rest of us

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,690
they're right up in the corner there of

00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:24,820
the user contributed notes section is

00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:27,429
the add a note button click on that and

00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:30,639
share what you've learned let us know

00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:32,830
our community is so powerful because of

00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:35,379
the knowledge that we have but we need

00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:40,600
to share that and this is a great way to

00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:41,950
do it now knowing your language is

00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,830
important but also knowing your

00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:46,659
framework know your tools make sure

00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:48,700
you're using the latest version of your

00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:51,309
framework and tools I know it's tough

00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:53,379
upgrading but the benefits of the new

00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:55,570
features but most of all the security

00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:57,639
benefits are very important make sure

00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:59,889
you keep everything up to date and make

00:21:57,639 --> 00:22:04,330
sure you're aware of when new article

00:21:59,889 --> 00:22:05,980
new versions come out other places that

00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:08,320
you can go to become more familiar with

00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:10,269
a project go to github take a look at

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,879
the code that's involved in your project

00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:14,649
look through and see what new things are

00:22:12,879 --> 00:22:15,450
being added what feature requests have

00:22:14,649 --> 00:22:18,510
been requested

00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:20,130
and take a look and once you've gotten

00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:23,250
familiar with the code for your favorite

00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:24,960
project try contributing to it it's a

00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:26,490
great way to practice the standards that

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,769
you're going to be using it's a great

00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:31,529
way to get feedback on your coding style

00:22:28,769 --> 00:22:33,059
now I know it's painful when someone

00:22:31,529 --> 00:22:37,830
comes back to your commit and is like

00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:39,779
nope try again okay but it's a learning

00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:41,970
experience don't take it personally I

00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:43,740
know we love our code and it's our baby

00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:46,590
and we just made it and presented it to

00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:49,529
the world but it's just code okay we can

00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:51,899
rewrite it we can make it better so take

00:22:49,529 --> 00:22:54,389
your code put it out there get some

00:22:51,899 --> 00:22:56,519
feedback on it and see what suggestions

00:22:54,389 --> 00:23:00,210
they have take that and then make

00:22:56,519 --> 00:23:01,769
yourself a better developer if you're

00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:04,230
looking for an automated way to check

00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:06,120
your code one thing you can do there's a

00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:07,950
number of automated checking tools out

00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,169
there so you can go through they are

00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:11,669
free for open source projects a lot of

00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:13,740
them have free trials if you'd like to

00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:16,980
check it out and there are a number of

00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:18,809
them out there so senseo insight goes

00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,850
through if you're using a symphony

00:23:18,809 --> 00:23:23,070
projects nco insight is fantastic

00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:25,529
because it has symphony specific checks

00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:27,539
so if you're doing symphony that can be

00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:30,510
a good one it's also going to check your

00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:31,950
XML and your EML and one thing that's

00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,880
really awesome about this one is it's

00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:35,100
going to check your composure

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,929
dependencies so if you're using composer

00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,820
this can help check your composure

00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:43,049
dependencies for vulnerabilities as well

00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:45,630
which is very very beneficial scrutinize

00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:48,000
ER is another one scrutinize are also

00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:51,120
besides PHP will check Python and Ruby

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,830
as well and what scrutinize ER does is

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,710
it takes a lot of the open source tools

00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:57,659
out there like your PHP code sniffer PHP

00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:59,279
mess detector and a number of others and

00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:01,289
it's going to give you a nice gooey

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:05,460
admin panel to see the results of all of

00:24:01,289 --> 00:24:07,350
them makes it easy to run now because it

00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:09,960
does run all of these different open

00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:14,399
source tools it does take a little while

00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:16,320
to run but it's worth the wait and of

00:24:14,399 --> 00:24:18,059
course I work for code climate just my

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:22,110
disclaimer but we do automate a code

00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:27,559
review as well we do PHP JavaScript Ruby

00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:29,220
and almost Python very soon so again

00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:31,860
automated code review

00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:33,870
very very helpful it's a really quick

00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:36,120
way to have a second set of eyes

00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:39,270
double-check your code without having to

00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,710
share your code publicly so it can help

00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:42,179
make you a little bit more confident

00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:44,159
about your code before you put it out

00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:53,909
there for everyone else to nitpick as

00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:58,159
well yeah mm-hmm excuse it again Oh on

00:24:53,909 --> 00:25:00,840
premise yeah I'm not sure about senseo

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,460
code climate does yes code climate does

00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:05,070
have an on-premise version it works with

00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:07,409
all flavors of get so if you are using

00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:10,260
get behind your firewall like a private

00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:11,880
get installation you we have it's called

00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:14,460
the enterprise platform and then it's

00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,679
it's it doesn't send anything out it

00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:22,620
stays on your server yeah otherwise it

00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:31,280
works as a like a SAS okay any other

00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:34,080
questions okay so the biggest oops sorry

00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:37,140
the biggest thing about being a bold

00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,760
coder is to never stop learning now the

00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:40,710
moment you stop learning is the moment

00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,419
you become obsolete as a programmer you

00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:44,669
may still be able to function as a

00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:46,890
programmer but you're no longer going to

00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:49,830
be a good programmer programming is

00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:51,809
constantly changing it is constantly

00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:53,880
evolving new things are added all the

00:25:51,809 --> 00:25:56,190
time new vulnerabilities are discovered

00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:59,309
all the time so maintaining this sort of

00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:02,220
continuous learning is absolutely

00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:04,320
necessary and important but how do you

00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:06,510
keep learning where do you find the

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,100
resources you need as we already

00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:10,350
discovered lots of things on the

00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,590
internet or maybe not true so it's

00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:16,530
important to find valid resources and

00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:19,169
take a look if you find something and it

00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:20,400
says do it this way well take a look a

00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:21,960
little further and see if you can find

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,850
other people that agree that you should

00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,919
do it that way don't just take one

00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:29,970
resource make sure you're checking lots

00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:31,830
of resources and there are resources out

00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:33,870
there for every kind of learning style

00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:36,330
however you would like to learn there

00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:38,789
are resources out there for you you can

00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:42,000
learn by reading PHP architect magazine

00:26:38,789 --> 00:26:43,070
publishes every month they have digital

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,630
formats and

00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:46,880
version so if you like reading on-screen

00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:49,130
you can do that if you like reading more

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:53,000
paper you can do that too whichever way

00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:55,880
they have new articles all the time PHP

00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,230
the right way is a group effort to put

00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:01,610
best practices out there so take a look

00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:03,710
PHP the right way goes through and talks

00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:05,809
about formatting your code spacing your

00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:07,340
code good ways to format things good

00:27:05,809 --> 00:27:09,769
ways to implement things good ways to

00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:13,190
talk to AP is lots of great information

00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:15,230
on that website and PHP developer or

00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:16,879
goes through and aggregates blog posts

00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:19,370
news articles everything you need to

00:27:16,879 --> 00:27:21,289
know they tag everything so if you want

00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:23,240
just security stuff then just follow

00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:25,519
their security tag if you want new

00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,590
features you can do that so take a look

00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:29,419
it's a great way to quickly scan through

00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:34,370
so that you're not stuck trying to find

00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:36,259
blog post to read lean pub if you're not

00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:38,899
familiar with lean pub it's a way to

00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:40,789
self publish books you can get books

00:27:38,899 --> 00:27:42,470
that are in progress but the best thing

00:27:40,789 --> 00:27:44,659
about lean pub is when you buy a book

00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:47,659
and that book gets updated you get the

00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:49,549
updates so your book is not static and

00:27:47,659 --> 00:27:51,230
be coming out of date as long as the

00:27:49,549 --> 00:27:52,940
author is still working on the book you

00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:54,799
are getting new information so take a

00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:57,019
look at lean pub it's a really neat way

00:27:54,799 --> 00:28:00,230
of course amazon in your local library

00:27:57,019 --> 00:28:03,529
are going to have books as well if you

00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:05,960
prefer to watch presentations nomad PHP

00:28:03,529 --> 00:28:09,529
does presentations every month they have

00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:11,990
a European time slot and a u.s. time

00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:14,570
slot so they will go through and they

00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:16,789
have great presentations amazing

00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:18,169
speakers there's one main talk and a

00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:19,549
couple of lightning talks so there's

00:28:18,169 --> 00:28:21,830
usually a couple of different topics

00:28:19,549 --> 00:28:23,870
being covered and if you miss a

00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:26,090
presentation you can also purchase the

00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:27,470
videos later on so you don't even have

00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:29,240
to be there if you're out of the office

00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:32,600
or whatever you can still get the

00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:34,700
presentation all of the stocks at this

00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,590
conference and previous PHP UK

00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:38,779
conferences are available for free on

00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:41,000
YouTube so take a look they have a

00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:42,860
youtube channel and go through and you

00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,809
can see all of the presentations that

00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:49,190
you've missed so there's no excuse for

00:28:44,809 --> 00:28:52,789
missing any PHP UK talks PHP academy'

00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:56,120
also has items up on YouTube PHP Academy

00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:56,809
has tutorials on different frameworks

00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,029
and library

00:28:56,809 --> 00:29:00,919
is different language constructs getting

00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:04,129
started with various things so lots of

00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:07,129
good tutorials there as well and then in

00:29:04,129 --> 00:29:08,929
plural sites and Tut's also does they do

00:29:07,129 --> 00:29:10,730
paid training so you can take a look at

00:29:08,929 --> 00:29:12,769
videos there I believe pluralsight has

00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:15,830
some that are free and it tuts+ might

00:29:12,769 --> 00:29:17,690
also but those are paid services but

00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:20,960
they have lots of tutorials and videos

00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:22,789
you can watch as well if you prefer to

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,210
take live training there are places out

00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:29,090
there that do live PHP treat live PHP

00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:31,100
training as well PHP architect does

00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:33,470
trainings ends is training and code

00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:36,499
Academy also has training so these are

00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:38,240
different ways that you can learn learn

00:29:36,499 --> 00:29:42,110
with an instructor there to answer your

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:44,330
questions right away you can learn just

00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:46,519
by listening there are lots of podcasts

00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:48,139
out there that are great dev hell i

00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:50,269
mentioned Chris Hart says earlier with

00:29:48,139 --> 00:29:52,970
the unit testing he runs a podcast along

00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:55,999
with Ed finkler called dev help it is

00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:58,580
abusing not entirely safe for work but a

00:29:55,999 --> 00:30:01,759
lot of fun and it's a great way to sort

00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:04,610
of keep an eye on what's going on other

00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:07,129
podcasts loosely coupled PHP Town Hall

00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:09,470
that podcast and there's a lot of

00:30:07,129 --> 00:30:11,480
different series you can watch tons of

00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:13,519
podcasts out there I'm only mentioning

00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,289
just a couple but there are lots of them

00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:18,860
out there you can stay on top of things

00:30:15,289 --> 00:30:20,929
with podcasts as well and I would say to

00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:23,029
when you're dealing with podcasts and

00:30:20,929 --> 00:30:25,399
articles and things like that it's good

00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:28,279
to search for PHP specific ones but

00:30:25,399 --> 00:30:30,039
security is kind of generic and so if

00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:33,259
another language has a security issue

00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:34,820
it's possible we do too so it's good to

00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:36,440
keep an eye on what other languages are

00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:39,649
discovering new features that they're

00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:41,240
adding because we're always happy to you

00:30:39,649 --> 00:30:42,679
know take someone else's idea and merge

00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,419
it into ours and make our language

00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:46,519
better too so if we keep an eye out on

00:30:44,419 --> 00:30:50,749
what everyone's doing we can all learn

00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:52,730
more if you'd like to practice online

00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:55,070
there's a number of different places

00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:57,529
that do coding Coty's and these are just

00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:59,480
practice exercise where it's not so much

00:30:57,529 --> 00:31:01,460
important that you find one right answer

00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,049
that's not what these are about these

00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,879
are about practicing different coding

00:31:03,049 --> 00:31:11,559
styles or practicing different coding

00:31:04,879 --> 00:31:11,559
methods excuse me just for a second

00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:27,059
okay so practice coding I mean they

00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:28,380
always say practice makes perfect but

00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:30,780
it's actually perfect practice makes

00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:32,490
perfect so take a look at the

00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:34,320
suggestions that these places are doing

00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:36,450
and practice doing things that way

00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,070
pretty soon it'll become old hats and

00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:40,380
you'll be very comfortable doing it that

00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:42,929
way so practice the new things that

00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:45,630
you're doing and PHP code pad is a

00:31:42,929 --> 00:31:49,050
website that allows you to enter in some

00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:51,840
PHP code and it will lint it and render

00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:54,000
it for you and so it's a very simple way

00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,470
to practice PHP without setting up a

00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,900
test server somewhere and going through

00:31:55,470 --> 00:32:01,620
everything to install PHP you can just

00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:02,970
practice there's if you'd like if you

00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:05,610
prefer getting your information via

00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:07,320
email there are a number of great

00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:09,030
mailing lists out there but the two i'm

00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,040
going to highlight our securing PHP's

00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:13,140
mailing list its security information

00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:15,150
right in your mailbox they don't send

00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:17,820
out to money it's like once every two

00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:19,679
weeks or so I think so it's not going to

00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:21,390
flood your mailbox but it's good to keep

00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,970
an eye on this kinds of stuff as it

00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:28,980
comes out PHP weekly as you may guess

00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:31,350
comes out weekly most of the time um and

00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:33,330
it's another great resource it's a great

00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:35,190
place to find out about new things that

00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:36,900
are being released conferences that are

00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:39,960
coming up talks you can listen to

00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:42,090
resources online it's really a great

00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,640
quick read it's not I mean it's a long

00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:49,620
newsletter but it's easily scannable so

00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:51,360
another great one to sign up for another

00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:53,090
great way to learn is learning by

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,559
hanging out that sounds a little strange

00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:59,340
but the PHP community if you're not

00:32:55,559 --> 00:33:01,200
familiar is extremely active on IRC most

00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:03,210
specifically freenode there are a number

00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,950
of different channels PHP see is the

00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:06,960
community channel it is not a help

00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:08,460
channel but it's a good place to get to

00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,790
know people who know the answers you

00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:13,230
need and PHP women has a channel and PHP

00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:16,290
mentoring has a channel there are a

00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:19,290
large number of channels out there so

00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:20,790
try I RC if you're not familiar with IRC

00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:22,870
and you don't have an IRC client

00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:25,990
installed freenode has on

00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:27,520
website web chat free no net and you can

00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:29,680
actually chat right from the freenode

00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:31,570
website through a GUI interface so very

00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:35,110
easy to try out IRC if you've never used

00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:40,480
it before I promise we're very nice pop

00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:43,480
in and say hello but I think the best

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:46,120
way to learn and the way I have

00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:48,580
personally learned the most is mentoring

00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:50,920
and that's not just finding a mentor for

00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:54,309
you but it's also mentoring other people

00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:56,170
there is nothing better than having to

00:33:54,309 --> 00:33:57,670
really know your stuff because someone's

00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:59,650
about to ask you questions about it

00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:02,350
there's I find nothing more motivating

00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:03,580
to learn something very very well then

00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:07,690
knowing people are going to ask me

00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:10,360
questions about it so mentoring is it

00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:12,850
works both ways I actually learn more I

00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:14,590
think from being a mentor but it's

00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:20,080
invaluable how much I've learned being

00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:23,740
mentored so how do you find a mentor

00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:25,780
well PHP mentoring org has lots of

00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:27,310
mentors available there are actually

00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:29,530
more mentors right now than there are

00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:31,600
people looking for mentors on PHP

00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:34,510
mentoring so if you want a mentor there

00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:36,520
are a line of people waiting for you so

00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:38,830
please stop by PHP mentoring that Oregon

00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:41,470
take a look other ways you can find

00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:43,600
mentors take a look at slideshare.net or

00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:45,790
speaker deck take a look at joined in

00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,770
find people who are giving talks on the

00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:49,720
topic you want to learn more about and

00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:53,409
just drop them an email hit him up on

00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:56,320
Twitter and ask everyone is always

00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:58,240
willing to help I shouldn't say everyone

00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,370
most people aren't always willing to

00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:03,730
help and even though it's intimidating

00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:06,400
to ask some of these people take a step

00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:07,960
of faith drop them a line and I think

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,060
you'll be pleasantly surprised by how

00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:12,880
many people are willing to take time out

00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:14,980
to talk to you there are lots of

00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,720
conferences out there talk to people at

00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,400
conferences who are attending the same

00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:21,010
kinds of talks that you are interested

00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,710
in or talk to the speakers see if they

00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:25,660
have anyone there are places online like

00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:27,370
no capes and voices of the elephant

00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:29,350
where they interview people in the PHP

00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:31,120
community so take a look through those

00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:32,830
archives listen to some interviews with

00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,180
people and see if you can find someone

00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:36,250
talking about what you want to learn

00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:37,710
about these are all great ways to find

00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:40,360
people

00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:41,950
but since having an apprentice is a

00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,450
great way to learn to if you are looking

00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:45,220
for an apprentice of course you can come

00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:46,720
to PHP mentoring although like I said

00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:49,090
there's a long line for the apprentices

00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,430
there but you can take a look in the

00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:54,010
various IRC channels even just check

00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:55,420
stack overflow and reddit who are asking

00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:57,550
questions about the things you know

00:35:55,420 --> 00:36:03,970
about drop them a line offer to help

00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:05,890
them out find people this way local user

00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:08,890
groups are a fantastic place to find

00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:10,630
mentors and apprentices as well if you'd

00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:12,610
like to have someone local that you can

00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:16,150
meet with in person your local root user

00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:17,650
group is a great resource if you don't

00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:21,100
know where your local user group is you

00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:23,260
can take a look at PHP ug or php.net

00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:25,510
also has a calendar of user group events

00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:27,970
and meetup is another place where a lot

00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:32,650
of user groups a lot of user groups are

00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:34,780
listed and of course if there's not a

00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:37,510
user group near you then guess what you

00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:38,890
just became a user group leader you

00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:40,780
should start a user group and I would

00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:43,030
love to help you will help you find

00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:46,180
sponsors will help you find a location I

00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:48,430
can't say enough how important a local

00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:50,950
user group is the networking that you

00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:53,560
build the contacts even just the sharing

00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:55,870
of ideas it is an amazing experience and

00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:58,300
I've learned so much from mine and so I

00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:59,980
really I want that for every one of you

00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,810
so if you are interested in starting a

00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:05,460
user group let us know there is a lot of

00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:08,140
support for people starting user groups

00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:10,270
another great way to you have to learn

00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:12,850
something is to offer to speak about it

00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:14,410
as you use your group or a conference so

00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:16,750
if you have to get up in front of people

00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:18,630
and talk about something this is great

00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:20,770
motivation to learn it very well and

00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:23,470
there are a lot of resources out there

00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:25,120
to help you speak now speaking not only

00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:27,010
helps you learn something but it gets

00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:29,560
your name out there it helps you build

00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:30,790
those contacts again you start learning

00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,980
about people who are asking you

00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:35,050
questions and you start finding people

00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:37,390
who offer you suggestions and you build

00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:40,090
that Network out a network is so

00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:42,010
important it helps keep everyone on

00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:44,350
their toes it helps all with suggestions

00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:46,720
coming in helps you find someone maybe

00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:48,040
to pair program with or help you talk

00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,660
through something you're struggling with

00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,450
you can't quite figure out what is the

00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:52,460
best way to do

00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:55,730
something having a network of developers

00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:57,500
that you can reach out to is amazing and

00:37:55,730 --> 00:38:02,450
these are some resources for speaking at

00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:03,560
conferences these are some links where

00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:05,240
you can actually find out which

00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:07,760
conferences are available to speak at

00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,820
and I will put my slides online they

00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:14,030
should be online shortly after the talk

00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:15,260
and here's the resources slide for later

00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:16,520
that's why I want to tell you that my

00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:18,500
slides will be online so you don't try

00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:20,240
to read that now these are a whole bunch

00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:22,190
of articles on best practices that you

00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,839
can follow and these do go through all

00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:25,670
of the nice code samples and give you

00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:29,750
very specific information that I didn't

00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:32,810
have time to cover today so my final

00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:35,720
thoughts for you today are bold coding

00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:37,369
it's it's a big idea it's a very

00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:39,200
abstract idea it's something that we all

00:38:37,369 --> 00:38:42,320
want but aren't really sure how to get

00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:44,450
but the big thing it's not necessarily

00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,160
about your knowledge or your skills of

00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:48,890
course you have to have knowledge and

00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:51,859
skills but the most important thing is

00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:53,900
you have to be active you can't just sit

00:38:51,859 --> 00:38:56,750
back and do the same old thing every day

00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:59,510
that you'll just get left behind if you

00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:01,849
do that you need to stay active actively

00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:04,510
learning actively participating in the

00:39:01,849 --> 00:39:07,010
community actively improving your code

00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:08,990
finding new ways to do things finding

00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:11,540
better ways to do things more efficient

00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:14,900
ways to do things staying active is

00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:16,579
critical to staying not only bold but

00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:22,099
just even part of the development

00:39:16,579 --> 00:39:24,589
community all right you can find me on
