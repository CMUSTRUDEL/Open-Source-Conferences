Title: Michelle Sanver - Accessibility Done Right
Publication date: 2015-04-02
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2015
Description: 
	Unfortunately accessibility is often an afterthought. Some users canâ€™t use a mouse, others are visually impaired. In this talk I will show you how to test accessibility and how to browse your site blindfolded or with only a keyboard and still get around using things like headers and aria labels.
