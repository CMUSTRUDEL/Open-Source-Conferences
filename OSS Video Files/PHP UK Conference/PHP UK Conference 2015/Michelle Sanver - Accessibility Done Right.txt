Title: Michelle Sanver - Accessibility Done Right
Publication date: 2015-04-02
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2015
Description: 
	Unfortunately accessibility is often an afterthought. Some users canâ€™t use a mouse, others are visually impaired. In this talk I will show you how to test accessibility and how to browse your site blindfolded or with only a keyboard and still get around using things like headers and aria labels.

you

00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:12,010
good morning let's talk about

00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:15,370
accessibility done right if I'm shaking

00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:19,480
ignore it I'm stage fright I'm getting a

00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:20,800
words so as a code rabbi said learn the

00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,529
most by sharing your knowledge with

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:27,550
others so that's what I plan to do today

00:00:23,529 --> 00:00:31,949
we as you just heard I'm Michelle

00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:31,949
sunwear and here's me petting a dragon

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:41,379
I'm co-president of PHP women and as you

00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:44,770
may have seen we sell elephants here at

00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:48,520
the conference for 15 pounds or thirty

00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:50,410
dollars if you're American as sold out

00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,550
but you can go to shove the PHP women

00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:56,579
dot org and buy your elephant so if

00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:59,500
you're wondering about my accents and

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,510
Swedish and Danish lived in Netherlands

00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,699
for six years and now live in

00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:07,870
Switzerland working for this awesome

00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:12,850
company called leap I'm actually a

00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:19,360
back-end developer I work mostly with

00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:21,640
data and there's a lot more to

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:27,790
accessibility than I can possibly cover

00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:30,759
in one hour of 50 hours so i know that

00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:35,680
you're tired it's after lunch or you're

00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:38,619
all awake and want to wake yay but let's

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,780
do an after-lunch story in a way I've

00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:43,600
always been really really passionate

00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:48,280
about a lot of things but accessibility

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:51,280
you know who cares it was one of those

00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:56,229
things I just didn't think of until I

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:58,899
met Aaron Aaron his amazing he's a blind

00:01:56,229 --> 00:02:01,600
programmer and it showed me some of the

00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:05,500
things that he does how he programs

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:08,890
while being blind no one ever knows the

00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:12,160
code betterton he does and he also knows

00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:16,250
a lot about accessibility so I started

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:19,130
showing me stuff and he also said that

00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:21,290
he had a bug or his thought he had a bug

00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:24,500
because there was a little piece of dust

00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:29,420
that is Braille display yeah that never

00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:31,370
happens to me he really really really

00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:34,160
knows how to use a screen reader in

00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:37,850
speed that you can't even understand he

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:41,030
was fake i really i I don't I know

00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:49,190
clearly as a screen reader okay I know

00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:52,940
how to work okay confession time this

00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:55,730
talk is not our planet I planned to be

00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:58,400
up here with a screen reader show you

00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:01,340
how to work just like Aaron did it's

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:05,420
amazing and you blew my mind I wanted to

00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:08,420
do that but I'm not era and this talk is

00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:11,600
not about people with disabilities it's

00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:13,930
not about blind and deaf people it's not

00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:17,920
about people with cognitive disabilities

00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:22,580
it's not about men who are colorblind

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:26,480
people with motor disabilities this talk

00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:29,570
it's about people people who are using

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:33,590
the web people who are using what you

00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:36,890
are building because after all what

00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:41,860
qualifies good code code written with

00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:44,560
the user in mind code for the people

00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:48,709
then let's look at some assistive

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:52,430
technology we have screen readers which

00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:57,530
we just talked about we have text to

00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:59,090
speech we have screen magnifiers move

00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:05,420
joysticks you can use them for more than

00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:10,220
just flight simulators with keyboards we

00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:14,200
have mobile devices so what does

00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,200
assistive technology do we have

00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:27,610
a mouse maybe let me tell your secrets

00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:31,090
all technology is assistive technology

00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:34,009
we can't build websites and test it

00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:39,590
against assistive technology it's

00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:44,449
impossible how do we do that yeah so

00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:47,320
let's not do that but what if

00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:53,180
accessibility online was like

00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:57,110
accessibility in real life this is a

00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:59,590
ramp it's an awesome rap what can use it

00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:05,870
for wheelchair users can use it and when

00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:08,240
he knows it parents with strollers me

00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:15,009
with my heavy shopping on wheels it's

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:22,070
amazing some other accessibility I user

00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:27,220
experiences hotel layouts I had a story

00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:30,080
just two weeks ago at sunshine PHP

00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:32,630
something really awkward happen it

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:37,520
involved a lot of beer but I lost my

00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:40,639
glasses and without my glasses I can't

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,099
find anything I was told that in the

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:47,090
morning I will go down to the reception

00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:50,630
and I will find them so I try to find

00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:52,250
the elevator which I managed to then in

00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:56,270
the elevator had to press the button

00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:59,169
that went to the lobby it's not so hard

00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:01,789
it's a big button button it has

00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:04,580
different circle from the other button

00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:09,380
so it's really really cool good

00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:13,970
accessibility good usability here no I

00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:16,669
really hope I don't lose my glasses here

00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:18,860
to get to my hotel room I first press a

00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:21,650
button take the elevator to the first

00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:23,979
drawer then I cross a bridge I take

00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:28,670
another elevator go to another floor

00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:34,000
then I go across it crazy it's not

00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:37,280
accessible so accessibility is about

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,920
universal design you can use for

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:46,600
anything such as the ramp that whistle

00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:46,600
it's actually invented by non mais

00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:52,670
universal design is the design of

00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:55,970
products and environments to be useful

00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:59,150
by all people to the greatest extent

00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:02,720
possible without the need for adoption

00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:05,710
or specialized design without the need

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:09,680
for adoption or specialized design

00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:17,360
that's how websites should be no special

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:20,210
things no adoption nevah she ran mates

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:26,240
was an architect and these were the

00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:29,750
things he saw as universal design we can

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,090
implement it in a website it just

00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:36,590
following some guidelines and simples i

00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:40,970
will show you right now first of all

00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:45,080
keep your Yahveh script um um um um um

00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:49,870
um don't turn it off ever there's no

00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,870
reason to believe inch it has a 15

00:07:50,770 --> 00:08:00,100
remember that all functionality should

00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:00,100
work for all people for all technology

00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:09,980
all people nice so now we certainly

00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:12,800
don't have this list of people with

00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:16,640
disabilities and it makes things a lot

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:20,570
easier to deal with we simply have

00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:24,190
guidelines so one of the things that's

00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:28,390
important it's this consistent language

00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:30,680
if you don't people may get confused

00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:34,000
people who don't learn the language very

00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:36,750
well people with learning disabilities

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,200
use consistent language

00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:43,140
right out acronyms at least the first

00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:52,260
time that you use them it's pretty

00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:55,650
straightforward be clear and concise now

00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:58,170
I had to build the website that I

00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:01,320
thought was really really accessible i

00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:04,650
had read everywhere about how cool it

00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,990
will be you know then i had Aaron try it

00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:10,680
out he didn't use my accessibility

00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:13,890
features you just a semantics is good so

00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:18,240
he started browsing my website with

00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:21,540
headers my headers weren't quite so good

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:28,590
but apparently screen read their users

00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:31,380
use them a lot a lot a lot a lot they

00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:38,550
use them to navigate to come to so make

00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:40,710
sure that your headers are logical so

00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:43,260
you know when your age three just looks

00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:45,810
better than age two and you just kind of

00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,390
have that one instead for design don't

00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:50,700
ever do that someone with the screen

00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:57,570
reader will be looking for 82 and be

00:09:50,700 --> 00:10:00,300
completely confused that sucks so design

00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:02,880
it correctly and think about the

00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:05,120
semantics before you think of how it

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,120
looks

00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:23,529
also important for readability is easy

00:10:15,409 --> 00:10:23,529
to use sans-serif fonts size 12 or more

00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:42,970
keep your headers relative in order

00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:47,659
please for instance size 14 16 18 and

00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:49,639
this is probably pretty straightforward

00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:52,069
but I've seen a lot of people not doing

00:10:49,639 --> 00:11:00,199
this keep a high contrast between

00:10:52,069 --> 00:11:06,079
background and font color give you links

00:11:00,199 --> 00:11:08,509
unique and descriptive names imagine

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,459
there was no other text around it except

00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:15,220
the title of the page would you know

00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:21,409
what link says if so perfect if not

00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:24,079
don't expect others to this so i think

00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:27,919
in 2015 i don't have to say this so I'm

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:30,970
just going to skip this line and for

00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:35,539
complex tables provide a summary a

00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:44,869
summary is incredibly important for

00:11:35,539 --> 00:11:47,689
people with learning disabilities now

00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:51,470
let's look at forms first is one of the

00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:54,470
trickiest things in accessibility when

00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:56,829
four fields are not labeled property the

00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:59,899
screen reader has no clue what it does

00:11:56,829 --> 00:12:03,709
it's a forum what should I write here I

00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:06,529
have no idea so it may be impossible to

00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:11,499
tell what condom to enter in your field

00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:11,499
that sucks that's not accessible at all

00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:17,799
forms should beat apple in lack of

00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:17,799
veteran assured

00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:29,010
in visual order if it jumps from tab to

00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:32,040
tab it's really confusing yes field sets

00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:34,410
for related fields for instance if you

00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:43,530
have full name and date of birth it may

00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:48,770
be personal information great antonius

00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:52,680
only asterisks for required fields why

00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:58,910
because some screen readers may ignore

00:12:52,680 --> 00:13:02,810
it so here's when area labels comes in

00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:06,600
use them in addition to asterisks I

00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:09,480
really required true if it's a required

00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:15,210
field and area required false if it's

00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:17,940
not after submitting include the errors

00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:20,030
in a page title that works really well I

00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,030
think

00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:32,850
captcha is bad okay it should not be

00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:35,450
used to validate submissions for

00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:39,330
accessibility I know there are

00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:42,510
accessible captures but actually the

00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:46,320
pretty useless I run told me struggles

00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:49,520
with them a lot so here's a link you can

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,890
download my slides later and look at

00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:59,130
sperm free accessible forest without

00:13:52,890 --> 00:14:01,200
CAPTCHAs yes they do exist now let's

00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:04,860
talk about colors as you can probably

00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:12,630
tell i love colors and to make colors

00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:16,140
accessible well there's some tricks but

00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:23,840
often we want to use colors to leave a

00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:26,280
message so red-green color deficiency is

00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:30,870
quite common eight percent of the people

00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:36,050
who have it but we also have learning

00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:39,090
disabilities and if color code things

00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:41,430
then the person would color blindness

00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:44,580
can't get it but if you don't call a

00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:47,190
code things the person with learning

00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:51,050
disabilities may not get it because if

00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:54,570
color coded it's much clearer solution

00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:58,290
satisfy both groups use colors and

00:14:54,570 --> 00:15:05,790
Mitchell indicators such as a question

00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:07,380
mark or whatever now there are tools to

00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:09,560
help with this that I will show you in a

00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,560
bit

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:23,660
now for audio and video make sure you

00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:29,700
always have an alternative text version

00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:37,380
for video use captions for out you

00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:43,920
include a text transcript also for non

00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:47,070
auditory learners if filling material

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,320
phone already descriptive article don't

00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:54,750
add an alternative you don't need it

00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:58,950
because yeah do not autoplay ever ever

00:15:54,750 --> 00:16:03,120
ever ever ever ever ever ever okay

00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:10,500
thanks and anything longer than three

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:16,890
seconds should I possibly yeah make sure

00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:22,490
compulsively please avoid flashes or

00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:26,370
very fast changes or animations actually

00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:29,960
anything that flashes three times in one

00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:32,310
second can cause epileptic reactions I

00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:37,260
think that's nothing you really want on

00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:38,850
your sites which is really a shame

00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:44,570
because there's some gifts I really like

00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:48,780
to include as I'm sure you're aware of

00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:53,520
when you include images you also need to

00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:56,490
include alternate or alt texts but what

00:16:53,520 --> 00:17:00,500
I often see is you have this gallery of

00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:03,990
images and i'll text of every images

00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:05,820
gallery image 1 gallery image to gallery

00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:09,600
in which three it should be different

00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:15,590
right so gallery image 55 how much am i

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:17,640
learning from that describe the image

00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:21,720
describe what you're trying to convey

00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:23,890
with the image because let's say we have

00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:27,339
a red panda

00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:31,240
don't say it's a red panda say what is

00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:33,310
trying to do a biology class is

00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,260
completely different from an English

00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:41,260
class when there's a picture of a red

00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:43,720
panda so alt text can be replaced with

00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:47,730
the caption if your caption image just

00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:51,160
don't have any i'll text you can reply

00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:55,030
perfect you can also leave replying for

00:17:51,160 --> 00:18:02,410
decorative images probably leave it

00:17:55,030 --> 00:18:05,650
blank for those cool gifts you have this

00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:09,160
goes without saying high contrast is

00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:14,110
important especially for figures such as

00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:16,980
graphs but for graphs include a table if

00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:20,950
possible if you have these nice graphs

00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:23,920
also include a text version table is

00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:27,100
really really preferable because anyone

00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:31,930
can just tap through the data easily and

00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:48,210
i love it please please please face

00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:51,640
avoid images of texts i hate them so

00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:55,360
area is what will be is for

00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:59,830
accessibility it means AXA bowl rich

00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:03,900
internet applications it's easy and it's

00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:06,580
powerful and it means you can actually

00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:09,190
structure your weird websites your

00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:13,840
modern web sites can be accessible

00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:18,190
because of area it's amazing so area has

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:23,140
roles roles tell the screen reader what

00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:25,930
an element does such as your fancy

00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:28,660
button which is actually a div but with

00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:33,430
rules you can tell it it's a button so

00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:35,019
all technology that supports it well no

00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:42,499
no it's a button

00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:47,289
awesome the area is also states and

00:19:42,499 --> 00:19:53,359
properties they tell the screen reader

00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:57,619
something more for example they can save

00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:59,989
a field is required or invalid they can

00:19:57,619 --> 00:20:03,889
tell whether a button opens a pop-up a

00:19:59,989 --> 00:20:07,549
submenu if something has autocomplete if

00:20:03,889 --> 00:20:13,699
a checkbox is checked enough it's really

00:20:07,549 --> 00:20:18,069
really useful I love it rows of

00:20:13,699 --> 00:20:20,690
navigation menu is a good example

00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:27,139
landmarks of banner and main content is

00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:30,619
another good example of area alerts of

00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:35,799
life and automatic now we start getting

00:20:30,619 --> 00:20:40,299
to something interesting in forms as

00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:43,549
what's that earlier also lost area and

00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:52,129
we can use things that's described by or

00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:54,440
labeled by it's really useful now most

00:20:52,129 --> 00:20:57,679
modern web site says didn't I become

00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:02,359
that I was like all mana website nah

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:06,229
most so slide shells is something I see

00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:11,149
all the time and in 90 percenter not

00:21:06,229 --> 00:21:14,209
accessible at all so make sure that each

00:21:11,149 --> 00:21:16,969
filter has out texts and then it can be

00:21:14,209 --> 00:21:18,319
navigated with the keyboard it's really

00:21:16,969 --> 00:21:20,959
all you had to think about in a

00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:25,639
slideshow I'll text navigate via the

00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:27,979
keyboard cool it's accessible I'll also

00:21:25,639 --> 00:21:30,219
of course think of contrasts and things

00:21:27,979 --> 00:21:30,219
like that

00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:45,720
please let okay so live regions are

00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:48,450
something really amazing with area for

00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:51,870
example it can be used to tell the

00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:55,020
screen reader information such as also

00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:57,110
completes results are available yay your

00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:59,610
message has been sent successfully

00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:03,450
status information and it's good for you

00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:06,630
sir and you know this is something new

00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:08,760
and accessibility and it really means a

00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:15,050
lot that we can do this this means that

00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:18,210
we can keep JavaScript on finally so

00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:23,510
live regions can either be polite or

00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:23,510
asserted i will say keep them pilates

00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:28,680
and making them assertive means that the

00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:30,990
interrupter flow of the screen reader

00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:33,120
which is really really annoying if

00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:35,430
you're trying to find something and

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:40,170
suddenly the size o new message on

00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:42,570
Twitter and you're like so just wait

00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:45,390
till screen reader is finished and then

00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:48,090
say okay now you cannot get messages on

00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:57,270
Twitter unless something is exploding of

00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:59,640
course yay javascript give me um um so

00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:02,910
throw away that no Jas plugin that you

00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:09,780
have to test accessibility not needed at

00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:13,760
all ever actually twitter twitter is

00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:18,420
amazing for accessibility if you want to

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:22,500
see an example of a website that does

00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:26,250
things right look at twitter they have a

00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:29,450
dedicated accessibility team and they do

00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,450
it really really well

00:23:33,309 --> 00:23:40,309
so this tweet fields has tons of

00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:43,429
information first you can focus on a

00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:49,640
tweet text edit field and work for

00:23:43,429 --> 00:23:51,520
custom forms it's really cool and it

00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,320
tells the screen reader will need to add

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,780
nickname it tells them there's a list

00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:04,610
thing you can go through the list and it

00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:16,010
does that with this impacts now let's

00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:29,150
first look okay so our a label by tweet

00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:33,470
books well okay that's not okay work

00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:36,860
with my hair thank you so I real able by

00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:41,240
tweet box mini home profile page profile

00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:45,380
level and this means that the screen

00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:50,150
arena will see this area labeled by this

00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:52,940
label and it has a role as a text box so

00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:55,790
we will know that we can write things in

00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:58,220
here and we will also know that it's

00:24:55,790 --> 00:25:04,880
multi-line because we have I real

00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:07,400
multi-line true perfect we'll see that

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:12,530
it has autocomplete with this area alta

00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:15,290
complete we will see that we can't

00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:17,860
expand it it's only 40 characters why

00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:17,860
would we do that

00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:32,120
okay you're falling asleep I'm sorry so

00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:35,180
here's online assessment tools wave is

00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:38,510
amazing it's online web accessible

00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:43,100
epilation ever a good evaluation tool

00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:45,020
and that's a firefox plugin the firefox

00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:48,560
plugin works really well I wish there

00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:51,470
was a plugin for address listed the only

00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:53,840
tools allows you to give it a web page

00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:56,840
address such as Twitter and then it

00:25:53,840 --> 00:26:01,520
gives you warnings it tells you okay you

00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:05,300
have maybe 50 area labels and tell see

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:08,540
if you have images with alt text ads are

00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:11,180
the same as other images it's problem

00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:14,000
indicator that something's wrong it

00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:24,580
gives you cool errors so use this one a

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:28,310
lot there's also the color filter sorry

00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:30,940
color filter is really cool it actually

00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:33,410
simulates what the web page looks like

00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:36,470
two people with different types of

00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:39,470
colorblindness so play with this and you

00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:42,140
will see if this high contrast thing if

00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:45,160
it's actually working out for you it's

00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:47,800
quite difficult sometimes like this

00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:53,650
purple and white looks pretty cool but

00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:56,630
yeah I guess you will work this check

00:26:53,650 --> 00:27:00,280
it's another cool thing it allows you to

00:26:56,630 --> 00:27:04,600
upload an image or a web address to

00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,600
simulate color blindness for that image

00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:09,650
this also color contrast checker yes you

00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:12,260
notice that there's a lot of color tools

00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:16,160
I use them a lot because I like colorful

00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:18,680
design and so here you can check the

00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:22,060
counter straight you between your text

00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:27,450
and background of color on the webpage

00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:30,419
that's a lot lot more so for more

00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:34,679
go to v3 see web accessibility tools

00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:41,909
list and have a look use them experiment

00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:45,990
it's really cool so accessibility is not

00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:51,600
about assistive technology accessibility

00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:56,179
is about people it's about universal

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,179
design following guidelines

00:27:56,570 --> 00:28:04,679
accessibility means no workarounds

00:28:00,029 --> 00:28:09,539
what's ever so keep your JavaScript on

00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:13,529
please please please please follow

00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:19,260
guidelines and if you have a modern

00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:22,500
website use by area it's actually pretty

00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:25,980
straightforward and really almost too

00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:37,559
easy remember to ask questions so

00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:40,769
questions Thank You factor were really

00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:42,090
helpful either um if I'm going back to

00:28:40,769 --> 00:28:44,120
look at a website I've worked on and

00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:47,850
thinking why I ought to make accessible

00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:50,789
what's the first thing I should do the

00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:57,840
first thing you should do for a website

00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:59,970
that already exists ok so in normal

00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,190
cases I would suggest think about

00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:05,370
accessibility front start but I had this

00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:08,340
project as well a huge huge projects

00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:11,580
that has been going on for two years and

00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:14,090
then suddenly Aaron starts testing

00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:17,990
things anything like oh that's not good

00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:20,820
so the first things you should do is

00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:23,700
look what bottlenecks you have on the

00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:26,370
website what things are may be confusing

00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:30,659
look at your semantics is something out

00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:33,450
of the ordinary if you have html5 is

00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:37,110
everything properly labeled chances are

00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:39,659
it's accessible already but if you have

00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:40,770
dynamic content maybe start looking at

00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:43,410
this area labels

00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:45,810
and adding it for outer loading and all

00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:48,000
that stuff that's where I would start

00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:59,730
with it in Matt dynamic content and

00:29:48,000 --> 00:30:03,590
images and contrasts on the page I so

00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:07,880
are there any kind of statistics on how

00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:10,170
how many illnesses of con screen readers

00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:13,500
actually has been users that are

00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:14,970
compatible with Aria because when you're

00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:19,950
looking at something like jaws which is

00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:21,360
a thousand dollars to purchase you get

00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:23,580
stuck on the version unless you're

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,920
spending a thousand pounds every release

00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:27,630
so do we know how many users are

00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:33,780
actually using modern screen readers

00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:36,300
that implement this standard so we don't

00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:38,820
really I haven't seen statistics for it

00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:40,680
but I know because Aaron said that

00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:44,280
basically all screen readers supported

00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:46,650
so I guess all scream readers should

00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:50,520
support area it's quite an old

00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:51,930
technology and I just not and is there

00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:54,000
any screen readers people can turn to to

00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:57,840
test the effect of their work that

00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:02,730
without having to fit you ok so to you

00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:10,530
can do to you can use this tool sai

00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:12,390
showed but you can also use screen

00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:16,680
reader on your Mac for instance you can

00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:20,460
use voiceover so voiceover works really

00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:22,530
really well to test area labels so a

00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:24,690
good example is if you go to Twitter I

00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:27,090
was going to do this but I was afraid of

00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:31,050
the Wi-Fi connection but if you go to

00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:33,420
Twitter you turn on voiceover and then

00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:36,120
you can see all these things if you type

00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:38,610
at you get a list and then it's fixed to

00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,970
you just like a screen reader would it's

00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:40,970
really cool

00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:50,520
we had a project where we converted

00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:53,190
stuff to be accessible we had three

00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:58,890
levels with the compatibility of the

00:31:53,190 --> 00:32:04,040
rich readers with aria it felt basically

00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:07,890
like web browsers of late 90s where

00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:12,120
stuff is not consistently working or at

00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:16,410
all and basically we were not able to do

00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:19,110
this no workarounds we in some cases we

00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:22,700
had to do some special stuff for let's

00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:25,710
say nvidia or voiceover or whatever so

00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:28,460
how should we approach it should we just

00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:31,680
go to the specification and hope that

00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:36,960
readers would basically a catch up

00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:40,560
eventually okay so I guess it's a lot

00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:43,590
like ignoring internet explorer 7

00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:46,800
because it's too old eventually you

00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:49,080
can't support everything because but

00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:51,300
what you can make sure to do is that all

00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:56,460
really important content on the website

00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:58,020
is accessible without area labels so if

00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:00,600
it's something really really important

00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:02,880
like a government website you probably

00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:05,490
want to make sure that it works even on

00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:08,400
old technology but like a modern web

00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:11,310
site like Twitter I guess I wouldn't

00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:21,990
care about those users even if it sounds

00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:24,290
a bit mean I would okay thank you very

00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:24,290
much

00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,570
