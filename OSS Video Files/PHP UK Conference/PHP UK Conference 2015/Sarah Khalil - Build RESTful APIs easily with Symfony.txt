Title: Sarah Khalil - Build RESTful APIs easily with Symfony
Publication date: 2015-04-02
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2015
Description: 
	Let's build a nice REST API with all the recent helper we can find. First of all, we will take some time to see, in theory, what's asked to build a "good" Restful API. Then we'll see some code with the usage of : - FOSRestBundle to save time, a lot; - JMS serializer and its awesome features; - the HATEOAS project, very nice to unlock the third level of the Richardson maturity model; - And finally, a little bit of Guzzle to ease communication between applications (going further with the SOA architecture). The goal of that talk is to demystify all technologies in the "REST" galaxy.
