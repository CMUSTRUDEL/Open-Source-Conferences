Title: Derick Rethans - Debugging: past, present and future
Publication date: 2015-04-02
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2015
Description: 
	In this talk I will go over all the past, present and future debugging techniques. The talk start by giving an overview on PHP's (ancient) standard features for debugging, additional (userland) libraries and functionality in frameworks. After the introductions we move on to the meatier stuff and I will talk about live-action debuggers, such as Xdebug and Zend's debugger. They both provide information while a script is being executed, in combination with IDEs. In the future, there is PHP 5.6's phpdbg which allows for some debugging and other analysis. I am also unveiling a project that allows you to ""step back"" while debugging as well; introspect what your script's or application's exact execution paths was; and trace variable modifications.
