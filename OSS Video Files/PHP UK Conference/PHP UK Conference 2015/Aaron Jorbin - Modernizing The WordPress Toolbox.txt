Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2015
Description: 
	WordPress powers over 20% of the web, yet until recently it’s toolbox and build process would be considered antique at best. A little over one year ago we began the process of reevaluating our choices. This lead us to updating our tooling and testing; making them first class citizens. Many of the pieces were taken off the shelf, a few where custom built, and some required large coordinated efforts to be successfully implemented. We’ve learned some valuable lessons along the way that may help other projects modernize their toolbox and discovered some excellent benefits that reinforce our decision to take on this challenge.
