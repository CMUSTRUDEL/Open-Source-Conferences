Title: PHP UK Conference 2014 - Glen Campbell - The Future of PHP Is In The Clouds
Publication date: 2014-03-21
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2014
Description: 
	PHP started as a simple scripting language for embedding dynamic data in HTML pages. It's grown to be a mature, flexible, very powerful language, and yet its roots still lie in the web; PHP powers the bulk of the world's largest Internet sites. Although the language has matured, the underlying infrastructure has, in large part, remained fairly static. With the growth of cloud computing, however, there's an opportunity for PHP developers to leverage the power and flexibility of virtualization to build applications that are distributed, scalable, and capable of handling massive amounts of traffic.

This talk reviews some of the key developments in PHP over the last few years and outlines how PHP can keep pace with the explosive growth of the cloud by rapidly prototyping architectural designs, managing infrastructure dynamically, and taking advantage of virtually unlimited storage and compute power.

what I'd like to do today is talk about

00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:13,440
about PHP sort of its history and my

00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:15,450
history with it because I've sort of

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,060
grown up with PHP been working with it

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,350
for over 15 years now and then watched

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,760
it come and go and watch some of the

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,859
amazing things that have happened with

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,630
it and so will take you through a little

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:28,920
bit about that and talk about about the

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:30,960
future in 1997 I lived in a little town

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,719
west of here called asket he ever heard

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,329
of that they do some races or something

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,910
there and I was really interested in

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:41,760
photography and i bought a contacts g1

00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,649
camera I imagine most of you have never

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,270
heard of context they really didn't make

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:47,850
the transition into the digital world

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,610
and the brand is really not around much

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:53,190
anymore but i was on a mailing list of

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,829
people that had contact g and cameras

00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,510
and that was really enjoyable until the

00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:58,649
list sort of crashed and went down and

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,710
then we couldn't get in touch with each

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:04,710
other anymore so i actually went out and

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,390
set up a website so that the people with

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,600
the contacts geez could actually share

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,700
photos with each other Tim O'Reilly

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,729
about five years later coined the term

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,070
web 2.0 and one of the things that meant

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:20,400
was that Seitz had user-generated

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:22,740
content they had commenting they had the

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,869
ability to share they had the ability

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,960
for people to customize their experience

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:29,579
a lot of that was sort of embodied in

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,600
Flickr if you remember when flickr was

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:36,150
released back in 2004-2005 and got

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,070
really popular well my site had all of

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,860
those features about four or five years

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:44,189
before flickr did but i was really a

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:46,079
novice at programming I was a novice to

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:52,079
the web and I really made some dumb

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:55,649
mistakes some of you immediately laugh

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:59,549
at this that that's almost an exact line

00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:02,729
of code in there so I had no concept

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:04,740
that HTTP had different verbs I just

00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:05,969
thought there's a page and had links and

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,220
if you're under the links you would do

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:09,610
something based on the link so you'd

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,710
upload an image

00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,120
and there was a link there next to it

00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,700
that said if the user wanted to delete

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,620
that image they could delete it so we

00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,800
launched the site you know 50 or 60

00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,900
people logged on uploaded images about

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:29,700
two hours later Google came and crawled

00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:34,470
the site hit all the links suddenly

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:38,320
everything was gone again they say that

00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:41,170
experience good decisions come from

00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:44,920
experience and experience comes from bad

00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:49,959
decisions so this was a step on my way

00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:51,459
to getting experience here and part of

00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:54,760
my evolution was the evolution of

00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:56,290
technology technology evolves and I

00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,330
think technology on the web and

00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:02,140
associated with that evolves faster than

00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:03,430
almost any other technology anywhere you

00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,920
all may have heard the story which is

00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,810
actually somewhat apocryphal that the

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,020
solid rocket boosters on the space

00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:12,959
shuttle were designed with a width of

00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:16,230
approximately four and a half five feet

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,310
so that they can be carried on rail cars

00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,560
because they had to be transported from

00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:22,330
the place that were manufactured to the

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,600
launch pad for assembly and everything

00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:27,340
else like that well why do they have to

00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,019
fit that with while the rail cars were

00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,209
dictated by the width of the train

00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:33,549
tracks right where did the width of the

00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:35,769
train tracks come from well they came

00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:37,989
from the train tracks in England where

00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:39,970
the train was invented well where did

00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:42,370
that with come from that came from the

00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:45,280
wagon tracks in the roads from where the

00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:47,440
Ragan's wagons were because if the

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,790
wagons weren't the right width to fit

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,820
the ruts that they would bounce all over

00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,230
the place and shake the goods up well

00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,870
you push that back further where did

00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,430
that whip come from and it turns out you

00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:00,519
trace that all the way back to the Roman

00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:03,850
chariots and so basically the most

00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:06,430
modern form of transportation in the

00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:08,739
world the space shuttle has design

00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:12,610
constraints that were imposed by the

00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:15,340
Roman chariot thousands of years ago now

00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:16,959
the fact is that's not actually true in

00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:19,220
a literal sense you can go to snopes com

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:23,150
and read up a bit

00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:27,170
more about it but it does have a truth

00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:31,130
that technology is constantly varying

00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:33,770
but it's also constrained by the past so

00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:36,380
my past constrained me into learning a

00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,580
bit more about HTTP it learned more

00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:41,720
about the web and how to build things

00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:43,940
and I learned more about PHP starting

00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,670
with PHP 3 I rewrote the site in peach

00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,110
before and then we moved on a bit now

00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:51,710
you all may remember that how many of

00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:54,500
y'all worked with PHP 3 okay the good

00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:56,750
old days of PHP programming you didn't

00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:59,180
have to worry about classes you didn't

00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:02,780
have to worry about objects everything

00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:04,340
was a global right you had you didn't

00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:09,080
have to implement any extra code to get

00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:12,250
sequel injection it like came free with

00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:15,560
the package there cross-site scripting

00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:17,330
none of us had ever heard that you had

00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,610
an include file you included a variable

00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:21,080
in the path Wow someone could just set a

00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,220
global variable somewhere and suddenly

00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,540
you're loading someone's code from

00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:28,700
another site it was really awesome one

00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:32,900
of the great things about PHP though was

00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:34,850
that it was simple anyone could install

00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,680
a package and literally within four or

00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:39,680
five minutes be running a web server

00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,600
that had PHP on it and get stuff up and

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,669
running and and that's one of the great

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,370
things about PHP is that that's still

00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:48,380
true today is that it's still about the

00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:51,530
easiest way to actually get something

00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:53,510
working when I rewrote that photo

00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:56,720
sharing site i turned it into a generic

00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:58,460
package called site frame if you're a

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,590
fan of horror films or something you can

00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,450
go look at site framed org and actually

00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,220
download it but I really really strongly

00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:07,160
recommend that you do not run this on

00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:10,550
any sort of publicly accessible web

00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:13,280
server unless you're sort of trying to

00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:16,220
find out who can hack you because it's

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,570
very good at enabling that but but it's

00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,880
a learning experience to sort of see

00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:24,380
what happened in the good old days and

00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:27,650
why they're not so good php4 came along

00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:29,960
and wow all this this yummy yummy

00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,860
goodness right we have object-oriented

00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,949
programming

00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:36,949
which was was the hot new thing it was

00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:39,860
the first real step of PHP into the

00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:41,990
modern programming world it used modern

00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:45,110
paradigms and modern ways of thinking it

00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:47,300
used encapsulation it had a whole bunch

00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:49,430
of features that made it much much much

00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:52,939
more stronger much stronger for

00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:55,639
developers to use that's continued in

00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:57,979
the in the following years multiple

00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:02,150
different releases the most the most

00:06:57,979 --> 00:07:04,159
major one coming up was PHP 5.3 which

00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,979
really revolutionized things that was

00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:10,340
sort of when PHP was launched into the

00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:12,979
modern modern era of programming and it

00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:16,430
had support foreclosures oh my god we're

00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:18,800
becoming less pure right anonymous

00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:21,050
functions a lot of the complaints that

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:25,279
people had about PHP were solved by PHP

00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:28,340
5.3 and really for the first time PHP

00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:30,500
was arguably has advanced the language

00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:32,779
as the core language as Ruby or Python

00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:39,319
or one of the other more modern type

00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:43,339
languages and no one really cared PHP

00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:45,860
5.3 came out and almost no one used it

00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:48,069
and it was a wonderfully circular

00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,930
situation that we got into because

00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:53,150
hosting providers said well no one is

00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:54,710
asking me for PHP 5.3 so I'm not going

00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,919
to install that one it's it breaks

00:07:54,710 --> 00:08:00,740
things in its backwards incompatible

00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:03,110
application developers said oh none of

00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,400
the hosting providers support PHP 53 so

00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:07,069
I'm not going to write my applications

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,120
with it and then the hosting providers

00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,500
used the fact that none of the

00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,199
application developers were requiring

00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,419
5.3 as a reason for why they didn't need

00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:16,129
to upgrade and it was sort of a

00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:19,370
stalemate in the market there for

00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:21,229
several years where PHP 5.3 was out it

00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:24,589
had all these wonderful features and no

00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:26,569
one could use it at all now I'm going to

00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:28,520
steal a little bit here from a guy named

00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:31,580
Larry Garfield a lot of you may know him

00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:36,229
he's given a talk at several conferences

00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:38,630
before where he talked about the changes

00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:42,289
that happened with that and the biggest

00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:43,529
change that happened was that PHP until

00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:45,709
that point did

00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:48,540
have sort of a community around it

00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:50,579
that's what was missing in the PHP world

00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,829
compared to say the Python or the Ruby

00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:54,959
world if you go to Python if you're

00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:58,199
anything would to do with Python you go

00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:00,660
to PyCon right everyone goes there there

00:08:58,199 --> 00:09:02,850
is one language conference for the

00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:05,720
Python programming language if you're in

00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:07,949
Ruby over here you go to ruby conf

00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:11,550
everyone does it there's one central

00:09:07,949 --> 00:09:14,129
place in the PHP realm there 145

00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:17,009
different conferences there was no

00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:18,569
single community and in fact there was a

00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:19,620
lot of pushback against that because it

00:09:18,569 --> 00:09:21,209
was sort of a feeling that this is a

00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,480
hobbyist language and we didn't need to

00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:26,670
get into those sorts of things like I

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,499
said Larry Garfield talks a lot about

00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:30,029
this because what he did along with a

00:09:28,499 --> 00:09:32,610
number of other people I'm calling him

00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:36,300
out because he he wrote the presentation

00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:38,069
here that they got together and formed

00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:43,620
something called the framework in her

00:09:38,069 --> 00:09:45,059
upper interrupt group fig and that was

00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:48,000
important because frameworks were big

00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:49,470
then one of the statistics he throws out

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,149
that the average PHP programmer is

00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:57,569
written 2.43 frameworks everyone likes

00:09:54,149 --> 00:10:00,149
that one but what they did is they set a

00:09:57,569 --> 00:10:03,889
plan to say okay we're some of the core

00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:06,329
application developers he works for

00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:08,339
drupal and there's a number of others

00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:13,529
that's it ok we're going to require PHP

00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:15,209
5.3 so all at once july of 2007 I think

00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,800
they all said we're going to require PHP

00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:19,709
53 on our next one and we're going to

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,079
deprecate all older releases within six

00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:23,490
months of that pressure most of the

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,689
major hosting providers had gotten the

00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,029
message and they'd started supporting

00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:29,009
PHP 5.3 that really started the ball

00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:31,589
rolling with the whole concept of

00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:35,429
community and with PHP moving into the

00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:37,769
modern era there's a number of other

00:10:35,429 --> 00:10:39,569
things that PHP didn't have before hand

00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:41,749
they didn't have a really standard

00:10:39,569 --> 00:10:49,050
easy-to-use way to package things up

00:10:41,749 --> 00:10:51,179
right python has pip ruby has gems PHP

00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:52,439
head pair but you really couldn't get

00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:53,639
stuff into pair unless you're one of the

00:10:52,439 --> 00:10:55,949
pair of guys and then you had to have it

00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:56,790
reviewed by 17 people and you couldn't

00:10:55,949 --> 00:10:57,960
just sort of create a cat

00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:01,080
could you share it with someone like

00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,310
that Symphony came along composer that

00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,140
was adopted by the framework

00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:06,960
interoperability group and suddenly we

00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:09,720
had a way to share stuff anyone could do

00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,160
it it lowered the barrier there just

00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,700
like to the language so that anyone

00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,990
could share code with one another and

00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:20,070
that was a huge benefit to the community

00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:22,170
there what that means is we didn't have

00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:24,510
to write code anymore we could reuse

00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:26,730
code and that's probably one of the

00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:29,400
single greatest things that the PHP

00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:31,170
community has done for itself is go to

00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,990
the open source model where we borrow

00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:35,340
code we share code and we give back we

00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:38,370
don't have to write everything from

00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:40,500
scratch this addressed some of the the

00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:42,810
key issues gentlemen I were talking here

00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,780
earlier before the talk started that you

00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:48,510
know in Python there's one or two HTTP

00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:51,540
wrappers that you use in Ruby there's a

00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:55,050
standard library that you use in PHP

00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:56,250
there's 147 and probably more than that

00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:58,170
if you count the ones that people had

00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:00,930
written on there on just for the fun of

00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:03,090
it well with with composer with symphony

00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:05,220
you now had a way to build sort of

00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:08,790
standard packages you could let the best

00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:10,110
ones win and in the future there's going

00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,310
to be two or three that are common that

00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,500
everyone uses and that's going to make

00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:16,830
it much more powerful for the PHP

00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:19,050
community how many of you are familiar

00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:22,440
with this Web site this web page

00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:24,750
specifically if you're a PHP coder I

00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:28,410
encourage you to read this its web on a

00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:30,330
stick com it's called why PHP sucks if

00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:33,660
you go Google why PHP sucks this is the

00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:36,060
first result here and it's a very sort

00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:39,930
of short winded rant about everything

00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:41,460
that's bad about PHP you should know

00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,900
what's bad about your language if

00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,730
nothing else then you can sort of be

00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:48,630
prepared to talk to the people who talk

00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:52,200
bad about you and he goes through a

00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:55,110
number of issues and really I don't

00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,880
think a lot of the claims here holds a

00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:58,770
lot of weight they're basically saying I

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,370
disagree with some of your design

00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:04,740
decisions you know in PHP a logical

00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:07,860
operator returns true or false one or

00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,840
zero in other languages it doesn't it

00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:12,780
returns the left side of the right

00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:14,910
side of the comparison which may make it

00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:17,030
more useful on the other hand you could

00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:19,080
argue that it's not as explicit

00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:21,360
everyone's entitled to their opinion and

00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,650
this is a common opinion out there it's

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,620
a real good resources out at the bottom

00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:29,280
of that page that says here are other

00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:32,610
anti PHP sites some of these are legit

00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:35,520
if you read that first one PHP a fractal

00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:37,740
of bad design that's actually got some

00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,960
seriously well thought out arguments as

00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:43,350
to some of the design flaws inherent in

00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:45,180
the PHP language I'm not going to dwell

00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:47,040
on it but you should be aware of those

00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:49,200
sorts of things but one of the things

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,550
that tells me is that PHP is actually

00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,440
being taken seriously as a

00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:54,780
general-purpose programming language

00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:59,430
which is something that wasn't true in

00:13:54,780 --> 00:14:03,030
the past what we know about PHP however

00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:06,180
is that people make money with it lots

00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:11,070
and lots and lots of money unlike Python

00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:12,630
unlike Ruby unlike Java seventy-two

00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:15,840
percent of the sites on the web or

00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:19,190
written in some form of PHP about half

00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,190
of them are written in PHP three

00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:26,040
Facebook gaha Wikipedia those are 36 of

00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:29,400
the top 10 with sites on the web are all

00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:32,100
written in some form of PHP it's the

00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,930
language that startups use why it's

00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,910
low-cost it's easy to get into its

00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:38,160
ubiquitous you can find people skilled

00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:43,800
in it you don't have to rely on any sort

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:46,470
of esoteric knowledge and PHP was really

00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,400
built to be easy to use and start up but

00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,650
it was never intended to be a

00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,600
general-purpose language I used to work

00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:54,990
for yahoo when Rasmus Laird arf was

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,670
there and he was insistent that PHP was

00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:59,400
never supposed to be a general-purpose

00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:02,310
programming language it was a templating

00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:05,790
language for HTML it was a way to get

00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:08,520
dynamic data into an HTML page and

00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:09,870
that's really all it was far so he

00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,190
pushed back against that for years

00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:12,420
luckily he's turned around a bit and

00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:16,440
we're getting more of the modern

00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:19,200
features in there but it shows that PHP

00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,540
has grown it shows that people are using

00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,710
PHP for doing massive amounts of things

00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,450
on the web

00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:28,280
and more importantly they're successful

00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:30,960
with it and they're making money with it

00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:35,070
so now we get all the sophistication and

00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:37,980
glamour of PHP it really is sort of an

00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:39,540
ugly duckling of a language it's no one

00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,010
really likes to admit they're a PHP

00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,780
programmer sometimes especially if

00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:45,180
you're around the cool kids that are

00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:47,970
doing Clojure and you know some of the

00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:50,040
other Haskell or whatever you know if

00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:53,580
you if you're in a bar or pub and people

00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:59,090
are saying oh I'm writing in Scala you

00:15:53,580 --> 00:16:03,000
sort of go on TV let me get you a drink

00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:05,730
they're the cool ones I'm a pragmatist I

00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,250
tend to say if the language lets me get

00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:09,510
the job done without too much expense

00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,250
and without too much here then I'll use

00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:13,590
it and that's where PHP is it's the

00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:16,320
pragmatists language the language

00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:17,970
shouldn't necessarily be be blamed for

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,190
all of the defects that people put into

00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:23,460
it and you can code in badly in any sort

00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:26,160
of language now you know as well as I do

00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:28,500
that a lot of these people here and you

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,470
and there are doing amazing things in

00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,780
PHP and part of the problem has been

00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:36,840
there hasn't been a single PHP community

00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:39,690
like in Ruby or Python the strength of

00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:41,730
PHP has been in lower level grassroots

00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:44,310
conferences like this there's 600 people

00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:46,140
here Python Python this year the major

00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:48,420
one in North America will have four

00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:51,300
thousand attendees they'll have a

00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:54,030
thousand or two thousand at the ones in

00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:56,490
Europe and in Canada and in Australia so

00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:58,380
they have a much more centralized

00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:01,110
community ours is much more distributed

00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:02,550
more dispersed more spread out but it's

00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,870
an events like this where people learn

00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:06,330
how to do things better they learn best

00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:09,720
practices they share with one another

00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:11,790
how to get things done and they also

00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,790
focus on some of the features of the

00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:16,580
language itself we've actually become a

00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:19,620
force to be reckoned with and as the

00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:20,730
framework interop group has Sean we can

00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:26,160
actually make changes to that

00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:28,860
environment out there so I want to shift

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,980
gears a little bit and talk about where

00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:34,360
PHP is going as you know the title said

00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:38,890
PHP's future is in the clouds

00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:41,110
I think the future is bright there are

00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:43,900
some things that need to change along

00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:46,710
with PHP as we go into the the future

00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:48,700
here one is that we're still building

00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:50,020
applications like we used to

00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,720
specifically we're treating an

00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:56,080
architecture as a static construct that

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,760
can't be changed I gave a talk yesterday

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,860
on how to bring down a website and we

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,530
talked about architecture of it and one

00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:04,030
of the people in there said you work for

00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:05,950
months and months and months to try to

00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:08,080
convince upper management to spend some

00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:10,660
money to get some hardware and then

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,830
finally you get the approval and you

00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,960
have three days to define your

00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:16,000
architecture so you can make that

00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:19,090
purchase and then get on with building

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,040
the system the implication there is that

00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:22,660
architecture is a static thing you do it

00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,960
once you spend the money and then you

00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:27,669
can't ever come back to the well again

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,250
but what happens if the architecture if

00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:32,950
the hardware itself is free or at least

00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:35,679
so low cost that you don't actually have

00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:38,590
to worry about the pricing of it right

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:42,010
we're less hesitant to do that for a

00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:44,559
good reason when we try something new

00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:46,480
and our code will often create a

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,919
prototype right how many of y'all just

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,160
play around with things to see how they

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,690
work I wrote a blog post it got really

00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:56,140
resonated with a lot of people it says

00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:59,080
if you're a programming manager you need

00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:00,549
to let your people play because that's

00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,530
how they learn new things that's how

00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:04,480
they figure out what what works and

00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:08,049
that's how you sort of grow your skill

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,820
base we can do that with code but until

00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:12,100
recently haven't been able to do that

00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,510
with Hardware well what I'd like to tell

00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:17,320
you is that yes we can do that with

00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:19,179
hardware we can you know spin up servers

00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,940
in a moment play with it see how it

00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:24,100
works spin them down and delete it when

00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:26,919
we're done right there's literally

00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:29,530
almost no overhead costs for this and we

00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:31,120
can test those assumptions if you want

00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:32,650
to change your architecture it's much

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,929
cheaper and easier to do it now than it

00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:37,559
ever has been before and so I want to

00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:40,990
talk through a couple of scenarios here

00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:43,570
about how that works this is from the

00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:44,650
Rackspace PHP library you don't need to

00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:47,230
get in the details of this but

00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:49,419
essentially you connect to something

00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:52,179
thing you authenticate one line of code

00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:55,270
you can create a server right voila

00:19:52,179 --> 00:19:57,669
that's hardware via code in other words

00:19:55,270 --> 00:20:00,730
hardware is not a purchase order an

00:19:57,669 --> 00:20:03,610
approval chain an installation an ops

00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:04,980
guy who has to run things a network guy

00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:08,470
owes to plug it in and get it connected

00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:10,990
it's one line of code in a PHP script

00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:13,600
and suddenly you have a new new server

00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:15,490
or you have a new storage device or you

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,799
have a new load balancer or you have a

00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:20,559
new Redis database or something like

00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:23,140
that that's really all you need to

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:26,890
understand if you want to try to change

00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:30,669
things prototype build something and see

00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:33,429
how it works measure everything the cost

00:20:30,669 --> 00:20:35,740
of a virtual server is like a few tens

00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:37,860
of currency units you know whether those

00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:40,750
are dollars or pounds or some or euros a

00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:43,720
new hardware as thousands of currency

00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:46,419
units right since this is easy this is a

00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,799
standard sort of model for a service

00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:50,890
oriented architecture right we've got a

00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:54,130
web front-end you have an API back in

00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:55,360
and you have some sort of cash do you

00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,730
know when that breaks what is your

00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,130
performance level there you measure that

00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:02,040
right what happens if you have multiple

00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:04,990
front ends going through a single cash

00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:06,580
into the back end there where does it

00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:09,250
fail does it fail with the API layer

00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:11,440
does it fail with the cash or do you not

00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:14,260
have enough front ends yet you need to

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,120
try that out and measure it what happens

00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,970
if we had multiple API servers are we

00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,940
now overwhelming the cash all those

00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:26,559
questions you should be able to answer

00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:28,840
in 2006 I helped launch Yahoo tech which

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:31,630
was sort of a gadget sin gizmos review

00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,220
site and it was the first service

00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:36,370
oriented architecture that we had built

00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:38,020
within yahoo so we had not done this

00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:40,720
before we said we don't want to do

00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:44,520
premature optimization so let's build it

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,870
once test it and see if we need caching

00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:50,080
you want to guess what the response was

00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:52,650
we we needed caching our throughput on

00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:57,429
the site after our first round of tests

00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:59,200
was point six requests per second that's

00:21:57,429 --> 00:22:00,480
all we could handle now we were going

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,419
through a front end

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,340
i layer the API itself was calling a

00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:08,010
dozen or two dozen other services within

00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:12,179
Yahoo so is it was really sort of a

00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:14,309
worst-case situation we tried probably

00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:16,710
50 different configurations of the

00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:18,750
architecture here all using physical

00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,250
hardware and we ended up with something

00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:23,220
that looked like this we had front end

00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:26,940
servers with a local squid cash running

00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:28,650
on each server a central squid cash that

00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:31,860
was actually a parent of the others and

00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:33,570
then a pool of back-end servers the

00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,590
middle air cash is actually cluster but

00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:38,070
we don't need to get into all the

00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:39,660
details it seems very logical but the

00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:41,370
addition of those extra little little

00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,960
tiny caches on the front end servers

00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:44,580
improve performance by about twenty-five

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,400
percent and improve the overall

00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:48,750
throughput of the system and it makes

00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,270
sense when you think about it because

00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:52,740
you're serving a web page ninety percent

00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:55,650
of the time you're serving the most

00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:57,390
common featured content right if you're

00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:58,950
talking about the iphone then it's the

00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:02,040
iphone article thats everywhere and you

00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:03,720
want to cache everywhere by having a

00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,309
cache hit up there on the front end

00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,410
server you don't have any network

00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:09,000
overhead you're just serving it locally

00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:11,429
it's effectively as if you're serving a

00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,580
static web page on the front side

00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:18,360
they're coming up with that

00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:21,299
configuration took literally weeks if

00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,980
not months of time so I would sit there

00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:25,220
for week after week trying various

00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:28,380
things out to see what worked best and

00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:29,580
in fact if we had had virtualization we

00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:32,010
probably could have written a script

00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:34,110
that we would run overnight and would

00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:39,120
let us know the next day or two which

00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:42,720
one of those configurations was best how

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:45,900
many of y'all have a pet right we used

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,919
to treat servers likes pets right how

00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:52,230
many of you have a server that has a

00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:54,929
name right you know its quirks you know

00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:56,549
when it's going to act up if it gets

00:23:54,929 --> 00:24:03,270
sick you stay up with it at night you

00:23:56,549 --> 00:24:05,160
take care of it right we want them to be

00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:07,020
around a long as possible right when we

00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:09,809
have a server out there but but really

00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,980
the modern era we're going to treat

00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:15,179
servers like cattle

00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:17,700
I don't I don't know their name right if

00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:21,090
you get sick I'm gonna drag it over to

00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:23,460
the side and get another one right I'm

00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:25,950
interested in the end product I want

00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:29,010
beef I don't care which cow it comes

00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:30,570
from I don't care which server my job is

00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:33,780
running on as long as I can get another

00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:38,190
one quickly and easily that's what we're

00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:39,600
going to go with so I want to summarize

00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:42,710
a few of the things I've gone through

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:47,250
here today it's not real complicated

00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:49,650
first PHP isn't the same language that

00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:51,630
it was a few years ago right the

00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:54,059
language has matured and developed and

00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:55,350
yet it's still the simplest easiest way

00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:58,799
to get something started and get

00:24:55,350 --> 00:25:01,309
something built second in the last few

00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:04,260
years PHP has really built a community

00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:08,100
that encourages sharing and reuse of

00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:10,350
code like never ever before that by

00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:13,950
itself will help push PHP into the

00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:15,660
future easily finally now that we have

00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:17,490
software tools we need to write awesome

00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:19,320
code we can turn those same tools

00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:22,470
through working on our architectures

00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:24,450
optimizing the performance we can treat

00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:26,669
hardware as ephemeral and we can create

00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:29,340
prototypes that achieve the desired

00:25:26,669 --> 00:25:31,440
performance and test test test test all

00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:33,630
the things measure everything and

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:38,250
understand why things are doing it the

00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:40,590
way they're doing so I'm not a PHP

00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:43,080
profit you know I'm not really a bigwig

00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:43,980
I'm just a guy who writes code I'm not

00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,340
going to tell you how to run your

00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:49,410
business you know how to which providers

00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:53,280
to use though obviously I have an

00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:54,780
opinion what I'd love to do is have you

00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,580
leave here with a better understanding

00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:59,059
of what's capable what's available what

00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:03,720
you're capable of and how you can do it

00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:06,419
any of y'all recognize this statue it's

00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:09,419
about it's about 600 yards from here up

00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:12,270
on City Road it's John Wesley the

00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:13,740
founder of Methodism and I understand

00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,450
that a lot of you here probably wouldn't

00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,940
agree or understand or care about his

00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:21,480
theology I'd like to leave you with one

00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:24,330
of his more profound statements which is

00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,930
to do all the good you can buy all the

00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:28,350
means you

00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:31,490
and in all the ways you can in all the
