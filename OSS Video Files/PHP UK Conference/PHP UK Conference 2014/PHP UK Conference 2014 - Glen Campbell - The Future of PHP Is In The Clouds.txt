Title: PHP UK Conference 2014 - Glen Campbell - The Future of PHP Is In The Clouds
Publication date: 2014-03-21
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2014
Description: 
	PHP started as a simple scripting language for embedding dynamic data in HTML pages. It's grown to be a mature, flexible, very powerful language, and yet its roots still lie in the web; PHP powers the bulk of the world's largest Internet sites. Although the language has matured, the underlying infrastructure has, in large part, remained fairly static. With the growth of cloud computing, however, there's an opportunity for PHP developers to leverage the power and flexibility of virtualization to build applications that are distributed, scalable, and capable of handling massive amounts of traffic.

This talk reviews some of the key developments in PHP over the last few years and outlines how PHP can keep pace with the explosive growth of the cloud by rapidly prototyping architectural designs, managing infrastructure dynamically, and taking advantage of virtually unlimited storage and compute power.
