Title: PHP UK Conference 2014 - Rowan Merewood - Algorithm, Review, Sorting
Publication date: 2014-03-21
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2014
Description: 
	High-level languages and platforms abstract away basic computer science problems so we can code quicker and not re-invent the wheel. That said, algorithms are too much fun to just leave as a black box. We'll learn how to analyse and compare sorting algorithms with live demos and visualisations. With an algorithm from the 1800s, it could even be a history lesson too.
