Description: 
	Put on your trench coat and grab your magnifying glass as we walk through investigating a real-life hacked WordPress website. You'll experience first-hand what tools can help you find the vulnerability and the point of entrance. Learn what the hacker might have left behind, how to seal up the most common problem areas, and how to set up notifications to help you spot a hack more quickly in the future. Even though we will be going through a WordPress website, most of the tools discussed are applicable to any website.
