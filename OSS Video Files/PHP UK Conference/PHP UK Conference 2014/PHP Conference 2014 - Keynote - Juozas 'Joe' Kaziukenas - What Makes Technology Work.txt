Title: PHP Conference 2014 - Keynote - Juozas 'Joe' Kaziukenas - What Makes Technology Work
Publication date: 2014-03-24
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2014
Description: 
	There are now more people building apps, or any piece of technology, in their free time, than wooden chairs some hundred years ago. It's not that we no longer need great chairs, but making one is bloody difficult, and not that easy to get into, but coding something can lead to the world-fame of a new billion dollar startup. Yet more chairs have literally withstood their customers than the current flood of apps manage to even get any attention. And these guys have tried every wood, style and form combination, even so far as telling me that they could solve all of my problems if only I sat on their chair. I mean app. Let's talk about that.

	00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:10,200
so this talk is not really about magenta

00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,509
land or building apps this is more like

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,549
crystal meth and Daft Punk and kind of

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:17,520
PHP inspired rant about building things

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:27,330
I hope you like it also this is not

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:31,109
coffee so exactly this I was I was

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:33,690
flying somewhere I think I was in one of

00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:39,750
the airports in Germany I'm standing in

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:40,890
a line to board the board a plane and as

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,750
I'm standing there obviously the line

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,020
gets shorter and shorter and as they

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:49,079
almost got to the gate I pull out my

00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:51,000
iPhone open the KLM app I'm a dutch

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,539
airlines have to see my boarding pass

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,559
and so i tried to open it and it's not

00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,969
here so i go to the gate and the girl is

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,609
like can you present your boarding pass

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:05,070
I'm like yeah I don't have it so she's

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:08,520
like how how exactly did you get here oh

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:09,960
my girl as I was standing at the

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,939
security desk it was working fine

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,290
actually the button boarding pass was in

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:19,770
app but once once the graphic boarding

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,820
gate it was gone so she's like well show

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,580
me the app I'll show you how it's done

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,740
that's like sure sure teach me teach me

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,240
more so she's trying she's trying to

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,810
find the boarding pass it's not here so

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:34,409
eventually she takes a paper boarding

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:37,439
pass and prides down I guess my name my

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:39,180
details my my my seat all the details I

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,229
need to actually board a plane and then

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,899
should I go to the plane on it's all

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:45,810
fine since I'm flying I'm thinking

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:48,570
that's really dumb like how how an app

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:51,119
which have my boarding pass kind of lost

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,409
it so a couple of weeks like I guess I

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,840
keep flying and I keep going different

00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:57,540
airports and trying by that eventually

00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,540
Fergus trial and error I figure out that

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,969
it starts showing your boarding pass

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,880
button two hours before a flight and

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:09,360
then stop showing it at the time of

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,790
flight so for all the time like you had

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,280
one job to make it right

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,079
for example what what if you're what if

00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,689
my flight is delayed the boring packs

00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:20,329
just disappears what if i'm early at the

00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:23,640
airport I need to go through security I

00:02:20,329 --> 00:02:26,939
can't open my boarding pass so the only

00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,890
purpose of it HAP was either search for

00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:31,470
flights which sometimes people do you

00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:34,379
can either check in for flight which I

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:36,090
tend to do if I can go to my laptop so i

00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:37,859
would check in on my to my flight on my

00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,540
phone I did it so it's faster and easier

00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:41,969
for me as opposed to go into an airport

00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,769
standing in line I mean obviously the

00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:45,510
most important thing is I show up in an

00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:48,810
airport plot my app I don't have to go

00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:50,970
to the to the check-in desk I just put

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:54,120
my app on screen it scans it it's done

00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:56,939
I'm allowed to fly so the only purpose

00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:01,470
of that happen really was to allow me to

00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:04,709
faster get to flying and it failed to do

00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:06,750
that job it only had one job to do so I

00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:08,430
was thinking about is like which you're

00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,840
trying to build all these apps we're

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,730
trying to build all these websites and

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,430
services but sometimes seem to be

00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:16,290
missing what is the actual core thing

00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,569
we're trying to fix what is the core

00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:20,310
problem we're trying to build in most

00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:23,069
times it's it see what to do something

00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:25,109
faster cheaper or easier like for me

00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:26,819
doing anything online it I prefer that

00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:28,199
as opposed to going to a store buying

00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:30,180
something I would just rather do it

00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:31,769
online so for e-commerce site obvious i

00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,290
want to buy something but if i have an

00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:37,590
app which shows me my boarding pass it

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:42,389
better work i'm sorry i'm not

00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:44,099
really sorry i actually check the

00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:48,930
organizer so parents allowed just where

00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:51,209
r equal free country i guess and i had

00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:53,400
another app another example it was it is

00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:55,799
a nap pod tripit which is a kind of a

00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,659
travel organizing app and shows all your

00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:00,060
flights of your hotels puts everything

00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:01,560
in one spot so as I'm flying here it is

00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,150
all by the way you're flying to PHP UK

00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,359
these are all the details you need it's

00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:08,040
really cool a problem that app has is it

00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:09,930
every time you open it up and if it

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,259
wasn't started before so if the iphone

00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:15,449
just killed app every time you open it

00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:17,340
it decides to refresh for data which is

00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:20,389
fine so it tries to give up the date

00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:22,860
what happens if i am not i farm offline

00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:24,040
it can't refresh your data and just keep

00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,590
spinning forever

00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,480
so again I have an app which tries to

00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:30,520
show me all these things and the moment

00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,500
my internet breaks it stops working if

00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,940
I'm on the flight it doesn't work if I'm

00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,980
an underground it doesn't work again

00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,380
these simple simple apps trying to do

00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:44,490
something good for me just break so so

00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:48,520
quickly so 24 b stock i was thinking i

00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:50,080
started writing PHP to be honest really

00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,910
as i write PHP go back because i went to

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,830
a forum online and those guys like i'm

00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,720
gonna pay a thing with like 50 quid for

00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,730
someone who's gonna build me a nap I'm

00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,710
like I'm gonna build your nap and he is

00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,780
yes you should build me a nap and like

00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,760
okay I'm going to learn PHP now because

00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,050
I know how to the labs so learn PHP and

00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,570
it was pretty cool when i started doing

00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:10,810
all these different things but today I

00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:12,130
realized that if you look at all these

00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:15,910
stars you look at all these companies

00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:17,380
most of them are most of our PHP is I

00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:19,510
think it's absolutely amazing

00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,100
but we went from a line which you choose

00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,540
to be this thing everyone could easily

00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,610
pick up it used to be a thing everyone

00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:27,640
just picks up as a kid I'm such learning

00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:30,550
it's easy to build websites to a

00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,920
language now which people can use to

00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:35,050
build billion-dollar companies I think

00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,960
that's just insane for me that's just it

00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:39,670
breaks my mind so everyone in this room

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,530
can be building something which five

00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:43,750
years for now facebook is going to buy

00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:45,670
for sixteen billion dollars I think it's

00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,860
amazing and that's why I decided to talk

00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:51,640
about this is that everyone in this room

00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:53,920
has the capacity and I guess we drive to

00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:56,710
build things and doesn't really matter

00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,240
is if it's a client application or a

00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,590
start of your building or slide

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,420
projector a building or an open source

00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,400
project you're building your building

00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:05,980
something and that's by itself is

00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,140
amazing but at the same time I've seen

00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:10,780
so many startups and so many projects

00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:13,330
fail to deliver so far that share some

00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:15,880
stories from some some things I've done

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:17,890
before to maybe help you build things

00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,960
which actually work because if there's

00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,730
nothing more frustrating but spending

00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,830
hours and mumps and weeks building

00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:25,240
something and then figuring out it

00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:30,150
doesn't know what actually needs that as

00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:34,060
it sucks so a while ago I found this app

00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:36,250
it's built by BMW and great company

00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:38,780
German coming

00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:41,240
there's a BMW app and you pull out and

00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:44,900
the only thing it does it unlocks your

00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:47,060
car so first of all I was like this is

00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,380
this is just stupid white like why would

00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:51,290
ever need why would I ever need to

00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,280
unlock my car lift my phone and they're

00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,480
like oh it's actually pretty cool you

00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,210
just pull out your app and you unlock it

00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,370
I'm like I just pull up my key press

00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:00,230
unlock and it unlocks how like what the

00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:01,610
app actually solves and it'll get all of

00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:03,470
its like new technologies and things so

00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:05,210
that be subtler goes to a cloud comes

00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,970
back to the car and unlocks it and like

00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:10,730
whatever have gloves on what if I can't

00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:12,500
remember my key code wasn't from drunk

00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:15,890
okay I guess you shouldn't be driving if

00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,570
you drunk anyway but most of the modern

00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:19,730
cars you just have a key in your in your

00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:21,920
pocket your you show up at a car and

00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:25,490
just unlocks itself because it detects

00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:29,240
you so the app itself tries to fix a

00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:30,890
problem which doesn't exist so they send

00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,360
God knows how many how much money how

00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:34,100
much time how developers spend all this

00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,080
time trying to build something trying to

00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,180
fix a problem which doesn't exist and

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,410
the AB obviously fails at some point

00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,230
because it's just no one actually needs

00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:43,640
them so come up with a list of like if

00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:46,970
you if I actually try to build something

00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:50,360
what you should look for the first thing

00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:52,550
is is what you're building is trying to

00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,380
remove some barrier for example if

00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:57,560
you're a bit if you're building a taxi

00:07:54,380 --> 00:08:00,230
app like halo or you burn the batter for

00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,270
that is that if you leave a pub in a

00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:05,180
peak time it's very hard to get a cab

00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:07,670
because everyone so happen so if you

00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,170
have a nap you do that before you

00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:11,720
actually the place and then once a cab

00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:13,670
arrives you leave a place you have a cab

00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:17,990
so it solves a very cool problem of

00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:20,090
finding a cab in a busy time but the

00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:22,130
problem is sometimes people are adopted

00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:26,270
to existing technologies so they can't

00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:28,670
just take on what you're building during

00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:31,310
Christmas me and my friend were driving

00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:32,930
the cab back home in the thing and he's

00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,180
the goal actually this cab company

00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,650
accepts Bitcoin as a payment I was like

00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,570
this is amazing I was just I was so

00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,669
happy for for an hour this is amazing

00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:42,140
you can pay by bit coin so we're driving

00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:43,160
a cab and you're like okay you're going

00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,370
to stop and now we're going to pay the

00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,990
Bitcoin five minutes later we finally

00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,450
paid

00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:51,190
because both my friend and the cab

00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:53,230
driver have no idea how to use any of

00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:54,910
apps so it's been trying to figure out

00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:57,550
how to pay and laser scanning things and

00:08:54,910 --> 00:09:00,610
QR codes everywhere I'm like people are

00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:02,410
used to paying with cash it's very very

00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,570
simple so if you're using a technology

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:06,880
like Bitcoin for payments you better

00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:10,060
make sure that it replaces on which

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,830
exists now in a way which doesn't

00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:14,920
require more work because people are

00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:18,370
already used to somewhat bad currencies

00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:21,220
as cash another thing is sometimes

00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:22,930
sometimes existing some of the existing

00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,020
solutions need to change for your for

00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:29,230
your idea to get adopted again if we go

00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:31,480
back to tax the apps most of them were

00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:33,640
illegal in us for a while because it

00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,170
acts as a service it's pretty well

00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,779
defined and there are different rules

00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:40,660
and laws and you can just build whatever

00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:42,610
you want so it took them quite a while

00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,560
mumps to talk to the governor and

00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,029
eventually allow your app to be active

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,550
so again sometimes you build something

00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:50,170
and there's something you need to

00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:54,610
replace first for your app to become

00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:57,670
viable and the last thing is um most of

00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:59,440
apps we all do is are trying to make

00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:01,360
someone's life easier so if you're

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,670
building a business app it should places

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,149
something for them so we don't have to

00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:09,040
have staff doing something by hand what

00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:11,350
we what all people don't realize it is

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,260
that it's really not that good for a lot

00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:15,550
of people when you replace them if apps

00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:18,279
I would love to replace everyone these

00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:19,959
apps but you're replacing someone job so

00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:22,920
you're going to make one someone

00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:25,180
unemployed and that's not really good so

00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,470
what you have to realize that sometimes

00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,610
as you're introducing technologies

00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,680
they're going to be there's going to be

00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:31,209
people fighting the change again if

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,620
you're building a taxi app the call

00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:34,180
service is going to be like or you're

00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:36,010
going to replace with a nap you're going

00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,420
to fight this as much as we can if

00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,690
you're building an invoice app

00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:43,510
accounting is going to say please don't

00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:44,500
we would like to stay here as a job so

00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,560
that's why you have to look at these

00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,560
things

00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:55,399
most importantly and the circles for

00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:58,199
Paul brahim a guy from y combinator so

00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:59,850
instead of copying facebook I'm still of

00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,350
saying oh I'm going to build a better

00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:03,149
facebook I'm going to build a better

00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,740
twitter i'm going to build a faster

00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:06,810
something i'm going to be a cheap or

00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,420
something you should think about things

00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:11,730
and try to do them from a completely

00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,589
different angle instead of trying to

00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:15,630
copy something is trying to improve on

00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:17,550
something which already exists try to

00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:19,260
envision things from a completely

00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:22,199
different angle for me but probably the

00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:24,269
best example of that is snapchat I'm not

00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:25,620
really a user of snapchat I don't like

00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:32,250
to send naked pictures of myself

00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:34,139
medicine okay I've done it once so I saw

00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,790
app snapchat I'm looking at it it's a

00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:38,850
pretty design it works and messages but

00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:41,519
it looks extremely simple the app itself

00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:43,350
just allows you to send messages but the

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,300
difference is is it doesn't store

00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:47,850
anything so you can have a conversation

00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,740
with someone father a trace be left

00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,480
anymore and for everyone else we were

00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,190
like all this is stupid email stores

00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,019
everything facebook messages all there

00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:56,670
but the snapshot founders figure out

00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:58,920
where the second no one actually wants

00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:01,470
that we're not knowing but most people

00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,540
would like to talk and no trace would be

00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,339
left so they looked at the communication

00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:07,199
we looked at texting from a completely

00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:08,880
different angle and figure out how to

00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:10,560
build a solution which salt now I'm

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,180
almost and they're big on toppler so

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,040
that's a good example of trying to look

00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,040
at something from a different angle I

00:12:16,579 --> 00:12:23,339
think I was I was I was 17 years old and

00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:26,490
I was looking back in the fray Nia where

00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:29,940
I was from and my friend calls me and

00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:32,449
he's like maybe we should build the

00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,800
books e-commerce store and at that time

00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:38,519
like e-commerce was pretty much

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,139
non-existent there's a few stores but

00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:42,269
where no one used them because it was

00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:43,980
just too difficult it was just not a

00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:45,690
good customer experience you would buy

00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,519
things and then they would take weeks to

00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:49,740
ship so it was just not a bad experience

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,079
so here's like well do you think we

00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:55,680
should improve that I'm like I'm young

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:58,260
and dumb amateur let's do it so we spent

00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,970
then six months building an e-commerce

00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,819
site

00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:03,769
now we built everything from the front

00:13:01,819 --> 00:13:08,060
and side from a backhand side to the

00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:10,370
invoicing their house management payment

00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,750
providers like we didn't even use paypal

00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:15,230
we just wrote everything from scratch

00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:17,060
ourselves spend months and months so

00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:18,709
when should we build that and so we

00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,060
won't restore and we can't even you

00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:22,160
can't actually even ship anything

00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:24,379
because we can't afford anything so they

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,839
actually we drive things ourselves so we

00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:29,029
had our own apartments fill the books

00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:30,610
everywhere look it's all books and we

00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:32,569
just take them in the car and ship them

00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:35,120
so we're doing this for months and

00:13:32,569 --> 00:13:36,560
months and the obviously imager is

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,329
growing all the time so it's more and

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,949
more books coming eventually I think we

00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:42,350
got to up to like 10,000 bucks which is

00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:44,629
that times in amazing huge number ten

00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:47,540
thousand bucks Allah and we're starting

00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:49,009
to you like 50 orders a day it's a big

00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:51,589
number we were really happy like we went

00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:54,769
from from having nothing too pretty a

00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:58,389
bigger commerce store and so all the

00:13:54,769 --> 00:14:01,129
time as we are doing this I'm thinking

00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:03,170
how do we actually optimize this because

00:14:01,129 --> 00:14:04,730
right now we have 10,000 books and we

00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:07,309
have some people who look over books and

00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:08,660
we're trying to find them trying to pull

00:14:07,309 --> 00:14:11,660
the best books out and try to sell them

00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:14,449
how do we scale this to be able to sell

00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:16,160
a million books and as I'm thinking

00:14:14,449 --> 00:14:18,649
about them realizing well we can hire

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:22,759
another thousand people but that's not

00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:24,949
really scalable we can try to predict

00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:26,569
what books we should sell I was like

00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:28,579
wait a second that's actually a pretty

00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:31,639
cool idea so how about instead of

00:14:28,579 --> 00:14:33,740
looking at our books as as best actually

00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:35,959
listings how about we just say to an

00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,129
algorithm find us the best books which

00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:40,100
is going to make us famous the most

00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:42,019
amount of money and at that time terms

00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,399
like big data and data science you

00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:44,509
haven't even heard of it so we're like

00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:46,009
okay let's try to build this so we're

00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:47,779
starting building all these tools we

00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:49,189
build scrapers to scrape our websites

00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:50,870
which collecting all this data we're

00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:53,629
looking at this and as we start to build

00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:56,779
this I'm like this actually works it

00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:59,259
should be really cool so the data now

00:14:56,779 --> 00:15:01,009
comes around and everywhere you look now

00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:03,319
everyone's saying all be our big data

00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:04,459
you're building all these things and a

00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:07,069
question I have to everyone all the time

00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:09,380
is like do you actually use your data

00:15:07,069 --> 00:15:11,240
for anything because what a lot of

00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,080
people bragging about data miss is that

00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,620
if you

00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:19,580
use data as a resource you just waste

00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:21,590
money collecting you unusable bits so

00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:23,690
that's the first thing we kind of

00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:26,180
learned when building e-commerce store

00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:27,740
is that if you have data but you're not

00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:30,440
actually using it for anything it's

00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:31,970
useless so then we started building all

00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,170
these tools on this analysis obviously

00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:35,270
Porsche on these graphs all these

00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,650
different pieces of technology trying to

00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:38,420
look at our data from all these

00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:41,060
different angles trying to come up with

00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,800
solutions and then I came to this

00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:44,780
conclusion is that there are a few

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,850
things you need to have to make sure

00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:49,430
whatever data tool you're building

00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:50,840
actually works obviously the first one

00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:53,270
is is there a problem you're trying to

00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:55,550
answer which in most cases data can

00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:57,860
answer a lot of the questions so for

00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:59,600
example what are the top items in our

00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,820
store you look at that it's a very easy

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,090
query you run that you get a result boom

00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:06,620
it works but if you build some kind of a

00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:08,960
tool like what are the best five items

00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:11,180
in our store who is actually going to

00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,560
use that tool in most cases what's your

00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,510
staff if you're building something on

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,970
the app it's probably gonna be some user

00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:20,090
using it for something but that comes

00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:23,120
with tricky bit what sort of decisions

00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:25,490
are we going to do based on the data or

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,350
based on the tool you just did and most

00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:30,830
of the companies fail to deliver that

00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:32,300
and why because if i send your report by

00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:35,420
email about saying oh these are these

00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:38,120
are your thousand best products what

00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:39,620
sort of decision I can make for that not

00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,030
a lot and that's that's the most

00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:44,150
important thing we realize when building

00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:45,980
any sort of data related tool is that if

00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:48,910
you don't allow people to make decisions

00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:51,320
from it or the people making decisions

00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:55,060
are not actually understanding your data

00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:58,700
your tool is pretty much useless and

00:16:55,060 --> 00:17:01,040
what most startups fail is that table is

00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,840
not an interface every time like for

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,030
example again magento every time i log

00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:07,670
it into my gender and go to all your

00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:11,180
support i see a list of my top 1000

00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:14,120
orders so what what like what what

00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:16,550
should i use it for it's useless why is

00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:19,790
it users because as a user you're asking

00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:21,680
me to process every single row to figure

00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:23,900
out that thing is i'm looking for to

00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,990
figure out what questions i should be

00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,000
having and

00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:30,210
then do something about it why like I'm

00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,070
too dumb for this so a table is never

00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:35,280
interface so instead of an e-commerce

00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:38,220
solution having a thousand order list of

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:41,160
something build something which tells me

00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:44,970
you know what your top five items RVs

00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:46,890
your your profit margin today's list and

00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:48,300
these are with five items is you're

00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:51,120
going to run out of stock very very soon

00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:53,160
so I've learned from having raw data

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:57,210
which is for humans kind of

00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:59,429
incomprehensible to having an app which

00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,960
tells me my next actions which tells me

00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:03,750
answers to questions I haven't need an

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,309
answer for so every time I'll be I look

00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,340
at business tools and I look at their as

00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:09,720
apps which trying to help me I'm like

00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,700
what are you telling me please tell me

00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,950
something even if i look at apps like

00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,450
Foursquare which allows me to check in

00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:17,850
but what I'm looking at four squares

00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:20,850
please tell me the best spots in New

00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:22,950
York can you do it not really because it

00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:26,220
tries to focus on having just a list of

00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:27,720
things I don't like lists it takes me

00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,760
time to go for every single I want I

00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,040
want something to tell me what to do

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,440
next once you do that once you build

00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,030
apps which instead of presenting with

00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,100
raw data gives me answers give me

00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:40,920
solutions to problems it becomes so so

00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:43,110
usable and that's why it's so important

00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:46,380
to think about scalability not in terms

00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:49,080
nuts or in technology problem but does

00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:50,420
your idea actually scale again if you

00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,559
have a table once you have 100 items

00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:54,059
everything is very simple your interface

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,010
is very easy to use you can look at

00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:57,330
things very easily what happens when you

00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,880
scale up to having a million of

00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:02,010
something amila products million orders

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:05,580
the app you just build doesn't work

00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:06,870
anymore what you do next and that

00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,460
becomes a problem is how do you scale

00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:10,410
your ideas how you scale your solutions

00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,390
that's why every time I'm building some

00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:14,720
time thinking how we can do this in a

00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:17,910
way where the data size is irrelevant

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,380
that's why if your aunt if your app is

00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:21,630
providing solutions that's why if your

00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:23,520
app is providing suggestions it doesn't

00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:25,770
matter how much data is behind that it

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,090
always gives me something and that's the

00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:28,860
important thing about data and that's

00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:31,170
the important thing is about any data

00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:34,380
tool you build is that how you can do it

00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:36,030
so the data size doesn't matter so you

00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,040
can scale your app you can scale your

00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:39,830
solution

00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:43,400
beyond what's already nap that's very

00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:46,190
very cool I most importantly I hate chat

00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,680
boxes so much I think honestly thing is

00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:50,930
the worst UI element ever invented is a

00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,880
check box because every time you have an

00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:55,370
app or any sort of solution you're like

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,770
oh the app can go to the left or to the

00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:59,510
right let's add a checkbox keep adding

00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:02,120
check boxes for more things i can pick

00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:05,650
things and one what again what happens

00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:08,330
if you have a pretty well used app where

00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:10,790
there are thousand things you need to

00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:13,070
check all these checkboxes for who is

00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:16,520
going to do that another thing is what

00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:18,470
happens when all these check boxes are

00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,440
checked who's going to remember why

00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:23,000
they've checked them this is the biggest

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,370
problem for example Facebook privacy

00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,750
settings is there are so many checkboxes

00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:28,910
and once you check them you don't really

00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:31,460
remember what you check that you don't

00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:32,780
really know what your privacy is then

00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,340
they had to build all these tools to

00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,360
kind of preview what your privacy

00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,100
settings are because all these

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,130
checkboxes are not really telling the

00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:43,760
user what they've just selected most

00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:46,040
importantly I was I was taking a cab I

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,690
think two days ago here in London to the

00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,040
bar and the guys like how so which way

00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:50,330
do you want to go like I don't know I

00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,560
don't live here don't like it don't ask

00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:54,920
me these sort of questions I don't know

00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:56,750
it's pretty much your job please take me

00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,790
there and it's the same happens to your

00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,230
users as we're using your application is

00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:02,390
every time you have a chair box you're

00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:04,520
asking your user to make a decision but

00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:06,620
what if they're not in a position to

00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,730
make those decisions what if they don't

00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,870
know the answer you're just going to

00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:12,140
randomly check things and then just

00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:14,630
break things now in what we were

00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:16,850
building is that in most cases we have

00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:18,500
so many checkboxes for so many so much

00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:21,380
different items like orders data

00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:24,110
products they become unmanageable and

00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:26,030
that's why we're always thinking when it

00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:27,950
comes to data is how do we drive those

00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:30,470
decisions how do you pick a left or

00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,450
right purely based on data because then

00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:34,940
your app becomes scalable beyond

00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:36,410
infinity even when you have more and

00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:38,030
more data coming in even when you have

00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:43,600
more and more users using it it doesn't

00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:46,360
matter um this this startup came to me

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:49,940
recently em and they were building

00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,820
ecommerce charity website so it's pretty

00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,799
much amazon

00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:56,070
but only users using it would be

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:59,250
charities so you list your products on

00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:01,320
there and the charges come there and

00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:03,059
they buy products from you so it works

00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,009
exactly the same as in the same way as

00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:06,630
Amazon just it specifically for charity

00:22:05,009 --> 00:22:08,039
so you can have lower prices you're

00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:11,370
pretty much giving away things for them

00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:13,110
so they can buy them and every time I

00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:17,570
think about that I was like you're

00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:19,740
asking me to user service now but I

00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:22,889
don't want to actually invest that much

00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:25,769
time because any any additional service

00:22:22,889 --> 00:22:29,940
i introduce requires me to spend extra

00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:31,529
time I was like can you can you build it

00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,269
in such a way that it will actually

00:22:31,529 --> 00:22:35,519
requires any time so you built this cool

00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:37,350
idea but the school start up I would

00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:39,059
love to use it but can we make it in

00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:41,549
such a way that it will be completely

00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:44,309
free for me in terms of how much time I

00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:46,139
have to invest in this so we start

00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:48,570
talking into it i know what i realize is

00:22:46,139 --> 00:22:50,429
that every time you introduce a nap

00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:53,039
every time you introduce a new

00:22:50,429 --> 00:22:55,110
technology for anyone beat a user or

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:59,100
anyone how much extra work they're gonna

00:22:55,110 --> 00:23:00,570
have to spend to use it there's a

00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:03,799
concept in finance called opportunity

00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:06,600
cost which is a kind of financialization

00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:08,460
of doing something and not doing

00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,809
something else and a cost of needing

00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:12,419
something else it's called opportunity

00:23:09,809 --> 00:23:14,159
cost so as you're introducing tools

00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:17,370
which we can use it which I can use

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,559
myself when I'm using that tool I'm

00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:22,289
spending my time not doing something

00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:23,370
else so every time every time I want to

00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:25,940
use something I want to make sure that

00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:28,110
there's actually require extra work from

00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:29,370
for me because if it requires our

00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,799
support for me it becomes the two

00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:37,080
becomes useless because the investment

00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:39,509
is just too too high and this great guy

00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:43,250
Jack Dorsey is a founder of twitter and

00:23:39,509 --> 00:23:45,990
founder of square mobile payments app

00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:47,570
you said that the other interesting

00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:50,789
things happening online right now

00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:53,100
everything is is always connected so

00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:55,559
instead of Instagram being a photo app

00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:57,419
which it really is your Instagram just

00:23:55,559 --> 00:24:00,419
takes photos which already exists takes

00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:02,970
filters and takes a social connects them

00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:05,549
and comes up with one final solution

00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:07,470
being an Instagram all the cool service

00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:09,720
right now are all about connecting so

00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:11,519
once the user comes to sorry instagram

00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,700
there's not really that much extra

00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:16,259
effort he has to put into using every

00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,369
time someone comes to me and they're

00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:20,129
like oh do you like to use with our

00:24:17,369 --> 00:24:25,019
invoicing app I'm like yes but like I

00:24:20,129 --> 00:24:27,179
can't go and start doing extra work just

00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:29,369
use your app your app needs to connect

00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:31,769
to to whatever I'm using right now and

00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:33,299
that's why anything you're building

00:24:31,769 --> 00:24:36,690
anything you're doing is always API

00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:38,070
first because nowadays people have

00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:39,869
solutions for everything if your

00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:42,869
ecommerce store you have we have running

00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:46,350
magenta if you're doing a CMS you have

00:24:42,869 --> 00:24:48,239
some some solution running and I want

00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:50,999
every tool every tool you introducing me

00:24:48,239 --> 00:24:53,369
want to make sure it connects your tool

00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:55,379
I want to make sure it doesn't require

00:24:53,369 --> 00:24:58,259
extra work so the data is always going

00:24:55,379 --> 00:25:00,840
back and forward and that's why most of

00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:03,119
our successful tools are always

00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,980
api-based because then I can use

00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:07,139
existing systems and just offload some

00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,489
pieces of data to your app vonage

00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:12,119
crunches through that comes up with a

00:25:08,489 --> 00:25:14,730
solution and and I can use that it's

00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:19,320
very very cool so these are these were

00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:21,809
all about tools and now now to talk

00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:26,009
about real examples I used to be friends

00:25:21,809 --> 00:25:30,090
with Microsoft not anymore so a while

00:25:26,009 --> 00:25:32,759
ago couple years ago they had this cloud

00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:35,070
call it called a sure it's pretty much

00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:38,340
what Amazon is or what rackspace is just

00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:41,279
built by Microsoft the problem they had

00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:43,289
it was extremely hard to use like really

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,119
really hard to use and if you try to

00:25:43,289 --> 00:25:47,690
deploy a PHP app you have to bundle your

00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:52,440
PHP executable they're just just a mess

00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:54,659
so as I'm sitting home I'm like we could

00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,419
actually fix this how about we make as

00:25:54,659 --> 00:26:00,210
you're a very very simple tool how about

00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:02,970
we make it so if I try to deploy my app

00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:04,919
as a developer as a PHP developer I just

00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:07,200
drop in some files into it and just pick

00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:09,899
some up and it works s PHP should be

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,309
working so I sit down and start

00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:13,499
prototyping things inside building an

00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:13,950
app and so it's working really great so

00:26:13,499 --> 00:26:16,080
I

00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:19,049
an email to Microsoft saying hello I

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,190
build a service interfere of your

00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:22,919
service what do you think about it

00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:25,880
they're like yeah your service is called

00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:28,200
as your plus it's probably illegal so

00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,539
they end up not suing me so we started

00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,669
having cause of them then you look at my

00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:35,429
app and it's very very simple you just

00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:37,139
create your application you create a zip

00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:39,330
archive to it you upload it on my

00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:40,620
website it deploys your cloud provision

00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:42,330
some instances provision databases

00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:45,840
everything works everything is very

00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:47,580
pretty so as I'm talking to Microsoft

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,200
and i'm showing to them what I built

00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,760
we're like this is pretty cool this is

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,230
pretty nice like showing show us more

00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,880
and i'm having skype calls and show me

00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:55,350
demos on it and sorry going to

00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,690
conference and was like offices for the

00:26:55,350 --> 00:27:00,090
build eventually they're like maybe you

00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:02,250
want to come to microsoft in redmond

00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:05,220
that's where office may want to come and

00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:08,760
show it to some our engineers so i fly

00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:10,860
to redmond long flight um I'm just like

00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:13,529
they got there and so they had this as

00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:16,019
your conference happening for apparently

00:27:13,529 --> 00:27:18,809
like invited people so i'm glad i'm

00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:21,029
invited them there i'm speaking and the

00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:24,149
first talk they have was by scott

00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:25,830
guthrie this Microsoft I think VP of

00:27:24,149 --> 00:27:28,860
cloud or something and they're like

00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:30,690
hello everyone we built this tool and

00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:33,179
I'm like this looks exactly what I've

00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:35,580
built so apparently they come up with

00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:38,700
their own solution to whatever problem

00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:39,840
solving some devastating like I spent

00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,779
all this time trying to build something

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:46,440
and maxilla scheme up to exactly the

00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:49,200
same tool like mrs. this is horrible so

00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:52,200
but most important is that well actually

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,639
the app i built didn't work at all by

00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,070
the way I've done it it just it would

00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:58,350
trick to people to assume it actually

00:27:56,070 --> 00:28:00,059
works so every time you go and you

00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:02,399
create a database doesn't create a

00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:04,409
database I created a database so as I'm

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,840
having a skype call and I'm like oh

00:28:04,409 --> 00:28:08,279
that's provisional database I'm like so

00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,809
they can they can't actually see me I'm

00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:11,460
like oh I don't have a webcam let's not

00:28:09,809 --> 00:28:13,139
use a webcam so as we're having all

00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,610
these calls I'm actually like jumping

00:28:13,139 --> 00:28:16,350
from a keyboard on our provisioning

00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:18,679
things by hand because I couldn't be

00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:21,659
bothered to actually implement anything

00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:23,580
so I brothers have it works and it's

00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:25,330
also froze all these demos actually like

00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:27,830
I didn't actually implement and

00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:30,050
from the perform provisioning side

00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:31,160
everything everything was tricked so

00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:33,530
first time every time I would deploy a

00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:35,300
sample app guess what i already had the

00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:37,370
sample app deployed somewhere else so

00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:39,350
I'm like oh it's already deployed in

00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:41,060
five seconds it's ridiculous half an

00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:43,130
hour actually but I was like all this is

00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:46,910
earlier here and that's really important

00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:49,070
but every time you build something you

00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:51,280
have to have a prototype which tricks at

00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:53,630
one in assuming you have it's working

00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,890
the problem I see a lot is that people

00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:57,110
would come for example to their boss and

00:28:54,890 --> 00:29:00,170
be like oh I wanna think we have to have

00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:02,360
these five metrics and once we add them

00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:05,540
we're going to increase our sales ten

00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:07,400
times most people will be like yeah that

00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:10,700
doesn't sound right Adam I don't think

00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:12,050
we should do it well instead will be

00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:14,030
like oh actually I spend this weekend

00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:15,770
added these two things and now if we

00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:17,000
just add the last thing everything is

00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:18,890
going amazing a user's going to be

00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,680
happier when you do that and it works

00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:22,790
and then people trust you is that every

00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,140
time you build something it doesn't

00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:26,960
matter if it's a client project or

00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:29,600
startup think about how you can make a

00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,430
prototype which works so as you present

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,320
it to people they can actually

00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:34,760
understand what you're building you can

00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,320
actually understand it and see it and

00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,970
play it because a lot of people get

00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,980
excited about ideas alone so you're like

00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:41,240
oh I'm going to build this tool is going

00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,350
to do this and that i'm going to press

00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,560
all this data i'm going to be all these

00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:48,200
tables but you are like yeah but like

00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:49,880
show me miss and most people would say

00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,410
oh like you haven't actually built this

00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,030
oh you're you're an idiot you can't

00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:58,880
actually build anything well at least we

00:29:53,030 --> 00:30:01,160
say to me but if only you could show

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,840
them my actual real thing instead of

00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,580
saying oh i'm going to give this just

00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:07,160
 do it and show them what you

00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:08,660
just did 10 people like oh it's actually

00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:12,550
pretty cool it works I can play with it

00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:12,550
I can see what it does is very very nice

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,720
but once you probably have you have to

00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:19,280
focus and now so I've like I've built a

00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,990
few different things and I've seen many

00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,720
many other people do different things

00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:26,300
most important thing is he have to focus

00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:29,030
is what you're building so you have this

00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:32,450
great idea I'm going to do a payments

00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:35,660
provider your core thing to do is to

00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:36,950
make sure payments work um whatever

00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:39,030
interfaces you're going to build

00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:41,700
whatever graphs you're going to do not

00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:46,560
actually matter until the payment

00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:48,570
service works in even odd of open source

00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:51,570
projects get sidetracked trying to build

00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:53,610
these unnecessary extra services extra

00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:57,360
tools without actually delivering on a

00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:59,490
core part of an application so it's

00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,350
extremely important to focus once you're

00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:04,230
building susumi important tific a few

00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:06,930
things do them right and then move on to

00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:09,090
do different things so forth as you're

00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:11,310
building prototypes you pick the most

00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:14,040
important features you build them I

00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:15,810
guess you faked everything else and have

00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,880
app works everything functions you can

00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:19,830
build it in a week it's nice it's pretty

00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,530
adverse well once you lose focus once

00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:23,970
you start doing all these extra things

00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:28,380
then everything just breaks and falls

00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:31,500
apart again another quote from Jack

00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:34,140
Dorsey is that all the good products

00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:36,450
never day or all the good inventors of

00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:39,810
everything usually pick a few core

00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:41,580
features and they do them right and they

00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:43,590
they're obsessed about their about

00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:48,930
obsess for perfection but it's all about

00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:52,650
to a limited scope again if you look at

00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:54,750
snapchat it truly only does messaging

00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:55,710
you can't like even for messaging you

00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:57,720
have to send a picture you can't

00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:59,310
actually just send texts which sounds

00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:01,560
stupid it's like why I can see a text

00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:08,220
it's about focus is about figuring out

00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:09,450
the core principles of a nap so as we're

00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,590
talking about as we're talking about

00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:13,950
building things and it's talking about

00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:16,410
startups all the people get excited

00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:17,640
about idea to build a billion-dollar app

00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:19,410
all the people are excited about that

00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,700
they all have this great technology one

00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:23,250
a bill that I want to launch it for

00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:26,040
everyone else to use and then once they

00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:27,090
do any of this they no one no one is

00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,240
really interesting no one's actually

00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:32,010
buying your idea and while that happens

00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,300
because the only way even actually build

00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:35,250
something the only way you can get

00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:37,530
everyone else to use whatever you're

00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:40,620
building if you actually solve real

00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:42,420
problems not made-up ones not go to an

00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,800
art industry and say you're going to

00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,720
build in your commerce site build art

00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,640
I'm pretty sure you don't even know how

00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,900
art works like you can just go to a

00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,180
random industry and try to solve

00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,160
problems for them and expect people to

00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:56,900
use them

00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:58,340
I was a couple weeks ago I i get to

00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,840
remove my jacket I was like I mean I

00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,460
work as a shipper for for a couple days

00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,670
I'm gonna learn how their housing works

00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:06,080
so went to their house okay funny enough

00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:07,820
everyone's like oh you did you get the

00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,620
fight or something I'm like no I just I

00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:11,750
want to experience very housing so I

00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:13,160
went to their house and I'm shipping

00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,630
things and I'm scanning all the darkest

00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:17,030
and packing things and I'm shipping em

00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:18,890
off and all the time i'm thinking i

00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:21,170
could actually introduce a lot of these

00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:23,030
technologies but all what they're going

00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:25,970
to do is probably add extra work for

00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:28,340
everyone in that in that work because

00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:30,170
the shipping is all about taking a

00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:32,000
product I guess scanning it turns

00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:33,440
awesome system which then tells them

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,750
what's your next and you put the box out

00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,050
so what Telegraph's solve whatever

00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:40,700
problem you see to solve it has to make

00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:43,990
sure it just either improves the

00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:46,220
shippers performance or makes it easier

00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:48,620
solving a problem like increasing the

00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:50,360
quality of shipping like there's no

00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:51,800
problem with that so to realize as

00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:55,580
you're building things what's lecture

00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:58,220
poor problem you're trying to solve so

00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:59,840
recently what's app i think yes you've

00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:03,020
got bought by Facebook a huge amount of

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,310
money and there was like oh why did they

00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:06,830
get so popular because we had like I

00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:11,210
think 400 million users for an app which

00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:12,950
is a lot what we figured what the app

00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:15,650
creators figure is we actually have to

00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:17,900
reach the right customers so they were

00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:20,450
one of the first I guess startups

00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:22,610
nowadays to build a Java app for all the

00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:23,990
dumb phones which nowadays you'd be like

00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:26,570
why would they do this who is going to

00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:29,750
use a dumb phone pretty much most of the

00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:32,380
world so except from accepting us and UK

00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:35,419
and all the rich countries like that

00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:37,669
Africa and Asia are really huge into

00:34:35,419 --> 00:34:41,000
just old nokia sand all the old phones

00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:43,850
all them are in Java so I have to have

00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,740
to build a gel app so what's a built all

00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:48,590
of them and all of a sudden huge parts

00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:51,110
of the world became users of a lap I was

00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:53,000
in Spain that while ago and my friends

00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:54,710
like are you on whatsapp I'm like I

00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,380
don't even know what it is she's like oh

00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:58,970
in Spain text messaging is expensive

00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:01,130
enough and I can't really get a good

00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:03,530
enough plan that everyone's on whatsapp

00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:04,810
because i just paid by that for data and

00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:06,910
it is cheaper way more

00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:07,960
variants pain than text messaging and it

00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:09,340
will email click on my head I was like

00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,370
that makes no sense on the part of this

00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:13,900
it's the truth so all of us figuring out

00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:15,190
how do you reach your right customer how

00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:17,500
to reach the people you're trying to

00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:19,900
build every time I pull up a website in

00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:21,910
some hotel with a shitty connection and

00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:23,320
doesn't it takes forever to load or

00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:25,330
every time I go to Facebook and it

00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:28,150
starts playing videos automatically I'm

00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:30,550
like you know that only works for less

00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:32,560
than 1% of the world because everywhere

00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:34,570
else my internet is too slow or else it

00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,620
just can't load all these assets so

00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:37,600
you're building something which does

00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:39,610
actually reach the populations it tries

00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,960
to segregate users you start to pick

00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:43,120
only the users with fast internet

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,320
connections that's horrible every time I

00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:46,630
go to a hotel and I can't open the

00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,860
website because that ssl connection is

00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:50,050
not good enough so it keeps dropping

00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:52,330
packets and the assets download I'm like

00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:53,710
just don't have so much things on the

00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:56,110
website you try to figure out how you

00:35:53,710 --> 00:36:02,280
can achieve the reach of your app with a

00:35:56,110 --> 00:36:04,420
smaller or user base um I like sports oh

00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:08,620
but most importantly as you're building

00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:10,690
anything think about as a sport so as I

00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:12,040
was I was as I was sitting in a

00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:13,810
Microsoft Office I'm like oh this is

00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:17,320
just my thing I did spend a couple

00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:19,090
months building it failed but I was like

00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:21,130
a sectional too bad I learned something

00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:22,870
I learned how to build things I learn

00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:24,280
how to take it from an idiot an actual

00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:26,320
implementation how to get people to

00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:28,870
listen to that that's actually that's

00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,370
really cool so is it as you're building

00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:32,170
technology solve some problems you

00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:33,760
realize that in most of the time it's

00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:35,860
problem not gonna work most of the time

00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,960
whatever you build people are going to

00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,940
look at that and be like yeah you try to

00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,770
build something doesn't work doesn't

00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:43,780
really work you should be like yeah fine

00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:46,690
I'm going to build something else we got

00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:48,010
most of the successful inventors most of

00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:51,070
a successful people who build things

00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:52,360
they always trying to find a new idea so

00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:53,710
I just build more things and keep

00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,330
building them as a sport you fail and

00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:58,570
you build again eventually so I was

00:36:55,330 --> 00:37:00,780
going to click so it's a finishing

00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:04,800
example and the best example I have

00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:04,800
anyone has heard of his name before

00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:10,240
amazing he's American understand I'm not

00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:13,240
judging you I service this guy called

00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:18,289
Fisher I think he was born in late 80s

00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:21,650
and he had a horrible I side so

00:37:18,289 --> 00:37:23,209
you sitting in a classroom he can't

00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:24,499
really see the blackboard so he

00:37:23,209 --> 00:37:26,029
eventually gets moved to the back of the

00:37:24,499 --> 00:37:28,759
classroom because he teachers like you

00:37:26,029 --> 00:37:30,769
can learn anything you're more on leave

00:37:28,759 --> 00:37:32,719
so eventually he says verily I can't

00:37:30,769 --> 00:37:35,859
actually learn anything so maybe I

00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:39,109
should just quit school so he does I

00:37:35,859 --> 00:37:40,459
guess I well obviously as a good school

00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:43,579
have to come up with voice to make money

00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:45,619
so he's like I'm gonna sell candy so he

00:37:43,579 --> 00:37:47,329
buy some Kenya starts longing but he was

00:37:45,619 --> 00:37:50,929
like incredibly clever marketer so

00:37:47,329 --> 00:37:54,069
instead of just on candy so he buys from

00:37:50,929 --> 00:37:57,019
somewhere a huge print of a naked lady

00:37:54,069 --> 00:37:59,799
puts it on his chest and cars covers it

00:37:57,019 --> 00:38:02,150
with his robe when he goes to train and

00:37:59,799 --> 00:38:04,039
as he walks past all these businessmen

00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:05,779
traveling somewhere he walks past them

00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:07,069
and just flips it up shows his for a

00:38:05,779 --> 00:38:10,459
second then moves on and they're like

00:38:07,069 --> 00:38:11,689
whoa I sup kid what you're doing so they

00:38:10,459 --> 00:38:12,859
come back and they're like oh please

00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:15,199
show us more he's like if you buy the

00:38:12,859 --> 00:38:16,339
candy I'll show you more and we start

00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:19,029
buying all these kinda starts making all

00:38:16,339 --> 00:38:22,519
this money a huge startup works great I

00:38:19,029 --> 00:38:24,199
think he's like Oh bicycles ever one

00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:27,019
wants to have a bicycle I should open

00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:30,890
the bicycle store so here him and his

00:38:27,019 --> 00:38:32,179
brothers builds a bicycle store no one's

00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:33,829
buying my sickle no one we needs a

00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:38,619
bicycle so he's like how do i how do i

00:38:33,829 --> 00:38:41,390
get people to buy bicycles he he takes

00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:43,339
he takes a rope climbs up to the tallest

00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:46,159
building connects the rope from one

00:38:43,339 --> 00:38:49,789
building to another gets a stunt against

00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:51,650
driver and he just drives around on the

00:38:49,789 --> 00:38:53,689
trope the top of all these buildings

00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:56,150
almost like this amazing everyone starts

00:38:53,689 --> 00:38:59,029
buying bicycles he's always pretty cool

00:38:56,150 --> 00:39:01,269
I think eventually he he flies to

00:38:59,029 --> 00:39:07,189
Minneapolis one of the big cities in yes

00:39:01,269 --> 00:39:10,069
he takes an air balloon sorry miss wrong

00:39:07,189 --> 00:39:11,359
I miss I miss apart so eventually she

00:39:10,069 --> 00:39:14,599
sent some bicycles was pretty cool he's

00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:17,150
like oh he's a car driving he's the goal

00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:19,009
maybe I should start selling cars and he

00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:20,779
get like he's blinded up as a bat so he

00:39:19,009 --> 00:39:23,659
buys he buys a car anyway he drives you

00:39:20,779 --> 00:39:26,299
this fastest speed agility it's amazing

00:39:23,659 --> 00:39:28,549
I'm gonna buy one my cigar he's like

00:39:26,299 --> 00:39:31,429
maybe I should start selling cars so he

00:39:28,549 --> 00:39:34,489
opens up a car sales place one of the

00:39:31,429 --> 00:39:36,349
first car dealerships in u.s. selling

00:39:34,489 --> 00:39:37,669
all these cars before buying cars and

00:39:36,349 --> 00:39:39,499
he's like I'm pretty sure eventually

00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:41,709
people are going to want to drive these

00:39:39,499 --> 00:39:45,409
cars at night so he invents a headlamp

00:39:41,709 --> 00:39:48,650
about the hamlet is selling them it's

00:39:45,409 --> 00:39:50,419
running great eventually he decides to

00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:52,279
open the store in Minneapolis so he goes

00:39:50,419 --> 00:39:55,880
to Minneapolis gets a huge hot air

00:39:52,279 --> 00:39:58,819
balloon hookups a cart it goes to the

00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:00,559
air he's flying he's a pretty girl on a

00:39:58,819 --> 00:40:02,809
street so he's like Oh stopped us up

00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:05,479
let's go down so she comes to her he

00:40:02,809 --> 00:40:07,009
starts talking and I girls like why do

00:40:05,479 --> 00:40:08,239
you keep building all these things like

00:40:07,009 --> 00:40:09,890
you have so much money by this point

00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:12,199
while you keep building he's like oh

00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:13,969
that's really the only thing I want in

00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:16,039
life is like I want to build things he's

00:40:13,969 --> 00:40:17,089
like yeah but like let's think get

00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:19,640
things started and let's do something

00:40:17,089 --> 00:40:21,679
just travel let's go on holidays when

00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:23,150
he's like no no I'm gonna do one last

00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:27,439
thing well do one last thing and then

00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:29,719
it's going to be over so as he's driving

00:40:27,439 --> 00:40:31,249
his car he's like oh I'm pretty sure

00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:32,779
people would love to see them right

00:40:31,249 --> 00:40:34,789
because he's seen people racing the

00:40:32,779 --> 00:40:36,739
scars anyway because men we'd like to go

00:40:34,789 --> 00:40:39,079
fast so here I want to build a right

00:40:36,739 --> 00:40:41,029
track so he builds a dirt race track and

00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:42,979
I was like it has to be this dumbest

00:40:41,029 --> 00:40:45,309
thing you've ever done who's gonna watch

00:40:42,979 --> 00:40:52,699
people go in circles on a jerk track

00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:54,409
Americans I'm sorry so he he was a track

00:40:52,699 --> 00:40:56,479
and like six people died in the first

00:40:54,409 --> 00:40:58,640
race it's just complete disaster he's

00:40:56,479 --> 00:41:00,709
like I was horrible and he's already

00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:03,169
like charging a buck like a dollar to

00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:05,630
see the rice and people come anyway so

00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:07,849
he starts building that eventually he he

00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:10,400
builds a paved road was a paved track

00:41:07,849 --> 00:41:12,589
and that's what Indy 500 is now today so

00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,469
he built in different I want one of the

00:41:12,589 --> 00:41:17,689
most famous races in u.s. he starts

00:41:15,469 --> 00:41:19,369
doing that and obviously his now wife

00:41:17,689 --> 00:41:21,709
comes to him and he she's like well

00:41:19,369 --> 00:41:24,409
please come to a holiday so they fly

00:41:21,709 --> 00:41:25,669
they fly to Florida and as we were

00:41:24,409 --> 00:41:27,409
walking around the Florida we see all

00:41:25,669 --> 00:41:30,469
these things and there's a guy building

00:41:27,409 --> 00:41:33,079
a massive bridge apartment at that time

00:41:30,469 --> 00:41:35,420
one of the longest and biggest bridges

00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:36,109
in the world so it comes to the guy he's

00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,849
like while you're building was

00:41:36,109 --> 00:41:39,499
originally thought I'd like to build

00:41:37,849 --> 00:41:41,509
bridges he's like what's on the other

00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:43,339
side because I go I didn't even notice

00:41:41,509 --> 00:41:43,850
some swamps so he's like please taking

00:41:43,339 --> 00:41:47,480
her

00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:48,950
so we take a car go to the swamps and he

00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:51,200
starts looking around he's goes to the

00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:52,820
ground and playing with some mud he was

00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:56,270
like I'm pretty sure I can backfill all

00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:58,550
this place he's like sure I'll pay I'll

00:41:56,270 --> 00:42:00,860
pay for a bridge but I get the land and

00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:03,170
I build anything I won't bear it so he

00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:07,820
does so he starts back filling all this

00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:10,460
land if eventually he throws it out

00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:14,780
build casinos he builds hotels that's

00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:19,700
Miami today so he built Miami no one

00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:21,680
comes the whole place is empty and he at

00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:23,420
Point he has quite a lot of money but he

00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,340
built a huge like Miami's one of the

00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:28,700
largest cities in years now along comes

00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:30,830
so he runs to the Congress in vaginal DC

00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:32,540
and he has enough money by this point

00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:35,060
he's like let's build a highway from

00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:38,840
north to Miami so they build a highway

00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:41,390
no one comes if I had to do something I

00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:43,550
put all my money into this and no one is

00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:47,690
coming I have to have to do something

00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:49,790
and by this time he's also pretty good

00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:51,680
friends with a president so he invites

00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:54,440
the president to Miami he takes a few

00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:57,740
photos and when everyone starts noticing

00:42:54,440 --> 00:43:00,500
that and then want one person comes to

00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:02,590
people come eventually is as insane as

00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:04,910
it is today today in an internal wall

00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:07,880
all these people selling all the land

00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:10,370
eventually everything gets bought and so

00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:12,980
Miami is filled with people its

00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:14,840
flourishing everything instance like by

00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:17,000
this point he has more money than he

00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:18,740
ever need but he's like he wouldn't be

00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,110
himself he's like I'm gonna buy I'm

00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:23,810
gonna try to build something else so he

00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:26,150
decides to build the north miami which

00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:29,450
is pretty much on East Side of New York

00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:32,780
with an island which is kind of referred

00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:35,780
to as well Miami of the north he invests

00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:39,290
all of his money into that eventually

00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:41,720
the markets crashed everything gets shut

00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:46,880
down everything is over he can't finish

00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:48,650
it so as he's almost passing away this

00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,330
guy come to these guys come to him and

00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:53,210
they're like we're gonna take on a hot

00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:56,600
air balloon and fly over Miami the city

00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:57,470
you built as they're flying he sees all

00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,330
these things

00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:01,070
it's amazing it's a huge flourishing

00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:03,280
city million people millions of people

00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:07,130
are living there it's amazing and

00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:10,310
eventually he passes away and the point

00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:12,170
of a story that everything everything

00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:15,320
he's he built everything he tried to

00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:17,510
build was never to make money he didn't

00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:20,450
care he ever every money every penny he

00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:23,710
made he was always a mess it back it

00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:28,070
wasn't about trying to solve problems

00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:32,000
for for just for fake reasons everything

00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:35,810
he's done is he saw opportunities a

00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,920
market he saw gaps like headlamps people

00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:38,750
are gonna eventually want to drive at

00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:41,690
night how are we going to do is we can't

00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:44,500
see anything here both a headlamp for

00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:47,420
him it was all about solving problems

00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:51,140
for people for him it was always about

00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:54,080
figuring out solutions and then making

00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:57,260
so everyone else sees them and at a

00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:58,220
doctor like Indy 500 by this why this

00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:00,830
point is probably one of the greatest

00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:02,570
races in us and it started off from a

00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:04,550
dirt track and people's which people

00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:07,880
died every turn we make because it was

00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:09,730
just incredibly bad and that's what I

00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:12,410
want to leave you guys there is that

00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:14,990
everything you're building everything on

00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:17,869
a learning miss conference make sure you

00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:20,270
remember but it's all about trying to

00:45:17,869 --> 00:45:23,410
solve problems for people and trying to

00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:26,650
build things just because you want you

00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:26,650
