Publication date: 2014-03-21
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2014
Description: 
	If you want to get involved in open source but keep talking yourself out of it, let me show you how to take that first step. I'll cover the mechanics of contributing, from saying hello and installing the project to selecting a bug, your first pull request and code review. If you're already a contributor, contribute to my talk and share your valuable ideas.
