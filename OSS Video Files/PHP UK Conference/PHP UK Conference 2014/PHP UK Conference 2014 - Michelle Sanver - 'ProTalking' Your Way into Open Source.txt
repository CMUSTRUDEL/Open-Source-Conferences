Title: PHP UK Conference 2014 - Michelle Sanver - 'ProTalking' Your Way into Open Source
Publication date: 2014-03-21
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2014
Description: 
	If you want to get involved in open source but keep talking yourself out of it, let me show you how to take that first step. I'll cover the mechanics of contributing, from saying hello and installing the project to selecting a bug, your first pull request and code review. If you're already a contributor, contribute to my talk and share your valuable ideas.

	00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:09,510
Sam here to talk about krill talking

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,210
away into open source protec was my

00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:15,179
first of the source project so that's

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:18,750
why we have the title but before I begin

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:21,990
if you want the purple elephant you can

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:25,320
go to that link and pledge for it

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:27,330
because there are so so I'm not really

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,400
going to say who i am i'm going to ask

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:33,989
who are you how many of you have

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,850
contributed to the source before alright

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:40,790
how many have made your own mobile

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:44,430
source project what are you doing here

00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:48,930
so you guys you know how this works so

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:51,840
you can contribute to my talk and the

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:54,930
promise of open source is very quality

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,780
higher reliability more flexibility

00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:02,539
lower costs and an end to predatory

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:06,119
vendor locking from of the source org so

00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:08,790
better quality when everyone watches and

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,189
things yeah it's better quality than if

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:14,549
you sit alone in your bedroom and nobody

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:18,540
cares right and would better quality

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:23,009
comes higher reliability and more

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:26,340
flexibility so it's also really cheap

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:28,020
compared because you get developers for

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,390
free instead of having a whole team

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,210
working on it it might be worth open

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:38,040
sourcing your project only to save us

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:42,119
and my personal favorites and end to

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:44,850
predatory vendor lock-in what does that

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:47,729
exactly mean basically are not dependent

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,680
on your vendor anymore and when

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:52,259
something happens probably someone else

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,040
can fix it then it's awesome community

00:01:52,259 --> 00:02:00,210
yet anyone not convinced great I'm done

00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:04,619
and so I'm going to tell you a story of

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:07,740
who I was but first I'm going to say

00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:09,509
that my mum is a graphical artist so

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,200
these are the only pictures you will see

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:12,200
of me and

00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:19,150
if I got enough nutritional value from

00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:22,840
code I would eat that nothing else I was

00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:25,739
a code addict and I had been programming

00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:29,079
since I was 12 years old or something

00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:32,200
but you know I would never share it ever

00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:36,069
ever ever don't I didn't want the end

00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:38,799
want to see it because if someone would

00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:40,390
see my coat I don't know I was a bedroom

00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:42,549
coder I didn't know how it looked like

00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:45,909
and I was really really scared of the

00:02:42,549 --> 00:02:50,739
trolls to come and eat me and you know I

00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:53,349
was not comfortable at all so I made web

00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:55,540
sites under a nickname no one knew my

00:02:53,349 --> 00:03:01,239
real name everyone thought that was male

00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:03,579
because that helped as well so I had no

00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:06,370
food folio because of this which led to

00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:09,489
me being unemployable no one wanted to

00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:11,370
hire me and what they do is be

00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:17,500
unemployable you start your own company

00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:19,810
so I started p which is fair you know it

00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:24,370
was a fun logo in a fun name but that's

00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:27,970
about it I did manage to get a few

00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:31,810
clients which is cool but i still have

00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:34,000
no code confidence at all i mean i

00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:38,560
thought i was the graphics programmer in

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,340
the world and this is partly why i

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,340
wanted to contribute

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:52,480
so why I really wanted to contribute was

00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:56,010
that I felt ashamed for not contributing

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:59,470
I went to a conference PHP benelux and

00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:02,050
in there there was this keynote where

00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:05,020
the speaker told everyone who had been

00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:06,400
contributing to stand up so I'm going to

00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:11,880
do the same here everyone have a

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:15,280
contribute to tova source stand up yeah

00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:17,140
so yeah that's how I felt when I was

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,670
sitting down it didn't feel good you can

00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:25,750
sit down so I'm going to teach you how

00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:29,800
to contribute it I found these cool

00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:33,610
projects that i wanted i wanted to help

00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:38,320
them improve the product is called frill

00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:41,560
talk and it's not about talking

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,290
professionally it's this video and a lot

00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:48,280
of body which is being there it's videos

00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:50,170
about PHP so if you want to see an

00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:55,030
earlier version of this talk it will be

00:04:50,170 --> 00:05:00,220
there soon and prozac really really

00:04:55,030 --> 00:05:02,200
helped me and I realize thats wrong so

00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:04,330
frail talk helped me in so many ways

00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,610
because I could watch the videos their

00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:08,380
videos and then they had slides next to

00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:11,980
the video so you can really really

00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:13,810
follow a lot so when you're choosing

00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:18,010
your own project there's so many things

00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:20,530
you want to look at so the first thing

00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:22,600
is what are your friends doing that

00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,900
really helps if you work with your

00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:28,540
friends it's going to be so much easier

00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:31,450
but you know you may not have friends so

00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:33,820
well and second step is to be passionate

00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:37,330
they are really really really passionate

00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:38,890
you're gonna do this for free so if

00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,900
you're not passionate about it don't do

00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:44,560
it find something that you really like

00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:47,140
to do or something if you found a bug in

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,910
the open source software that can be

00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:52,090
your first contribution it's really

00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:56,290
really helpful or

00:05:52,090 --> 00:06:00,550
you can improve what you already is so

00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:02,110
by that I mean if you are using an open

00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:05,500
source project let's say you're using

00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:08,199
symfony2 and you found something wait

00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:10,449
wait this would be much cooler if the

00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:12,699
framework had this feature why don't you

00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:15,130
add it yes that's a really cool

00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:17,860
contribution or if you think the

00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:21,100
documentation is lacking so I did this I

00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:22,810
used it but you know I had to ask a

00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,940
million questions put them into that

00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:28,630
documentation and contribute that way

00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:31,210
and if you don't think any of this is

00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:36,580
cool you can be a superhero because

00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:39,550
that's cool so a code montage is really

00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:42,100
new and they have all these cool

00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:43,780
projects in there if you're ready to

00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:48,220
change the world go in there and you'll

00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:55,510
see for instance get tip which is really

00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:58,810
good projects and you know obstacles we

00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:03,039
all had them including the speaker's

00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:07,599
here at this conference and so David

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:13,000
traffic coming in community guy super

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:16,710
awesome his first obstacle was fear I

00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,620
think a lot of people have this and

00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:24,120
finding something to actually do it's

00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:31,120
really hard but hopefully you know

00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:34,930
protocol chillin and Lorna she's also

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:39,220
awesome she didn't realize her efforts

00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:40,930
would be useful a welcome and now she

00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,760
appreciates the effort and she's doing

00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:47,650
it anyway and that's the way you should

00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:49,930
see just do it anyway so Joshua he

00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:55,539
didn't really know he's a bit older than

00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:57,729
I am and he thinks he contributed to the

00:07:55,539 --> 00:08:00,219
Linux kernel first but not really sure

00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:03,250
and he couldn't say what his biggest

00:08:00,219 --> 00:08:05,300
obstacle is but he thinks the biggest

00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:08,030
issue for starting contributors

00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:16,000
is they overwhelmed by the current

00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:18,909
yesterday's Eli's also quite interesting

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,430
he didn't want to do it just as a hobby

00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:24,979
so he was trying to convince NASA but

00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:29,060
obviously they didn't want to share that

00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:32,360
coat so he failed the third heard the

00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:34,279
was that he had no other source karma

00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,219
even though he was a senior programmer

00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:40,729
he had been programming for ages nobody

00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:45,290
wanted to trust his code or him that was

00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:50,120
a big hurdle for him Beth had another

00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:54,170
story kind of similar to mine she was

00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:58,370
feeling she was afraid of being publicly

00:08:54,170 --> 00:09:00,470
ridiculed she was really scared and the

00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:03,860
worst part is that she was publicly

00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:10,220
ridiculed as well and let's get her off

00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:12,079
for one and a half year there is so but

00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:17,089
thanks to the PFE community she made it

00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:20,029
through my obstacles are technology new

00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:22,430
technology and fear of public ridicule

00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:24,649
if I'm trying something new and scared

00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:28,660
I'm doing it wrong and everyone will see

00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:28,660
it so

00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:41,829
I first of throat ah gracias in symfony2

00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,449
that wasn't me a framework for me

00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:49,089
because I had been using zend framework

00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:52,869
and I thought of really not contributing

00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:55,149
because you know symphony I I was scared

00:09:52,869 --> 00:09:57,069
and I would be doing it wrong I wouldn't

00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:59,979
be doing it the symphony way like

00:09:57,069 --> 00:10:03,249
everyone was saying but trying out soon

00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:05,619
funny let's so many things I tried to

00:10:03,249 --> 00:10:07,869
wake for the first time twig is an

00:10:05,619 --> 00:10:10,029
awesome templating engine and I

00:10:07,869 --> 00:10:12,999
completely fell in love with it only

00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:16,629
because I wasn't that afraid I guess to

00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:19,209
try it and composer oh my god I cannot

00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:21,489
live without it now composer is the most

00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:24,159
amazing tool ever if you don't know what

00:10:21,489 --> 00:10:30,669
compulsories it's a package manager PHP

00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:34,079
and then the biggest obstacle in my

00:10:30,669 --> 00:10:38,999
technology for pro talk was actually

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:41,499
vagrants because i'm not devops and

00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:44,350
vagrant is this virtual machine when you

00:10:41,499 --> 00:10:47,589
set up your coding environments and that

00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:50,739
was near to me but actually learned that

00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:54,939
it made my life easier all you do is

00:10:50,739 --> 00:10:58,179
that you read the readme and then add

00:10:54,939 --> 00:11:03,159
whatever to your hosts file that is the

00:10:58,179 --> 00:11:06,639
vagrant IP and then the host and then

00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:08,709
you type vagrant up in the terminal it's

00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:10,919
really easy then you watch the magic

00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,919
happen

00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:23,700
it's really just magic it sets

00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:27,810
everything up voice it's installing gate

00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:30,209
new 4g which i'm using composer this is

00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:38,269
a symphony project called on them up and

00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:38,269
working on and that's it and of course

00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:42,600
erica is going to talk about vagrants

00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:50,269
morals so if you actually want to know

00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:54,300
more about it go to Erica's talk and I

00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:57,480
also didn't know github very well when I

00:11:54,300 --> 00:12:00,870
was going to contribute real talk and I

00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:03,420
was using a graphical client called gift

00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:05,420
box to do gates and that turned out to

00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,920
be a really big obstacle for me I

00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:10,860
learned now that the guitar client is

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,589
actually pretty good so what you can do

00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:16,350
is that you're just you see all your

00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:18,750
Forks in there and you can clone it to

00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:21,089
your computer from there and when you

00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:24,839
commit something from this client it

00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:27,630
will automatically go to github to your

00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:29,250
fork so you don't have to pull emergen

00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:34,529
you don't have to care you can actually

00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:36,360
just code and not worry about it but you

00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:39,120
know that's good for basics and getting

00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:43,050
started but you really have to start

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:47,220
doing gates I had some obstacles

00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:48,980
honestly it was difficult to me and that

00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,200
no one has to know it was difficult

00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:55,589
because you can change everything

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:59,790
against for instance and you can start

00:12:55,589 --> 00:13:02,149
amending things get commit- I'm in it

00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:04,740
you commit so just commit something add

00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:06,510
whatever you forgot and amended and it's

00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:12,149
perfect people don't have to know you

00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:13,740
forgot it yay and also I realized it was

00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:15,870
pretty awkward because I had been

00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,910
reading documentation I had been reading

00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:20,610
about Symphony it took me ages before I

00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:23,910
could actually contribute so my fork was

00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:25,570
completely outdated so you need to keep

00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:27,970
yourself updated and

00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:30,460
I didn't find any easy way to do this in

00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:33,880
my graphical client i did buy them so

00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:37,540
just these three lines add your upstream

00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:41,470
fetch it and mud Shipton your updated

00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:44,620
it's awesome and what gets you can

00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:49,210
change anything so don't worry just keep

00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:52,750
doing it's about two weeks ago I believe

00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:54,970
I was at the sunshine PHP sunshine PHP

00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:59,200
is an awesome conference in miami

00:13:54,970 --> 00:14:02,680
florida and then I saw this kid talk by

00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:06,640
a guy called Jeremy lindblom and he was

00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:09,220
singing a song and I'm gonna play it for

00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:23,880
you now because it's three different if

00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:28,170
the audio works get help faking it

00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:28,170
remove fetch poet

00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:34,940
and status comment you're doing yet

00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:49,120
long branch check out that's it check

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:52,660
out virtually base don't quit lunar

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,870
recent a crush those bits you're doing

00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,870
it

00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,710
you're do it

00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:05,990
forgot come none of the repos you know

00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:12,040
patches a pull request you'll still

00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:12,040
licking show your do not

00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:17,930
you're doing it you're doing its own

00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:20,460
ticket by M&T your username help you

00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:27,450
around the test before you in it

00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:30,230
you're an idiot you're doing it you're

00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:30,230
doing it

00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:34,140
you're doing get

00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,060
or do we get

00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:51,430
so yeah that's a Jeremy Lin bloom he

00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:53,110
works for amazon and he's great at

00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:57,040
coding and apparently i'll start singing

00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:59,800
so these are the essential things of

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:04,540
gets and you know memorize the song

00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:07,750
memorized kids but I'm not here to do a

00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:10,480
git talk but I can show you how to learn

00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:14,920
get yourself so I found this really cool

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:19,420
interactive tutorial it was a try get up

00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:23,110
dot IO and in here it's you just write

00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:24,870
everything and try get and just go there

00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:29,170
because it's awesome it's life changing

00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:30,910
and you can also try other resources get

00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:35,980
immersion it's really good for getting

00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:42,780
into gates and book that I have link

00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:46,120
there is good as well so get my previous

00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:47,980
times are given this talk I asked after

00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,950
every step for people to contribute to

00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:54,220
it and I didn't know about this awesome

00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:56,500
little tool called hope so actually

00:16:54,220 --> 00:17:00,960
learn something from people cuntriot

00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:04,210
intimate act which was also so hope is

00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:07,950
gets tool for getting get up into the

00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:10,150
terminal basically and what you can do

00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:15,730
it's basically get with github

00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:17,410
superpowers so you can add a remote just

00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:21,310
by typing the name instead of the entire

00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:24,250
URL or you can do a pull requests

00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:27,850
immediately from your terminal or you

00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:30,430
can just write get rouse and it goes to

00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:33,400
the browser for you and it basically

00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:39,760
replaces gates and add some superpowers

00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:45,220
it's fantastic and now i'm going to show

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:47,020
you my github workflow first if work you

00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:53,230
press the fourth button that's so easy

00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:56,299
and you have it done Danny clone

00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:58,850
you could copy the link here to clone it

00:17:56,299 --> 00:18:04,389
if you want or you could use this cool

00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:09,529
to help and just clone in a terminal and

00:18:04,389 --> 00:18:12,409
when you have the link git clone blink

00:18:09,529 --> 00:18:14,090
and then the rest happens and you have

00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:15,620
the code based on your computer it's

00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:20,059
awesome that's all you needed to know

00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:22,999
about cloning and then I would advise

00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:24,769
looking at the code base it's it nice do

00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:27,619
you really want to do this now are you

00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:38,659
sure because it's scary it's really

00:18:27,619 --> 00:18:40,970
scary and coding guidelines look gift us

00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:43,519
any coding guidelines look if the

00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:45,049
project actually follows them because if

00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:47,389
there's a mixture of coding guidelines

00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:53,299
you may want to get into that discussion

00:18:47,389 --> 00:18:54,919
you know tabs versus spaces sir then

00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:56,210
lets the tribute file that you

00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:59,269
should look at before you actually

00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:03,789
contribute a lot of open source projects

00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:07,789
has it but not every project has it and

00:19:03,789 --> 00:19:11,929
if it doesn't contributing a contribute

00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:14,570
file is kind of meta so do that and read

00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:19,460
read me actually read everything in

00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:21,529
there read me if this tests run them

00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:23,480
that should be pretty obvious but run

00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:26,659
them if you don't know how to run tests

00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:29,480
I suggest you learn how to run tests and

00:19:26,659 --> 00:19:32,119
if there's not tests I willing to

00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:35,059
contribute them or are you okay with the

00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:41,230
project not having tests guess sometimes

00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:44,749
you really want it and then say hi

00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:47,299
communicate before you could go to all

00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:50,029
the channels like a lot of project has

00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:54,049
an IRC channel they have a mailing list

00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:57,110
or communicate at the github issue

00:19:54,049 --> 00:20:00,230
tracker or anywhere really but

00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:04,159
communicate make sure you do it then

00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:06,380
pick an issue you can either pick an

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:09,800
issue we can make an issue

00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:11,900
picking a nice too is pretty

00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:21,590
straightforward you see all the issues

00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:25,510
and get up and you start picking it so I

00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:28,100
picked this issue for instance and in

00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:29,840
there you have this discussion going on

00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:32,030
so before you actually pick the issue

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,370
you can start a discussion like how do

00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:36,740
you think this should be sold it's there

00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:40,310
any clarification on this has anyone

00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:45,590
worked on it before and then they can

00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:48,230
assign you to the issue and it does not

00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:53,330
make an issue it's a really

00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:56,860
straightforward form and then make your

00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:59,750
changes you know how to code right and

00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:02,510
when you made your changes it's time to

00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:06,040
push it you can either do this in the

00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:09,590
terminal or you can do it via your

00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:13,370
client whatever you're using it's just

00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:16,540
the command git push through then that

00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:20,420
was all I had to say about pushing then

00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:24,380
comes the scariest step of open source

00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:27,050
or maybe the second scariest the pull

00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:29,090
request it's time to show the world what

00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:33,380
you've been doing it's time to get out

00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:36,770
of your closets I was so scared so don't

00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:39,200
worry be happy because it's just a

00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:47,650
button in a form just like everything

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:52,490
else in github you see it's so easy I

00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:54,910
guess I'm i was almost emotional when I

00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:58,970
did it I did it that the PHP Northwest

00:21:54,910 --> 00:22:01,310
hackathon everyone was around me and it

00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:06,770
didn't work because there was no

00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:09,080
internet so but in your pool requested

00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:12,260
some things you can do like you can link

00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:14,630
to the issue tracker to your issue and

00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:16,910
by hash and

00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:19,640
number and if you use any of these

00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:21,980
keywords it will resolve or close it the

00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,680
issue for you if they merge the pull

00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:29,420
request completely automatically which

00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:32,990
is really really cool and after that you

00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:34,460
often wait for like ages and ages or it

00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:38,450
goes within a second and you're like

00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:41,870
well what then it's code review that is

00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:44,000
maybe the most scary part some projects

00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:47,180
they just merge it or they say denied

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,980
they don't say a reason but then it's

00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:51,830
good for you to start a discussion and

00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:56,410
ask if they didn't merge it why didn't

00:22:51,830 --> 00:23:00,500
you and some clarifications and

00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:02,690
sometimes they say this looks great but

00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:08,390
you didn't really know get yet so fix

00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:13,660
your screw-up which was my case um so

00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:18,230
correct or discuss you learn so much and

00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:22,220
sometimes there are trolls but trolls

00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:25,160
can make it often when you think they're

00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:29,560
trolling they are just Dutch I learned

00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:34,610
that the Duchess so directs it's crazy

00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:40,370
so really really read everything because

00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:42,560
yeah then you know this is pretty

00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:46,190
straightforward but it still doesn't

00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:51,980
really help because I was still scared I

00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:55,790
was still I didn't want to contribute so

00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:58,850
I I guess I got over it when i started

00:23:55,790 --> 00:24:01,910
going to conferences my first conference

00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:06,080
is not on here it was the PF congress in

00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:09,500
utrecht netherlands it was a really

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,840
small conference and quite cozy and they

00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:17,890
said we're taking into VF in Northwest

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:22,060
so Dara was in 2011 on my first

00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:27,440
international conference in the UK and

00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:28,580
in their life changed to the better then

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,320
I became a conference at

00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:32,539
then I went to all these conferences

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,860
well I haven't been to this I just put

00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:38,450
it there because I want to go there and

00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:40,640
this one and this one but you know if

00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:42,950
you start going to conferences he start

00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:46,100
meeting people and that's when your fear

00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:48,710
start disappearing and I started going

00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:53,510
to this awesome news group Amsterdam PHP

00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:55,460
and in there there was this guy raffle

00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:59,360
who completely helped me with everything

00:24:55,460 --> 00:25:02,059
i'll talk more about him later and youth

00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:05,330
groups also become kind of an addiction

00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:08,240
so I went to the PHP benelux meetings

00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:09,970
which were closed and I became the

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,710
co-president of theatre II women I

00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:16,370
started my own local user group learning

00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:18,169
in PHP which was an experience on its

00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:20,539
own because in cloning and there was no

00:25:18,169 --> 00:25:22,669
PHP community I needed know PHP

00:25:20,539 --> 00:25:26,480
developers there it's a pretty small

00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:29,090
town so I went to the first meetup me

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,519
they're hoping someone would arrive till

00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:35,860
you guys did and after that web between

00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:38,419
10 and 20 ever meet up it's awesome and

00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:41,769
that's the local youth group here kids

00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:47,559
belong obviously probably heard of it

00:25:41,769 --> 00:25:52,370
that's PHP northwest in Manchester so

00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:56,360
for me overcoming the fear happened a

00:25:52,370 --> 00:26:02,120
lot on RC I am an RC addict I admit I'm

00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:04,190
in over 60 IRC channels my nickname when

00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:07,700
IRC is Kiki if your honor you see you've

00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:10,880
probably seen me mostly I go to PHP

00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:12,860
mentoring PPC and PHP women as my devil

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:18,500
bear see channels and they're all gone

00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:22,960
free nhanh and on IRC the this thing

00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:26,389
happened and called PHP mentoring and

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:31,419
teach him entering that org this is

00:26:26,389 --> 00:26:35,659
matthew his my testing mentor and i

00:26:31,419 --> 00:26:38,779
can't tell you how important mentorships

00:26:35,659 --> 00:26:41,570
are especially when speaking I wouldn't

00:26:38,779 --> 00:26:44,610
be here if it wasn't for these guys

00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:47,340
this is a really really really really

00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:49,410
really really old picture that's a

00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:52,500
raffle domes and it was his first

00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:54,870
international conference he runs the

00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:57,390
answer rampage vs group as he moved to

00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:59,430
Amsterdam and it's been a big

00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:01,710
inspiration to me he told me you should

00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:05,370
speak and he puts me on Amsterdam PHP

00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:09,330
stage for 60 people it was full them and

00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:12,060
it was scary I was shaking but he hugged

00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:14,190
me and he said it would be okay then

00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:18,000
David stepped in and helped swing with

00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:23,310
my abstracts and everything I mean it's

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:26,010
awesome then Lineker she doesn't know

00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:29,340
she's my mentor which is and she's the

00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:31,110
other co-president of thp women and she

00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:33,540
was the one who actually got me over

00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:38,660
that first step to contribute on a

00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:42,570
hackathon then there was one guy who

00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:49,080
helped me more than any one of the other

00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:52,650
it's ego weed ler i know i just talked

00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:54,990
code with him and he showed me that my

00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:58,400
code was good he told me that and that

00:27:54,990 --> 00:28:01,830
changed my code confidence forever so

00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:04,950
every time I have some code I show him

00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:10,140
and we discuss it for hours and he helps

00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:13,770
me he really does so to overcome the

00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:16,560
fear start going to conferences start

00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:20,550
going to youth group talk to people get

00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:23,360
a mentor or 5 10 20 whatever what helps

00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:28,110
is to have every mentor does one thing

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:33,450
like Matthew is my testing mentor David

00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:37,890
is my talks mentor and eager is my code

00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:41,220
confidence mentor also something that

00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:44,220
helps is having friends I met them at

00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:47,010
conferences such as Erika and that's

00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:49,980
Anthony Ferrara he now works at Google

00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:52,259
and they apparently like wearing the

00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:56,769
same t-shirts

00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:59,649
also friends are invaluable this was

00:28:56,769 --> 00:29:04,119
after a conference we just decided to go

00:28:59,649 --> 00:29:08,879
out in Amsterdam for few days Jeff of

00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:12,759
fun and I guess my first comfy

00:29:08,879 --> 00:29:16,889
contribution and community completely

00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:20,499
changed me I'm still killed passionate I

00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:33,210
really am my mom is still a graphical

00:29:20,499 --> 00:29:35,409
artist now I'm a conference addict I was

00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:39,609
calculating for my company how many

00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:41,679
conferences optimum in 2013 and i

00:29:39,609 --> 00:29:44,859
realized that i've been to 11

00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:48,909
conferences in 2013 most of them abroad

00:29:44,859 --> 00:29:52,960
and i am now obviously a speaker somehow

00:29:48,909 --> 00:29:55,029
which is cool and i am not afraid to

00:29:52,960 --> 00:30:00,340
contribute because i have these people

00:29:55,029 --> 00:30:03,369
to lean on i have everyone and then i

00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:06,850
decided some time ago you know maybe

00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:09,970
this yippee unsuccessful company is it's

00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:15,399
not for me because somehow i need to

00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:18,369
earn money so now i'm going to move to

00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:21,809
switzerland i'm going to work for this

00:30:18,369 --> 00:30:27,159
awesome company lead and they hired me

00:30:21,809 --> 00:30:29,440
basically because i'm in open source and

00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:32,289
I'm big in the community and I really

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,809
like what I'm doing so during open

00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:37,869
source led to hopefully one of the most

00:30:34,809 --> 00:30:39,639
awesome jobs i will ever have and it

00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:42,039
also led to me being in the community

00:30:39,639 --> 00:30:44,289
I'm co-president appeared for women

00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:47,590
which is this awesome group to support

00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:50,159
women in the community no healthy I will

00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:54,909
happily share my stories with them and

00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:57,690
mentor them i mentor new people all the

00:30:54,909 --> 00:31:01,929
time because i know i've been there and

00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:03,669
you know running running PHP going out

00:31:01,929 --> 00:31:05,460
there running my own your script that

00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:10,750
you know

00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:14,919
but it's all thanks to you it's all

00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:21,850
thanks to the community community really

00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:23,919
really really does work so now it's

00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:29,230
actually time for you to share your

00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:34,179
stories does anyone have an open source

00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:35,590
story to share questions and stories to

00:31:34,179 --> 00:31:37,900
share about being an open source

00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:39,640
starting open source anybody who hasn't

00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,320
yet started an open sources is now

00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:48,130
slightly less nervous wants to talk

00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:49,690
about it yeah um so I did want so

00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:51,159
stories about open source I've done a

00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:53,860
lot of open source stuff and I actually

00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:56,140
I have my first major contribution to

00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:58,980
PHP I would say is currently in an RFC

00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:01,539
and it's not getting good feedback but

00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:03,190
it was a learning experience and it's

00:32:01,539 --> 00:32:06,070
been fantastic I'm like trying to pick

00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:07,900
up see it's a big thing for me I've had

00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:09,280
a lot of failures in open source

00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:11,260
projects you know things I've started

00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,700
they've got nowhere but they're always

00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:15,159
learning experiences they're always

00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:17,530
exposure and it's interesting i have

00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:19,570
like a an API for rackspace which is

00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:20,950
silly as I work for engine yard but it

00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,210
kind of never went anywhere but I still

00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:23,470
get more questions about that than

00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:25,840
anything else that I've done and people

00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:29,890
are interested so just putting stuff out

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:32,770
there is is fantastic for people to

00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:33,970
review who you are judge you as a person

00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:36,760
that sounds really bad but like if

00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:38,950
you're looking for a job it's a great

00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,630
way for employers to look and see kind

00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:43,450
of how you work how you contribute how

00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:48,159
you work with other people and it's it's

00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:50,919
fantastic yes definitely so when I gave

00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:54,460
this talk my first talk ever at answer

00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:57,070
on PHP there was this company sponsoring

00:32:54,460 --> 00:33:00,580
and the venue and the pizza and a beer

00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:03,909
and they asked me another questions

00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:05,770
because they had no open source code but

00:33:03,909 --> 00:33:08,980
they were thinking you know if we can /

00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:12,880
source our tools other people can help

00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:15,640
us use the tools and our tools would be

00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,539
so much better we help others they help

00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:22,369
us we don't have to pay the salaries

00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:24,379
so two months later this one guy who had

00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:27,769
been there he did a talk at Amsterdam

00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:29,659
PHP about his first open source projects

00:33:27,769 --> 00:33:36,669
and horse mad at me because he had no

00:33:29,659 --> 00:33:36,669
contributors so any other stories

00:33:40,929 --> 00:33:48,019
question or two part statement I run an

00:33:44,869 --> 00:33:50,299
open source project and I think a lot of

00:33:48,019 --> 00:33:51,889
people are scared of contributing but

00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:56,779
there's a lot of ways of contributing

00:33:51,889 --> 00:34:00,109
besides just providing code one way is

00:33:56,779 --> 00:34:03,590
if you find a bug report it in a way

00:34:00,109 --> 00:34:06,919
that's reproduce herbal to those of us

00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:09,079
that do develop another is to help out

00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:12,260
answering questions or if someone

00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:15,109
reports a bug that's very general to try

00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:17,809
and find a way of reproducing it what'll

00:34:15,109 --> 00:34:20,270
answer questions on forums about the

00:34:17,809 --> 00:34:23,059
software so there's a lot more ways of

00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:28,040
contributing to open source than simply

00:34:23,059 --> 00:34:30,770
coding definitely I know that's one of

00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:33,200
the biggest contributions I make to open

00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:35,869
source it's actually it doesn't have to

00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:38,450
do with code it's being there supporting

00:34:35,869 --> 00:34:41,389
other people answering questions because

00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:43,520
that's something everyone can do as I

00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:49,849
said I'm an RC addict so I probably be

00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:53,000
there any wages ask it really helps any

00:34:49,849 --> 00:34:59,720
other tips for new contributors grab one

00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:01,369
just billing just something that you

00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,980
kind of touched on but I started

00:35:01,369 --> 00:35:09,280
recently start contributing to joined in

00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:12,319
and I found that it was a great way to

00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,450
take up and learn a new technology

00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:16,130
because in my day job are pretty much

00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:17,440
work on a fixed stock so I don't have

00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:21,140
much opportunity to learn anything new

00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:23,000
I'm contributing to joined in let me

00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:24,980
learn well quite a lot of new things

00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,119
than your eye is you're scared to begin

00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:28,670
with but yeah

00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:32,180
the community really is helpful so I

00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:34,309
just want what doesn't yes if you want

00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:38,420
to contribute to join in the one of the

00:35:34,309 --> 00:35:40,730
most friendly projects I know about you

00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:43,099
go to their IRC channel and you can ask

00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:45,859
any question and they help you they

00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:48,829
really really do and they also have on

00:35:45,859 --> 00:35:51,519
their issue tracker they have easy big

00:35:48,829 --> 00:35:54,049
issues so first contribution can be

00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:58,220
something really small because it helps

00:35:54,049 --> 00:36:00,740
to just get it started joined in what

00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:07,039
your Elwood joined in Viet Joe and often

00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:08,930
joined dot in yeah definitely contribute

00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:12,680
to joined in if you can that's I'm

00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:15,769
contributor to so there's two points

00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:18,380
another good way of contributing and I

00:36:15,769 --> 00:36:20,779
say this as the documentation maintainer

00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:23,200
of zem framework to is to contribute

00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:26,180
documentation contributing documentation

00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:29,900
you you're not going to get cold reviews

00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:31,880
you're not going to get as much judge

00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:34,069
judgment contributing to documentation

00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:36,410
as you are cold so it's also a really

00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:38,059
good way to make your name known in the

00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:40,579
community to contribute documentation

00:36:38,059 --> 00:36:42,349
first particularly if there's no

00:36:40,579 --> 00:36:44,989
documentation something is always better

00:36:42,349 --> 00:36:46,549
than nothing or if you've noticed just a

00:36:44,989 --> 00:36:48,559
small typo in the documentation the

00:36:46,549 --> 00:36:50,960
frustrated you for ten minutes it takes

00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:52,759
you you know 90 seconds to create the

00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,019
pull request that can fix that tight

00:36:52,759 --> 00:36:56,509
bowl that's frustrated you for ten

00:36:54,019 --> 00:36:59,109
minutes and that's really really um I

00:36:56,509 --> 00:37:02,109
mean gratefully received by any project

00:36:59,109 --> 00:37:02,109
yeah

00:37:06,979 --> 00:37:14,160
I just wanted to thank you because

00:37:10,219 --> 00:37:17,009
you're tall kid MCM PHP was my second

00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,709
meet up there and it really helped me I

00:37:17,009 --> 00:37:21,809
started contributing after that and I

00:37:19,709 --> 00:37:24,869
got my first contribution was like

00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:28,109
really it was not planted for symphony

00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:30,239
and I just got a bug a weird bug and I

00:37:28,109 --> 00:37:33,359
went to this I'll exchange while i was

00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:37,319
doing silex and then Igor helping me

00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:40,469
also eager so and he say do a pull

00:37:37,319 --> 00:37:42,839
request come on and then I I was really

00:37:40,469 --> 00:37:45,779
scared really really because come on my

00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:48,930
first contribution I I don't have this

00:37:45,779 --> 00:37:51,930
courage to go to symphony but it was um

00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:54,269
I had to do it like three times because

00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:56,369
I was always doing it wrong I had to

00:37:54,269 --> 00:37:58,979
learn how to use it properly but it

00:37:56,369 --> 00:38:02,069
really worked and it's all your fault

00:37:58,979 --> 00:38:05,130
and even vagrant the first time I heard

00:38:02,069 --> 00:38:08,549
about vagrant was in your talk I was

00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:10,979
really life changing from me Wow and now

00:38:08,549 --> 00:38:16,920
you're even talking about like yeah so

00:38:10,979 --> 00:38:19,289
thank you he wrote a book on it I was

00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,029
gonna say as far as documentation one

00:38:19,289 --> 00:38:23,400
great way that you can easily contribute

00:38:21,029 --> 00:38:26,099
is it's actually possible on github to

00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,449
edit directly on the web and because

00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:28,650
it's like typically HTML and mark down

00:38:27,449 --> 00:38:29,910
on something you don't need to like

00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:32,039
clone it and have it in your local

00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:40,709
machine and it's a really easy way to

00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:42,690
submit things back to a project my first

00:38:40,709 --> 00:38:48,809
contribution has been on a Python

00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:52,440
project a program to convert audio files

00:38:48,809 --> 00:38:54,769
and I was showing the program to my

00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:57,719
sister and she did some stuff with some

00:38:54,769 --> 00:39:00,059
specific pattern of settings and it

00:38:57,719 --> 00:39:03,359
happened that a part of our original

00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:08,579
files work has been deleted quite

00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:12,359
destructive and so the project is on

00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:15,660
github and I had a rock and I found out

00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:18,470
how to fix it I fix it at the same time

00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:21,050
I also that it's some stuff on the UI

00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:25,940
to make it more convenient there are no

00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:28,700
shortcut to close the application I / to

00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:31,609
request and they've been accepted few

00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:37,550
days ago a few days after and was very

00:39:31,609 --> 00:39:44,270
great it was like a changing the world

00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:48,500
around around me and what we get paid

00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:53,619
paid a lot in self self confidence or

00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:53,619
something I guess yeah definitely I

00:39:57,369 --> 00:40:01,460
would just say to like you've probably

00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:03,260
heard horror stories about people

00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:05,720
getting shamed and whatnot and that

00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:07,460
happened to me my first time and don't

00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,440
wait a year and a half like i did to get

00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:11,960
back involved come and talk to some of

00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,790

contribution will help you find the

00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:18,740
people that you will need to talk to you

00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:21,349
before you you know submit your pull

00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:24,380
requests and such and we really do want

00:40:21,349 --> 00:40:27,140
to help you make it a nice easy happy

00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:28,760
first time contributing or if you have

00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:31,130
contributed in the past and it didn't go

00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:33,170
well I really strongly encourage you to

00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:36,770
give it another try it really is

00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:38,570
wonderful and don't let a few crabby

00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:46,369
people dissuade you from getting

00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:50,750
involved thank you the questions

00:40:46,369 --> 00:40:54,680
comments again is the maintainer of an

00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:57,859
open source library I don't always have

00:40:54,680 --> 00:41:00,410
the time to respond immediately to pull

00:40:57,859 --> 00:41:03,490
requests or requests for help or

00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:06,410
anything that doesn't mean I ignore them

00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:09,830
it may be some time before you get a

00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:13,099
response if you do a pull risk request

00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:16,190
or if you make a submission or report a

00:41:13,099 --> 00:41:19,400
fault but open source developers have a

00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:23,109
work-life balance as well yes so please

00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:26,170
be patient with us to thank you

00:41:23,109 --> 00:41:29,920
yes most people do of a source on the

00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:32,980
spare time so it's really something yeah

00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:37,809
be patient that's what's good tip thank

00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:39,339
you might ask those people who have not

00:41:37,809 --> 00:41:40,869
yet contributed to an open source

00:41:39,339 --> 00:41:46,630
project at the beginning of this class

00:41:40,869 --> 00:41:49,720
are you more likely to now and if you're

00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:52,299
not why wouldn't you I guess I would

00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:56,410
love to help you you can talk to me

00:41:52,299 --> 00:42:00,249
after and PHP mentoring it can help you

00:41:56,410 --> 00:42:03,190
also and you know just join the channels

00:42:00,249 --> 00:42:05,470
or mailing lists and you can be under

00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:09,670
numis if you want to that's also cheap

00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:13,960
Igor gave me to start an anonymous get

00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:17,109
up reboot before you know just to try it

00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:19,869
out because I wasn't confident to do all

00:42:17,109 --> 00:42:23,650
this stuff so again I went into

00:42:19,869 --> 00:42:25,720
anonymity and it helps because you think

00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:29,259
okay this is silly to be anonymous

00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:31,029
because now I know I can do it so you

00:42:29,259 --> 00:42:34,869
don't have to be you it doesn't have to

00:42:31,029 --> 00:42:36,369
be you who go out to the world but

00:42:34,869 --> 00:42:38,680
afterwards you're probably going to be

00:42:36,369 --> 00:42:40,450
like me people call me Kiki and

00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:42,279
conferences because they know me so well

00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:47,619
but it was just meant to be another

00:42:42,279 --> 00:42:50,460
numerous nickname so it's cool thank you

00:42:47,619 --> 00:42:50,460
