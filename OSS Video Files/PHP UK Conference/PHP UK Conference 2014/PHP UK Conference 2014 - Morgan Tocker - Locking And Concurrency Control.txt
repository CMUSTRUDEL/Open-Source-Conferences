Description: 
	When you use a RDBMS, it offers a number of features to protect data integrity and protect against concurrent modification of data. Concepts covered in this session include table/row locks, MVCC, deadlocks & lock waits, transactions and isolation levels. Attendees will also get a better understanding of various database errors, and know how they are expected to be handled by applications. Examples will use MySQL 5.6, but cover theory that is 90% applicable to all databases.
