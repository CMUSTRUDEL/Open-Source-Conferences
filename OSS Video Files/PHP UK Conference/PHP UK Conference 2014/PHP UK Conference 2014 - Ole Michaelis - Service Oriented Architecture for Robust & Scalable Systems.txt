Publication date: 2014-03-28
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2014
Description: 
	Software Architecture is hard. And when your business grows, its getting even harder because scaling doesn't come out the box and it's not only the software which grows it's also the team. So you have to find a way how to scale your software in a way that it stays easy maintainable for growing teams and scalable. I'd like to talk about Service Oriented Architecture in general and also share some experience and give some examples where SOA would save you in a tough spot and maybe places where SOA isn't the best idea to implement.
