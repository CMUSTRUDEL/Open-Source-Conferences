Title: PHP UK Conference 2014 - Marcello Duarte - Test, Transform, Refactor
Publication date: 2014-03-21
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2014
Description: 
	Let's have a close look into the Red-Green-Refactor cycle and understand the subtleties of each step. When we go down the rabbit hole of Test Driven Design we sometimes take too big steps leading us to many failed tests we just can bring back to green without writing a lot of code. We need to take a step back and take the shrinking potion of baby steps again. This very illustrative talk, full of test and code examples, will dig into each of the steps of TDD to help you understand how to keep a sustainable pace that will lead you in the right track.
