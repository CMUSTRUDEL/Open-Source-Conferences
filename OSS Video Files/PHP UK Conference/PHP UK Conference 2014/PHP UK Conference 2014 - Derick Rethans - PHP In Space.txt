Title: PHP UK Conference 2014 - Derick Rethans - PHP In Space
Publication date: 2014-03-21
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2014
Description: 
	In this talk we are going to see how PHP can be used for all kinds of terrestrial and non-terrestrial purposes. That doesn't mean that we will be looking at sending PHP up with the next Mars rover but instead we will (try to) figure out how calculate the positions of bodies in the solar system. This is for example useful for calculating the moon phase, or sunrise/sunset. We will also look at coordinate systems on solar system bodies and do calculations with that. I have a couple of other things up my sleeve too. Expect trigonometry and other maths, and rocket science/explosions.
