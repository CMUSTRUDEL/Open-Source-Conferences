Title: PHP UK Conference 2014 - Derick Rethans - PHP In Space
Publication date: 2014-03-21
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2014
Description: 
	In this talk we are going to see how PHP can be used for all kinds of terrestrial and non-terrestrial purposes. That doesn't mean that we will be looking at sending PHP up with the next Mars rover but instead we will (try to) figure out how calculate the positions of bodies in the solar system. This is for example useful for calculating the moon phase, or sunrise/sunset. We will also look at coordinate systems on solar system bodies and do calculations with that. I have a couple of other things up my sleeve too. Expect trigonometry and other maths, and rocket science/explosions.

	00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:10,230
so this is perhaps not how can I say

00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,610
this in a nice way not the most useful

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:15,870
talk of a conference I have to admit

00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:18,350
that but it comes forward out of a few

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,880
things that I've been playing with both

00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:24,869
OB hockey project like my Raspberry Pi

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,490
at home I like openstreetmap stuff lots

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:28,140
of calculations are done with distance

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,269
and things like that and i also like

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,610
playing computer games but i only really

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,350
play once called kerbal space program so

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,940
if you have never heard of this by the

00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,090
end of this present day you would want

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,430
to play with us I think so yeah well

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,850
here we go so I have to introduce you

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:47,489
jebediah he is the uber space person

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,920
that is flying around with us and the

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:52,410
color green that he uses is badass ball

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,570
and CSS so that explains a lot and he's

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:58,170
always very happy here landed on the

00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,699
moon so the whole game works from a

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,050
fictional solar system so their main

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,239
planets carbon which is equivalent to

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:07,350
earth except it's a bit smaller by the

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,610
tenth of the size has two moons so you

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,470
can see their orbits are the different

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,260
rights this one is in the same playing

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,650
where's the other one is quite tilted

00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:18,479
which makes it more difficult to get to

00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:20,549
similar moon just like we have here they

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,290
also have one that looks green and

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:25,740
apparently it's made out of mint candy

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,960
so this is one we going to have a few

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,299
exercises it later when we get to some

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,850
equations but first and some other

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,640
planets and if I have the time I will

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:38,700
actually end up getting to the Mars

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,579
variant called doona anyway so Jebidiah

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:46,280
he lives somewhere own on kerbin and he

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:51,600
lives at 41 of 4711 south as well as

00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:52,740
4745 74 degrees east right however I was

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,000
trying to figure out how far it is

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,770
between where he lives and where the

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,469
Space Center is but the coordinates with

00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,270
the Space Center are given with like

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:02,490
degrees minutes and seconds right and

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,020
this is something you need to convert so

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,840
that's the first thing because I want to

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,929
know how far he has to walk to get to do

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,450
to get to work basically word so Eddie

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,770
the coordinates with minutes and seconds

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,470
is not something that many

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:19,680
gerton can do anything about so a while

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:23,550
ago as part of a totally different thing

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,190
I wrote some algorithms in an extension

00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:28,440
that does lots of calculations with

00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:30,090
distances and stuff and as part of that

00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,860
I need it like this function that

00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:35,400
converts is it is not the most

00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,290
complicated function to be fair but yes

00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,000
so some of the things that I will be

00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,010
talking about has to do with extension

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,650
that I've written or I've contributed to

00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:44,880
or I've been hacking on and never seen

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,380
the light of day yet because it's

00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,470
definitely not finished I really ugly

00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:51,780
and the first one is peach V geospatial

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,970
it I've started that I think two or

00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,590
three years ago here with Marcus dead

00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:58,350
loss and Michael MacLean if you know

00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,120
them however they haven't been

00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:02,070
contributing not to it but I have so

00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,710
I've sort of taken Dover and change all

00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:06,270
the api's so they must like love me for

00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,910
that and then it's something else been

00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,380
working on speech free solar system

00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:12,360
which is maybe not the most useful

00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,070
extension but I like playing with this

00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,100
kind of stuff right and I actually had a

00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:18,540
use for it as well it goes well three

00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,040
years ago I got a raspberry pi or two

00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,540
years I don't know how all the how all

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,890
those things are and I don't do

00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,270
something useful with that now I don't

00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:29,100
do hardware hackery stuff at all because

00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:30,600
soldering irons make just my hands burn

00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,240
every time I touch them then I student

00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,760
so I won't do something so far advice

00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,170
with it and but I saw that at work

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,420
actually they had used the Raspberry Pi

00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:42,120
stuck behind the TV to have like a

00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:44,790
support well what's going on support at

00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,440
that moment right so I don't have a big

00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,660
TV but I have like an LCD screen that

00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,820
now has the raspberry part connected to

00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,890
it one thing I want to do in there well

00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,650
show the current wetter and current

00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:57,450
weather there's lots of api's for that

00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,120
so I'm not talking about it now but one

00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:04,020
of the things I thought be nice whilst

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:06,330
to show the background of weather better

00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:09,540
show should imitate the color of the sky

00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:11,190
outside right how you saw this i don't

00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,810
know but i thought this is a fun project

00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:14,340
to do in order to do that you actually

00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,590
need to think about a few things like

00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,730
instead of current weather and how high

00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,169
the summers up and stuff like that and

00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,760
that's what this extension helps

00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:22,790
midnight anyway let's go back to

00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,169
jebediah that needs to get to work and

00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:27,270
so yeah there's function in the PHP

00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:29,550
geospatial extension is very

00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,259
interestingly named dms to decimal sent

00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,949
four degrees minutes seconds to decimal

00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:39,120
and give that the corners as well as e

00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:42,270
to w or for West an e for East or s for

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,069
South and and for North whether I like

00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:46,680
this API not I don't know but it does

00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:49,199
work and then it tells you where exactly

00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,539
the corner so now I'm not really

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,979
interested in so many decimal so I'll be

00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:55,050
removing those in later examples by

00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:56,789
their cim so case P stands for kerbal

00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:00,900
space program right away and jab lives

00:04:56,789 --> 00:05:02,970
at various now of course we can do that

00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,400
the other way around as well but because

00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,080
degrees minutes and seconds are three

00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,090
distinct values so i can't really return

00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,069
it as one complex value i could probably

00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,840
return a desert each peak cloth or

00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:16,110
something like that but who likes

00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:19,020
classes and so it returns of course

00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:21,360
BHP's will evil structure called an

00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:23,190
array and there's a few things in there

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,930
so of course bang it and do actually i

00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,819
can combine it back to it right not most

00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,169
interesting thing however now we know

00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:31,740
where he lives now we need to figure out

00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:33,180
how far he actually has to go and you

00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,069
have interesting formula so that i will

00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,229
not be explaining the formula here but

00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:39,690
it's called a hatter sine function or

00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:42,860
have a sign for Miguel that the double

00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:45,270
calculates using a spherical earth model

00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,699
according to great circle lines the

00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,690
great circle line is the shortest

00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:50,340
distance between two points on the

00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:52,110
sphere or actually it's the whole

00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,060
circumference but it is used to

00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,069
calculate the distance along this arc

00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:00,419
around the sphere we should do it to

00:05:56,069 --> 00:06:01,889
have a sine function at this API the

00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:05,460
have a sine function which is also part

00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:08,250
of PHP geospatial actually takes geo

00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:11,909
JSON objects so Gio Jason is like a

00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:14,069
whole it's a description ish on how to

00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:15,840
store like points and lines and polygons

00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:18,659
and think like that and the reason why I

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,490
use this API is because well you can

00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:22,319
probably put it in a PHP class right

00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:25,229
yeah I can wrap it with the coordinates

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,490
and stuff like that but that means that

00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:28,080
if you want to show it on a map

00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,699
somewhere you have to convert it all the

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,819
time between those classes energy OJ's

00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:34,800
and stuff me working with MongoDB a lot

00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:37,169
the geospatial stuff part of it also

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,320
stores all this data in points lines and

00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:41,160
polygons with with geo Jason so I

00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,860
thought I'll pick this

00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,540
because that is handy and it yeah it

00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:49,830
saves me from having to move between

00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:55,260
stuff okay have a sign is quite okay but

00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:56,670
it uses a it uses a sphere for doing ass

00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:59,070
calculation now as you might know the

00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:02,940
earth is not actually sir urbanus but

00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:05,100
earth is not and yeah this tells you how

00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,630
many meters it is between us points but

00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,100
that's not very interesting so it's

00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:10,260
something else is called a Vincente

00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:14,490
welcome called quite called formula

00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:16,680
because it is a better way of using it

00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:19,020
uses actually a flattened spherical

00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,970
model of the earth which is much more

00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:24,330
appropriate for doing very long distance

00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:26,130
calculations but it is an iterative

00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:28,830
function so you need to do a few

00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:30,960
iterations and if you're getting closer

00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:32,670
to the poles then those iterations can

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,350
actually take up a whole lot of time so

00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:37,170
there's a few preconditions and when you

00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:39,510
can use it incentive for Mac it has

00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:42,360
exactly the same API you give it to geo

00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:46,140
Jason points and it tells you how far it

00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,520
is in meters in this case 12,000

00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:51,470
kilometers is a bit of a long walk for

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:55,050
him to befriend all right so next slide

00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:57,390
okay so yeah I said Deb jebediah lifson

00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:00,930
kurbanov on earth and that yeah it's a

00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:02,880
different size it's only 600 kilometres

00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:06,120
right as opposed to the earth which is

00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,860
about 10 times as large and to do the

00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,630
calculations here we cannot use Vincente

00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,150
because its use is a spherical earth

00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:14,490
model and not a fictional planet small

00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:16,919
alright so we are using have a sign here

00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:18,090
because it will be better accuracy that

00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:21,090
have a sine function doesn't actually

00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:23,220
take into account heights so if there is

00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:24,630
of course the difference between sea

00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,550
level and on the top of mountains and

00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:29,460
distance wise but we don't care about it

00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,780
so much and yet I have a sine function

00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,340
so what I've done here is the third

00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:36,180
argument you can actually specify the

00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:38,099
radius of the planet and this of course

00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,510
doesn't make a lot of sense if you think

00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:42,229
about planets but it makes a lot of

00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:44,580
sense if for example if you want to

00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:47,190
instead of meters you don't have miles

00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:49,020
as distance right and she can instead of

00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,520
testifying the radius of the earth and

00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,200
kilometers you use the radius of the

00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,210
earth and models and then you get a

00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,840
example but it also works in my example

00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,640
so that's

00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:01,650
very handy and we figured out that he

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:04,200
has to walk what is it 11 100 kilometers

00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:07,320
it's going to be a long walk win alright

00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,760
so yeah so which direction does he has

00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,810
to go to right so the coordinates where

00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,350
he lives to the right here on the coast

00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:14,880
and the Space Center is here and yeah if

00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,350
you hit a line right which looks like

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,170
the shortest line but it isn't actually

00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:21,210
of course what because if you look at it

00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:23,520
this is the shortest point between those

00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:24,690
things so even though the first one here

00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,270
it looks quite similar how do you

00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:29,630
calculate the the direction he needs to

00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:32,940
Vulcan isn't actually so simple because

00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:34,530
yeah as I said the line looks like this

00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:40,710
and you see that the direction actually

00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:42,600
changes along the longer trip and to do

00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:46,170
calculations with this you figure out

00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,940
the direction is something that is well

00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,800
almost kill like this where you have to

00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,870
cross half the planet perhaps not very

00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,850
useful but calculation directions on a

00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:55,710
slightly smaller scale you don't really

00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:57,000
need all the important or the difficult

00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:59,790
formulas you can use with a really

00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,710
simple ones but to be accurate why not

00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:03,560
so the reason why I wrote this one is

00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:05,940
because I like post boxes and

00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,260
openstreetmap so I like to find post

00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:11,370
boxes all over the place and take photos

00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:16,200
of them and put them on the map I think

00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:18,660
my phone found one as well and and for

00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,820
that i want to have see all my box which

00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,740
is power gel can talk about it some

00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,260
other time it tells me the direction of

00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:28,470
where the post box is in and to do that

00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:30,650
i wrote is algorithm which is well not

00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:33,690
very simple but not very difficult edem

00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:35,070
so let's have a look at how it works so

00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,350
the geospatial extension now has a

00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:40,620
function for that and by now i mean in

00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:44,460
the last two weeks and it gives you a

00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:46,500
direction based on yeah so north a snort

00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:49,260
and then well it goes in a circle so it

00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,240
gives you actually it gives you the

00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:54,030
direction in degrees for minus 180 2

00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:57,300
plus 180 I don't like that so I might

00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:59,760
change that API later to just go from 0

00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,920
to 360 my example will still work

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,279
because it uses plus 36 in a modular so

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,620
the output is exactly the same now but

00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:09,259
so yeah it calculates the initial

00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:11,300
bearing and so he knows in which

00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:14,209
direction to walk and this case is 113

00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:16,879
degrees now this wasn't working when I

00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:19,579
was reacting the presentation and I

00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:21,379
often find that working on my hacky

00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:22,899
things that I sometimes have to actually

00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:26,329
fix them bill watching the presentation

00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:28,939
so I was a bit delayed for that but

00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:31,790
let's continue a bit more so yes we have

00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:34,790
here this line right so I wanted to draw

00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:38,509
this line on the map and annoyingly the

00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:40,670
mapping well library or JavaScript

00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:42,709
library that i use for called leaflet it

00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:44,569
doesn't actually do this it only tells

00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:46,040
you it can only draw lines between

00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:47,569
points and it doesn't take into account

00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,779
of curvature of the earth because in

00:11:47,569 --> 00:11:53,089
most cases you actually only use this

00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:57,230
mapping API for much smaller areas then

00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:59,180
planets kill so I thought well if I want

00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:02,240
to draw such a line I need to figure out

00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:05,269
in two points on this line so i can draw

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,040
multiple lines as segments and the first

00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:10,899
thing i did that i wrote this function

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:13,550
in PHP which Lord something like this

00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:16,699
PHP isn't particularly very good for

00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:20,120
doing trigonometry it's also not by far

00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:24,529
not very fast so of course I written the

00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:26,209
Sikhs see implementation as well and it

00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:29,029
also works so basically I can't try to

00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:32,059
explain how this works maybe I'll give

00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:34,970
it a shot so first of all it does is

00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:36,680
calculate the distance so it knows how

00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:40,490
long the liners and then divide it into

00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:42,470
like into as many points as you wanted

00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,959
which is the calling function here but

00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:47,600
but the input here is both the

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,850
coordinates as well as the fraction

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,069
along the line so knows the distance

00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:55,309
calculates a fraction of this distance

00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:57,829
and then recalculates the point the

00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:59,300
coordinates that belong to this fraction

00:12:57,829 --> 00:13:02,029
along the line so that is all this

00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,499
function does how does that you all find

00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:06,860
have to find on Wikipedia or in a

00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:09,199
matchbook gonna explain you anyway so so

00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,189
yes that's so this is how I do that and

00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:11,540
now of course I've written as

00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,800
implementation of this is all but that

00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,600
just wants to show you this in peach

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,509
because after all this called PHP in

00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,970
space and not how to call PHP functions

00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:20,449
in Excel

00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:24,899
in space just not nearly as interesting

00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:27,149
all right so let's continue so the other

00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:29,519
thing that I liked is if I make like

00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:31,379
demos out of this video you you can see

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,110
a daytime long lunch looks a lot nicer

00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:36,720
than a nighttime lunch so I created this

00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:38,519
function that tells me when send sunset

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,079
and sunrises I've done this about four

00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:43,800
or five years ago and as part of PHP

00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:46,949
plain PHP it's a function called date

00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:49,470
sun info now PHP used to have already an

00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:51,810
API for this I don't remember the name

00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:55,170
for volta das now sunrise and sunsets I

00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:57,689
believe but those have very interesting

00:13:55,170 --> 00:14:00,779
API is well first of all doesn't really

00:13:57,689 --> 00:14:03,149
take care of time zones very well and by

00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:07,170
default it picks the coordinates for

00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:10,410
Jerusalem now why that is I do not know

00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:14,009
but that's just how it is so dates and

00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:15,930
info and takes it unix timestamp and yes

00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:18,389
just probably should accept a daytime

00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:20,579
object and i was hoping to finish that

00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:23,699
sometime for this presentation but that

00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:27,059
didn't work and then you have to give it

00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:30,329
a our schedules run at latitude

00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:31,379
longitude pair the annoying thing is

00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:34,079
that you're Jason that I showed you

00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:37,769
earlier uses longitude latitude instead

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:40,199
of latitude longitude and every API in

00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:43,769
mapping libraries uses a order that you

00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:45,839
never ever know and I get it wrong well

00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:47,399
most of the time because that's how does

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,139
things required some it's the same thing

00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:51,149
with bounding boxes you have no you

00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:52,500
sometimes have north east south west as

00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:54,629
coordinates of course work for you

00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,490
that's north east south west but

00:14:54,629 --> 00:15:00,480
sometimes you see north south first and

00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:02,490
then ease of s vs mind-boggling but has

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,439
nothing to do with PHP no data episode

00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:06,839
it's room so when you call this function

00:15:04,439 --> 00:15:08,250
it actually doesn't give you one data

00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,660
point it doesn't give you just sunrise

00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,970
and sunset it gives you a few more

00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:14,370
things actually so it gives you sunrise

00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:18,329
and sunsets in your ex timestamp so you

00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:21,420
can calculate that to your local time by

00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:23,850
putting into a date great but it also

00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:27,779
tells you to transit which is the point

00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:29,730
it goes through Zenith or woollen mostly

00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:30,690
south with notes always necessarily

00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:33,390
cells

00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:35,850
and there's all not always directly in

00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:38,610
between the sunrise and sunset depending

00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:40,110
on stuff but it shows you fewer things

00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:43,170
as I'll show you three different kinds

00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:45,450
of Twilight and depending well the name

00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:46,950
of those well data point actually tells

00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:50,220
you what the difference really is right

00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:53,070
so yes civil twilight which it I think

00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,600
it is defined as it's light enough so

00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,950
that you can read a book outside or

00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,480
something like that and you have

00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:00,660
nautical to violent which i think is

00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,430
enough after this point it is dark

00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:05,520
enough so that you can navigate on the

00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:07,890
on the stars and ask astronomical

00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,330
Twilight is when it's so dark that well

00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:11,670
you can't see anything unless you have a

00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:14,880
light and it's very good for observing

00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:18,630
astronomical events like stuff maybe

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,800
rocket launches order is RSS and again

00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:22,500
sometimes you can see those in daytime

00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:25,260
is own anyway before continue blubbering

00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:28,260
about that let's look at some more stuff

00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:30,540
so yes so the position of the Sun in the

00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:32,430
sky is is something that i needed for my

00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:34,650
raspberry pi thing all right i wanted to

00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:37,800
know how far the sun is over your eyes

00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:39,690
and so i can count or approximate the

00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,300
color of the sky at that moment so i use

00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:44,370
a few data points for that I I know but

00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:47,280
it's overcast or raining or snowing or

00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:49,740
Thunderstone so i created darkness color

00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:52,680
based on that and then depending on how

00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:57,540
far the sun is over your horizon it will

00:16:52,680 --> 00:17:00,540
tell me how it's faded to the night

00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:02,550
color which is differently fun again so

00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,290
earth some pulse is actually a wrong

00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:06,510
name because it doesn't calculate

00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:10,650
position it only calculates the height

00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:14,189
over the horizon which that's why

00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:16,350
there's a an unhappy face but actually

00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:19,079
internally the extension that implements

00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:21,810
algun actually just calculate it i just

00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:24,510
not exporting it so again i will change

00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:26,310
this api some point and actually to show

00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:28,319
you that it works if I reload two slides

00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:30,900
you can see the value actually changing

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,740
that the moment the Centers 22 dot 87

00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:37,650
degrees over or isin you can go measure

00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:39,000
that if you don't believe ok so I'm also

00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:44,250
working on the full position of the

00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,200
sun's about height as well as azimuth

00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,820
and I'm also going to that for the moon

00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,830
I actually have written that already but

00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:51,480
not exporting the extension so I'm

00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:54,570
talking about our moon not the moon

00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,490
which is carbons moon not talking about

00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:57,810
that right now anyway so this is

00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,910
probably the stuff that we've done on

00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,380
land and jebediah finally makes it to

00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,730
space station is figure out its light

00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,350
and the Sun is high enough in the sky

00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:06,600
and now we need to shoot up some rockets

00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:08,610
because that's how that goes that's what

00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,310
austral nets do of course nor kerbal

00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:14,040
nuts in this case okay net so they're

00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:16,080
gone so there's something called a truss

00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,580
to weight ratio and basically means if

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,860
its larger than one you'll take off if

00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,870
it's not larger than one you will not

00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:25,770
and I will demonstrate it by some

00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:27,630
in-game footage all right so when you

00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:29,460
just start you can see the surface to

00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:31,830
weight ratios being less than one right

00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:34,260
it goes the trust compared to the

00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:36,750
vessels mass is not an equal ratio so

00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:39,270
you see that once it hit one the rocket

00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:40,950
lifts off and that is how that works so

00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:43,100
if you're designing rockets which you

00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:45,570
all of you have done once in a while

00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:48,240
actually I've done some model rockets

00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:50,220
and this is very important I mean our

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,950
competition of the shoot of the rocket

00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:55,830
as high as you can get get British with

00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:58,650
a standard engine so what can you do to

00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:59,880
make that better right I've seen some of

00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,890
the other teams that we're also doing is

00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,960
that making really elaborate design but

00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,310
I looting that shape everything down as

00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,700
much as we can to make it as light as

00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:11,580
possible forget about safety things like

00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:13,230
some some cotton goo so that the the

00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,360
back charge of the engine when the

00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:17,430
parachute comes out actually doesn't

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:21,030
blow up the altimeter we managed to

00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:24,030
score chat i think but to all good all

00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:26,820
good things we actually managed winning

00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:28,440
because our trust to weight ratio was

00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,600
the best and that means with a set

00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:33,840
engine you go to highest and you win a

00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:36,050
competition I will not talk about what

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,360
happened to the parachute down but

00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:42,330
basically it fuse together because of

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,860
engine exhaust but okay so yeah this is

00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:46,320
how this works and you can calculate is

00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:49,350
quite easily right let me go to the next

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:52,560
slide so yes so when we start off the

00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:54,270
Rockets sis be the ball all the little

00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,560
tiny things in the Bekaa so I don't

00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:57,420
think you can make a much better / 0

00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,050
point amount and save us show you what

00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:01,080
an oversight

00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:02,760
so when it's you standing still with all

00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,050
the fuel in there I basically created a

00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,410
rocket that doesn't really fly very well

00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:09,210
so the mass is three and a half tons the

00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:11,430
engine thrust is 30 kilo Newtons it's a

00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:13,650
very tiny ant and the tiniest engine i

00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:15,840
could find excellent and a mexico

00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:18,180
maximum acceleration from that you can

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,650
calculate right i'm not sure why this

00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,870
number here doesn't match the number

00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:25,140
here it's probably because all of the

00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:27,450
land struts at some point and so yeah

00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:29,250
the dish you can calculated the service

00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:32,340
to weight ratio is zero eight eight it's

00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:34,080
not enough don't lift off so when I

00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,550
start burning my engine what happens of

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,010
course that it gets lighter because I've

00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:40,380
been burning fuel and a moment where the

00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:42,570
serves to wait Rachel hits one it lifts

00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:44,970
off well now let's see how we calculate

00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:46,290
us also it helps if you point a rocket

00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:49,710
to the right way up which are hand on

00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:51,870
the first time all right so yeah yeah to

00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:53,550
calculate a maximum weight depending on

00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:55,890
the trust's of your engine you can

00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:58,260
calculate quite easily by dividing the

00:20:55,890 --> 00:21:00,690
trust by the surface gravity and carbons

00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:03,270
surface gravity is exactly the same as

00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:05,760
Earth on the equator so it doesn't have

00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:07,440
the variations that your earth gravity

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,390
has depending on where you're close to

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,630
mountains or not because that'd be a bit

00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:14,070
too much to model in the game I'm sure

00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:15,510
see this is how we calculated is by far

00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:18,750
not the most interesting equation

00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:20,910
because you / something finding this in

00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:23,190
detail or finding the formulas was a bit

00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:25,080
tricky so yeah service the rate ratio is

00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:27,090
simple enough so the result of this is

00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:31,410
that the maximum weight can actually be

00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:34,620
when we have a 30 kilonewton engine that

00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:38,970
the maximum weight was 3058 kilograms

00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:42,200
which as you look here is about what the

00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:45,630
ingame thing did is all right it's at

00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,980
3050 but that's more because I don't

00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:50,580
have all the decimal point so I have to

00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:53,850
guess so it actually mobiles it quite

00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:56,430
quite well and that's somehow doesn't

00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:58,590
actually surprised me all right so what

00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:01,230
else are we going to look at so once you

00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:03,210
up into an orbit you need yeah you need

00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:05,430
to do orbital maneuvers to get to places

00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:08,370
right and the way how you calculate that

00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:09,830
is with sounds like a delta T also first

00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:11,360
time I did is rocket she

00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:17,090
probably watch this because I promise

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:20,450
explosions I forgot something i forgot

00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:24,740
basically to you can see that inside

00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:26,630
here this means docking clamps and you

00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,070
should not do those all the way at the

00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:31,100
end they should go all the way in the

00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:32,299
front yes I play with this game and I

00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:36,769
blow up so much stuff in this case

00:22:32,299 --> 00:22:38,240
however bill survives so bills actually

00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:40,549
quite happy those never happy he's

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,480
always very grumpy and afraid of being

00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:46,250
blown up well I know why so yeah point

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,809
point a rocket to right way up as well

00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:50,090
as make sure it doesn't fall apart when

00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:51,500
ignoring engines they're always good all

00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:53,360
right so let's talk a little bit about

00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,880
Delta V Delta V is something that is

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:59,179
used in rocket equations and lots for

00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:02,059
many different things and this also got

00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:05,240
the tchaikovsky rocket equation I might

00:23:02,059 --> 00:23:06,529
get an name wrong but so clever person

00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:11,570
that come up with this formula that

00:23:06,529 --> 00:23:14,029
explains the Delta V the maximum Delta V

00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:16,909
of vessel can do and Delta V basically

00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:19,010
means it changed in velocity not

00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:21,649
thinking about atmospheric drag or stuff

00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:23,690
like that so it is in vacuum and of

00:23:21,649 --> 00:23:25,460
course if you're getting off a body then

00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:26,960
like a planet then yes that's

00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,760
atmospheric drag and various equations

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,880
and fully work because there's a

00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,559
negative force more you have heard of

00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:36,649
terminal velocity I suppose it's

00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:39,260
something false and it doesn't go fast

00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:43,070
because the air pressure at counter

00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:44,809
weights the I don't know the term for

00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:46,940
this anymore annual I need all this

00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:48,440
physics stuff but not anyone anyway so

00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,880
this is called a rocket equation and it

00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,190
basically works this photo you have the

00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,080
initial Mouse including the fuel that

00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:56,840
you're going to use to shoot it up in

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,000
the sky wit or propellant as it is more

00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,649
nicely cult and we have the final total

00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,240
mass of course that is the difference

00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:09,220
between empty tank and full tank so ten

00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:12,700
things you lose when ya doing stuff and

00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:16,130
I'll get back to losing stuff or so and

00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:20,360
so Delta V is it difference in velocity

00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:23,720
0 n is the logarithmic function which in

00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:27,020
PHP isn't Ellen is called log and then

00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:29,299
vez effective exhaust velocity basically

00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:31,909
that tells you well how well is your

00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:33,380
energy actually doing so for that term

00:24:31,909 --> 00:24:35,690
in this formula we have to have a

00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:37,610
further look and basically specific

00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:40,130
impulse well that V stands for is the

00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:43,210
acceleration due to gravity at the

00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:46,250
surface of course the higher up you get

00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:48,470
gravity gets less but that's something

00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:50,450
that I'm not talking about the area

00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:52,130
cough gets too complicated and as I said

00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:55,100
before this is about the same as it is

00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:57,620
on earth on the equator and an LSP or

00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:59,809
it's not LSPs ISP is the specific

00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:01,309
impulse in seconds i misspelled it but

00:24:59,809 --> 00:25:06,890
you can't see that because in this form

00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:09,140
that looks the same and yes so yeah you

00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:10,700
use this term and then you put it in the

00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,260
order function formula to calculate the

00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:15,230
maximum Delta V and of course I have

00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:17,090
worked out example here so the ingame

00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:18,919
things they actually models very well so

00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:21,110
it is not like oh this is a funny game

00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:22,880
that allows you to do Rockets know

00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:26,450
exactly variable to adult and all the

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,950
physics in there barring some ball

00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:31,130
things that haven't thought about yet

00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:33,049
like we entry eat and works actually

00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:34,700
really quite well and all the formulas

00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:37,370
are tested whether they actually work in

00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:39,250
the game and yet even those corrects

00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:40,970
there was more surprised that my

00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:43,130
calculations were correct and the game

00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:45,950
was to be found there so yes we have

00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:49,370
those two things and so specific impulse

00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:52,850
is the gravitational constant times the

00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:57,650
specific game in the game the ISP at sea

00:25:52,850 --> 00:26:00,559
level is being given as 3 huh most

00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:01,760
engines they have a different specific

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,580
impulse depending whether and in

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,320
atmosphere or not for calculation see

00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:08,000
I'm not thinking about it because again

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,159
that makes it to complicate it but the

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,549
game actually does model that wrongly

00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:16,370
but it does knowledge so the ice the ls

00:26:13,549 --> 00:26:19,159
no isp at sea level is three hundreds

00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:20,809
and the maximum engine powers a 30 kilo

00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:24,620
Newtons that we've seen before hourly

00:26:20,809 --> 00:26:26,690
also the fuel tank if it's full it's to

00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:28,429
do two and a quarter tone and if it's

00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:30,880
empty it's only a quarter ton so the

00:26:28,429 --> 00:26:34,640
difference is two tones which is a

00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,380
something we function needs us all so

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,280
again I've implemented this in PHP and

00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,280
is actually not very difficult

00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:44,800
so yeah you multiply specific game pills

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,510
again this is misspelled but in this

00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:52,980
case you can see that because its

00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:52,980
different forms times at yet a graphic

00:26:54,390 --> 00:27:01,960
full mouth and empty mouth and by

00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:04,480
running this you get result 20 439 Delta

00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,400
V out of this which if you're actually

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,530
up in space this number is actually what

00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:12,520
the game shows you as well it's quite

00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:15,280
good that's quite a lot to us to enter

00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:18,070
orbit around kerbin you need about 20

00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:20,500
100 meters per second so you would think

00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:21,910
that this rocket would manage that but

00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:25,900
it doesn't because of the atmospheres in

00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:28,210
the way his own so that doesn't work and

00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:31,900
I so a few more things let's do some

00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:34,540
velocity calculations again more maps I

00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:37,750
did promise Mountain explosion so what

00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:40,570
this does is the blue line here is the

00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:43,420
orbit of my spaceship right you can see

00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:45,970
wealthy periapsis is the closest point

00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:48,130
to the body and the apoapsis so the

00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:51,400
closest point is about 300 kilometers

00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:53,920
and I wanted to have the apoapsis as a

00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:56,410
thousand kilometers but my pylons and

00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:58,240
skills weren't good enough well you try

00:27:56,410 --> 00:28:02,820
this late if you want and see how easy

00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:05,560
this is and yeah you can calculate what

00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:06,760
the velocity is at either point see if

00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:10,410
you know a few things you need to know

00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:13,180
the mass of the body orbiting around and

00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:15,520
of course technically the mouth of the

00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:19,240
vessel also has an influence on this but

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:21,310
comparing three tones against moon

00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,020
doesn't really much of a difference and

00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:26,620
lees PHP is not nearly as accurate

00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:27,910
enough to calculate that for you so

00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:30,100
let's forget about the mouth of the

00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:32,260
vessel itself and yeah there's a few few

00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:34,750
things that you need to know about here

00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:37,860
so you have the shortest distance R 1 or

00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:41,680
periapsis and you have the longer axis

00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:43,840
which is the apoapsis or are too so here

00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:45,420
in the middle you have the moon and you

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:48,850
can see that of course this bit is

00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:51,500
shorten that bit right so in orbital

00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:53,540
mechanics the velocity of the space

00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:55,580
ship is not the same all around the

00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:57,640
orbit if it was a circular object

00:28:55,580 --> 00:29:00,440
orbiting yes it is the same everywhere

00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:04,100
that'll get back to the circle of orbit

00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:07,940
in a bit also even though the apoapsis

00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:10,970
and Barry up to say 300 and and say a

00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:13,190
thousand even those 998 that is not

00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:14,810
actually the radius because you also

00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:16,550
need to take into account the radius of

00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:20,180
the moon and the game doesn't tell you

00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:23,270
that see this is why I'm adding the 60

00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:26,690
because the moon is 60 or has a radius

00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:29,600
or 60 kilometers so how do we calculate

00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:31,630
the velocity at the r2 point which is

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,790
the point farthest away in the orbit

00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:37,370
anybody knows how to do it no it's okay

00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:39,020
i didn't know here so i watch some

00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:41,060
videos and YouTube and now know how this

00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:43,070
works anyway there's a function for this

00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:45,200
so a bit more maths you got here so we

00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:48,050
have the the mint candy moon here again

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:53,150
called minimus and we can calculate then

00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:55,340
with some some terms what the velocities

00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:59,330
of course as a spoiler in Bolton which

00:29:55,340 --> 00:30:01,390
has 2907 but there we go so what what

00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:05,780
are the terms in here there is like some

00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:08,690
cosmic constants why it is a consents I

00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:11,930
don't know scientists don't know and I

00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:13,700
don't like it because they want to have

00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:15,440
this big theory that ties everything

00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,840
together and they don't want constant in

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,090
it but they haven't figured it out yet

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,190
so we have a constant which is actually

00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:25,720
not very I is it tells something about

00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:29,810
the weakness of the gravitational forces

00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:33,380
compared to other forces like what are

00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:35,150
the other ones yes yeah yeah that's for

00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:37,150
okay i can i can think of that if I

00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:39,920
think about a bit more so yes and then

00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:42,080
the other term that we use is m and he

00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:44,780
learns to guess what that is it's the

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,670
mass or the mass yes and this has many

00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:48,680
digits so and your calculations are

00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:50,530
chopped off the last bit because I got

00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:53,300
tired of typing into my calculator and

00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:55,460
then the other term here tells you

00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:59,960
something about the relation between the

00:30:55,460 --> 00:31:04,850
velocity and the distance to the middle

00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:05,299
of the or the majors semi-major axis I

00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:07,190
forgot

00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:08,570
planet here so there's one other thing

00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:10,820
that is important here for those

00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:13,580
calculations is is basically the effort

00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:15,649
between the shortest and the longest

00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,999
distance which is somewhat in the middle

00:31:15,649 --> 00:31:20,090
here and which is called a semi-major

00:31:16,999 --> 00:31:21,590
axis and then you can calculate with

00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:27,289
just using the average you so in this

00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:31,279
case what is it 700 something actually

00:31:27,289 --> 00:31:34,129
709 because it says it right here so we

00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:36,259
calculate that and then we also know the

00:31:34,129 --> 00:31:39,590
distance at the furthest point because

00:31:36,259 --> 00:31:41,989
that is the same as the apoapsis which

00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:43,429
in this case is 9 and 98 kilometers plus

00:31:41,989 --> 00:31:46,129
radius of the moon is a thousand and

00:31:43,429 --> 00:31:48,080
fifty eight kilometers now when you plug

00:31:46,129 --> 00:31:52,159
all those terms into your formula you

00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:53,720
get 2907 and to verify that I've plugged

00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:57,379
it in a game again and what does it say

00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:59,239
at the furthest point it says 29 up 12

00:31:57,379 --> 00:32:01,190
now there's a few things why because i'm

00:31:59,239 --> 00:32:03,649
actually not fully at the apoapsis i was

00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:05,509
a bit too early to be precise those nine

00:32:03,649 --> 00:32:07,789
minutes and seven seconds the earning so

00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:10,519
the velocity hasn't reached well it

00:32:07,789 --> 00:32:14,389
largest number yet but please good

00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:16,039
enough right now I also know why my

00:32:14,389 --> 00:32:19,309
calculations were wrong first because I

00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:21,019
really thought this was 300,000

00:32:19,309 --> 00:32:24,980
kilometers and then you get factors

00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:27,799
wrong of course anyway so Delta V is

00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:30,859
this measure that those things about the

00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:33,440
change in velocity right so how do we

00:32:30,859 --> 00:32:36,109
calculate the difference between the

00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,029
current orbit that I have as well as the

00:32:36,109 --> 00:32:40,789
circular orbit is this actually circle

00:32:38,029 --> 00:32:42,559
for you know it isn't okay the aspect

00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:46,100
ratio of the screen is wrong imagine

00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:48,139
it's a circle imagine it's a circle so

00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:50,950
how do we calculate that right it's pull

00:32:48,139 --> 00:32:53,749
fairly trivial you basically calculate

00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:55,639
the velocity at any other point in the

00:32:53,749 --> 00:32:58,009
orbit and because it's a circular orbit

00:32:55,639 --> 00:33:01,119
the speed is the same all along the

00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:04,340
orbit all right so we come back to them

00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:06,799
to the circle here and then we can use a

00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:09,499
better formula or a simple formula

00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:11,299
because paeonia bonocore there's no

00:33:09,499 --> 00:33:14,809
difference between epilepsies and

00:33:11,299 --> 00:33:17,350
periapsis so the formulas a bit easier

00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:21,220
and you end up calculating

00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:24,100
that you get 40 meters a second out of

00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:28,570
this formula as a speed on a circular

00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:32,260
orbits around minimus that is made out

00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:33,940
of minty candy all right so what is the

00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:37,059
difference in velocity or if you

00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:39,280
calculate 40 minus 29 roughly the end up

00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:42,220
at being 11 and when you look at the

00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:44,260
game here it says 11 dot eight so again

00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,700
my calculations work properly and of

00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:49,240
course how do you get this delta T by

00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:53,950
burning your rocket side so let's burn

00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:56,200
some rockets all right so what I wanted

00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:58,690
to do is actually simulate or talked

00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,850
through all the equations of getting to

00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:02,260
juna which is the Mars variant in the

00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:04,330
game so I have this big rocket here

00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:07,240
Bill's flying with us he's frightened

00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:09,940
azizul and when you lift off you see

00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:12,010
exactly the video moves faster than I

00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:13,780
can speak because I sped it up but you

00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:16,869
see that it's doing staging as well

00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:19,179
right okay stop stop that okay at some

00:34:16,869 --> 00:34:21,669
point you see I'm not going straight up

00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:23,740
I'm taking like a turn because as much

00:34:21,669 --> 00:34:25,780
more efficient to do much more efficient

00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:27,669
also my rocket has wings which create

00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:30,970
some lifts which is bit cheating of

00:34:27,669 --> 00:34:32,230
course but it does work and on earth you

00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:35,919
would do this in a totally different

00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:37,270
trajectory in a game you go up straight

00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:38,770
for about 10 kilometers and then start

00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:41,050
earning as you have seen rocket launches

00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:43,090
on TV it's started doing a turn almost

00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:45,220
immediately mostly because the earth is

00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:49,300
10 times as big the atmosphere bit

00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:50,679
denser so yeah it works better you have

00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:53,369
to talk to the real rocket science is

00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:56,050
exactly why I'm just an amateur one and

00:34:53,369 --> 00:34:57,790
yeah you see that off the launching you

00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:59,920
seed like this orbit and you can see of

00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:01,800
course that it is not actually in orbit

00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:06,400
because I'm not going fast enough

00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:10,000
basically orbiting is falling slower

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:12,010
than the planet rotates so you just fall

00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,130
really really fast in a direction but

00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:17,080
you fall the moment you do that do you

00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:18,550
urge is or the planets the lower so you

00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,020
just need to fall in the correct speed

00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:22,690
so that your orbits right that's

00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:25,030
basically what orbiting is so this is

00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:26,560
why there's there is still gravity in

00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:29,500
orbit sizzle this one of the reasons

00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,790
anyway and we burn some more and at some

00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,670
points

00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:35,140
now I don't have to burn for a bit you

00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:36,460
saw my staging there so I have to go

00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:42,250
back to form a moose it goes event two

00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:44,680
phones okay so once I pop up the details

00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:47,170
okay so what you can snow that's

00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:48,430
difficult to see so i have used staging

00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:52,600
here right and the reason why if you

00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:54,610
staging in a rocket is so that carrying

00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:57,640
up lots of extra things like rocket

00:35:54,610 --> 00:36:01,480
engines and wings and stuff you really

00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:03,100
don't bond in space like nuclear tiny

00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,500
nuclear power station the power rockets

00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:07,570
and yeah you don't of course to make it

00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:11,650
back to the planet you want to not have

00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:13,330
that end up in space because things

00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:16,030
floating in space can cause issues

00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:18,300
anybody have seen gravity here you know

00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:20,710
you've now heard of the Kessler syndrome

00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:22,750
the castle syndrome is actually one of

00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:25,750
the loading funnies in this game and

00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:27,490
says treating Kessler syndrome which

00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,750
makes no sense or for people that don't

00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:31,690
know below this the castle syndrome

00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:34,090
basically says that at some point there

00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:37,480
will be so much debris debris in an

00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:39,760
orbit in like low Earth orbit and that

00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:42,820
will hit all the things and because of

00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,470
this you get this exponential collection

00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:45,910
of debris in an orbit and if this

00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:49,000
actually happens that means we can't

00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:50,380
don't go to space anymore or we shoot it

00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,580
all of this guy with a big laser it

00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:57,520
would be awesome and that next thought

00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:59,530
next talk is about lasers yes so yeah

00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,240
the staging happens so that yeah you

00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:03,910
don't take so much weight with you and

00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:07,960
because you drop stuff off and make sure

00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:09,490
it nicely reenters you get much more

00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,230
Delta V out of it because you lose all

00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:13,150
the way that you don't need so this is

00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:14,920
why im using staging it so I've actually

00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:16,660
what four stages or something like that

00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,370
so the first one is with big solid

00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:19,930
rocket boosters and this is something

00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:21,640
you know you know about Cole's face for

00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:27,250
him if it doesn't go up all more

00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:29,020
boosters doesn't actually work so and

00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:31,270
also another reason why you staging is

00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:34,060
because you can use fuel lines between

00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:35,590
our tanks are in the tanks again getting

00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:37,960
more performance out of your Rockets

00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:40,330
because of way things so at the moment

00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,680
I'm still having two of my side books is

00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:44,050
only I which you can see in this stage

00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:47,120
and you can see that

00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:51,260
the trust to waist ratio is actually 0

00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:53,930
dot 40 just by far not high enough sorry

00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:56,300
the currents eighth it's 20 20 but when

00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:59,960
I lose those rockets to trust to weight

00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:01,670
ratio drops 20 dogs 40 and as you might

00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:04,430
remember from previous life that is not

00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:06,410
enough to get up into space but we're

00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:12,140
already going almost of the over three

00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:13,340
ones so it sort of works I mean actually

00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:16,160
all probably should show you that what

00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:21,860
happens so when I lose them the trustee

00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:23,900
ratio is now 0 at 14 and we can okay

00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:26,360
once it pops up you can see now that in

00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:29,420
my orbital speed is 1900 of 5 and it

00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:31,280
needs to be about 2150 probably fit

00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:33,470
great uses a slide as a calculation for

00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,440
that on the zone which I could have done

00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:38,720
and it says that the apoapsis is at the

00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,610
moment 80 kilometers I wanted to create

00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:43,850
an orbit that was 80 kilometers around

00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:47,690
the planet and you should see the

00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:51,380
periapsis minus 238 that means that you

00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:53,630
will crash unless you are more Oh more

00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:57,140
delta v 2e rocket and it tells you the

00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:59,030
time to a purposes of 37 and what you

00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:01,790
try to usually get to Apple apps us up

00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:03,620
to what to a minute which is a saving of

00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:06,320
margin so you actually see that when I

00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:08,510
burn here now further the apt x apps

00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,860
abscess drops because i'm not actually

00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:12,980
having enough trust to iteration and

00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:14,360
then you see it to go into 30 minutes

00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:17,810
and then i make it again and then you

00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:20,140
see it orbits ok so orbits here again

00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:24,430
from this orbit I need to go to

00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:28,040
different planets and this is also in

00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:29,750
calculation that I know how to do but I

00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,700
couldn't get to work so I don't have it

00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:33,980
on a slide because that would look silly

00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:36,140
I'm not sure I'm telling you in this but

00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:39,200
there you go and so yes we have this

00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:44,540
orbit and there's a way to calculate the

00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:46,310
correct ejection angle of the planet

00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:49,310
that you orbiting on doing that at the

00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:51,890
exactly right moment to have an optimal

00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:53,300
trajectory to your other planets this is

00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:55,850
called launch windows make sense right

00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:57,530
and you don't have to wait for lunch

00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:59,450
windows normally because you can just

00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:01,310
more power to but it's so much more

00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:02,510
efficient to do so this is right here on

00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:05,600
the news like I'll to have to wait

00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:07,310
another mob well it's for Mars is like

00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,480
18 months or something like that so you

00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:12,620
don't really want to miss your lounge

00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:14,540
window and so yes that is the in the

00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:16,220
game there's some calculation for this

00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:19,100
and I actually wanted to see where I

00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:21,380
could do that myself and that I failed

00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:24,940
so I just show you how it looks like

00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:27,770
instance so yeah you have to wait until

00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:28,940
at the moment I have to wait 14 minutes

00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:30,380
to my long term and then you can see

00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:34,190
what I've done with the orbiter I've set

00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:36,800
it up earlier so it is like this perfect

00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:40,010
trajectory to hit in this case June are

00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:42,800
marsh you can however see that there's

00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:44,720
like tiny triangles and the tiny

00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:49,430
triangles makes it this is the closest

00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:51,650
approach but it means I'm not actually

00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:55,550
getting captured by the planets

00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:58,430
gravitation and that is of course the op

00:40:55,550 --> 00:41:01,040
daardie orbits are not in the same plane

00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:04,130
there's a slight inclination which I'll

00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:06,320
get to in a moment blah blah blah so

00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:09,260
okay so here you see that the descending

00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:12,260
note is zero dot one degrees which is

00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:15,040
just enough to miss a planet so getting

00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:18,140
those numbers right is quite important

00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:19,700
which you probably shouldn't bring up

00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:21,740
with a party with some purchase

00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:23,780
scientists that managed to miss Kellogg

00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:26,120
calculators with the thing they actually

00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:27,440
sent to Mars and then on the missing

00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,490
it's because they didn't know the

00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,560
difference between inches and

00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:33,530
centimeters but that's a little

00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,580
interesting story anyway so yeah of

00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:36,440
course you need to make this course

00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:37,790
correction and course correction is

00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,700
something that NASA does all the time

00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:42,500
it's all because they have to I mean

00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:45,830
they're quite good calculating stuff but

00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:47,840
if it's only fraction of a second off

00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:49,310
sometimes which happens with rockets all

00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,800
the time because it's just not exact

00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:53,450
science yeah they have to make course

00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:57,680
corrections in this case I have to burn

00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:59,810
so it did tell me it's about 1100 meters

00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,820
per second Delta V and of course my

00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:05,270
rocket has way more because I over

00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:07,700
design stuff so yeah it burns a little

00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:10,280
bit and you can see the orbit now

00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:11,410
getting larger rights and it gets up to

00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:15,119
a point where it

00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:18,760
snap out because this is the point where

00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:20,079
there where the orbit goes out of the

00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:22,150
sphere of influence and the sphere of

00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:24,069
influence is something that doesn't

00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:26,230
really exist in a real world where

00:42:24,069 --> 00:42:28,390
gravity is always going to have any

00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:30,520
influence on words however modeling

00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:31,990
gravity in the solar system where you

00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:34,089
have so many different bodies of

00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:36,940
different masses it's so complicated

00:42:34,089 --> 00:42:39,789
that you can't actually do it with more

00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:43,059
than three bodies in the in the system

00:42:39,789 --> 00:42:44,470
so this is why people need to need to

00:42:43,059 --> 00:42:47,829
make course corrections of course judges

00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:49,150
can calculate it and yeah in kerbal

00:42:47,829 --> 00:42:51,970
space program this is not a problem

00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:54,700
because it only does one body physics or

00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:56,349
will sorry to body physics and it has

00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:57,430
this constable sphere of influence so

00:42:56,349 --> 00:42:59,859
the sphere of influence reaches to

00:42:57,430 --> 00:43:01,720
certain radius and then it switches to a

00:42:59,859 --> 00:43:03,520
different body in this case that the Sun

00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:06,460
that you here so make some course

00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:08,200
corrections here there we go so my

00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:12,039
rocket is a bit wobbling because I don't

00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:13,890
know how to make rockets and it's also

00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:16,660
very handy that you can speed up time

00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:19,210
that means that I don't have to wait 200

00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:21,279
days to actually get somewhere but I can

00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:23,619
do that over well getting some coffee I

00:43:21,279 --> 00:43:25,329
suppose so depending on the rocket

00:43:23,619 --> 00:43:29,020
engines there they don't always have the

00:43:25,329 --> 00:43:31,180
same m specific impulse so the engines

00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:34,539
are really efficient don't have a lot of

00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:36,819
thrust so in this game there is a I on

00:43:34,539 --> 00:43:38,319
for a second there is an engines called

00:43:36,819 --> 00:43:39,970
an ion engine which actually exists

00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:42,279
which are really efficient but it

00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:47,740
generates so little trust that in game

00:43:42,279 --> 00:43:50,619
it takes me 23 hours to get to the Delta

00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:53,410
V that I needed to do and annoyingly if

00:43:50,619 --> 00:43:55,960
you have a throttle up engine it come

00:43:53,410 --> 00:44:00,460
time accelerate so yes you have to wait

00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:02,500
a 23 hours or are more boosters so any

00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:06,819
case we have arrived at the planet here

00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:11,079
and landing with the most tricky bit and

00:44:06,819 --> 00:44:14,349
I'm not very good at but yes so we'd

00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:18,339
come in about fifteen hundred meters a

00:44:14,349 --> 00:44:20,859
second slowing down I will not have

00:44:18,339 --> 00:44:23,440
enough fuel for any more but what I do

00:44:20,859 --> 00:44:24,940
have is an atmosphere so the general

00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,119
concept is that you use the atmosphere

00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:27,670
for

00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:30,220
breaking now the game also can calculate

00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:32,890
that for you but I counts because I

00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:35,230
haven't found the equations yet but

00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:36,849
we'll see what happens here again this

00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:40,749
is time accelerated in the game but also

00:44:36,849 --> 00:44:43,089
the video sped up four times and you can

00:44:40,749 --> 00:44:46,150
see the orbit getting smaller and mean

00:44:43,089 --> 00:44:47,710
not adding any fuel to it because i'm

00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:51,789
using the the atmosphere for breaking

00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:52,869
and once it's done i get somewhere it

00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:56,319
takes another minute I'm done well to

00:44:52,869 --> 00:44:59,019
wakefulness so I miscalculated so I need

00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:00,999
to burn anyway and at some point you can

00:44:59,019 --> 00:45:05,859
see my landing spot side my learning

00:45:00,999 --> 00:45:07,269
sports ass here that's there I don't

00:45:05,859 --> 00:45:11,890
want to over the so landing gear comes

00:45:07,269 --> 00:45:16,059
out I be some more fuel because I don't

00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:19,869
pull the planets ditch my stage open the

00:45:16,059 --> 00:45:21,880
parachutes and aim so i aim very nicely

00:45:19,869 --> 00:45:23,579
see the other thing nope my parachute

00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:28,869
comes out it crashes that one here and

00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:30,999
then I'll and built it falls over so I

00:45:28,869 --> 00:45:33,180
just spend an hour doing this and then

00:45:30,999 --> 00:45:37,150
you fall over just really annoying and

00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:38,859
you know about what I said about

00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:42,249
pointing the rocket the right way up

00:45:38,859 --> 00:45:43,480
otherwise it doesn't go into space he

00:45:42,249 --> 00:45:46,029
couldn't go home anymore which is really

00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:48,249
annoying alright so what I still have to

00:45:46,029 --> 00:45:50,670
do probably for maybe feature version of

00:45:48,249 --> 00:45:53,440
the talk or implement in a few other

00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:55,869
extensions I want to continue working on

00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,279
the soda extension extension do the

00:45:55,869 --> 00:45:59,859
correct position of the Sun and the moon

00:45:57,279 --> 00:46:01,950
and for the moon you can calculate two

00:45:59,859 --> 00:46:05,259
types of positions you can do the

00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:07,660
geocentric basically from the center of

00:46:05,259 --> 00:46:10,180
the earth or topographic is where where

00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:11,829
you are on the earth also makes

00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:13,749
difference of course to where the moon

00:46:11,829 --> 00:46:15,249
appears in the sky so I want to do some

00:46:13,749 --> 00:46:16,989
calculations for the dose calculations

00:46:15,249 --> 00:46:18,730
are really difficult I found a really

00:46:16,989 --> 00:46:21,400
good website for this but I don't

00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:23,140
understand the chance so I have to do

00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,339
some more learning and the same thing I

00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:27,130
want to do the same thing for planets

00:46:24,339 --> 00:46:31,029
which I can't really see much use forum

00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:33,430
PHP Sun and Moon yes I probably can't

00:46:31,029 --> 00:46:34,989
find all the interesting uses for it and

00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:36,730
I want to do some more Spacey stuff so

00:46:34,989 --> 00:46:37,839
there's some other things that I want to

00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:39,310
have calculations were solved us

00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:41,900
something called the over

00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:43,760
basically means if you go faster your

00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:45,770
engines are going to be more efficient

00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,540
and creating delta T aerobraking

00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:50,090
something along to calculate the Hoffman

00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:54,250
transfer which is the most optimal

00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:56,540
transfer between two orbiting bodies and

00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:58,370
when I was researching that I found

00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:01,760
something about bi elliptic transfers

00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:03,560
which instead of making one good burn

00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,830
you actually create a burner goes way

00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:08,180
too far and they use another burn to

00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:09,890
allow a new orbit with what you actually

00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:11,960
wanted to be and that can be more

00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:14,510
efficient and exactly I figured out that

00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:17,120
they use that for booting geostationary

00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:20,570
satellites into orbits that's how they

00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:22,580
do that I didn't know that because yeah

00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:24,830
usually that the Rockets that sensitive

00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:27,140
up into space they have more power than

00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:29,150
they actually need so they use that to

00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:30,680
reduce the amount of fuel that the

00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:32,930
satellites need to get into the correct

00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:34,280
orbit so that makes it awesome and yes I

00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:36,170
want to put all the equations I using

00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:38,480
this presentation to an extension or one

00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:41,330
of the ones I already have and of course

00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,950
I need to rescue bill Reconquista kaduna

00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:46,970
so my first attempt was something like

00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:50,000
this I think let's just swap the engine

00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:52,130
and that didn't work particularly well

00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,860
and he died that's why you have safe

00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:58,070
games which account do in real life

00:47:53,860 --> 00:48:02,480
anyway any questions I walk into

00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:05,560
something no questions who's going to

00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:10,700
try out kerbal space program later today

00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:13,880
sorry yes so how long did it take you

00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:16,790
from scratch to get to your level of

00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:22,520
expertise in this game what unit would

00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:26,170
you like this in beers years okay in

00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:30,560
beers it is approximately approximately

00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:32,600
200 I drink about a beer in our someday

00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:35,300
now it takes quite a lot of time but

00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:37,400
it's lots of fun if and of course I'm

00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:42,440
actually better than i'm showing here

00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:45,230
because I I promise explosions no it's

00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:46,790
anything else I had a question for you

00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:49,220
but I didn't see anybody answering a

00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:50,690
call cycle destructans who's going to

00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:54,680
try it kerbal space program later if you

00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:56,390
need help let me know I've helped many

00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:58,730
people getting into orbit which is step

00:48:56,390 --> 00:49:03,290
number one landing on moons is step

00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:08,870
number two docking in orbits yeah that

00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:13,280
is a pain yes question writing their use

00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:14,810
microphone so when yet the planet what

00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:18,020
do you do then just go back oh no you

00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:19,880
get whoa that's the plan no actually the

00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:21,890
d ID is that you collect signs

00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:24,830
everywhere and science allows you to

00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:29,090
unlock more parts however that has

00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:34,280
nothing to do with PHP I actually looked

00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:37,010
at using PHP for for creating extensions

00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:38,120
to the game because it's quite open and

00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:40,280
there's lots of people that create

00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:42,560
modifications for it however this has to

00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:44,120
be done on C sharp which means i would

00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,950
have to write an interface between chi

00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:48,380
sharp and peach PSO and that is going a

00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:50,060
bit too far for my limited amount of

00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:53,450
spare time that i already have all

00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:55,490
rights yet a question is though you can

00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:58,370
also questions about the PHP bits of the

00:49:55,490 --> 00:50:00,160
talk is there any physics in the game

00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:02,630
that you actually found disappointing

00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:06,230
physics that I found is appointing yeah

00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:08,420
reentry reentry it has effects but you

00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:10,580
don't die if you do wrong so that is

00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:13,160
something i miss but there's much for

00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:15,590
that also the parachutes aren't really

00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,640
quite good or it is not very well models

00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:18,710
and things like that so yeah there's a

00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,330
few things but it's an alpha version of

00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:24,050
the game and i'm sure they'll be all

00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:25,550
models in the future having different

00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:27,860
solar system that you can go to rid of

00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:30,290
our primary you never know but it won't

00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:32,780
go into the physics of that one you

00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:34,610
mentioned launch windows yes i had a

00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:37,250
quite long argument with my friend on

00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:40,370
this game about if it's better to plan

00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:42,380
your launch from scratch from Earth or

00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:45,590
whether you do it once you've reached a

00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:51,200
steady orbit of say ATK I do it for more

00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:53,180
bits it I think it worked better it's

00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:58,730
definitely easier because she can wait a

00:50:53,180 --> 00:51:00,740
safe game in orbit it's actually unity

00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:02,690
the platform the game is running in yes

00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:04,400
you're not accessible is it for people

00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:06,290
who are not on the Alpha program is it

00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,420
still available to buy on steam or how

00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:10,100
does it work I don't know I really don't

00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:11,450
know haven't looked at that but I would

00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:13,160
like to know at some point it's on steam

00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:15,860
available to purchase now oh yeah the

00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:18,020
game is on steam sorry yes yes all right

00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:20,330
anything else well I hope it was

00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:23,680
somewhat useful and at least

00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:26,030
entertaining I have no more questions

00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:28,250
although I've nine more minutes so if

00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:30,680
there's anything do you think that some

00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:33,260
of the calculations besides the space

00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:34,790
rocket II stuff because no real rocket

00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:37,610
engine is going to turn in PHP of course

00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:38,900
but things we work to calculate

00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:40,220
positions of the moon so you have any

00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:43,460
ideas where the Alpha could be useful

00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:44,960
for soon to arrive flying cars that we

00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:47,210
will be driving i'm chillin flying cars

00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:55,520
versus a little different from us to us

00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:59,360
40 years ago yes um it could be used to

00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:01,490
control at an autumn automatically

00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:03,980
pointing telescope they already exists

00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:05,450
yes so if you have a if you have a

00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:08,360
system that can calculate the position

00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:10,010
of a planet the moon you can

00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:12,440
automatically point telescopes at it

00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:14,000
yeah that does exist but not a PHP

00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:17,860
version I don't think no I don't think

00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:20,860
so but very good this one on the back

00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:20,860
okay

00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:33,200
that's very true yes that is true as oh

00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:35,330
yes all right okay my first attempt is

00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:40,040
not going to be my last attempt my most

00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:41,540
epic failure was not going to the Mars

00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:44,570
variable going to one of the moons of

00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:49,520
the Jupiter variant very nicely landed I

00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:51,950
had a proper rocket but I broke off the

00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:53,690
engine up in landing so he's stranded

00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:56,240
there right and I spent the whole

00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:58,970
Christmas holidays designing a bigger

00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:02,330
space ship to land pick him up and fly

00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:06,109
back and I will actually create a video

00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:08,330
out of that at some point anyway yeah

00:53:06,109 --> 00:53:12,730
thank you very much i hope you enjoyed

00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:12,730
