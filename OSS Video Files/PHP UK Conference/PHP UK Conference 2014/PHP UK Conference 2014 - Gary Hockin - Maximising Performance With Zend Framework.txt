	Zend Framework 2 is a complex beast, and has been wrongly criticised for it's performance in a number of places. There are plenty of ways to eek out extra cycles from Zend Framework 2, some of them are known, some, not so much. Fisrtly you'll be introduced to the ways to benchmark and profile your ZF2 app, then we'll discuss the out-of-the-box improvements such as config caching and compiling, but also cover some bespoke modules designed to help your performance. Finally, we'll cover some coding best practices that can really help to squeeze that little extra out of your entry level VM.
