Description: 
	MySQL 5.6 was released in February 2013. It is the largest release of MySQL in history (measured by code size increase) and contains a number of very useful enhancements to replication, performance and security. What I want to talk about however is how it's now much easier to run in production with features like online DDL and performance_schema.
