Title: PHP UK Conference 2014 - Stuart Herbert - PHP at the Firehose Scale
Publication date: 2014-03-21

Description: 
	Here's one to give the PHP bashers a well-deserved black eye! Twitter is one of the world's best know social media sites, handling over 500 million public tweets a day (that's around 6,000 tweets a second). Together, they're delivered to select partners as a 'firehose' of data, who in turn deliver it on to their customers. DataSift is one of Twitter's firehose partners, and when someone presses 'Send' in their Twitter client, we aim to get that tweet into the hands of our customers in about 1 second. And PHP plays several key roles in making that possible. Come along and hear Stuart explain just how.
