Description: 
	Linux distributions are using very powerful package systems for deployment of software for many years now and it's time that developers start using those systems as well. We talk about how to setup up a private repository, how to create RPM files and how incorporate this in your version control system so everything will work automatically. We also will talk about the pro's and cons of the system, how to work with different package flavors and how we can use the system for other purposes. Both you and your system administrator will become best friends again!
