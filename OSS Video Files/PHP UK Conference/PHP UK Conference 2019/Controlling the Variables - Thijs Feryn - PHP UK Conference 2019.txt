Title: Controlling the Variables - Thijs Feryn - PHP UK Conference 2019
Publication date: 2019-03-22
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2019
Description: 
	As a kid, do you have ambitions for the future? “When I grow up I want to become a …”. Maybe you wanted to become a fireman, an astronaut, a nurse, a teacher, or a police officer? As you grow up, these ideas evolve and get replaced with actual ambitions, actual hopes and dreams. These might be entirely different than your childhood dreams.

But how do you reach these goals?
How do you accomplish these dreams?
By listening to your parents, friends, or teachers?
By doing it yourself?
Or maybe, you have given up and settled for a watered down version of the career and life you envisioned?

People often attribute success to luck, and lack of success to incompetence. But what if I told you it’s all about controlling the variables?

Luck is something that you can control in a way. The more you figure out the context, the key players, the relationships, the values, and the rules of the ecosystem in which you want to succeed, the easier it is to gain from it. The more variables you control, the easier it is to find potential opportunities and to bank on them.

Maybe you didn’t get lucky, maybe you just saw it coming, and prepared yourself for it.

In this talk, Thijs is going to share his experiences, his hopes, his dreams, and how he applies a positive mental attitude to level up in his career, and in life in general.

This is not a growth hacking talk, but a simple set of tips and tricks to succeed, even if it seems like the odds are stacked against you.

	00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:07,470
I'm happy to be here actually it was

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,540
always my ambition to do a keynote like

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,940
this and the original idea was sparked

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,830
exactly a year ago at this very event

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,350
just around the corner in the speaker

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,510
room I was noticing how other keynote

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,369
speakers were preparing and I thought

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,710
this is something I want to do and that

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:24,689
was my career I'll do it moment and I

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,609
submitted an idea that's been on my mind

00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:31,320
for a couple of years and how here we

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:33,210
are the ideas is prefaced around the

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,100
fact that you could set yourself up for

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,620
success if you want to based on positive

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,420
mental attitude and I also believe in

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,980
the fact that you should be displaying

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,480
and expressing the thing you were

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,040
passionate about because we're all

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,190
passionate about something I'm a hundred

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,530
percent sure of that now unfortunately a

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,750
lot of cases people attribute that

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,239
success or that quest for success based

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,670
on luck I'm here to tell you that luck

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,620
is heavily overrated and luck is often

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,199
confused with another term to recall

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,290
chance

00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:06,420
luck is within our control more or less

00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:10,260
chance is completely beyond our control

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:13,229
it's completely random now in order to

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,060
be successful or in order to go for your

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:16,680
quest for success you need to control a

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,140
set of variables I'm using the metaphor

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,210
of a juggler juggling pins here these

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,210
pins represent variables aspects you

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,340
need to control the more variables you

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:29,430
can control the more you can control the

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:32,939
outcome your destiny if you will now

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:35,250
what we call luck are just pins are just

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:37,920
variables we don't get control maybe

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,610
even ones we don't know exists that what

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,130
this this talk is about now we all know

00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:45,780
the the typical cliche in in order to be

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,040
successful or in order to have certain

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,439
opportunities you need to be at the

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,420
right place at the right time we know

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,090
this cliche right but you could still be

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,740
there when the action happens where the

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,899
action happens and the opportunity could

00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,070
still slip away from you and that's why

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,810
I would like to add something there's

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,430
some space left on the slide you have to

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:06,149
be in the right place right time in the

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:08,429
right mindset that's important and that

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:09,989
mindset is based on the set of aspects

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,580
this this is just a couple of things

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,830
we're going to talk about about

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,500
positivity belief skill effort

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,020
all that kind of stuff that being said

00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:22,080
hi I'm taste good to see you here I

00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,910
really enjoy being here I've spoken at

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,040
many PHP conference I've attended many

00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,840
PHP UK conferences and always cool to be

00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,400
in the UK I mean I'm not just saying

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,960
here because I stand here I'm a

00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,420
Technical Evangelist at the Belgium web

00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,010
hosting company called combo and you can

00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,650
reach me on social media if you want

00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,700
that on these different channels now

00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,740
there's a danger to it

00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,300
I know because by putting it out there

00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,320
and saying that you couldn't let I'm

00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,520
looking at the front doors you can

00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,340
hackle me you could banter me

00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,080
you can even criticize me previous time

00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,340
I've done this talk people actually did

00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,350
criticize me and I learned a lot from

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:56,670
that so by all means do so if you're

00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:58,200
fair I'm willing to be fair as well I do

00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,670
have to acknowledge something I have to

00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,490
acknowledge that I'm gonna talk about

00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:04,860
going for success and achieving your

00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:06,870
goals it's easy relatively easy for me I

00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,610
will admit and I will use it as a

00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:13,140
disclaimer that I could speak here from

00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:15,170
a position of relative privilege I don't

00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,030
come from an underrepresented group I

00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:19,740
come from a safe area I've had good

00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,600
upbringing I don't suffer from mental

00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,940
health issues so you could say well it's

00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,100
kind of easy for you but I accept that

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,750
and I want to acknowledge that what I

00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,630
would also like to mention is that for

00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,220
any individual every individual every

00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:34,950
one has its own challenges its own

00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:37,560
obstacles its own things that are going

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:39,180
wrong and all of they might seem really

00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,220
tiny in the grand scheme of things and

00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,810
very relative but to each individual it

00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,670
is very much real so I just want to put

00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,440
that out there that you see this from

00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:49,950
this person perspective perspective from

00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,450
someone who didn't have too many

00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:55,050
challenges in the grand scheme of things

00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:56,550
but still one driver for me that was the

00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:58,110
reason why I'm doing whatever I'm doing

00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:00,660
and that was the fact that when I was in

00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:03,270
school people told me I wouldn't belong

00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,740
here and I'm not talking about I'm gonna

00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:07,770
stand right in the middle in this room

00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:10,170
this stage this very industry people

00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:12,630
told me I did not belong here my

00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:14,880
counselors told me tastes you suck at

00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:17,160
maths which I do for that matter second

00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,130
maths I am not that good at logical

00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,380
reasoning everything scientific is a

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,660
little tricky for me and I like

00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,700
languages I study language I studied

00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,830
French Dutch English German Latin

00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,020
all that stuff and they told me no taste

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,940
based on that skillset and the

00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,150
limitations you have you will not make

00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,490
it

00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:37,860
who needs communication skills in IT

00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:41,010
anyway 1999

00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:43,080
who needs that anyway I know what I did

00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:44,190
I disregarded that advice and I said you

00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,630
know what I'm gonna tune out of this

00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,580
conversation because I'm really

00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:49,830
passionate about computers I'm not the

00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,540
typical profile of a lot of developers

00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,400
here but I still want to be in this

00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,990
industry and I want to use the skills I

00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,000
have and acknowledge the limitations

00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:00,450
that I have and I disregarded it I

00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,460
studied IT I graduated and I did have

00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:04,290
some issues with with mats in school but

00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,600
regardless of that I did an exchange

00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:08,220
program and I went to Finland for three

00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,220
months and that's where I got most of my

00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:13,020
inspiration we got things done I quickly

00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,420
realized there that the world is a lot

00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,640
bigger than the small town dicks made

00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:19,080
where I come from in Belgium so it's a

00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,900
lot bigger there's an international

00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,430
aspect to it my project that I had to do

00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,380
on that exchange program was based upon

00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,420
PHP a language I didn't know until that

00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,870
point little did I know it would bring

00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,790
me here

00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:32,010
but you lovely people so that was an

00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,300
indirect consequence and I also realized

00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:35,850
that I didn't want to continue studying

00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,410
because if I would pursue master's

00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:39,690
degree it will require lots of Matt's

00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,280
logical reasoning algorithmic stuff not

00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,780
really my cup of tea so it was then and

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,940
there that I decided to apply for a job

00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,430
apply for a job at a Belgian web hosting

00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,590
company called combo we're really small

00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:52,410
back then for a bit bigger now through

00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:54,900
five or seven people and I saw this job

00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:56,370
opening for support job technical

00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,530
support so it was the ideal way to

00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:00,360
combine skills that I wasn't supposed to

00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:02,190
have right communication skills

00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,740
problem-solving skills helping people

00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:07,050
and using tech for that and it went

00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,030
great it was awesome but the irony of

00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:11,730
everything and that was was a huge on

00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:15,120
for me is the exact reason I got hired

00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:16,560
is because I could speak French another

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,120
native French speaker I could speak

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,250
French in Belgium a bilingual country

00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:24,000
that's important I could also write PHP

00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:25,590
and wasn't that the ultimate middle

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,450
finger to people who say I wouldn't

00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:30,120
amount to anything IT that I should stay

00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:31,470
clear of this industry that was that was

00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,060
a good one and that's important because

00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,830
you shouldn't take advice from people

00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,810
who say you cannot do something of

00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:38,370
course you have to take criticism but if

00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,999
someone says to you you can't do

00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,649
something just for the sake of

00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:43,989
and you really feel you're passionate

00:06:41,649 --> 00:06:46,209
about it maybe you should look the other

00:06:43,989 --> 00:06:48,069
way because I do not believe in the man

00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:49,689
holding you down I do not believe in our

00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:51,519
industry at least there's systems in

00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:53,349
place to keep us down but I do believe

00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,479
in individuals projecting their own

00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:57,639
frustrations their own limitations their

00:06:55,479 --> 00:07:00,369
own lack of ambitions so whenever you

00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:03,189
see that step away and try to do you

00:07:00,369 --> 00:07:04,869
whatever you means it's a bit cliche

00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:07,449
right saying that you can do whatever

00:07:04,869 --> 00:07:09,610
you want and the world is yours I'm not

00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:12,339
sure if that's the case but if you are

00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,989
passionate enough about something and it

00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:16,449
could be something ridiculous but

00:07:13,989 --> 00:07:18,579
everyone has a passion everyone has a

00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:19,869
path and you should just pursue it and

00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:22,269
if you don't know what that means or

00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:24,069
what that means specifically to you just

00:07:22,269 --> 00:07:26,289
try to be inspired by people surrounding

00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:28,089
you and if you're not in an environment

00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:30,279
where there's too many inspiring people

00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:32,619
just go where the action is and let's

00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:34,389
make it very tangible here in our little

00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:36,159
setting we are in the PHP community a

00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:38,349
lot of the inspiration I got to do what

00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:40,209
I wanted to do came from people in this

00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:42,369
very community some even sitting in this

00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:44,919
very room so my advice would be if you

00:07:42,369 --> 00:07:46,719
are not fully embedded in the PHP

00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:48,099
community why not take a look and I'm

00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:49,479
talking about the typical community

00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:51,629
kumbaya that we're hearing a lot of

00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:54,039
cases I'm talking about real help real

00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:56,019
inspiration and real plants and a lot of

00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:58,179
it came from it because my main source

00:07:56,019 --> 00:07:59,889
of inspiration in the PHP community was

00:07:58,179 --> 00:08:02,259
by attending my very first conference

00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:03,969
back in 2007 in Germany international

00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:06,189
PHP conference and it was right there

00:08:03,969 --> 00:08:07,989
right then that I a knew I wanted to be

00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:09,789
in this community and B I knew

00:08:07,989 --> 00:08:11,499
eventually I would like to be a speaker

00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:13,869
but back in the day no one would give me

00:08:11,499 --> 00:08:16,719
a shot but when I started out in my job

00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:19,659
I took inspiration from our leadership

00:08:16,719 --> 00:08:21,639
from our management really top people

00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:23,139
and one of the main things they taught

00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:25,149
me and you will not like this you will

00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:27,309
absolutely not like this the thing I was

00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:28,869
taught in a good way is to be commercial

00:08:27,309 --> 00:08:30,159
now if I look at you I know we'll do

00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:32,229
that right now I'm gonna scan the room

00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:33,639
you don't seem too enthusiastic about

00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:35,829
being commercial if I would tell you

00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:39,430
that one of your priorities is to be

00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:40,930
commercial you'd be like whatever we're

00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:42,490
not sales people developers or

00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:44,889
seasonings or project managers whatever

00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:47,110
now I have to tell you in all walks of

00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:48,610
life in every aspect of life you need to

00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,350
be a bit commercial and being commercial

00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,880
is not being a sneaky salesperson that

00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:53,470
grabs money from people's pockets I'm

00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,210
talking about there

00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:57,130
a sales aspect of transactional aspect

00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:59,080
to some items in life but also a

00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:00,310
marketing and a branding and a PR aspect

00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,920
you have to sell yourself you have to

00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:04,030
display your passion but if you're

00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,320
passionate about something good for you

00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,460
but show the world that you're

00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,860
passionate about something and then

00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:10,480
things will change and I also believe

00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:13,270
that a lot of it has to do with my

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,430
upbringing and it's actually the same

00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:17,950
upbringing as my CEO apparently both our

00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:21,760
mothers run a sort of small mom-and-pop

00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:23,530
shop in terms of organic food so my mom

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,850
has an organic food store my CEOs mom

00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:28,180
has an organic food store and we're

00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:29,620
discussing this like how we were raised

00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,880
in this kind of environment and I'm

00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,410
gonna show you a little video this is

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,210
little town in the community where I

00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:37,090
grew up this is how you enter my mom's

00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:39,100
store this is also the pathway to the

00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,420
house so if you enter you turn the

00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,820
corner and there's the door to the

00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,440
living room and whenever I would have to

00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,360
enter like there's a person coming in my

00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,040
mom says hi this is my mom whenever I

00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,870
would pass I would say hi to the people

00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,370
as well that would be my job I was

00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:53,080
raised as a as a three-year-old boy

00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:56,740
whenever someone would walk in this

00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:58,990
store to say hi and represent the brand

00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,610
that brand was my mom's store but in

00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:02,500
whatever you do you don't have to rep

00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:04,510
your brand as well and not saying that

00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,560
you should be the main ambassador for

00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,940
the company you work for

00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,980
but whatever brand you want to represent

00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,340
primarily your own brand your personal

00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,770
brand

00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:13,060
I was also taught that when my mom

00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:14,650
wouldn't be available to pick up the

00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,940
phone I would pick up the phone and

00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,890
represent the brand and welcome to

00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,170
people and it's actually all about that

00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:21,550
honest one-to-one relationship when

00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:24,100
we're in business we talk about business

00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:26,110
to customer business to business I'm

00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,210
just talking about human to human in all

00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:29,590
aspects of what you're doing you're

00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,180
gonna have to interact with humans and

00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,800
you're gonna have to convince them that

00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,990
you are trustworthy and that you can

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,490
provide value so yes

00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:39,280
you're probably gonna have to be

00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:41,470
commercial in a way but it's beneficial

00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,030
to yourself so think about what you're

00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,710
passionate about think about an

00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:46,570
opportunity that another person can give

00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:48,970
you figure out what they honestly need

00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:50,620
and try to build up an honest long-term

00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:53,320
relationship and that will benefit you

00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:55,480
that's one of these aspects another one

00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,360
is this picture it's a story about

00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,880
belief I took a city trip to this fairy

00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,830
city in 2014 who can guess the city it

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,340
is not San Francisco this bridge is not

00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,340
the Golden Gate Bridge

00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:11,520
close enough Derick Lisbon this is

00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:14,130
Lisbon and I took a trip there with my

00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,560
wife and a couple that were friends with

00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:18,150
and were about to travel to Lisbon just

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,360
have a nice time out and the day before

00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:22,650
I left I saw this on my Facebook

00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,910
Timeline apparently The Rolling Stones

00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:25,440
are one of my favorite bands it's the

00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:27,390
first concert I saw when it was 11 years

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,860
old my dad took me and I know this that

00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:31,530
they would be playing that same day I

00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,820
would be there so I'm like yes okay this

00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:34,770
needs to happen I need tickets for this

00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,740
concert so I contacted my friend Daniel

00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:39,240
in Lisbon and asked Daniel can you fix

00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,430
me tickets for this lovely concert I

00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,050
need to be there it's like whoa hold it

00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,730
this concert has been sold out for

00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:47,160
months there's no way you can getting in

00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:50,160
this is the concert of the year you will

00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,780
now get tickets I said okay fine and we

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,430
did our city trippin thing the first day

00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,930
the ladies were dead tired they went to

00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:56,340
bed early and I took my friend Cedric

00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:58,530
and I said you know what let's be

00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:00,150
adventurous we have everything to gain

00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:01,770
and nothing to lose we could just go

00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:03,900
there and try to buy tickets to try to

00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:05,250
get it knowing that the concert is sold

00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,720
out so normally you would say let's not

00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,400
give it a shot because it will not

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,440
succeed we went there and indeed it was

00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,690
sold out and we didn't in the beginning

00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,460
find a way to get in and we used the

00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:16,230
variables that were available one of the

00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:18,110
variables was that we saw some young

00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:21,660
people trying to buy and sell tickets

00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:23,460
buying for 20 selling for 100-200

00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,800
whatever also knew that the retail price

00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:27,540
for this concert was 78 euros so we made

00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,270
sure we had 78 euros in our pocket and

00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:33,060
we decided not to go over that budget

00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:36,120
and we started running around talking to

00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:39,330
people and our main enemy and our main

00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,340
friend was the factor time as long if we

00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:43,500
waited a long time our chances of

00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:45,810
getting tickets but reduce but as time

00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,880
progressed people selling tickets were

00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:50,430
in risk as well because those would be

00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,740
worthless 15 minutes before showtime we

00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:55,950
saw a couple trying to sell us or trying

00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,720
to get rid of tickets at an ridiculous

00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:59,820
rate and we approached them and we're

00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,380
very aggressive that was the only way

00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,180
time was running out and said you know

00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,770
what sells this tickets we're gonna get

00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,550
it no no you're too aggressive or not

00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:08,940
selling him to you

00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:10,500
we saw them to those kids I said I hate

00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,580
to break it to you but they only have 20

00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,860
euros in their pocket and they're gonna

00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:15,450
sell it for 100 I took the money from my

00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,310
pocket my friend who we showed them the

00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:19,170
money and said you know what sell us

00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,529
this tickets because if you don't in the

00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,660
next

00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:23,189
fifteen minutes this nice ticket you

00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,839
have will not be nothing more than a

00:13:23,189 --> 00:13:26,610
sheet of paper that you can wipe her ass

00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:29,610
with I put it like that and then they

00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:31,350
did and yeah sorry yeah he's a bit of

00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:33,899
profanity right there and we went into

00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:38,129
the show and we were in and there was a

00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:41,069
big surprise for me Bruce Springsteen

00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:43,110
was even there like how can you figure

00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:45,689
that out in advance it was one of the

00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:47,730
best concerts I've ever attended and it

00:13:45,689 --> 00:13:49,350
was based on the fact that I believed I

00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:50,850
would get in there in a sold-out concert

00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,680
is this the biggest accomplishment of

00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:54,209
our life by far not but it's a great

00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,579
story I will keep telling it and it's a

00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:58,529
story about believing that things will

00:13:56,579 --> 00:14:01,230
happen you know what if it didn't happen

00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:02,790
I wouldn't have not lost anything it

00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:05,759
would have been a great story trying to

00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:08,399
get in the concert but I tried and that

00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:10,529
was a good one so if you see an

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,269
opportunity and you believe against

00:14:10,529 --> 00:14:15,600
better judgement or advice just go for

00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:16,740
it you'll see what happens okay next

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,199
variable is empathy

00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:22,319
you should deploy it as much as you can

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:24,149
I for that matter used to have a hard

00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:26,850
time being empathetic towards other

00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:28,889
people I used to be thinking that

00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:32,100
everyone every single individual was

00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:34,470
mentally wired the same way and I become

00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,759
became more empathetic not by realising

00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:39,209
that I should be but by learning it the

00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:40,949
hard way I've organised events where I

00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:42,300
made sure things were arranged in a

00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:44,490
certain way and people did not like it

00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,559
and I thought they just didn't like it

00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:48,269
but they felt anxiety over certain

00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:51,569
situations or they weren't comfortable

00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:53,850
and I quickly learned aid that I should

00:14:51,569 --> 00:14:56,189
deploy as much empathy as I can it will

00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:58,230
help me the few certain situations but

00:14:56,189 --> 00:15:00,059
what is equally important is that you

00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,949
should not expect that it comes back to

00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:04,199
you you should not expect that people

00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:06,209
will have empathy for you because if you

00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:07,410
do in all circumstances in all

00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:09,839
situations you'll get rather

00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:11,790
disappointed so what I would say is be

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,470
nice to people respect them see where

00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:15,600
they're coming from but don't expect it

00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:18,209
to come back at you and when it doesn't

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,790
come back this is a controversial one

00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:22,230
please don't complain complaining is the

00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,939
worst thing you can do in these

00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:25,379
situations and people usually don't

00:15:23,939 --> 00:15:27,420
listen to other people who complain I

00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:29,370
know this is controversial but I need to

00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:32,009
put it in the right context standing up

00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:33,370
for what you believe coming out of an

00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:34,900
unjust situation and try

00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,880
correct that is not complaining

00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,980
complaining is just sitting there and

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,529
saying this opportunity didn't come to

00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,300
me and it was my turn and the sense of

00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:44,500
entitlement please do not complain

00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:47,050
there's true ways you could deal with

00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,790
these kinds of situations so there's a

00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:52,350
situation you do not like either you

00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:55,540
change the situation or if you feel that

00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:57,940
doesn't require too much effort or

00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:00,010
you're you're fine with the situation as

00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,870
this or you don't want to put too much

00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:03,670
mental energy in it just leave it as is

00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:06,760
and otherwise door number three is just

00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:08,260
to circumvent and adapt yourself some

00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,240
things you will not change please don't

00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:14,200
complain about them find another way or

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,660
accept it don't complain and if you

00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,550
complain about opportunities not coming

00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,300
your way you should realize what had

00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:21,970
happened and here's another

00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:25,270
controversial one is maybe you did not

00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:26,650
work hard enough for it why is this

00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:29,020
controversial because people think oh

00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:30,730
you're promoting 16 hour work days and

00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:33,250
you're not considering burnout and

00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:35,140
mental health issues I am but I'm just

00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,690
putting it out there that everything you

00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:40,000
will probably do is based on your talent

00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:42,040
and executing that talent and putting in

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,870
the hard work there's no denying it

00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,700
there's no other way I know that talent

00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:47,830
is an accelerator talent can accelerate

00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:50,050
the process but still you have to put in

00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:51,730
the work now again I'm not saying you

00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,470
should put in 16 hour work days and I'm

00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:55,570
not promoting reaching a point of

00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:58,330
burnout what I am saying is that it's

00:16:55,570 --> 00:17:00,220
just sort of total sum of parts a tally

00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:02,050
the more you add on it the more it takes

00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,820
a certain shape and the more it turns

00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:04,449
into something you can wheel and use to

00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,550
your advantage

00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:08,740
I'm not a person who's willing to work

00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:10,179
16 hours a day I have a family I like

00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,920
picking up my kids from school I like

00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:13,689
playing with my kids I like going out

00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,670
the football games with my mates I like

00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:17,530
hanging out with my wife I like to do

00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:20,980
all those things but whenever something

00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:22,179
happens and I didn't come my way I just

00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:24,699
look at myself and I know

00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:26,589
hey I didn't work hard enough and the

00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:28,960
only thing you can have then in that

00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:31,600
situation is more patience if you don't

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,770
want to work that hard just be more

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,350
patient and I'm willing to be more

00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:36,970
patient back in the day I wasn't that

00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:39,610
patient I saw things passing by I

00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:42,730
thought yes now it's my time and it just

00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:44,470
passes by and I didn't get it and at

00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:46,390
first I was a bit frustrated and I

00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,990
started complaining but I knew no one

00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:49,090
was listening

00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:50,350
No why would anyone listen to someone's

00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:52,299
complaining without having valid

00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:53,770
arguments and I knew I didn't work hard

00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:55,929
enough for it and that was absolutely

00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,370
fine and that's an important message it

00:17:55,929 --> 00:17:59,289
can be absolutely fine

00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:01,990
as long as you have the patience and I

00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:02,260
know in some circumstances you look to

00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,789
the right

00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,260
you see your laptop was like okay we can

00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:06,909
do a project there you look to the left

00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:09,159
you see your couch a bag a crisp plain

00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:11,919
your Playstation and it's up to you to

00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:13,419
choose and in many many instances I went

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,120
for the bag of crisps the couch and the

00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:18,010
PlayStation did I regret it no but I did

00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:20,230
realize that hey I'm gonna have to be

00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:22,779
more patient until something comes just

00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:24,520
a reality another reason why probably

00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:26,500
opportunities didn't come your way is

00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:29,289
because you lacked a bit of

00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:31,630
self-awareness let's go back to my case

00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:34,929
I suck at Matt's I'm not that good at

00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:36,580
logical reasoning in say I'm not really

00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:38,289
a good developer right you would think

00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,779
that that would suit me and in the

00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:42,669
context I was working at as a support

00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:44,350
engineer eventually I got promoted to be

00:18:42,669 --> 00:18:45,640
the manager of that department and I had

00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:47,080
to do other things I have to do people

00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,640
management I have to take care of the

00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,039
planning and all that kind of stuff and

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,330
I noticed that I wasn't too good at that

00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:54,039
and I knew what was doing my job all

00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:56,020
right clients were happy but I saw an

00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:57,880
increasing sense of frustration with my

00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,710
co-workers who said yeah okay the

00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:02,409
clients are happy too we're not all too

00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:05,260
happy and the natural reaction would be

00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:08,950
I need to improve those skills but if

00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:10,390
you look down deep inside I knew I was

00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:12,190
never gonna reach a level where that

00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:13,539
would be acceptable and I noticed that

00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:16,240
some of these skills were present in my

00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:17,860
team so I talked to management and

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,570
actually stepped down and did something

00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,669
else and someone from my team got

00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:25,149
promoted and led the team and did it

00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:27,010
fine I wanted to help people I wanted to

00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:29,440
use my communication skills and I wanted

00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:31,510
to embed tech and instead of doing this

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:35,919
on this one-to-one basis I had the

00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:37,179
fortunate enough also a lot of credit

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,010
goes to the community because I was

00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:41,350
inspired by PHP communities while I was

00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:43,330
working as a as a manager for a support

00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:44,919
department I was already hanging around

00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:47,260
in the community and I was already doing

00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:48,610
a tiny bit of speaking so I was it sat

00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:50,320
down with management and they said you

00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:52,240
know what instead of being a support

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,909
engineer why don't you just become an

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,590
evangelist we need someone who carries

00:19:54,909 --> 00:19:58,299
out the message it's the same deal use

00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:59,900
communication skills you use tech skills

00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:01,970
help people but in the broad

00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,590
way and that I did so if you're in a

00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:06,230
position you're not comfortable in and

00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:08,600
you want to improve just think can I

00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:10,250
genuinely improve those weaknesses and

00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,810
if you can't just think about what

00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:14,090
you're passionate about think about what

00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:16,400
you're good at and try to find a way to

00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:17,660
do that that would be one major point

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,820
advice and if you're doing that and

00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:21,320
you're feeling sure because there's this

00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:23,660
thing called the impostor syndrome we

00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:26,570
all notice right everyone has that I had

00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:28,190
that like 20 minutes ago like am I am I

00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:31,070
good here can I stand up on this stage

00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:33,290
can I address you it is very real but

00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:35,720
what I also learned is that you should

00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:38,780
always act like you belong there

00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,580
at every single point you should have

00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:42,170
the confidence to stand there and if you

00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:45,830
don't you know what will help you and it

00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:48,200
sure helped me last year I was there

00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:50,120
behind the corner to the speakers and

00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,920
the keynote speakers for last year's

00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,510
edition were sitting there and these are

00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,400
people that I highly respect that I

00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:57,530
consider friends and that I know will do

00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,900
an excellent job and it was still

00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:01,160
stressing out and I was trying to have

00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,380
small talk with them they said no no

00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:05,030
right now I need to prep this I'm not

00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:07,100
sure if this will work and that was my

00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:09,890
moment like okay when these people are

00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:11,690
nervous and I considered him put them in

00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:14,210
high regard you know I'll be fine

00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:15,770
and I use that as a mindset like

00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:18,020
whenever I walk into a situation I

00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:19,520
realize that the people who are pulling

00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:22,220
the strings or running the show might be

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,900
just as nervous as you are so just act

00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,700
like you belong there it'll be fine

00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,700
I'm not saying fake it till you make it

00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:31,130
because that's also an angle of this but

00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:32,750
you're good at what you do you should

00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,980
believe in yourself because if you're

00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,870
passionate about something and you've

00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:38,120
spent a lot of time working your skill

00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:40,730
you'll be fine there's a lot of stalkers

00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,680
out there I'm a talker but there's doers

00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:44,660
in there as well and you just have to

00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:48,770
show a bit more confidence and I'm 100%

00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:51,230
sure that you will be fine now there's

00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:52,670
also some elements you need to be

00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:54,740
comfortable with and yet you need to

00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:56,990
respect it was always my hope to become

00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:58,280
a speaker and in the beginning people

00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:00,260
didn't really care about me they didn't

00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:03,110
know me I never got selected for any PHP

00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:04,630
conferences and maybe there's organizers

00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:07,310
in the room who sent me the Dear John

00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:09,020
letters saying well it always starts

00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:10,190
like that we had an incredible amount of

00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,559
submissions then you know you're not

00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:14,559
select maybe

00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:16,809
we had so many no you're not I just stop

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,999
really okay I'm part of it and it led to

00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:21,580
a bit of frustration but by working it

00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:23,139
hard I managed to get my first shop and

00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:24,370
then took that one to the next level in

00:22:23,139 --> 00:22:27,100
the next level and just built on that

00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:29,529
and just grind it out hard work not

00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:31,720
working 16 hours a day is just a long

00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:33,340
period of time being patient it will

00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,730
happen it will happen work it work it

00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,019
work it

00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:37,749
and I grasped onto that single

00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:39,309
opportunity and as time progressed I got

00:22:37,749 --> 00:22:40,480
invited to more events and then I

00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:42,490
realized there's the thing called the

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,649
process and you should always keep your

00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:46,840
eyes on that target the process is the

00:22:44,649 --> 00:22:49,119
most important thing what is it that I

00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:53,289
like I like speaking so what do I do I

00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:55,450
speak this size rooms small rooms it

00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:59,019
does not matter you also have the

00:22:55,450 --> 00:23:01,679
outcome the outcome is like my initial

00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:04,690
outcome was I want to do a keynote here

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,580
I am is this the outcome not really I

00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:07,690
like it I'm really like if I look in the

00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,249
room I'm really happy that all these

00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:11,110
people took the time out of their really

00:23:09,249 --> 00:23:12,309
busy schedules to be here but that's not

00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:14,679
the outcome you have to push the

00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:17,320
boundaries because what was okay what

00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:19,629
was cool yesterday probably be just as

00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:22,509
normal tomorrow so you evolve you'll

00:23:19,629 --> 00:23:24,909
level up but don't put these things as

00:23:22,509 --> 00:23:26,559
the outcome because otherwise you'll get

00:23:24,909 --> 00:23:29,080
really on the board but what is more

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,700
important is to acknowledge certain

00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,590
things that happen as side effects as

00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,389
you become more successful

00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:37,230
I'm not saying you'll become a diva but

00:23:34,389 --> 00:23:40,389
some things you you experience as normal

00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:42,399
if I would experience this size room as

00:23:40,389 --> 00:23:45,429
normal I would be disappointed if it was

00:23:42,399 --> 00:23:46,659
only 50% capacity and that's important

00:23:45,429 --> 00:23:48,490
you have to think about what your

00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:50,169
process is my process is speaking so if

00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:51,759
there were only one person in this room

00:23:50,169 --> 00:23:53,499
if it's only James in this room I'd be

00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:56,559
perfectly fine because that's what I do

00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:58,840
I speak that's all I do and I work hard

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,610
and everything that happens I consider

00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,379
as a side effect and as a bonus and if

00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:05,409
you respect that you'll be fine and you

00:24:02,379 --> 00:24:07,990
can just have to grind it out to lots of

00:24:05,409 --> 00:24:09,960
it I think this is my I've done more

00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:12,850
than 200 presentations in 15 countries

00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:15,009
over a period of a decade and at first I

00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:16,240
never thought I would be on this stage I

00:24:15,009 --> 00:24:18,850
never thought anyone would be interested

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,179
my main concern was what I'm gonna say

00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:23,350
what I'm gonna talk about what will be

00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:25,110
interesting to people I had no clue but

00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:26,549
you know what I ignored that and I

00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,869
did the meetup scene and the

00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:29,489
unconference scene and eventually it

00:24:27,869 --> 00:24:30,809
came now apply that to your own life

00:24:29,489 --> 00:24:32,669
maybe you don't want to be a speaker

00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:34,529
maybe have something else in life that

00:24:32,669 --> 00:24:37,230
you want to achieve but still go for it

00:24:34,529 --> 00:24:39,570
now we're almost reaching the end here

00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:46,230
and I have this weird piece of advice

00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:57,960
check this out every time an opportunity

00:24:46,230 --> 00:25:00,029
presents itself sometimes you just have

00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,710
to say yes there's some really rear

00:25:00,029 --> 00:25:03,480
double communities opportunities that

00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:05,489
make no sense maybe from a financial

00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,739
point of view from a career point of

00:25:05,489 --> 00:25:09,600
view from a Content point of view but

00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:11,190
they just make you feel happy or it

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,989
sounds crazy and you want to give it a

00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:16,139
go an adventure I've had some of these

00:25:12,989 --> 00:25:18,269
and they turn out really well this is a

00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:20,399
place in Poland called Mohawk it's a

00:25:18,269 --> 00:25:21,929
copy to me apparently it's as you can

00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:23,519
see in the middle of nowhere and that is

00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:25,580
where a couple of years ago PHP con

00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:27,869
Poland was hosted now I was at another

00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:30,989
developer event in Poland and after my

00:25:27,869 --> 00:25:32,249
talk a guy came up to me Darius I still

00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:34,259
see him every now and then and he

00:25:32,249 --> 00:25:36,119
presented himself and asked me for my

00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:37,409
details I gave him a business card he

00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:38,909
said you know what you should speak at

00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:41,940
my event I'm like yeah whatever

00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:43,710
and time went by and a couple months

00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,480
later I receive an email from him saying

00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:49,200
all right we want you to speak at our

00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:52,529
event and if you agree you have to fly

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,359
to Krakow a guy will be there in a car

00:25:52,529 --> 00:25:56,009
yeah they really figure be Eastern

00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:58,710
European accent we say guy will be there

00:25:56,009 --> 00:26:00,509
in car no disrespect no stereotypes but

00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:02,549
someone would there be there to pick me

00:26:00,509 --> 00:26:05,730
up and we drive me three hours in the

00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:08,340
months middle of nowhere like what could

00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:10,350
go wrong right what could what could

00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,700
possibly go wrong I said you know what

00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:13,739
I'm gonna do it I'm gonna take you up on

00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:16,799
it I flew to Krakow and guy was there

00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:18,090
with car it was actually three guys in a

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,909
car and they drove me down the

00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:23,279
countryside and three hours wonderful we

00:26:20,909 --> 00:26:26,570
even had pancakes and a restaurant that

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:29,070
had meeting music and dinosaurs outside

00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:30,450
really weird from the get-go but it was

00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:32,460
actually really good event and it was

00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:33,539
very secluded when I was looking this is

00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,279
the hotel as well when I was looking

00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:36,570
there was nothing around me there was no

00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,670
distractions there were only those

00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:39,710
people I had to

00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:41,630
best time and you know what I got to

00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:43,430
know a person there another speaker

00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:45,140
called Jeffery a McGuire Jam as we call

00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:47,570
him he's a big deal in the Drupal scene

00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:50,210
and because of that event I got to know

00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:51,710
him and he helped me get into the Drupal

00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:54,080
scene because that was a place where I

00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:55,280
also wanted to evangelize and I never

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,380
got the shop I never got the opportunity

00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,750
but weirdly enough by saying yes to this

00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:00,980
I became friends with him and also

00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:02,390
because of this I could tell this story

00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:04,430
right here right now so that's also a

00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:06,260
plus but I said just said yes to

00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:08,210
something and it turned out all right I

00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:09,950
have another thing I said yes to I'm

00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:11,450
also a football fan I'm a season ticket

00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:13,310
holder at a Belgian football team called

00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:15,680
creeper and with a bunch of friends

00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:18,020
we've been going for years and because

00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:21,290
of YouTube vlogs and especially Casey

00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:25,540
nice that the guy I love watching I said

00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:27,140
maybe we should vlog in football game

00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:29,000
that won't work

00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:31,400
and we started doing it we named our

00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,350
brand FCB support and we just started

00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,880
and I know like you will probably be

00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:36,320
watching this or whatever you I'm saying

00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,140
you'll probably won't listen to you but

00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:42,800
still we we started taking our our cam

00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:47,120
to the football games and tried to do an

00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:48,890
honest representation we are fans we

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,530
represent the world of defense not a

00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:53,000
highly produced very sterile content

00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:54,410
that the team itself produces but

00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,140
something honest this is mimicking my

00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:58,700
son and this is all honest content and I

00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:00,020
noticed that in the beginning not a lot

00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,580
of people were watching it but after a

00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,780
while a couple of hundreds started

00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,250
watching it a couple of thousands

00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,720
started watching it and I noticed the

00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:07,730
immediate impact while I was in the

00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,770
stadium every time I go to the stadium

00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:11,900
now and I go every two weeks people

00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:14,090
approach me people talk to me I got a

00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,440
couple of messages my team is playing an

00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:17,300
away game in Salzburg tonight

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,490
are you coming taste no I'm in London I

00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:21,170
can't so all of a sudden we created

00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:23,000
something that people like and we're not

00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:24,560
rock stars in any shape or form or very

00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,450
approachable and we'd like to put it low

00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:28,250
threshold it's about two people but what

00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:30,650
we know is that stuff makes me happy

00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:32,960
that stuff makes the people happy I know

00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:35,510
what I'm gonna keep doing it and is this

00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,240
success does this qualify as success in

00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:39,920
my book it does do I get financial gains

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,690
from it no it costs me more money more

00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:43,430
time and more frustration from my wife

00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:45,200
the more I do it but you know what it

00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:47,840
feels right and eventually something

00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,090
will happen and what did happen is that

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,140
I managed to get in touch with the team

00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:52,250
and the team

00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,900
knowledge that we were doing a good job

00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:56,330
and we could interview players every now

00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:57,500
and then we had this nice settings here

00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:59,360
and every now and then we end up in the

00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,700
newspaper is this the process and the

00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,830
outcome no this is a side effect because

00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,930
eventually it's all about people and

00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:08,090
that's the focus talking to people

00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:09,710
getting the high fives people seeing the

00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:11,360
camera coming up to us put in a

00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:13,730
statement knowing that it's honest

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,290
content and I'm feel very happy about

00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:18,280
this is this the biggest accomplishment

00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:21,350
in my life no is this success I guess so

00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:23,570
what does the future hold about to wrap

00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:25,930
it up here with my channel I have no

00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:27,980
clue I'll just keep grinding it out

00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,780
professionally I'll probably do the same

00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:31,340
thing and a couple of months ago I would

00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:33,260
say I would just grind it up but things

00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:34,700
have changed in the last couple of

00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:37,490
months for me things I didn't anticipate

00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:39,770
I'm a big fan of technology called

00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:41,330
varnish I do a lot of presentations a

00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:43,460
lot of it has been grinding it out

00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:45,020
talking about caching and a couple of

00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:46,550
years ago I got invited by the company

00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,950
behind the software to write a book

00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:50,750
which was insane I didn't see that one

00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:52,970
coming and it was solely built on just

00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:55,640
grinding it out being out there making

00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:57,830
videos and a couple months ago they

00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:01,700
asked me to join them and that is the

00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:04,220
big change as of March 4th which is two

00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:05,990
weeks I guess I'll be a tech evangelist

00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,560
at varnish and after 15 years of loyal

00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:08,390
service

00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:11,420
I'll be leaving combo in a way still be

00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:14,120
attached so that's the next step is this

00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:17,180
luck well I don't really think so it's

00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:20,690
just am I will I be great at this job I

00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:22,190
don't know I probably be fine but it's

00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:23,450
just a build-up and it's been coming

00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:26,570
I've been working with varnish for a

00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:29,090
decade now just piece by piece by piece

00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:30,980
don't project the outcome the outcome is

00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:32,060
uncertain but the process is cool and

00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:34,250
everything that happens is the side

00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:36,530
effect is this the outcome no it's

00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:38,450
probably a side effect that being said

00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:40,070
thank you go for it by all means if you

00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:43,520
were passionate about something do

00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:45,230
whatever you need to do I hope I'm not

00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,850
sure I don't have the the arrogance of

00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:48,350
saying that I will probably inspire you

00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:50,510
that's probably not the case but just

00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:52,100
listen to what I'm saying here if you're

00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:54,200
passionate about something in your

00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:56,510
professional life in your career family

00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,370
life friendships hobbies sports whatever

00:30:56,510 --> 00:31:02,800
you're doing just go for it you have

00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:02,800
