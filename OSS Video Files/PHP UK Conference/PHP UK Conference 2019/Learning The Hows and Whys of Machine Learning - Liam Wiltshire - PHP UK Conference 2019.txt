Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2019
Description: 
	Since it's founding, Tebex has processed over 18 million payments for games servers around the world. This is a rich data source, and one that we've significantly under-used. We know there should be ways of using this data to improve our product and to make our merchant's lives easier - how and where to start, now that's a totally different question! Join Liam as he shares Tebex's initial experiences in experimenting with machine learning to use past data to prevent fraud in the future - different algorithms we've tried, (many) failed experiments, the situation today and plans for the future.
