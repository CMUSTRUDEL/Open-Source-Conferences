Title: Everything is Awesome - Paul Verbeek Mast - PHP UK Conference 2019
Publication date: 2019-03-22
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2019
Description: 
	ðŸŽµEverything is cool when youâ€™re part of a team!ðŸŽµ

The Lego Movie came out almost 4 years ago, and it taught children everywhere the importance of teamwork. And what teamwork, and working in harmony, actually is. Letâ€™s just hope that those lessons really stick with these kids. Because letâ€™s be honest, weâ€™re making a mess of it.

But itâ€™s not too late for us. We can learn from the Lego Movie as well. Iâ€™ll show you how you can help to make sure everyone feels safe and respected in your team and your company. How you can feel better being the unique person you are within your team. And how you can make your, and everyone elseâ€™s, life more awesome!

	00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:08,790
I wanna start out with to tell you a

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,719
little bit of a story about a job I had

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:15,509
so it was back in 2017 and I just

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,400
switched jobs to find a place that I

00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:19,140
enjoyed a bit more I was working before

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,000
at booking.com and it was a little bit

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:25,109
too big for me so I wanted to switch to

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,330
a startup and five months later I also

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:32,640
left that job so the reason of that was

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,140
a few days before I quit my job I was

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,000
speaking at a different conference it

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:41,100
was one in Germany JavaScript conference

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,379
and I was speaking there and a few of my

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,789
colleagues came along and at one point

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:47,039
during the second day of the conference

00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:52,199
I heard that someone broke the code of

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:53,640
conduct he was I told one of the female

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:56,489
speakers there that with what she was

00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,809
wearing she was asking for it I don't

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:03,030
know what it was but it's probably not

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:06,240
something good so later I heard that

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,100
that person was my boss it was something

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,250
I did not expect from him because he was

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:17,490
very friendly and very talking about

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:19,770
diversity and everything so when the

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:24,210
crew of that conference tried to speak

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:26,759
to him he became very angry and he told

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,320
the crew that's then that the next time

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,960
the next year he would be on that stage

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:36,150
and talk to them about what equality

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:38,960
really means that's ok yes it's supposed

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,460
to be black I just have my nose here and

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,820
so I didn't speak to him at the

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,439
conference anymore so all the all the

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,960
things that I heard was from someone

00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,509
else but he did leave some messages on

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,220
our our company's whatsapp group because

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,770
he didn't believe in slack so he just

00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:59,579
did what's up but that's all the things

00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:01,409
that he said corroborated the story so a

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:04,680
female colleague of mine decided to

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,880
speak to him the Monday after but we

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,979
actually already knew what we wanted to

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,810
do so we already wrote our letter of

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:12,390
resignation

00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:14,660
but even after speaking to him the story

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:19,260
only became worse and worse

00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:22,230
so to him equality meant that everybody

00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:24,390
would be exactly the same as him that

00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:26,640
you leave your beliefs and religions

00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:29,250
outside of your of the office and be

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,570
completely neutral because that is what

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:35,190
he believed that he was completely

00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:37,260
neutral so as a lot of people might have

00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,550
done in our situation he said we left

00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,740
that job

00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:47,910
and luckily about we found something

00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:49,680
else pretty quickly and this isn't the

00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:53,250
first time that I left my job because of

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,920
the atmosphere or because my colleagues

00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:58,350
or because I didn't really feel part of

00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,860
the company I actually rarely left the

00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:03,330
job because I didn't like to work and I

00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,680
think that happens to a lot of people in

00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:08,010
tech even if they don't really realize

00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,230
it people are switching jobs constantly

00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:12,900
and they don't feel welcomed within the

00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:15,390
within their environment they feel

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:20,850
excluded or maybe even worse our bullies

00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:23,190
or arrest but for me keep switching jobs

00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:25,380
I don't think it's gonna solve any

00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,180
problems and I want to try to make it

00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,550
better I want to try to make it awesome

00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,360
for everyone so this is the talk of my

00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,360
the topic of my presentation

00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,620
it's I cannot do anything more than that

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:44,310
because otherwise the YouTube gods will

00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:45,900
block the talk so I'm a senior software

00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,460
engineer at confirmed that means

00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,900
something completely different to meet

00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:52,170
and it probably does for you because I

00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:58,110
am a front-end developer I'm also a

00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:59,640
designer sort of I've been doing

00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,080
development for about twelve years now

00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,300
and I've worked at a bunch of different

00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,820
companies and I've seen good and bad

00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:08,850
examples of teamwork and inclusivity but

00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:10,620
mostly a lot of bad examples and I

00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:13,290
decided to take these experiences that I

00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:17,220
have and see what I can do to avoid

00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:24,960
falling into the same patterns and to

00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:27,090
find ways to improve it in the 1950s a

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,890
journalist's flow image wide said the

00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,900
great enemy of communication we find is

00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:32,810
the illusion of it and what he meant by

00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:36,060
it is that people have tried to improve

00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:38,100
communication in the workforce and they

00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,920
tried to find a way to show that it has

00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:43,170
improved they documented whatever was

00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,850
said in meetings and they tried to make

00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:48,000
sure that everyone was in the loop of

00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:49,710
everything but he realized that that is

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,040
just an illusion it's sort of a paper

00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:55,140
trail of fake improvements then he also

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,250
said we have not talked enough we have

00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,190
talked enough but I've not actually

00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,630
listened and especially we haven't

00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:04,260
listened to those people that need

00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:06,360
understanding our problems with

00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,890
listening to each other and our lack of

00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,960
compassion and our inability of

00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:12,140
understanding isn't just caused by lack

00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:15,180
of communication and the work for I

00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:17,730
study of by the Harvard Business Review

00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:21,240
show that many leaders assume that they

00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:22,320
are valuing diversity there they assume

00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,270
that they are better at valuing

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,770
diversity than they actually are they

00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:28,650
think that they think that they fail you

00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:31,890
diversity and inclusivity well a lot of

00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:34,050
them are solely using diversity to get

00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:35,670
recognition themselves so to show the

00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,280
outside world how diverse they actually

00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:39,990
are so I'm saying the great enemy of

00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:44,220
inclusivity we find is the illusion of

00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:45,930
it because it's not that hard to count

00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,560
the percentage of women or people of

00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,050
color in your

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,610
organization but just showing data about

00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,110
hiring and promoting that first

00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,020
candidates it doesn't make your company

00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,520
the most welcoming for the people there

00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,590
it's more about building a climate of

00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,780
trust and appreciation and also openness

00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:03,870
to differences in thought styles and

00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:05,840
backgrounds now most of you here are

00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:07,950
probably not managers at big companies

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,900
so you might think that you have little

00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:14,100
influence in the inclusivity of your

00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:17,910
company but you are part of the company

00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:19,530
and you can be a co-worker who's

00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:23,040
welcoming and make sure that everyone

00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:24,690
feels included but before I start

00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,160
telling you how you can do that I want

00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:28,830
to take a little bit of step back and

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,750
see how the culture we have it now how

00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:35,310
it became that way because in the

00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:37,440
beginning of computer computer science

00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:39,120
men focused a lot on building Hardware

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,669
well women pioneered software

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,729
development and argue lead one of the

00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:49,290
most famous software pioneers is Grace

00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:51,630
Hopper she programs in 1944 to mark one

00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:54,960
which was a supercomputer at Harford's

00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:57,510
that helped design the atomic bombs so

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,760
great hopper had an amazing ability to

00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:02,160
just take problems and turn those into

00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:08,400
mathematical equations and then turn

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:10,470
that into machine language in 1945 the

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,530
US Army created this computer it was

00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:17,039
designed to calculate trajectories or

00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:18,630
the director sorry English is not my

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,850
native language there's some words a

00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:23,130
little bit hard for me so it was

00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:25,550
designed to calculate trajectories of

00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:29,160
weapons used by soldiers on the fields

00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:33,419
six women created and programs this

00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:35,760
computer because those six women were

00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:37,979
already doing the same calculations many

00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:40,650
early it was easier for them to program

00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:42,539
it as well but when this computer was

00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:44,760
introduced by the press there these

00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:46,710
women's were almost not photographs or

00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,510
even mentions this was the only photo

00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:52,110
that was shown in the press with two

00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:56,690
women in it and they actually look here

00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:56,690
more like telephone operators

00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:04,200
and in 1960s the computer industry was

00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:07,380
growing and getting more lucrative and

00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,580
it was so lucrative that in 1967 the

00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:11,520
editor-in-chief of The Cosmopolitan

00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:13,050
decides to tell their readers about the

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,840
healthy salary woman will get in this

00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:18,060
line of work and alongside it had photos

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,000
of Anne Richardson here who was a

00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:24,630
systems I've been an IBM systems

00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,820
engineer she was wearing a sporty dress

00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:28,980
and burly earrings and that way she

00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:34,020
wanted to tell everyone that's it was a

00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:35,700
job any woman could do auto start the

00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:39,360
article starts out with telling the

00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:42,719
reader said a girl senior system analyst

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,160
gets twenty thousand dollars and up now

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,450
in today's money that's about one

00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:49,620
hundred and fifty thousand dollars a

00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:52,860
year so if you compare that to a salary

00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:55,110
of a female secretary in New York which

00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:58,080
was back then a relatively high paying

00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,580
job in a very high-paying City the

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,530
average for that was about fifty two

00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:04,820
hundred a year so you could make almost

00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:06,960
four times as much as being a programmer

00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,600
it also had a quote from Grace Hopper

00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:12,600
and she said it's just like planning

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,160
dinner it is something that she said

00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,460
women are expert at because they have

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,560
patience and attention to detail

00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:23,700
great opposites women are Naturals at

00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:25,770
computer programming at wages they were

00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,450
so extremely high because there were not

00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:29,340
enough programmers to fill these open

00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:33,420
jobs but at the same time the industry

00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:34,920
also started to shut women out so

00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,410
companies were desperate to find new

00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,620
programmers and recruiters began to

00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:42,690
become working to find the skills and

00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,480
personality that was needed to become a

00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:47,370
good programmer and at the same time

00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,930
salaries went up and per worker

00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,660
programming get was getting a better

00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:53,730
status in beginning it was seen as a

00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,920
typist job but now it was becoming what

00:09:53,730 --> 00:10:00,060
they called a professional job which was

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,980
back then something masculine and

00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:06,150
companies were using the IBM aptitude

00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:10,010
test that's where the test was designed

00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:10,010
to test for problem-solving skills

00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:14,770
but it was easy to cheat on that test

00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,800
people were sharing the questions and

00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:19,810
answers so they thought to start out

00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,660
with personality test something that was

00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:24,640
a little bit harder to cheat and there

00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:27,100
were two mill psychologists William

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,410
cannon and Dallas Perry who Pro felt

00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:32,500
about 1,400 programmers to make a

00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:34,390
vocational interests skill they believed

00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:38,700
that this could predict success in the

00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:42,100
field but only 187 of those were women

00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:45,040
which if you can if you think of it was

00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:49,740
really weird because the male-female

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:52,120
ratio was almost 50/50 back then and

00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:54,070
based on their studies they found it

00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,170
well good programmers are people that

00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:58,120
liked solving puzzles that makes sense

00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:01,720
but they also shared one very specific

00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:05,950
trait program is disliked activities

00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,910
involving close personal interaction now

00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:12,640
you might think that's not something

00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:15,190
really focused on men but people be

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:18,700
we're starting to get selected for being

00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:19,930
antisocial and not just for talent and

00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,300
that was the beginning of the now

00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:25,930
well-known stereotype of this occlusive

00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:27,630
developer but it did favor mill

00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:30,220
programmers more than female programmers

00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:33,000
for example antisocial personality

00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:35,440
disorder favors men by 3 to 1 ratio

00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,020
autism and Asperger's was seen as high

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,000
as seven times more amendment but

00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:41,650
besides that women who have these

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,710
characteristics are often seen as

00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:46,540
someone who doesn't like people or men

00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:49,680
are seen as a lone wolf which is

00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,680
something to be admired

00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:58,840
so in this 2010 book the computer boys

00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:00,370
takeover author Natan s Murray wrote the

00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,960
industry was selected for antisocial

00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:04,090
mathematically inclined Mill's and

00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,740
therefore antisocial and mathematically

00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,970
inclined mills were over-represented in

00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,070
the program population

00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,690
this in turn reinforced a popular

00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:12,940
perception that programmers ought to be

00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:15,790
antisocial and mathematically inclined

00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,200
and therefore mill and once this

00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:19,180
progress got underway

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,439
every room related to computer science

00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:25,629
began to be filled with antisocial men

00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:28,089
so classes conferences labs and

00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:29,889
workplaces and then they became senior

00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:33,069
programmers they became bosses and they

00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:34,899
became teachers and in the 1980s when

00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:37,329
computers became normal to own at home

00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:40,209
it became avoiding something to bond

00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:41,949
with a father and a son and the

00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:43,989
stereotypical nerd was so white white

00:12:41,949 --> 00:12:45,729
spreads mid-eighties movies like Weird

00:12:43,989 --> 00:12:47,919
Science Revenge of the Nerds and war

00:12:45,729 --> 00:12:49,959
games romanticized the awkward geniuses

00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:53,289
who uses tech to win the affection

00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:55,149
affections of attractive women and even

00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:59,609
though popular media didn't create the

00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:59,609
stereotype they definitely reinforced it

00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:05,919
and in the mid-90s there was a startup

00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:08,979
called trilogy has anyone ever heard of

00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:12,399
trilogy it's Joe hence I see one in the

00:13:08,979 --> 00:13:14,519
back that's not a lot okay that's good

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,739
then I have something to tell

00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:20,470
so trilogy was ran by a Stanford dropout

00:13:17,739 --> 00:13:21,999
called Geo Lehman and after getting

00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:24,009
money from his investors for his

00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:26,529
software he had an idea how to hire new

00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:27,699
programmers and that is his idea is

00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:30,039
something that's still visible in

00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:32,409
today's hiring strategies so instead of

00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:34,989
hiring experienced programmers he would

00:13:32,409 --> 00:13:37,569
take talented overachieving students

00:13:34,989 --> 00:13:39,369
direct directly out of graduation the

00:13:37,569 --> 00:13:41,049
ethos of the company was where elite

00:13:39,369 --> 00:13:44,109
talent and its potential and talents

00:13:41,049 --> 00:13:46,029
that experience that has merit basically

00:13:44,109 --> 00:13:50,019
they were looking for they said only the

00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:53,099
best and to get those students they

00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:55,449
passed out laptops and universities and

00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:58,089
hosted extravagant dinners at top

00:13:55,449 --> 00:14:00,399
restaurants in San Francisco and most

00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:03,849
importantly the recruiters were mainly

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:06,389
young good-looking women the reason for

00:14:03,849 --> 00:14:09,429
that is that Joe Lehman had the idea to

00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:16,089
hire women that would never look twice

00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:18,189
at a geeky engineer but once a student

00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:20,169
was interested in working for trilogy

00:14:18,189 --> 00:14:23,019
they had to undergo a series of brain

00:14:20,169 --> 00:14:25,359
teasers and these kind of brain teasers

00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:27,429
might sound very familiar to you they

00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:28,959
would ask them questions like how many

00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:31,329
piano tuners are in the world

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,879
how many golf balls since fit into a

00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:35,860
standard double-decker bus and how much

00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:39,430
would you charge to wash all windows in

00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:43,390
and these are this is a hiring strategy

00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:44,740
that was used by google till 2013 and is

00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:47,800
still being used by a lot of companies

00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:49,090
right now but those questions they have

00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,250
nothing to do with being a good

00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:54,430
programmer these questions are only for

00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:55,780
cultural fit because the company was

00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:57,430
looking for people with extreme

00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:59,500
confidence people that would answer

00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:03,370
answer these questions without any

00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:07,900
actual expertise and the company culture

00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:09,610
was work hard play hard holidays were

00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:12,700
called competitive advantage days

00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:13,600
because no one else was working and at

00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,520
the end of the week

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,920
everybody was so tired they were ready

00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,570
to party and let loose and sometimes

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,670
they would spontaneously hop on a plane

00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:23,650
to Vegas with Lehman himself

00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:26,650
stay up all night and go to casinos and

00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:28,630
strip clubs he expected his employees to

00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:30,000
bet or nothing sometimes even up to tens

00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:32,740
of thousands of dollars at a time

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,200
and he's insane working hours to

00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:38,980
drinking the gambling Vegas strip clubs

00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:41,440
etc and selling potential over expertise

00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:46,060
made the culture very male-dominated it

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:48,430
was completely hostile towards women now

00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:50,410
truly was one of the first among a long

00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:52,390
line of tech startups debts required

00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:55,150
assimilating into a culture of masculine

00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:56,830
arrogance that many people especially

00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:59,890
women might not want to sign up for him

00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:03,930
and in the past 20 years much has

00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:03,930
changed but the bro culture still exists

00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:08,200
two years ago Susan Fowler

00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,360
shared her experience at where she

00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,740
details the sexism and harassment she

00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,920
had faced at the company where she was a

00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:16,570
cyber liability engineer her story where

00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,190
she told how managers and human resource

00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:20,680
department did little to rectify her

00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:22,510
issues showed how high performance high

00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,490
performers were protected when accused

00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:28,750
of harassment and other intolerable

00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:31,690
behavior Susan Fowler kind of brought

00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:33,970
uber to its knees and it ignited a 20-17

00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:35,830
me to campaign and many other women

00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:37,420
including women in upper management at

00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:41,740
big companies shared similar stories of

00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:43,270
harassment and sexism but it's not over

00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,620
yet there's still a lot of work to be

00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:47,550
done to make sure that everyone is

00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,550
treated equally

00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:52,980
now this story has focused a lot on

00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:55,529
women in tech but it's not just the

00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:57,450
women it's also people of color the

00:16:55,529 --> 00:16:59,760
LGBTQIA community people with a

00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,930
disability and people in economic and

00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,580
social hardships who are being

00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:06,740
marginalized and have to undergo a lot

00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:09,420
of harassment and discrimination but

00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:11,910
what's the point of this when I'm saying

00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:15,720
it all I'm talking about this my thing

00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:18,630
is how can you help with that but how by

00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:22,309
just being a better co-worker and also

00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:22,309
what does all this have to do with lego

00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:30,000
nothing sorry a little bit like Oh is

00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:32,580
everything like I has to do without

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,070
being creative but the lego movie itself

00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:38,130
is also a lot about teamwork and about

00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:39,900
how everybody is unique and if you let

00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:41,820
everybody be their unique selves and

00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,610
value each other and believe in yourself

00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,750
as well you can achieve great things

00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:47,640
much more than when everybody just

00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:52,290
follows a set of rules and lives and

00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:54,600
routines and conformity and is equal and

00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:57,330
that is where the idea of this talk came

00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,740
from I wanted to take that idea and see

00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:00,179
how we can put it into practice to

00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:04,800
create a more inclusive and welcoming

00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:06,390
environment so this is actually the sort

00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:11,460
of my talk addresses all very long

00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:13,140
introduction sorry for that so a good

00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:16,520
way to start is to make everyone feel

00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:19,140
welcome and included so onboarding new

00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,940
people it's mostly just as simple to-do

00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:23,460
lists just think about how you would

00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,679
onboard people at your company I think

00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,450
it's a little bit of paperwork you

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,010
probably have some sort of excel sheet

00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:33,480
or something that says what you need to

00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:36,059
do it's as a new person you have to

00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,400
write write down some forms you have to

00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:41,160
do some handshaking for getting

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,660
everyone's name maybe you're meeting

00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,940
with some manager that tells you about

00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:48,620
the mission and vision of the company

00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:52,230
which you probably don't even care about

00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:54,720
but what's being left out here is to

00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:57,510
make you feel like you're actually part

00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,750
of this company and that you as an

00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:01,830
individual feel welcomed

00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:05,100
but it's not just something that you

00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:06,570
actually do with new hires making people

00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,030
feel welcome and included is something

00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:15,000
that is ongoing but it does start out

00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:17,610
with new colleagues when a new hire

00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,710
joins your company or a team try to

00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:22,980
actively include them as much as

00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:25,350
possible because not everybody is gonna

00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:28,560
be comfortable with getting to know new

00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:29,400
people and it's hard for them to reach

00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,530
out themselves

00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,910
so think about your first day at the

00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:37,350
company you're currently working at and

00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:39,330
what you wish people did or told and I

00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:41,730
know that when I started a new job which

00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:43,830
is more often than I actually want to

00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:47,760
admit but look at my LinkedIn profile

00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:50,310
you notice I would I would love to have

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,350
an onboarding buddy something someone

00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:53,610
that just helps me out the first few

00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:56,790
weeks with getting to know the new

00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:58,680
people for me Leslie's new getting to

00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:01,800
know the company culture and how

00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:04,680
everything works someone to make

00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,990
introductions for me and to keep

00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,490
reminding me of everybody's name because

00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:10,260
I'm terrible with names that's why I

00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:12,360
love these name badges it's all of you

00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:16,500
are wearing I hope that everybody would

00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:17,970
do that in company but preferably it

00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:21,300
would also be someone who knows the code

00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:22,710
but that's not extremely important it

00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,110
should be someone who tells me things

00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:28,860
proactively like where to find certain

00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:31,620
documents and how and who to ask for the

00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:34,140
things that I need and someone who

00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:39,270
introduces me to other people at a lunch

00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:42,180
area or something like that but if your

00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:44,730
company doesn't really have onboarding

00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:48,720
buddies or if they do they don't want to

00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:51,870
do this you can still go to the new

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,070
people and just chats for a while it

00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:55,410
could be about anything could be about

00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:58,860
themselves could be about how it's going

00:20:55,410 --> 00:21:00,960
just try to ask what problems they

00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,880
currently have just and take an interest

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,260
in their personal life it makes them

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,300
feel part of the company instead of

00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:08,990
someone who just kind of invaded a tight

00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,990
group of people

00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:13,370
and when someone joins your team

00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:17,210
remember that your whole team dynamic

00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:19,309
changes just think of it as forming an

00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:21,710
entire new team because everybody's

00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:23,720
gonna be communicating differently and

00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:26,270
working together just slightly different

00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,669
so think of what would you do when you

00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:31,340
create a new team and how you would

00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:33,760
handle that so maybe have a lunch

00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:36,530
together do a brainstorm about

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,150
priorities something like that and try

00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:41,630
to make sure that these news new people

00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:45,590
are are feeling like an equal member so

00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:48,140
try to avoid any inside jokes or talk

00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:52,190
about new features in the products that

00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:53,659
you haven't explained to them first and

00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:56,240
don't assume that they will eventually

00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:58,039
learn because that's just going to

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:03,130
exclude them and they will probably

00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:03,130
leave sooner than actually they want to

00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:08,030
so for example of a meeting is coming up

00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,470
where there's gonna be a lot of talk

00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,820
about things that happened in the past

00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:12,919
or things that is going to happen in the

00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,679
future talk to them a little bit

00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:17,000
beforehand and explain what's going on

00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:21,049
not just to make them feel welcome but

00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,270
also that they can be valuable for your

00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:32,150
company from from from the very first

00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:33,860
day so language is a tool that we try we

00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:36,140
used to try and create a common

00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:37,760
understanding it is powerful and is

00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:39,350
essential for creating an environment

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,440
where everyone feels welcome and

00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:44,299
included but it's sadly also used to

00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:48,320
leave people out to discriminate or

00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:50,270
marginalized and this has been done for

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,130
so long it's becoming an unconscious

00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:54,020
habit and it's such a habit that people

00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:57,020
actually disagree that some terms are

00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:58,460
excluding people and to create a more

00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:00,049
inclusive environment we need to take a

00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:03,830
look at these words and these phrases

00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:05,390
that we use and try to dig into empathy

00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:08,320
and imagine experience that it's not our

00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:11,179
own now some things I want to point out

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,250
and some of those changes days might

00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:15,080
seem a little bit unnecessary or maybe

00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:19,730
even silly but I hope you would have a

00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:21,649
open mind so first off whenever you talk

00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:23,380
about some this by the way very weird

00:23:21,649 --> 00:23:26,050
for me I'm gonna talk about

00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:28,000
language English language to a bunch of

00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:30,430
people who probably know English a lot

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,730
more than I do so if I'm wrong please

00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:35,140
tell me so whenever you talk about

00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:38,020
someone try to make your sentences

00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:42,490
people first so instead of saying a

00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:44,260
blind man use a man who is blind this

00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:46,420
keeps the individual at the most

00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:49,030
essential element because if you say a

00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:51,340
blind man you focus on disability first

00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:54,970
and you might unconsciously dehumanize

00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:57,400
them you probably see a man with dark

00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:59,170
glasses and a walking stick but if you

00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,600
say man who is blind you will think the

00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:03,220
man first before focusing on the blind

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,960
part it makes them a little bit more

00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,520
real so it's very useful if you want to

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,610
talk about accessibility or things like

00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,610
that

00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:13,510
jargon and abbreviations they can

00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,310
exclude people who might not have

00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:17,830
specialized knowledge of a particular

00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:21,280
subject and it can impede effective

00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:24,880
communication as a result so try to use

00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:27,730
them try to only use the ones that are

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,900
widely used you can use things like SQL

00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:33,760
or PHP you're not gonna keep saying

00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:35,830
what's the same for PHP hypertext

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:39,730
process it's gonna be rental to

00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:42,480
pennyways so if necessary explain what

00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:44,470
you what you mean but so if it's like

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,000
abbreviation that only using your

00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:47,530
company try to explain what you mean and

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,660
if you give a presentation where it's

00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:56,400
being used tried adds the full phrase of

00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:58,870
of it on the slides it first comes up

00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,790
and this is the one I have people

00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:03,130
sometimes walking out of my talk because

00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:06,160
they don't really agree with me but guys

00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:09,460
is not gender neutral this is something

00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:11,770
that is being discussed a lot and I'm if

00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:14,590
you don't agree with me that's fine but

00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:16,210
people say that's using guys instead of

00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:18,760
something like people folk or everyone

00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:20,170
it's very normal and yes it is normal in

00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,570
the sense that a lot of people you are

00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:24,610
using it like that but using guys

00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:27,520
assumes that the normal default human

00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:30,430
being is a meal and also he or men are

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,410
said to be neutral there's numerous of

00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:34,990
study that showed that words like these

00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:36,640
cause people to specifically think of

00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:38,770
Mills

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,590
for example when you talk about your

00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:44,170
user and you say he clicks on that

00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:47,430
button you're gonna unconsciously

00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:50,140
picture a man clicking on that button

00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:52,780
which could then impacts how you will

00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:56,380
how you will design or write your code

00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:58,150
or you're probably not your code but

00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:01,930
your app how you're going to design your

00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:05,560
application so instead of he or she

00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:08,920
tried to use the user the user clicks

00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:10,990
the button but also just with normal

00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:13,690
conversation if you're if you're gonna

00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:15,700
do a presentation at your job and you

00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:18,160
keep referring your user as geist and

00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:20,200
the women in your company might think or

00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,300
other people as well they might think

00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:29,410
that you're just thinking of all your

00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:31,930
uses us as men and well and instead of

00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:35,470
guys you can also use people things like

00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:43,000
people folk everyone or I prefer y'all

00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:45,700
because it just sounds fun and I also

00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,450
hear people saying things like she's

00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:52,870
just a little bit OCD or bipolar which

00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:55,180
is terrible so terms like bipolar OCD

00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:57,010
and a DD they're real psychotic

00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:59,760
disabilities that people and maybe some

00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:02,380
of your co-workers actually possess and

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:06,610
they should not be used as metaphors for

00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:09,130
everyday behavior also terms that stem

00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:12,640
from context of mental helps like crazy

00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:15,520
or meds or schizo or psycho try to avoid

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:18,280
these as much as possible and all of

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,800
these above also counts when you're

00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:24,240
coding don't use terms in your comments

00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:26,770
or in your commit messages or your PRS

00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,470
don't use profanity that just makes you

00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:31,810
seem childish and try to keep it as

00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:33,640
exclusive inclusive as possible just

00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:39,010
don't assume that's just men are going

00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:40,870
to read your code so another way to be

00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:42,610
an awesome co-workers to by being humble

00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:45,190
and recognizing your own limitations and

00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:47,050
shortcomings and being humble doesn't

00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:48,880
really mean to think less of yourself

00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:49,890
it simply means to think of yourself

00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,960
less

00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:54,000
and by doing so you can help with making

00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,830
others feel more included for example

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,510
knowing that you don't have all the

00:27:55,830 --> 00:28:00,600
answers right now might lead you to ask

00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:02,190
others for their input and this signals

00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:05,880
to your colleagues that you're open to

00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:07,590
other ideas and to their ideas so as I

00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,270
just said the first step of being humble

00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:12,059
is by accepting your own limitations and

00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:14,280
here's the hard truth you're not the

00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:17,340
best at everything you're probably not

00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:20,250
the best at anything I know that I'm not

00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:22,200
and nearly everyone knows things that

00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:24,450
you don't and by accepting this you can

00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,130
learn from everyone you will become more

00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:28,260
empathetic and people will understand

00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:30,210
you better and if you're not afraid of

00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:31,919
making mistakes and be honest about them

00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:33,780
it also shows that the company doesn't

00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:37,260
have a culture where everyone has to be

00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:39,450
perfect and this will relieve stress in

00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:44,220
you and in your colleagues and it opens

00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:46,020
up a lot of conversations but to learn

00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:49,710
how this will work we also need to

00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:51,240
listen to each other and when someone

00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:52,950
listens to you whether it's an idea

00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,990
you're sharing or a project challenge

00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:57,510
you're working on it feels supportive to

00:28:54,990 --> 00:29:02,850
have someone all in just witnessing what

00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:04,970
you're going through so how many times

00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:08,910
do you bring your laptop to a meeting I

00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:12,510
think for me always I used to always do

00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:14,250
that or maybe you're trying to tell

00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:15,480
something in the meeting or giving a

00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:17,040
presentation and everybody's just

00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,650
looking at their phone which is very

00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:21,690
frustrating is your solution for this is

00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:23,160
also of course you just do not bring

00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:28,559
your phone or laptop with you but that's

00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:29,940
not always possible but if you don't if

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,370
you if you have to bring them with you

00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:34,320
but you don't really need all the

00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:36,120
notifications try to turn all the email

00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,429
notification and other channels off or

00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:41,790
just mute them and be there for your

00:29:38,429 --> 00:29:44,190
co-workers because they have prepared a

00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:49,530
lot of effort into preparing this

00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:52,950
meeting so also look at people when they

00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:55,740
speak and try to make notes because

00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:59,160
that's Alma also looks like you're more

00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:01,679
engaging and if you don't understand

00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:03,240
what someone is saying don't think that

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,130
you are dumb or that

00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,750
we'll think you're dumb just try to ask

00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:09,600
them to explain where with what's going

00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:13,110
on and also try to talk less and listen

00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:16,050
more so don't interrupt someone or make

00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:18,630
corrections even if they're even if

00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:20,520
something is wrong so you can make

00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:22,559
correction if something is wrong and

00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:25,140
that's really important to make a

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:27,330
correction but if it's just to show off

00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:31,980
how much you more no more just don't do

00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:33,750
that and maybe try a little bit more to

00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:37,070
understand someone else's few points and

00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:37,070
be interested in what they have the same

00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:44,160
yeah so it also goes the other way

00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:45,809
around at meetings there's also always

00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:48,510
one or two people that seem to dominate

00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:51,559
the conversations they take the longest

00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:53,910
and and have an opinion about ideas

00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:56,100
about everything this person could even

00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:56,490
be you and these people are not bad

00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,350
people

00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:01,500
but it could be that they make other

00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:02,910
people seem more insignificant so any

00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,620
recent study a question was asked to

00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:06,840
employees at a global bank is when you

00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:09,030
have a contribution to make any meeting

00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,860
how often are you able to do so and only

00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:12,420
thirty five percent said that they felt

00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:15,870
they were able to make a contribution

00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:17,550
when they had something to add and those

00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:20,250
always sixty five mostly consists of

00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:22,920
four group of people there are

00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:25,110
introverts people have an unconscious

00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:29,130
bias that's someone who talks through

00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:30,809
information is smarter but introverted

00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:32,460
people they make the best contributions

00:31:30,809 --> 00:31:34,110
when they have some time to process and

00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:37,050
choose the words carefully

00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:39,650
so all extroverts are talking introverts

00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:42,120
remain quiet and this might be seen as

00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:44,309
disengagement or lack of experience and

00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:47,070
that will lead introverts of being

00:31:44,309 --> 00:31:49,320
demoralized I will also tell you a

00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:50,870
little bit about how you can avoid these

00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:53,670
things

00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:55,410
I'm as a remote worker at a company

00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:58,410
where no one else is remote so I'm just

00:31:55,410 --> 00:32:00,500
constantly at home and it's very hard to

00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:02,940
make a contribution via conference call

00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:04,890
if the connection is not perfect it

00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:06,540
takes some time to process what you are

00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:10,020
what person on the other line is saying

00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:14,550
which can just lead to not saying anyway

00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:16,080
anything at all a lot of studies have

00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:17,070
shown that women are far more likely to

00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,500
be interrupted

00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:21,210
and are taking less seriously it is so

00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,679
common that our terms like mint

00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:26,700
errupting and mansplaining but I will

00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:29,309
not get into that for now and sorry you

00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:31,230
should also show that there often people

00:32:29,309 --> 00:32:33,539
of colors are often really ignored

00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:36,179
during meetings they also need to work

00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:39,059
harder to be recognized and acknowledged

00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:46,259
then more often than white white

00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:47,730
co-workers so if you're the facilitator

00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:49,649
of a meeting there are some things that

00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:52,100
you can do to make sure that everyone is

00:32:49,649 --> 00:32:54,960
valued equally so before the meeting

00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:57,000
share the purpose of the meeting the

00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,519
share the presentations and any relevant

00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,289
data that way introverts can process

00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,240
some of the data before the meeting and

00:33:01,289 --> 00:33:05,190
they can ask additional questions during

00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:09,210
it and it's also useful to help your

00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:12,750
remote workers to follow along if you're

00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:14,279
working with video conferences ask the

00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,659
remote participants to use the chat

00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:20,009
feature to let everyone know that they

00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:22,830
want to chime in another way to include

00:33:20,009 --> 00:33:25,799
remote workers is to have everyone use

00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:27,720
video so what we do at our company is

00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:29,730
that everyone would just be it with the

00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:32,039
headphones on and have the meeting on

00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:33,779
their own screens which will help well

00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:36,120
at least for me helping me feel more

00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:40,830
included because everybody has the same

00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:43,409
issues and try to set some ground rules

00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:44,940
things like no talk talking over each

00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:47,879
other and make sure that everyone keeps

00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:49,919
to it when someone interrupt someone

00:33:47,879 --> 00:33:52,350
else say something like I'm actually

00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,000
interested in what they had to say so

00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:57,330
that people can actually talk a little

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,580
bit more and try to keep central no two

00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:02,669
subgroups or talking when someone else

00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:03,809
has the floor and after the meeting send

00:34:02,669 --> 00:34:05,789
an email where the summary and the

00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:07,259
decisions and actions this will help

00:34:05,789 --> 00:34:08,819
remove workers that might have not have

00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:11,669
heard everything to do to bet

00:34:08,819 --> 00:34:13,919
connections but also do not forget about

00:34:11,669 --> 00:34:15,569
yourself because you are awesome too

00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:18,000
being humble doesn't mean you should be

00:34:15,569 --> 00:34:20,609
quiet you should but know your limit and

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,800
limitations but also your strengths

00:34:20,609 --> 00:34:24,720
because your opinions are unique and

00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,849
your palettes and you should not be

00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,800
afraid to let your voice be heard and

00:34:26,849 --> 00:34:30,899
it's very important to be aware of

00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,849
because if you do not recognize your

00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:35,569
own awesome and awesomeness it's hard to

00:34:32,849 --> 00:34:35,569
be a great co-worker

00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:41,970
so find people who believe in you and

00:34:39,419 --> 00:34:44,789
keep away that people try to belittle

00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:46,879
your emissions encourage and support

00:34:44,789 --> 00:34:49,619
them and welcome their sport in return

00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:51,240
spend more time with those who sharpen

00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:54,109
you and make you better and less time

00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,109
with those who drain your energy

00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:58,799
the truth is friends and colleagues who

00:34:57,299 --> 00:35:02,220
speak encouragement into your life are

00:34:58,799 --> 00:35:03,390
priceless and Europeans are pellets and

00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:07,020
you should not be afraid to let your

00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:09,770
voice be heard I stand up for what I

00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:11,640
believe in I think you should do too and

00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:14,880
sometimes people don't agree with you

00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:16,319
which happens to me very often but if

00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,029
you have surrounded yourself with people

00:35:16,319 --> 00:35:20,970
that share your viewpoints and who

00:35:18,029 --> 00:35:22,589
encourage you and support you you will

00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:24,150
be less afraid to say what you believe

00:35:22,589 --> 00:35:29,160
because there are always people that

00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:32,010
will help you but mostly just be

00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:34,980
yourself respect your co-workers and

00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:37,500
help them be themselves as well because

00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:39,359
you are awesome and it's up to you to

00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:42,390
help make it everything awesome as well

00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:43,589
and this is a very terrible cliche a

00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:46,049
little bit of kindness goes a long way

00:35:43,589 --> 00:35:48,210
but it's a cliche but it's also the core

00:35:46,049 --> 00:35:50,190
of this whole talk if you want to have a

00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:51,930
more welcoming environments people have

00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:53,760
to be kind to each other and it will

00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:55,529
generate a ripple effect if you start

00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,329
being more inclusive and kind to your

00:35:55,529 --> 00:36:01,279
co-workers they will start doing the

00:35:57,329 --> 00:36:01,279
