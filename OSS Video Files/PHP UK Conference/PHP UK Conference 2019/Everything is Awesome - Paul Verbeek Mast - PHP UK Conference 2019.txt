	ðŸŽµEverything is cool when youâ€™re part of a team!ðŸŽµ

The Lego Movie came out almost 4 years ago, and it taught children everywhere the importance of teamwork. And what teamwork, and working in harmony, actually is. Letâ€™s just hope that those lessons really stick with these kids. Because letâ€™s be honest, weâ€™re making a mess of it.

But itâ€™s not too late for us. We can learn from the Lego Movie as well. Iâ€™ll show you how you can help to make sure everyone feels safe and respected in your team and your company. How you can feel better being the unique person you are within your team. And how you can make your, and everyone elseâ€™s, life more awesome!
