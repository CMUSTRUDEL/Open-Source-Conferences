Title: PHP UK Conference 2017 - Karina Popova - Real Time Communication to Simplify Your Life
Publication date: 2017-04-03
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2017
Description: 
	An implicit goal of developing applications is to increase level of communication. A connectivity is becoming an integral part of IoT projects. What would you think if you have the connectivity wherever your IoT sensor is, your own independent cloud based network, extremely scalable and globally distributed. Nowadays SIM cards and endpoints can be easily managed in real-time via an intuitive user-interface or an easy-to-integrate API. The developing process, security issues and key features will be discussed together with lots of real working IoT use cases based on PHP.

good morning yeah sound is working so

00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:15,269
mmm my name is Karina Popova I'm a

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:21,090
developer evangelist at linked mobility

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:22,800
you should see right now my slides so

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,740
today I would like to tell to talk to

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,130
you about real-time communication for IT

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,929
how it can simplify our everyday life

00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:33,239
because we think that we all know that

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:34,530
the main goal of all development but we

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,960
are doing now it's to increase

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,870
communication between things and IIT is

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,739
like a main keyword right now so many

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:45,690
projects and usually our previous year I

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:49,260
gave around 15 talks about IIT and

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:51,600
usually I start with a nice story nice

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,540
example and this time I was really

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,610
struggling I was flying an airplane

00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,320
thinking oh my god so what what this

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,710
time because of course it should be

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,229
something you we live in a smart photo

00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:06,180
it was Wow for me as I work closer to IT

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:10,110
like you have this panel where you

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:14,490
control everything temperature of the

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:16,680
floor lightning and the bathroom

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:23,010
temperature in the shower so it's really

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:26,760
cool and but the one thing like is you

00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:31,440
remember that my tacos to simplify our

00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:33,570
life I realized that every time when I'm

00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,030
going to a bathroom for example I need

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:39,120
to do two movements now I need first to

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:42,180
activate display and then I need to then

00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:48,270
only I can choose it I want to turn

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:52,200
light on so the company where I work I

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:56,040
work in a German company but recently

00:01:52,200 --> 00:02:00,420
about seven other companies now where

00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:03,150
big one will situate it in Scandinavia

00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:07,080
Baltic countries and Germany our office

00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:11,390
so our background is a messaging

00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:14,190
business and we do a two-factor

00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:15,360
implications for big German banks like

00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:18,360
Deutsche Bank and so on

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,550
and so it means a lot of security we

00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,570
have we provide services worldwide for

00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:26,970
more than 400 we have contracts with

00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:29,310
more than 400 operators worldwide and

00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:31,230
have excellent that form availability

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,780
and then we was thinking okay messaging

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:38,610
business what's next and we decided to

00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:41,070
move in our team thanks good so what

00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:43,460
first what we thought about that

00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:46,740
who is our potential customers and

00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:48,930
that's we were reading a lot of articles

00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:52,550
and we come up with this term which is

00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:55,650
like quantified self which means that

00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:58,350
it's a self knowledge through self

00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:01,520
tracking with technology because a lot

00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:04,730
of people around us all of us we try to

00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:07,950
explore different aspects of our life

00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:15,090
every day we collect as much data as

00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:17,640
possible first we all the time want to

00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:20,720
monitor all different inputs like food

00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:24,870
consumption and so on also different

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:27,060
states of our mood like how to remember

00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,970
how I felt two weeks ago and what will

00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,860
be next because sometimes it's also can

00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:35,030
predict your mood and there is also a

00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:37,530
performance applications nowadays

00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:42,380
physical we all know there is also cool

00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:45,180
some cool mental applications which is

00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:47,910
every day my phone tells me do I have

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,800
depression or not which is kind of cool

00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:51,600
because on these days when I have a

00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,580
notification today it seems today you

00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:58,140
don't have depression I really feel that

00:03:53,580 --> 00:04:00,780
I don't and I'm much more happy so

00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:03,120
what's going on now basically all these

00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,720
IT technologies they're driving the old

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:10,190
style system and infrastructure to kind

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:15,810
of highly available highly interactive

00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:19,280
applications and services so shortly

00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:22,470
about IOT is or is a prediction that in

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,300
2020 we will have lots of connected

00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,380
devices per purse and tons of data

00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:30,460
processed per second

00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:32,680
and of course we're not including yet

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,660
all these connected cats and dogs it's I

00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:38,230
believe will be also a thing in some

00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:40,030
years and sometimes it helps to stop for

00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:42,760
a moment and like seeing where it will

00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:47,380
bring us all if we would really simplify

00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:52,060
our life or not and what future will we

00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:54,370
have of course the IOT is the main

00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:56,740
factor but as we on the pitch P

00:04:54,370 --> 00:05:07,810
conference today we'll talk a lot also

00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:09,460
about PHP ok yeah so when I sell to my

00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,650
friends like I have a talk about pitch

00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,070
beam IOT usually people save me are you

00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,560
crazy

00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:18,220
how does it work is it really a saying

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,800
or not and then I always tell like which

00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:24,790
feels really cool language it's so easy

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,890
to launch so fast it has so many like

00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:29,610
have so many libraries and so on so it's

00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:32,110
so easy to work with it so why not

00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:37,600
HP can really play an important role in

00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:40,560
IOT and because the picture which we see

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:46,330
when we just think about PHP in IIT it's

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:49,120
not so large when we when we can combine

00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:54,600
them together so everyone talking about

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,600
how these cardboards connected stuff but

00:05:55,140 --> 00:06:02,140
some PHP developers they really

00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:03,700
interested in building IOT applications

00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:09,040
I have some friends who is doing all

00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:11,680
this that all IOT devices in his houses

00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:15,220
house all the time tweet about something

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:19,000
and it's done with PHP but the basic

00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:20,650
example which I usually say it's GPS

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,080
sensors that can constantly

00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:26,530
publish your location and its connect

00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:28,390
PHP application which can stream data in

00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:30,610
real time and you can monitor your

00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:36,070
location and web browser that's a more

00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:39,240
simple so ok so PHP and IIT can yeah IOT

00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:39,240
work with page cream and

00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:45,130
basically IT producing a lot of data and

00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,919
what we need we're always searching kind

00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:50,040
of a needle in all this data we have we

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:53,650
need to get relevant information

00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:58,360
relevant data and for this for PHP if we

00:06:53,650 --> 00:07:03,130
will recall it PHP in IOT it's like a

00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:04,870
bit big thing because if you just have

00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:08,199
data it means nothing if we will

00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:11,940
visualize it and we will see in the real

00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:11,940
time what's going on it will mean a lot

00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:18,820
so then because we're from messaging

00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:22,539
businesses you remember I told at the

00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:24,910
beginning we decided that it would be

00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:27,580
cool for us to work in a IT field

00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:30,180
connected like more close to

00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:33,010
connectivity and Internet of Things

00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:38,110
converging around a lot of things around

00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:42,160
us into community of information kind of

00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:44,169
all these things and we have a lot of

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,330
sensors around us and all the sensors

00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:49,030
turned billion of information into data

00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:51,180
generating things which can interact

00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:53,590
with the environment all the time and

00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:59,380
this ayah to devices can certainly

00:07:53,590 --> 00:08:01,060
connect through different ways but we

00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:04,510
decided to focus on cellular

00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:06,220
connectivity and we thought that it's

00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:08,410
really cool because obviously when you

00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:12,729
have Wi-Fi reception it's always limited

00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:15,430
so one access point and it's also the

00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:17,470
you have a lot of problems with device

00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:20,070
configuration or network configuration

00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:23,320
and with the cellular connectivity it's

00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:28,120
no you don't have really any maintenance

00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:30,310
efforts and really a large investigation

00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:35,849
of any event is possible because we have

00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:39,159
so many sim based devices around us and

00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:44,350
it is possible to observe event event in

00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:48,420
any location anytime and yeah so you see

00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:51,270
if you have a simple tourism

00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:54,000
and then because we had this contract

00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:55,560
with 400 operators worldwide we decided

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,300
that would because at the simcard can

00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:01,680
eat just a multi network and work

00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:03,900
everywhere and because we were as

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,850
developers to usually experience a lot

00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:10,020
of difficulties like when we have one

00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:12,570
operator one providers that we it's not

00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:15,210
so flexible it's really hard to

00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:17,250
understand security policies it's a lot

00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:19,250
of limitations from someone so we

00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:25,170
thought it would be cool to do something

00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:29,880
to create develop feature which can work

00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:33,720
everywhere and when we look on IT

00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:36,390
functional view it we see that first you

00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,790
need to create information it's of

00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:41,010
course made by sensors basically or any

00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:43,800
IOT devices then you have to communicate

00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:45,930
and this is what we jump in with our

00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,700
connectivity solution but then you have

00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:50,400
to aggregate this information and that's

00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:57,000
where we start to use PHP to aggregate

00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:58,710
information to in a secure way then we

00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,150
have a plan in the next year that we

00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:04,200
will analyze this information with

00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:07,680
different intelligent systems as we hope

00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,780
that it will be possible to do and then

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:13,200
act of course but nowadays acting is

00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:16,710
more like a human but hopefully in 2020

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,140
it will be more computers so our another

00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:23,150
our symbols that there are some IT

00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:25,800
issues which we wanted to avoid and

00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:28,940
first of all it was that there are so

00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:33,230
many whenever you use an IOT application

00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:36,300
so many useful useless sorry

00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:37,770
dashboards and notifications so if you

00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,150
have thousands of devices you'll

00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:42,330
basically have notifications every

00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:44,400
second they all want to talk to you and

00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:49,310
you don't know what to answer to them

00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:53,839
because basically each device it's just

00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:56,540
huge number ID numbers at all and we

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,939
also would like to enable developers who

00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,889
is a service which we create it's

00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:04,220
awesome it would be much easier to crew

00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:07,370
to adapt to several users and so we

00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:09,800
decided to have five needs like the

00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:11,540
first was a connection connection

00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,749
quality which means that we required the

00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:16,730
permanent connection on any device at

00:11:14,749 --> 00:11:19,399
any time so with the maximum possible

00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:21,790
existing coverage worldwide and was a

00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:24,589
strongest network so which means that

00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:26,509
SIM cards that you provided can connect

00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:30,050
can switch all the time to those a

00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:31,910
strongest network the next need was

00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:34,189
advanced security because in IIT you

00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:36,170
know talked a lot about security that

00:11:34,189 --> 00:11:37,790
it's very important that no one received

00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:40,639
our data so I thought it would be cool

00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:42,019
to have IP restrictions that the SIM

00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:46,579
card of course can be locked a specific

00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:53,930
IOT device and also integration via VPN

00:11:46,579 --> 00:11:57,379
and so this is how our VPN architecture

00:11:53,930 --> 00:12:02,209
should look like usually you have to

00:11:57,379 --> 00:12:04,220
have a VPN client on the device in our

00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:08,689
case you don't need two SIM card types

00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:10,939
really cool role you can all the time

00:12:08,689 --> 00:12:14,300
connect just to our payant service and

00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:17,769
then we encrypt it like a picture below

00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:20,870
it's what we do we encrypted both way

00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:24,079
when they connect to our IP N and then

00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:28,370
to any SIM card so it's less power

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:30,980
consumption it's no APN client required

00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:34,519
and so another need was access to the

00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:37,129
device and we thought that it's cool to

00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:39,980
have a static IP address so every SIM

00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:42,110
card has a static IP address it's a of

00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:44,209
course enabled and established by

00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:45,730
directional communication and we can

00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:49,069
monitor it in real time

00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:51,050
of course about sex ability said we had

00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:52,879
some weird cases like when people wanted

00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:55,939
to track a polar bear so it should work

00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:58,100
with minus 50 degrees or someone want to

00:12:55,939 --> 00:13:01,519
use it in a harsh environment like in

00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:03,679
metal production and very super hot

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:07,850
it's also resistance to vibrations

00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:10,220
humidity in all this stuff and then a

00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:13,959
really cool thing is a control of all

00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:16,249
these sim cards and IOT devices so we

00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:18,980
thought that would be really cool if you

00:13:16,249 --> 00:13:22,009
can control everything in real time you

00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,779
can monitor it on one portal and so we

00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:30,740
had a customer portal and we created

00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:35,089
also our API and this is mostly a place

00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:36,889
where we use PHP a lot so from the

00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:38,959
implementation side there were no more

00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:41,240
difficulties because you are not

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:44,300
dependent anymore on any mobile operator

00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:47,389
you basically have your own mobile

00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:51,319
network there is no different roaming

00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:52,790
prices you don't need to change SIM

00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:55,459
cards when you're moving from country to

00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:57,249
country and we know there is some

00:13:55,459 --> 00:14:00,769
connection available almost everywhere

00:13:57,249 --> 00:14:04,129
so but each subset of SIM cards is IPI

00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:06,129
programmable which means you can

00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:11,779
basically play with it around and do

00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:14,079
what you want yeah so this we have two

00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:17,949
types of control your access control

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:21,170
where you can collect data from all your

00:14:17,949 --> 00:14:28,850
SIM cards and represented in real time

00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:32,179
and API as I told already so of course

00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:34,490
what you can see him we had to collect a

00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:36,230
lot of information we had a huge

00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:39,499
databases and everything should be

00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:40,009
connected smoothly where PHP works very

00:14:39,499 --> 00:14:43,819
well

00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:46,040
so what you can see is that you can

00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:48,199
manage all your endpoints you can manage

00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:51,079
your SIM cards which means you can

00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:52,790
actually go and debug your endpoint and

00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:54,459
see what's going on in why it's not

00:14:52,790 --> 00:15:01,029
working what was a problem without

00:14:54,459 --> 00:15:06,259
physically being on a place and you can

00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:09,049
turn on on turn off like do we want to

00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:11,540
have out here or not do how many you can

00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:13,759
put limits how many SMS your device

00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,320
should send and you can also choose

00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:17,140
between the

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,950
and the reef profiles because if you

00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:23,830
have most encourage of course you have

00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:27,730
price is usually cheaper so this is how

00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:33,130
it looked like it's in real time you can

00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:36,490
see if device is on or off you can see

00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:39,010
to which network attached device right

00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:41,920
now and it's all in real time so if the

00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:44,530
devices just moved to another room and

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,960
you can also see in real time how much

00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:49,120
data has been used and what your pain is

00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:52,000
everything is in real time and for this

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:55,690
of course we need to collect a lot of

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,860
information and a runtime on PHP really

00:15:55,690 --> 00:16:04,870
a huge sink here and you can also pass

00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:07,420
your IOT device with API and so entire

00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:10,240
ecosystem is built around different PHP

00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:15,040
libraries and with curl it allows you

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:19,480
easy and repeatable concept and user API

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:23,320
remotely and things which you need to do

00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:26,010
to have to work with IOT it's actually

00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:32,680
you just need to have knowledge about

00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:35,890
PHP which I think all of us has and you

00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:40,080
also need to have a development

00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:43,980
environment like Apache or nginx and

00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:47,230
like a text editor as we all sing and

00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:50,440
you have to connect and at this point we

00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:51,910
provide this connectivity so there are

00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,780
different use cases now it's an

00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:58,500
interesting part so we know that IOT

00:16:55,780 --> 00:17:01,630
device is now around us everywhere so

00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,850
this is where our SIM cards were used in

00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:06,670
PHP were used also so the payment

00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:10,480
terminals suite management smart

00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:15,400
metering security stations and a house

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:20,589
management a simple thing is just a

00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:22,839
simple examples is that your device can

00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:26,199
communicate with you which means for

00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:27,549
example our alarm system whenever

00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:32,769
enters the room it could send you a

00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:34,840
message another thing is when you

00:17:32,769 --> 00:17:37,779
communicate is a device in Germany it's

00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:40,360
very popular is it whenever you want to

00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:42,610
enter your garage you just wanted to to

00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:46,029
: special number and the door is open

00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:50,350
and there is also we provide access to

00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:54,220
to use ussd it's very popular on the

00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:57,279
ships because traveling along the coast

00:17:54,220 --> 00:18:01,630
and where GPS connection is just some

00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:03,880
connection is not so good but it's still

00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:06,610
available so they can't really connect

00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,980
to internet but they can use USSD and

00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:13,870
open dialogue and talk to each other in

00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:16,630
real time so the first example which we

00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:20,860
had a use case was about a health

00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:25,840
monitoring we did it for Google

00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:28,539
conference in previous July yeah and so

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:32,309
they asked us to create quickly a health

00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:39,130
monitoring IOT device so we thought like

00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:47,289
why it was a case because if you senior

00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:49,600
and you already usually you have to stay

00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:50,889
at your home on your relatives would

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,179
want you to move to assist and

00:18:50,889 --> 00:18:54,279
accommodation that someone is looking

00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:57,340
around you but of course when you are

00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:59,019
old you don't want to change your

00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:01,240
lifestyle you would like to stay at home

00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:04,269
and do normal stuff what you do there

00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:06,460
are a lot of health devices but they all

00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:08,590
usually have a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth

00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:11,110
connectivity which means they are not so

00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:13,840
flexible they can't monitor what's going

00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:14,620
on when senior went to magazines to the

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:19,929
shop sorry

00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:21,639
and if this if something happen with

00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:25,710
humans a shop the SIM card can

00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:28,809
immediately trigger a message yeah and

00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:31,030
to your relatives a doctor or emergency

00:19:28,809 --> 00:19:35,419
message depends on

00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:40,190
so our solution was very simple quick so

00:19:35,419 --> 00:19:43,160
we took Arduino with gsm shield which

00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:45,289
basically you can take any IOT device

00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:48,890
also Raspberry Pi would work perfectly

00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:53,780
you just need to have a JSON so yeah for

00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:56,570
the sim card we also take this pulse

00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:57,799
sensor which cost like 2 euros I guess

00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:00,110
so it's very cheap

00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:07,190
you can do it create at your home

00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:09,169
immediately and this pulse sensor check

00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:12,440
your heartbeat and whenever there is

00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:16,970
light the measurements shows that it's

00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:18,740
too high or too low it will say that

00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,929
something is wrong with you so the third

00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:22,909
component was our sim card

00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:25,520
decided to try it out how it will work

00:20:22,909 --> 00:20:30,760
you play outside this is ask Emma how it

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:33,740
looked all together and you can money

00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:37,039
buy yourself say do you want to do

00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:41,419
measurements every second or every five

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:44,330
minutes and what is the limits you can

00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:47,960
find all these sketches and code on our

00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:49,669
github account after and so basically

00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:53,809
what we've done it's done the pulse

00:20:49,669 --> 00:21:01,039
sensor connects a finger or ear then you

00:20:53,809 --> 00:21:04,600
connect it also to Arduino device or any

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:07,400
IOT device which broadcast a signal and

00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:10,909
this is how it looks like at the end we

00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:17,659
have this application which shows you in

00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:21,380
real time how is your what parts do you

00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:25,669
have in this minute and the moment when

00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:30,890
you stop wearing the device it's of

00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:36,350
course going down and so this is mainly

00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:40,220
how we collect data and of course we

00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:42,760
need PHP in this point to consume data

00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,760
and

00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:48,420
for these purposes it's much more useful

00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,310
for us that we created also a web

00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:52,140
application which can work in your

00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:54,120
browser and you immediately it can go

00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,310
and check what's going on with your

00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:59,010
parents for example what is the pass

00:21:56,310 --> 00:22:06,030
they have right now yeah

00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:09,480
well monitor everyone yes the next case

00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:13,680
was yes smart home it's basically what's

00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:16,440
in our hotel room right now like you can

00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:17,730
control your heating and you can

00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,450
communicate with your washing machine

00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:23,400
being outside and it's probably it would

00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:27,510
be much more easier that you can just go

00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:30,300
on web and push the data through it like

00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:33,780
with speech pickup its application looks

00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:42,210
much more cooler user has much great

00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:45,660
experience with us and it's very people

00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:48,440
like to use it more in a to avoid some

00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:50,610
disasters it's a home you know because

00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:53,130
for one of the company we did this

00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:55,170
application which shows that it's like

00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:57,330
everything burning inside and it's a 3d

00:22:55,170 --> 00:23:00,750
model like what's going on inside home

00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:04,860
and it was really cool because people

00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:09,150
react immediately they don't panic panic

00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:12,990
is good and then another is I told you

00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:15,720
already it's alarm system providers

00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:18,900
they're one of the biggest users for our

00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:24,510
team because it's a big challenge to

00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:27,090
control home and that's also every one

00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:29,610
of us would like to have to know that

00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:33,590
his home is safe everything is in the

00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:37,200
right place so security is kind of a

00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:42,540
main thing but we feel much more safe

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:45,620
when we can remotely control it and for

00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:48,210
instance they now do also this

00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:50,670
application where you can see that your

00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:52,590
TV was removed from the place because

00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:54,730
it's attached to a special device and

00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:57,400
all this information and

00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:59,110
real time can really help us to feel

00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:09,059
much more safer and really can really

00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:09,059
increase our quality of life and yeah

00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:15,160
automative areum this was the first

00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:18,070
result that that's our main case because

00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:20,470
if we provided a SIM card which can

00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:22,780
connect everywhere so for it would be

00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:25,330
very interesting for people whose

00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:29,400
devices are moving around and first of

00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:32,950
all it's car bikes and all this stuff so

00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:37,450
because car rentals and livery services

00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:41,890
and logistic enterprises they spend

00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:44,320
really a lot of money on fleet

00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:49,270
management and energy and it's a lot of

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:51,280
human efforts but with just one simple

00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:53,440
help of the IT device you can connect

00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:55,570
and track location and mileage and see

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,000
what's wrong with the car

00:24:55,570 --> 00:25:03,510
you can even track your drivers and see

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,510
what is driving styles they have is it

00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:13,330
like do they do it safe or not is they

00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:15,610
spend a lot of fuel or not and even one

00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:17,500
company who whom we've done sees they

00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:20,860
have kind of communications at each

00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:22,960
driver receiving real-time score and he

00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:24,400
knows what he's done wrong and at the

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:29,290
end of March the best travel will

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:32,620
receive more money so another case we

00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:35,950
support conservation projects was a guy

00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:38,559
decided for two weeks travel from Munich

00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:42,190
to Vienna by River on a paddling boat

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:44,710
and young for him it was very critical

00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:47,679
that in real time everyone can go on his

00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:49,690
web page and see where is he right now

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:54,250
is that he's really traveling because

00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:57,790
they give him money to save his forest

00:25:54,250 --> 00:26:00,360
area around this river and the cool

00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:05,890
thing was that it was one of our first

00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:08,260
GPS tracking project and during two

00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:11,350
weeks he spent around 15

00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:14,950
but data being every two second

00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:16,720
connected so it's really cost almost

00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:19,480
nothing so a lot of GPS tracker

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:23,290
immediately want to have the same to be

00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:27,790
able to work everywhere and show it on

00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:30,850
the real time and map and another main

00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:34,240
thing right now is a agricultural

00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:37,440
industry because somehow young predicts

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:42,630
that our population would increase to 11

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:46,690
billions by 2100

00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:50,290
yeah and all these people has to be fed

00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:52,840
and but our main problem is also that we

00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:58,690
have unsustainable farming right now

00:26:52,840 --> 00:27:01,870
that really farming has a huge impact on

00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:05,169
our life not a good one so we have to do

00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:09,790
it more efficient and reduce pollution

00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:12,549
and in this purpose they now do these

00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:16,690
drones which can monitor the field they

00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:18,070
fly around and check where they water

00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:20,770
really need it

00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:24,220
if the trees there is some nutrition

00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:28,919
deficit and also analyze different soil

00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:31,780
conditions and they can apply different

00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:35,980
herbicides only where it's needed not on

00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:38,799
the whole field and use these drones in

00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:42,700
the future they even will transfer

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:45,040
different insects a specific field and

00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:48,790
of course all this should be monitored

00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:51,520
in real time that farmer can see what's

00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:54,690
going on the field which he should which

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:58,780
resources he should should provide and

00:27:54,690 --> 00:28:01,480
what he has in his storage and all this

00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:04,720
should look cool and like a nice

00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:06,880
application it's right now we'll do this

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:10,650
application for mobile phones but also a

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,650
web application and

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,460
then there was this case with retail

00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:20,170
stores I told you we thought that our

00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:23,420
main case when device is moving but no

00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:27,200
when you have thousands of devices and

00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:30,140
they associate it around one or two many

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,730
countries you don't want to have ten

00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:34,070
different contracts with different

00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:36,110
mobile operators and you don't want to

00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:40,490
check if they really exist in this area

00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:43,100
or not so basically with this sim card

00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:46,450
which we provide you can connect all of

00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:50,809
them in any place so this is our domain

00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:52,940
think so they use SMS and data as a

00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:55,820
fallback option because usually they

00:28:52,940 --> 00:29:00,050
have Wi-Fi but it's often does not work

00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:01,610
and all they need this data also it's

00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:05,559
very critical that it should be in real

00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:05,559
time and should be represent it for

00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:14,890
manager levels to have to do a quick -

00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:17,960
to be quick with decision making process

00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:21,800
so another case we've done with IBM

00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:27,440
together so they thought would be cool

00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:30,410
if you don't have connection to Internet

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,809
but you still have a GSM network so it's

00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:37,070
possible to use SMS so you can just send

00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:44,000
an API call for example via SMS and this

00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:47,600
case we thought sending our call and we

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,240
receive notification that it's if it's

00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:52,280
received then everything is fine but if

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,850
not we don't receive any notifications

00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:58,540
and we send it by SMS and at the end

00:29:55,850 --> 00:30:00,650
what we've done on this map you can see

00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:03,920
all the questions where I had

00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:08,870
conferences already it's a little bit up

00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:11,660
to date but okay so basically have this

00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:14,020
IOT devices be whenever I'm on a

00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:17,090
friends I usually send a message said

00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:19,160
today I had a talk and it's all stored

00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:21,950
in one database and it has a really nice

00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:26,840
representation with the help of each

00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:33,710
beam ah yeah also chatbots now it's

00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:37,490
really thing for IOT because you want to

00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:39,350
talk with your device and but you want

00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:41,420
to do it cool so what we've done with

00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:44,240
within our company you have this

00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:47,120
facebook messenger where you can connect

00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:51,590
all your devices you can also find out

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:53,630
the code in our github account and of

00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:57,340
course you know that PHP is very

00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:58,550
important for all this representation of

00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:03,770
chatbots

00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:06,050
and there is much more because there's

00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:08,990
kind of intellectual system inside which

00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:12,590
can understand what it should answer and

00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:15,520
how it should react and so there is a

00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:20,780
different combinations of IOT and PHP

00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:27,860
together and so in this way we thought

00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:30,800
that our our main goal is to develop

00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:33,100
this multi network SIM card and that it

00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:37,400
can simplify all data collection and

00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:40,850
help us to stream data real time in a

00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:42,770
web browser for all our clients and in

00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:46,190
the end we really would like to increase

00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:50,420
the quality of life of general citizens

00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:53,960
or general people and society as a whole

00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:57,350
and it's of course possibilities with

00:31:53,960 --> 00:32:02,480
PHP and IOT bring together it's endless

00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:03,980
and IIT will definitely will continue to

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,020
be one of the main technology in the

00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:08,240
next years and because we have this

00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:12,420
knowledge in PHP would be very cool if

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:15,529
we can come up with more solutions and

00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:15,529
[Music]

00:32:16,149 --> 00:32:23,299
so we're kind of providing connectivity

00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:25,490
and our na developers are not our target

00:32:23,299 --> 00:32:27,769
group to whom we want to sell this but

00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:31,549
we would like to enable you to create

00:32:27,769 --> 00:32:33,169
something more and to try it out so I

00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:36,200
have some SIM cards with me if you have

00:32:33,169 --> 00:32:38,690
an ideas I can give it to you and you

00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:45,320
can try it out already today and you

00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:48,169
will order your IOT device and so I'm

00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:50,389
just hoping that if we will merge IOT

00:32:48,169 --> 00:32:54,350
and PHP we will live in a better place

00:32:50,389 --> 00:32:55,850
and we have also a developer package on

00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:59,869
our website if you are more interested

00:32:55,850 --> 00:33:03,590
into developing draw you can check there

00:32:59,869 --> 00:33:08,389
is a lot of blog posts and github

00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:10,879
account yes and yeah I would like to

00:33:08,389 --> 00:33:13,700
thank you that you are where was me

00:33:10,879 --> 00:33:16,669
during this struggling moments here my

00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:19,580
presentation and I will be happy to

00:33:16,669 --> 00:33:21,619
receive your feedback yeah I'm around

00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,539
here a whole day if you have any

00:33:21,619 --> 00:33:37,070
questions right now I can also maybe

00:33:23,539 --> 00:33:40,519
answer yeah so I'm really into the IOT

00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:41,809
stuff and using PHP as well the the

00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:44,149
biggest problem that I've found at the

00:33:41,809 --> 00:33:46,580
minute is not gathering the data but

00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:49,700
it's doing something intelligent with

00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:51,470
the data once you've received it and I

00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:54,499
think that is gonna be the biggest

00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:57,200
obstacle going forward is that something

00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:59,629
that you've your company has actually

00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,999
put some work and effort into yes there

00:33:59,629 --> 00:34:05,779
is another top cost combining IOT and

00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:07,970
interface artificial intelligence in two

00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:13,010
weeks in Bristol you're welcome and here

00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:15,260
I was thinking if you've got a tracking

00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:17,359
device for your cat or child or granny

00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:20,480
yes then you can analyze where these

00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:22,310
cats went and why for example it's

00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,630
always has the same pattern and one day

00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:26,910
it's went a completely different place

00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:29,700
you can predict somehow behavior of not

00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:31,140
only cats but also people this is what

00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:33,480
we in a big airport

00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:35,910
say usually do is a trackage person and

00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:37,920
understand why they are moving so if

00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:40,310
someone is doing a weird stuff probably

00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:42,750
the security should put attention on it

00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:45,300
anything I don't think

00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:48,000
gaffur taping a an Arduino to your cat

00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:52,350
is a practical solution in the minute

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:58,880
but yeah yeah we have made a lot of

00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:58,880
plans an idea any other questions

00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:13,940
yeah so I have my Arduino with the

00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:18,420
shield on it that's then sends an Esso

00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:22,590
the GSM network to your servers then

00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:23,910
your servers then talk to my server does

00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:25,800
that the idea so then I can have PHP

00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:27,510
running on my servers and it's just an

00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,940
endpoint that your server talks to on

00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:33,450
myself everything is possible with our

00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:34,860
solution so it's the way if you want to

00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:36,710
do it on our server it's also possible

00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:39,240
if you want to do it by yourself it's

00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:40,740
everything we have super flexible that's

00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:44,160
why I like the solutions that you can

00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:48,440
immediately create this IOT device and

00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:51,440
work talk to it start away without being

00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,440
yeah

00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:06,510
Anna German sometimes gentlemen one time

00:36:17,829 --> 00:36:21,190
Sorry Sorry

00:36:21,259 --> 00:36:27,170
is it possible to use this technology

00:36:24,109 --> 00:36:29,690
sim technology to get around the issue

00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:31,160
that SIM card is a point of failure say

00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:33,019
for example I've left my son got a home

00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:36,049
I can move my number on to another SIM

00:36:33,019 --> 00:36:37,369
card and then could I use that to create

00:36:36,049 --> 00:36:43,640
that make that happen

00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:47,119
that makes sense say for example I've

00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:49,390
got my sim card as a home and just for

00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:52,039
example and it has 107 number on that

00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:54,319
but I need it here today but I have one

00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:57,229
of these Sims is there way to put the

00:36:54,319 --> 00:36:59,869
number onto the new sim and just

00:36:57,229 --> 00:37:02,809
temporarily so can borrow a colleague's

00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:05,359
device and then use this type of

00:37:02,809 --> 00:37:09,759
technology to get around the single

00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:09,759
point of failure issue with sim cards

00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:19,519
yeah it's called a SIM cards right now

00:37:17,059 --> 00:37:22,309
okay yeah so it's possible that it's

00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:28,569
like a virtual one John you can yeah

00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:28,569
it's possible with this technology sorry

00:37:29,979 --> 00:37:33,699
any other questions

00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:43,650
if not I really would like to give some

00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:45,690
sim cards for someone sorry um so in one

00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:51,030
of the diagrams you put up you said that

00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:52,619
in instances where you have limited cell

00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:55,740
networks you would befall back to GSM

00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:58,380
and send SMS messages from the devices

00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:59,460
back to your servers but earlier on in

00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:02,040
the presentation you said that you've

00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:04,410
made the devices but that communication

00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:06,180
bi-directional if during those periods

00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:08,820
where you have limited cell reception

00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:10,470
and you're communicating back using SMS

00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:14,280
if you were to make a request from your

00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:18,240
I guess you your pores what happens to

00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:19,740
those requests similarly if you've got

00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,599
limited if you've got a limited network

00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:24,210
available what happens to those requests

00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:28,500
to do is get lost or what happens to

00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:30,960
them if you lost a network yeah usually

00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:33,290
is there is no cases as I switches to

00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,119
another network in less than a second

00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:38,700
okay so it's always connected if there

00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:42,660
is a any GSM available in this area yeah

00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:44,790
it will be always connected but in

00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:46,290
instances but like so one of the

00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:48,599
diagrams you put up or one of the things

00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:51,210
you put up said if you had limited G

00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:52,740
like Style Network you would fall back

00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:54,980
and just start sending SMS messages

00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:58,560
which implies that you don't have enough

00:38:54,980 --> 00:39:01,140
data to make API requests from your

00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,550
devices so what happens to the requests

00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:05,880
coming from your portal to those devices

00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:07,740
today get why was them yeah as a

00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,960
resource requests and their processes

00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:14,390
events and it's its own network yeah

00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:14,390
okay yeah okay

00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:29,470
i if your sensor is broken by still

00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:31,780
sending the data how do we detect net if

00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:38,380
a sensor is broken but still sending the

00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:40,810
data yeah how do you detect net usually

00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:42,460
there is like a check system on a sensor

00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:45,160
which says for example something is

00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:48,100
wrong and you can see it's immediately

00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:50,710
on your web portal that something is

00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:56,190
wrong so you can connect and check if

00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:59,350
it's a mistake in if it's a physical

00:39:56,190 --> 00:40:03,760
damage or not I mean if you don't see

00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:07,150
any problem with during debugging so

00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:10,600
probably it's a physical and then the

00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:14,110
only way just to send someone and draw

00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:17,230
it out so you don't analyze net they'd

00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:20,050
have to know of course with magnet or

00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:22,480
data and if there is that's what I told

00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:28,240
you but it's possible to limit that your

00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:31,780
device is not sending like you everyone

00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:34,120
understand that for example it's if it's

00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:37,240
an alarm system it will use about one

00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:39,580
megabyte during one month and of course

00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:42,910
if it starts sending like 50 megabytes

00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:45,460
something is wrong then you will monitor

00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:47,080
all this we have a lot a lot team you

00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:49,540
receive an alerting that it's not

00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:52,690
typical behavior for the device then you

00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:54,810
start to investigate what's wrong thank

00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:54,810
you

00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:10,190
any more questions let's all create IOT

00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:14,480
devices it's very cheap and I can give

00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:17,350
you connectivity solution okay thank you

00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,350
