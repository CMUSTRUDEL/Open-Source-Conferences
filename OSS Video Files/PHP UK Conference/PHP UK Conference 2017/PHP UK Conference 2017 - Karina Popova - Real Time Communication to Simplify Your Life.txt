Description: 
	An implicit goal of developing applications is to increase level of communication. A connectivity is becoming an integral part of IoT projects. What would you think if you have the connectivity wherever your IoT sensor is, your own independent cloud based network, extremely scalable and globally distributed. Nowadays SIM cards and endpoints can be easily managed in real-time via an intuitive user-interface or an easy-to-integrate API. The developing process, security issues and key features will be discussed together with lots of real working IoT use cases based on PHP.
