Title: PHP UK Conference 2017 - Dave Ward - Preparing your Dockerised Application for Production
Publication date: 2017-04-03
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2017
Description: 
	You’ve got your application dockerised for development. That process is working smoothly, and you’re gaining a lot of the benefits that docker gives you - environments are trivial to setup, independent of platform, and they are consistent for everyone on your team. How do you go about taking the next step so that your application is deployed into a scalable and reliable production setup? How do you create deployment artefacts which are built with consistency and transparency? How do you manage environment variables between staging and production environments? How do you perform actions / schedule processes in one environment and not another? In this talk we will discuss what you need to do to get your dockerised application ready for deployment into a production environment.
