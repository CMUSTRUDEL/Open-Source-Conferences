Title: PHP UK Conference 2017 - Derick Rethans - Its All About The Goto
Publication date: 2017-04-03
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2017
Description: 
	Don't worry, this is not about the goto keyword. In this presentation, I am showing you some of the inner workings of PHP. We are going to look at how different language keywords and constructs are handled internally. Basically, everything is converted to goto, but the how and why, is not as simple as it seems! This is a very in depth talk, mostly interesting to people that want to know how PHP works internally. Expect lots of wonkyness, a form of assembly, and trees.
