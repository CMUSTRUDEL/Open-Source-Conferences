Description: 
	Decoupling, abstracting and ungluing your applications has been something that people have been talking about for years.

How far are we from having the ability to package re-usable web-focussed widgets that can be composed into applications? What would a world where libraries were all non-framework specific that could be glued in look like? Lets have a look at how far we've come as an industry and what the future could hold.
