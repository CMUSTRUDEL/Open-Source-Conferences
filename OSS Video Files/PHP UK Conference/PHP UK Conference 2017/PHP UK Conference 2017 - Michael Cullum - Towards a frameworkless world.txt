Title: PHP UK Conference 2017 - Michael Cullum - Towards a frameworkless world
Publication date: 2017-04-03
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2017
Description: 
	Decoupling, abstracting and ungluing your applications has been something that people have been talking about for years. Ultimately though, most packages still have dependencies and creating a library-abstract bundle is still hard but it's getting easier. How far are we from having the ability to package re-usable web-focussed widgets that can be composed into applications? What would a world where libraries were all non-framework specific that could be glued in look like? Lets have a look at how far we've come as an industry and what the future could hold.

	00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:13,459
towards a framework list world a

00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:15,440
framework this world how many people

00:00:13,459 --> 00:00:17,080
over the past two days which have been a

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,790
great two days I'm sure you'll all agree

00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:22,220
have been to a talk that was about a

00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,270
framework to see you hands up I'm not

00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,030
gonna make you stand up because you're

00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:28,400
all tired after two days keep you out

00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:30,080
Cuba hands up also stick your hand up if

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,610
you've worked on a project that use the

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:36,019
framework this week and join your hands

00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,629
so that any of those if you have a

00:00:36,019 --> 00:00:42,620
project in your company that uses a

00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:44,359
framework so I mean I can't quite see

00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,489
everyone but I'm pretty sure like most

00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:48,710
the hands in the room are up so I'm here

00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:50,479
talking about a framework this world in

00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,579
a world that quite obviously has quite a

00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:57,350
few frameworks that are obviously quite

00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:59,539
well used so quickly Who am I my name is

00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,710
Michael Colin and that photo looks even

00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:03,109
more ugly than it normally does when

00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:05,960
it's that large that's my Twitter handle

00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:07,490
if you want to tweet abuse at me if you

00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,320
wanted to constructive criticisms

00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:11,719
anything else you're in a talk that's

00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,399
where you can find me I can't respond

00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:16,909
I'm completely defenseless the next 30

00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:19,340
minutes so there you go I work for a

00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:21,979
company called Sam knows we're hiring we

00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,820
do cool stuff with data and api's come

00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:26,450
have a chat with me if you want talk

00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:30,950
about that I work on a project called

00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:34,240
PHP BB which is a foreign software which

00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:36,590
you probably used about 150 years ago

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,920
you probably found like security issues

00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:42,829
with it and stuff it's a bit better now

00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:46,789
still way to go and I also am a

00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:47,990
secretary of the PHP fig which is a PHP

00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:50,749
framework intro for the T group I'll

00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:52,820
mention it a bit briefly later but

00:01:50,749 --> 00:01:54,350
realistically you don't care about any

00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:57,200
of that you don't care about me I'm just

00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:59,479
a guy on a stage we want we're going to

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,710
talk about frameworks and because it's a

00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:02,600
keynote everything has to be big and

00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:07,130
important so we're going to talk about

00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:10,880
the PHP world but it's a framework as

00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:12,830
well so we'll make it dark I like

00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,780
history who likes history

00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:17,600
who likes history but hated history when

00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:21,290
they're at school yeah this is this

00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,460
would be fun history I promise but we're

00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:26,870
going to start with a date just like

00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:30,140
school so 1994 what happened in 1994

00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:32,080
Nelson Mandela became president was

00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,830
inaugurated as president of South Africa

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,780
China got the Internet

00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:37,220
that's cool that affects all of us

00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,660
especially those of us that have like

00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,510
websites that are currently used in

00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:44,510
China this are the kind of important

00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:47,290
thing happened it was kind of this guy's

00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:52,340
fault I mean I mean this guy's success

00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:54,190
does any one of his guys shutout rasmus

00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,990
yes

00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,890
he created PHP for anyone who doesn't

00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,110
know about it

00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:02,810
eli was talking yesterday about old

00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,400
schoolers and stuff and in 1994 I can

00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:08,680
confess I was one of those that he

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:11,540
mentioned that wasn't actually born so

00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,070
he created PHP as a tool

00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,200
so he could track visitors to his resume

00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:17,930
I don't think he realized the effect it

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,480
was gonna have on his resume in the long

00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:23,690
run but you know that happened and we're

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,180
all here today because of that and we've

00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,140
come quite a long way this goes to 2018

00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,190
because you know we're always

00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,660
forward-thinking right

00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,790
his developers we're always thinking

00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:35,120
about what we're doing next except for

00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:41,060
like half the time so we're over here

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:42,350
2017 PHP 3 over there in 1998 1998 was

00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:49,310
when we had the zoned engine yeah big

00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:50,330
whoop yeah go on ok that was pathetic we

00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:55,550
can have a bigger boot for this one no

00:03:50,330 --> 00:04:01,310
PHP 7 in 2015 there we go that's much

00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:05,720
better so we've come a long way who

00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:07,670
remembers PHP lab in 1998 like I see

00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,600
like four hands five hands and I don't

00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,860
think that's just because I can't see

00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,780
any of you

00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:15,019
PHP live was kind of like the first

00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:16,400
framework it I recently tweeted out and

00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:18,859
I was working on this talk I was like

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,700
who has a release date for the PHP live

00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:22,910
because I didn't know what year it was

00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:25,730
and the response I got was from one of

00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:27,620
the initial guys who worked on it and

00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:29,050
he sent me an email to the mailing list

00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,930
where it was kind of being announced and

00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:34,010
basically it was sessions handling yeah

00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,810
I mean not a huge amount but

00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:37,880
realistically in that day that was a

00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,140
framework right it provided a couple of

00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,210
features that use in what a lot of

00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:44,780
applications and we call that a

00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:49,240
framework right 2005

00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:52,340
simply one who used Symphony one whoo

00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:56,060
okay yeah okay that's a fair enough

00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:59,900
reaction is simply one that was kind of

00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:02,300
like the first proper framework you took

00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,920
this big thing called Symphony and you

00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,210
built a project around it and you had

00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,760
this big application that was called a

00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:09,410
symphony application and it did some

00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,910
horrible things but it kind of gave you

00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,990
a structure to your application and it

00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,640
meant that we could stop using all of

00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:18,290
those homegrown frameworks of your side

00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:23,180
of building ourselves 2006 who remembers

00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:27,590
cakephp who still uses cakephp okay a

00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:29,210
few fee for coding right sir I seen my

00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:33,320
companies like raised our hands we don't

00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:34,940
eat we don't use it anymore and then

00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,310
frameworks I'm for anyone whose uses use

00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,840
them very much okay but this was

00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:42,560
temporary what one so frame what one is

00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:44,450
very different design framework - yeah

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,660
just like Symphony Symphony one Symphony

00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:48,920
do and then there was kind of like a

00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,810
little lull for a couple of years and

00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,980
then there's this framework that I can

00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:54,770
never remember actually how to pronounce

00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:57,500
although David I think is here you wanna

00:05:54,770 --> 00:06:01,850
shout it out David okay no he's gone

00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:06,200
home nevermind long weekend and then we

00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:08,900
get to 2011 and this happens this is

00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,490
ridiculous just so so we have fuel PHP

00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,680
we have aura

00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:16,150
we have lithium we have symphony - we

00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:19,910
have laravel all of these kind of pop up

00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:23,080
and we have composer pop up now composer

00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:26,180
was initially created by Jordi and Niels

00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:28,100
Niels used to be the lead of lead

00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,300
developer of PHP and he initially

00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,650
created composer because it was like

00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,750
pitch room we need a way to do package

00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:34,670
management we need a way that we can

00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,810
have all of these extensions and styles

00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:38,030
and they can all work together and

00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:39,279
depend on each other so he created

00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,839
started working on composer

00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:43,119
and then he had to chat with Fabian

00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:46,869
potentia the lead developer / Symphony

00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:48,129
at simply live and Geordie was there and

00:06:46,869 --> 00:06:49,569
Geordie was like hey I can help out with

00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:51,549
this because Symphony is having a

00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:54,429
similar problems anyone we use have that

00:06:51,549 --> 00:06:57,789
EPS file and Symphony yeah it was kind

00:06:54,429 --> 00:07:01,299
of ugly right so we solved that problem

00:06:57,789 --> 00:07:03,249
and thre implemented composer this year

00:07:01,299 --> 00:07:04,559
so we took kind of a long time after we

00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:08,139
then invented it

00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:12,099
but yeah so huge advent of frameworks in

00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:14,049
2011 and then in 2012 two things

00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:17,619
happened we had and one extra framework

00:07:14,049 --> 00:07:19,899
Falcon and we had the pitch roof rig it

00:07:17,619 --> 00:07:22,299
was you know initially created the first

00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:23,259
seven meeting of the PHP fake I'll talk

00:07:22,299 --> 00:07:28,059
a bit more about what that is in a

00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:31,209
minute but then there's nothing there is

00:07:28,059 --> 00:07:32,589
nothing between 2012 and I'm gonna say

00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:33,729
2018 because I'm hoping none of you are

00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:35,379
going to invent a framework in the next

00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:36,819
10 minutes although if someone goes and

00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:38,859
like writes one now at Bruce Lee Rock

00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:42,549
then obviously he didn't pay attention

00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:44,949
to the whole framework list bit but so

00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:47,199
we have have this big vowel here my

00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:51,669
parrot my thing is not working so that's

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:53,169
not helpful between 1994 and 2005 we had

00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:55,539
no frameworks we lived in a framework

00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:57,809
this world well we had pitch free

00:07:55,539 --> 00:08:00,579
liberal whatever then we had a lull

00:07:57,809 --> 00:08:02,439
because we had some stuff in 2005-2006

00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:03,999
then we had all of this in 2011 it was

00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:05,469
like yeah we have composed that we have

00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:07,719
libraries we have all of this stuff we

00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:08,309
can include it's great and then nothing

00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:11,769
again

00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:14,319
so did every PHP developer just stopped

00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:18,759
developing PHP at that point obviously

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:20,289
not because we're also here practiced so

00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:23,619
if we look back to kind of 2012 and

00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:25,089
packages started this is an exponential

00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:27,099
graph essentially it's not very smooth

00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:31,019
everyone likes the smooth graph but like

00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:33,129
they never really are are they a

00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:34,959
ridiculous number of installs you can't

00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:36,959
read these numbers down here but it says

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,610
basically 4 million packages installed

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:43,120
and if we look at the number of symphony

00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:45,009
downloads that's now almost 700 million

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,660
downloads if we look at the Zen

00:08:45,009 --> 00:08:48,699
framework that's about 150 million

00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:52,000
downloads if we look at laravel that's

00:08:48,699 --> 00:08:52,779
30 million downloads so that means that

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,240
00:08:52,779 --> 00:09:00,759
percent of all downloads from packages

00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:03,459
are Symphony 18% that's ridiculous

00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:06,790
if we include zem framework and laravel

00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:09,550
in that number that number is 24% that's

00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:14,170
that's a quarter of all downloads of

00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:15,670
packages our frameworks so frameworks

00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,199
are a big deal which puts me in a

00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,850
problem because I submitted an abstract

00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:24,040
to this conference and the talk title

00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:27,279
was towards a framework as well so where

00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,480
does this leave us what if I told you

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,569
the frameworks meant actually frameworks

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,499
I have found a fix for this I found I

00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:34,899
worked out how we're in a very

00:09:32,499 --> 00:09:38,980
weightless world because for Mozart

00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:40,749
frameworks if you look at the symphony

00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,269
top down loaded packages this comes from

00:09:40,749 --> 00:09:45,699
their website and they pull that from

00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:47,410
from composer so air from packages API

00:09:45,699 --> 00:09:49,629
rather so I try I trust I trust these

00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:51,639
numbers as much as I can although

00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:52,899
realistically those numbers will be

00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:54,009
slightly off because they did like zip

00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:55,870
downloads at the beginning of their time

00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:58,990
so but we can we think we can we can

00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:00,819
roll with this so we've got like event

00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:02,860
dispatcher we got console got yang or

00:10:00,819 --> 00:10:04,930
finder process blob of of are all of

00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:07,089
these different components Symphony

00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:12,309
itself the actual symfony framework its

00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:14,529
15th 15th it's kind of low right

00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:18,569
framework bundle is like not even on

00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:24,250
that the top view if I look at the end

00:10:18,569 --> 00:10:26,079
it's kind of the same there 7th but yeah

00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,389
it's still not the top there the

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:32,920
framework is not the most downloaded

00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:34,750
part of the framework and if we look at

00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,550
aura and laravel then it's kind of a

00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:39,220
similar kind of solution laravel is a

00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:40,809
bit M is a lot less componentized in the

00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:43,420
way that it kind of operates as a layer

00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:44,529
but it's even that is the same if you

00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,579
look at all the downloads of all the

00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:47,319
different laravel components are

00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:48,399
actually more than laravel itself and if

00:10:47,319 --> 00:10:51,120
you look at aura that's very

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,120
componentized

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,129
so if we actually look at the number of

00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:58,839
downloads of those actual frameworks of

00:10:57,129 --> 00:11:04,149
the symphony framework of Zend framework

00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:07,019
of laravel we're not with 35 million now

00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:10,180
considering I was talking about

00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:11,680
900 million just a few moments ago 900

00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:15,660
million downloads for frameworks and now

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,589
we're talking about 35 million as tiny

00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,790
we all feel like we're using frameworks

00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:22,300
but actually it turns out we're really

00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:25,060
not this this bar chart on the left this

00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,829
bit just that bit down there that's

00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,899
frameworks out of all downloads on

00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:31,300
packages and on the right-hand side we

00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:34,810
have all of these other libraries these

00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:36,310
components of frameworks because we live

00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:39,189
read all the things cuz everyone loves a

00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:42,819
library right who likes a library who'd

00:11:39,189 --> 00:11:44,920
like some library with books how does

00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:51,009
how at a tech conference does that get a

00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:54,399
bigger whoop anyway I love books to like

00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:57,430
yeah sorry I get I get it we live read

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,899
all the things we like libraries and the

00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:03,100
reason for that is that frameworks on

00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:05,079
frameworks yeah I found my solution your

00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:08,009
application should have three things in

00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:15,000
it it should have your business logic

00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:16,899
libraries and glue nothing else nothing

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,040
who thinks that they have something else

00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:21,639
in one of their applications that's not

00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:23,050
one of these three things you're wrong

00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:24,759
and I can say that cuz I'm on stage and

00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:26,170
you're not however feel free to come and

00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:27,279
like just dispute that with me later I'm

00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,540
just gonna say that for the sake of it

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,550
I'm actually curious as to what your

00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:34,240
actual thing is so business logic what

00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:35,139
the hell's business business logic your

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,699
business logic is the stuff that

00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:38,740
actually matters to application that's

00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:40,420
saying that if we want this specific one

00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:43,569
this specific endpoint at this specific

00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:46,120
URL we can do this thing and output this

00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:47,680
kind of data and we can send this thing

00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,439
to cash but the thing is is that we

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,870
don't actually put it in the cash we

00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:54,939
tell monologue to put it in a log in

00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:57,610
library or we tell Symphony cash to cash

00:12:54,939 --> 00:12:59,050
it that's done by libraries the

00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:03,220
libraries is all of your technical stuff

00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:04,959
that's stuff that does stuff that's

00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,220
things like monologue but also its

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,449
things like internal tools are quite

00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,769
often you'll end up accidentally

00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:10,029
integrating into your business logic

00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:12,189
because you're never going to need it in

00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:13,420
that one place if you're sitting stuffed

00:13:12,189 --> 00:13:15,699
with cash if you're persisting stuff to

00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:18,300
a file system if you're retrieving stuff

00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:20,140
from a file system if you're doing your

00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,340
processing your requests

00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:24,920
symphonie requests Symphony response in

00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:28,490
an HTTP Colonel foundation that's a

00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:30,410
library it's not a framework and then

00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:31,700
finally we have our glue and this is

00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:34,190
basically what a framework is a

00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,970
framework is glue a framework is glue

00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,920
between all of these different

00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,940
components

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,510
it's a glue between your event

00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:43,970
dispatcher your container your cashing

00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:45,080
library and not all of that is part of

00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:47,180
your framework bundle in your vendor

00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,790
directory sometimes that's your

00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:52,400
configuration in your Yammer files or if

00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:53,780
you're slightly insane or your XML files

00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:58,850
and annotations if you're slightly less

00:13:53,780 --> 00:14:01,160
insane that's a bit opinionated but so

00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:02,300
and it's also got your structure your

00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,260
structure of your application you know

00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,060
do you have a source directory you have

00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:09,680
an app directory that's all kind of glue

00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:12,140
so and this is this is a word I made up

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,270
by the way this is not a typo if you

00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:15,710
being library agnostic I reckon that we

00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:19,070
should say it we should say that this is

00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:22,190
library magnetism so I'm inventing this

00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:23,450
word because I feel like it library

00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:25,460
agnate ism what does that mean it means

00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:27,650
that you can swap out a library during

00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:29,240
development that's solid principles

00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:31,180
right everyone follows since solid

00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:35,960
principles everyone likes solid solid is

00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:37,070
solid dependency inversion principle

00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,560
says that you should depend on the

00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:41,060
abstractions and not concretions so you

00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,900
should be able to swap out libraries you

00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,780
shouldn't be depending on a specific

00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:46,940
library you can use the tools at work

00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:48,860
for the job instead of saying hey I'm

00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,180
just going to use Symphony or hey I'm

00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:52,220
just gonna use an framework you can do

00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:54,050
what Drupal do because Drupal look doing

00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,190
good things right now and you can use a

00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:57,260
bit of some framework and you can use a

00:14:55,190 --> 00:15:00,589
little bit of Symphony that's perfectly

00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:02,420
fine if that's what does the job and you

00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:06,560
can drop in replacements so Garry who

00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:08,030
did a keynote yesterday afternoon he

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,980
told me a story a little while back I

00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:11,900
think it was a pitch free world and he

00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:14,270
said that he disliked symphonies

00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:16,820
container or just like pimple weight

00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:18,530
rather that's perfectly fine that's an

00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,180
opinion heat why he didn't even

00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:22,640
necessarily just liked it he just refers

00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:24,589
ends which is cool because he is the

00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,050
lead maintainer and service container so

00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:28,790
it kind of makes sense slightly biased

00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:31,160
but it means that when he goes and uses

00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:33,470
a micro framework or whatever if it's

00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:37,610
implementing some interfaces he

00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:38,570
just droppin whatever he feels like but

00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:41,350
then you kind of get this thing called

00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:43,340
dependency he'll who has dependency hell

00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:44,570
quite a few of you if you don't have

00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:47,480
dependency hell you probably do and

00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,680
composer to solves it for you you can

00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,210
have library one and it can say hey I

00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,400
require monologue Symphony cash and

00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:53,930
pimple I have library - and it say hey

00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,000
we were quite anal gas stations and

00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:57,860
framework library 3 says hey I want

00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,210
analog PHP cache in PHP lead container

00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,910
and then your business logic has a

00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:05,840
completely different set of requirements

00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:07,010
and that's hard so we develop interfaces

00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,480
and we say that all of these different

00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:10,490
libraries if they intimate implement

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,920
these interfaces then you're not

00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:16,130
depending on monologue anymore you're

00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:18,770
just depending on three things for

00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:20,740
interfaces and those different libraries

00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:22,250
can implement them however they need to

00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,020
and provide that additional

00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,970
functionality that might be appropriate

00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:27,830
for your use case because you should be

00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:30,200
using what is relevant to you and not

00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:32,690
just whatever a certain library forces

00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,160
you to use I don't want my caching

00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:37,190
library to dictate my logging library I

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,080
want to detain my login library so we go

00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:42,140
from 10 dependencies so just 3 which I

00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,310
chose I call myself a symphony developer

00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,510
so I went first symphony caching

00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:48,230
Symphony dependency reduction container

00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:50,540
you can do whatever you like so I said

00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:52,430
I've mentioned a fake very briefly what

00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:54,250
is the fake it's kind of a bit like PHP

00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:58,310
Congrats

00:16:54,250 --> 00:17:02,720
this is a photo of Obama speaking at the

00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:06,770
PHP Congress this this totally happened

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:09,260
about three years ago yeah it sounds

00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:13,070
like in PHP we trust top so yeah

00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:15,410
PHP Congress well I mean what do I mean

00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:17,510
by that what do I mean mother so PHP

00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:18,880
Congress it's a bunch of people that

00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:20,510
come together to come together

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,770
representing different parts of the

00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:23,450
ecosystem

00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:25,010
and whether that's from different

00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:27,620
projects you can call them States if you

00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:29,540
want and also from the community with

00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:32,270
the new big three and you can elect

00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:33,500
community representatives it's also a

00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:35,840
bit like the UN because you know we

00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,430
argue a lot we don't disagree on things

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,940
we don't agree you're always agree on

00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:43,580
things but the idea is it's designed to

00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:45,860
represent this huge diverse group of

00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:49,120
people of

00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:50,960
huge diverse group of different projects

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,370
it's called the PHP framework

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,870
interoperability group which of course

00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:55,730
is a problem because I just said we're

00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:57,470
in a framework less world so just

00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:01,399
pretend it's like a standards group or

00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:03,860
an interoperability group so I was

00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:05,960
talking about those different PSRs or

00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:08,240
interfaces that we could be moving over

00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,610
to and that sounds appear to be Sanders

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,299
recommendation and a lot of them are

00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:15,409
interfaces some of them do other things

00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:19,250
but I don't really care about the

00:18:15,409 --> 00:18:22,549
minister so these interfaces they're

00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:24,019
great right they allow for and there's

00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:30,529
that word again

00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:34,659
framework agnosticism and this is really

00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:37,100
important because we no longer a

00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:39,980
symphony application or a Zen framework

00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:44,570
application or a larval application with

00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:45,980
PHP applications and we're just having

00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,750
mean what you know might be the choice

00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,710
that you a bunch of Symphony components

00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,600
work for you I

00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,889
I said earlier the symphony cache and

00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,620
symphony dependency injection worked for

00:18:51,889 --> 00:18:55,399
me so I pulled them those two those two

00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,750
different things

00:18:55,399 --> 00:18:58,070
I doesn't mean that I've got a symphony

00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,799
application I have a PHP application

00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:03,440
that uses symphony if I decided to then

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,549
put in the Zen service container I'm not

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,350
suddenly using a ZEM framework

00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:08,929
application ie just having to be doing

00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:10,789
that this applies to people to who in

00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:12,049
the room describes himself simply

00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:16,279
druthers and frame where developer

00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:18,440
laravel developer yeah I'm perfectly

00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:19,700
happy to say that I if you look at my

00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,190
Twitter bio I'm pretty sure it probably

00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:25,549
says I'm a back-end Symphony developer I

00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:26,600
work a lot with symphony but I off this

00:19:25,549 --> 00:19:30,500
talk I should definitely change that

00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,850
because I as a developer should become

00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,399
framework agnostic as well as my

00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:37,029
applications ultimately the the

00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:40,490
framework all that is is your glue and

00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:42,529
your glue should be up to you focus on

00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:44,120
the libraries that you're using focus on

00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:48,919
your business logic because that's

00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:50,950
really what you care about your

00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:55,039
applications if you make these

00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:56,659
completely framework agnostic that's not

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,760
really a thing because you still have

00:19:56,659 --> 00:19:59,779
your glue in your applications right

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,249
your glue is still

00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:02,960
really important your glue is what

00:20:01,249 --> 00:20:03,950
brings your application together but it

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,659
shouldn't really matter what your glue

00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:10,159
actually really is your libraries if

00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:12,409
you're developing a library

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,639
then why develop a library for Symphony

00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:16,639
when you could develop a library for

00:20:13,639 --> 00:20:18,379
every single framework and then just

00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:20,749
have glue packages have a bundle

00:20:18,379 --> 00:20:22,340
Symphony have a service provider for

00:20:20,749 --> 00:20:24,289
laravel you can someone can just shop

00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:26,570
into their project immediately you've

00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:27,950
just stopped having 30 million people

00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:31,489
from being able to use your project and

00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:33,349
had a few hundred million and finally

00:20:31,489 --> 00:20:36,259
yourselves if you can make yourselves

00:20:33,349 --> 00:20:37,369
more framework agnostic then it means

00:20:36,259 --> 00:20:38,479
you're a lot more versatile if you go

00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:41,169
into a new job and you suddenly have

00:20:38,479 --> 00:20:43,940
site using a new framework that's great

00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:45,710
but I think we should actually bear in

00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,279
mind the fact that we're just not simply

00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,960
developers

00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:52,419
we're not seven framework developers all

00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:55,820
just PHP developers Matthew where if any

00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:59,450
great guy Gary also spoke his praises

00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:00,799
yesterday he created a blog post which

00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:04,129
you can go and find actually down here

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,989
and he made this quote he was talking

00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:07,219
about composer and having lots of

00:21:05,989 --> 00:21:09,739
different packages and he said the

00:21:07,219 --> 00:21:11,779
logical implication of the composer is

00:21:09,739 --> 00:21:14,029
the ability to package reusable web

00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:14,899
focus widgets that can be composed into

00:21:14,029 --> 00:21:18,019
applications

00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:21,200
that's very long-winded sway of saying

00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:22,729
that why do we have to have a symphony

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,830
bundle why do we have to have a Lera

00:21:22,729 --> 00:21:27,440
bundle why can't we just have a whole

00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:30,109
bunch of libraries and build their

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,149
applications because as developers

00:21:30,109 --> 00:21:34,969
that's what we do we build applications

00:21:32,149 --> 00:21:36,259
we don't build Symphony applications we

00:21:34,969 --> 00:21:38,089
don't build some framework applications

00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:42,460
we don't care about that we don't need

00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:42,460
to thank you very much

00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,960
