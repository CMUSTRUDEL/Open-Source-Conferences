Title: PHP UK Conference 2017 - Eli White - State of the PHP Community
Publication date: 2017-04-03
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2017
Description: 
	PHP is sitting at an all time high for usage, with it running over 80% of the world’s websites. But how healthy is the PHP Community? In this talk we will examine the good and the bad of the PHP community and talk through some of the pain points that we may have experienced. But we’ll leave understanding the power of the community when it works together and understand why (and how) you should be helping to grow the community circle larger.

	00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:10,250
so I'm here today to talk to you about

00:00:06,649 --> 00:00:12,500
the state of the PHP community now when

00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:16,369
they mentioned that this is probably

00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:21,560
what you were expecting a discussion of

00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:24,410
pain suffering despair agony but what I

00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:27,020
want to give you today is a talk of hope

00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:30,259
I want to paint a different picture of

00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:34,960
the community they includes hope growth

00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:37,580
and future so before we do that however

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,400
for everybody else in the room who

00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:42,530
didn't chuckle at that first slide we

00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,200
need to review the pain that the PHP

00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,540
community has been through to know where

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,960
we're coming from and we certainly had a

00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:55,360
fair bit of it first of all there's

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:58,130
internals a very special special place

00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,760
internals has had its history of vitriol

00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:03,230
of being unwelcoming it's a place where

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:10,220
definitely there have been plenty of

00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:15,290
flame wars and even personal attacks PHP

00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:17,150
7 itself giving PHP 7 out had a lot of

00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:19,700
pain there was a lot of controversy

00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:22,670
about it there was controversy about

00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,350
scalar type amps whether we wanted them

00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:26,690
or whether we didn't and once it was

00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:28,340
decided we did want them what type of

00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:30,409
scalar type since they would be how they

00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:33,500
would be implemented when all of that

00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:36,020
was going down a lot of controversy came

00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,580
up about voting techniques people

00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,890
campaigning for votes

00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:42,140
the timing of requests that were being

00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:44,659
put in and people maybe trying to put

00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:47,540
requests in for a vote beyond time

00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:50,119
periods and other people can looking at

00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:52,460
that differently there was just a lot of

00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:54,560
mess happening around that time there

00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:58,760
was even a lot of controversy about the

00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:01,159
name itself PHP 7 vs. PHP 6 I will fully

00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,900
admit I was one of the instigators there

00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:05,540
I was the one who actually wrote up a

00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:08,119
very large email to the list explaining

00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:11,409
the reasons why I really felt it should

00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:13,879
be PHP 7 which led to zebb zorroski

00:02:11,409 --> 00:02:16,120
making the actual RFC and bringing it to

00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:16,120
a vote

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:21,780
we've also got fig the framework

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,480
interoperability group fake has seen a

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:27,060
lot of fireworks over its days not that

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,510
long ago they actually had for the first

00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,970
time in their organization had to have a

00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:35,610
vote and go to a vote about potentially

00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:39,020
pushing a certain member out the vote

00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:42,300
ended up failing everything is fine

00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:44,580
however there was a lot of infighting

00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,100
that came with that right there were a

00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,020
lot of people upset that there was even

00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,790
a need to go to a vote people that were

00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,100
upset that the vote didn't happen or

00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,810
didn't happen the way that it did there

00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,060
were a lot of people who left fig at

00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:05,220
that time a lot of people who have not

00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:07,260
come back there's also been a fair bit

00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:10,050
of shutdown happening within the

00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:13,800
community which maybe not everyone is

00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:15,210
quite as aware of Irun conferences for a

00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,300
living I run technical conferences

00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:20,760
specifically I run PHP conferences the

00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,130
way often that people who run PHP

00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,720
conferences get the word out the easiest

00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,850
way to get the word out is to reach out

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,140
to all the user groups because you reach

00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,640
out to the user groups you let them know

00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,770
they let their all their members know

00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,890
it's easy it's easy to get the word out

00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:37,440
however that puts us conference

00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:39,390
organisers in a unique place to sort of

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,030
see what's happening amongst all the

00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:45,360
user groups out there and across the

00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:47,940
world there has been a lot of groups

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,640
that are going inactive a number of

00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,230
groups that's completely shut down being

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,600
that I am from the US I have a couple

00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,250
specific examples from there that I can

00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,370
easily refer to in my mind

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:01,830
New York PHP which was one of the

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,720
biggest or is I believe the biggest user

00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:07,500
group dedicated to a specific city not a

00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:09,590
greater region for PHP did not meet for

00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:13,320
11 months straight

00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:17,940
Baltimore PHP did not meet for 18 months

00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:20,100
straight st. Louis PHP absolutely shut

00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,440
down and went inactive and is gone of

00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:25,740
course they did that six months before

00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:29,460
we move to conference there however a

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:31,230
lot of that has been happening

00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,510
the community itself has also been

00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:36,330
fragmenting within fragmenting in a lot

00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:38,190
of different ways in some parts it's

00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:41,070
people moving over to auxilary groups

00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:42,720
people from the PHP community moving to

00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,550
the Drupal community or the WordPress

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,650
community or the laravel community and

00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:49,650
separating themselves from the greater

00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:53,250
PHP community we've also been

00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:55,730
fragmenting in other ways IRC vs. slack

00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:58,980
for example a lot of the older original

00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:01,020
community always hung out in IRC now

00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:03,080
lots of people have left IRC to be in

00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:05,910
slack and that has caused some tension

00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,040
there's even age fragmentation happening

00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:10,050
in the community I mentioned being part

00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,080
of the older PHP community and I have

00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:14,390
the white hairs to show it unfortunately

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,680
PHP has been around for a very long time

00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:18,630
there are people that have been in the

00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,370
community from the beginning and there

00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:23,460
are now new people joining the community

00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:25,890
every day and a lot of times the new

00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,390
folks in has different ideas of what

00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,770
they want to see other the communities

00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,660
and people that have been doing it for

00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:37,380
20 years because we get stuck in our

00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:39,300
ways and then there's reddit to quote

00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,990
George Lucas you will never find a more

00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,250
wretched hive of scum and villainy

00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:48,030
reddit is a wonderful place however

00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:50,550
unfortunately the PHP subreddit tends to

00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:52,110
be the place where all of the angst all

00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,480
of the anger all of everything negative

00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:57,030
about PHP comes to surface and comes to

00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:00,990
a head and unfortunately it is a very

00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:02,880
public place so everyone sees that all

00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:06,120
right we've talked about all of these

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:09,450
pain points but before we go any further

00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:12,150
I want to now talk about the amazing and

00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:14,520
awesome things that does exist in the

00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:17,730
community because it is not all thing

00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:20,400
there are wonderful things going on most

00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:23,490
importantly are the people in the PHP

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:26,310
community the fact is PHP is filled with

00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:30,270
amazing people in my opinion unlike any

00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:33,500
other community in fact I often try to

00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:36,480
compare the people of the PHP community

00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:39,060
to being very similar to how PHP itself

00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,580
is unlike any other open-source

00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,289
programming language in fact I know some

00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,550
people will disagree with me and in fact

00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:47,759
people in this room may disagree with me

00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:50,189
but tough I'm up here speaking PHP is

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,740
unique as an open-source language in my

00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:54,749
opinion it is the only truly open-source

00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,699
programming language and what I mean by

00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:58,529
that is yes there are lots of other open

00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:01,499
source programming languages Ruby and

00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:03,149
Python and Perl and more all of those

00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:06,449
other open-source programming languages

00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:09,210
however have one person or maybe a small

00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:12,319
core team that actually decides the

00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:14,430
future and direction of that language if

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,169
you've ever looked on the internals

00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:20,159
mailing lists you know no one is in

00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:22,979
charge of PHP PHP operates as an open

00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:24,930
democracy anybody in this room anybody

00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:28,110
in the world can have a great idea for

00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:30,689
what they want to see happen with PHP a

00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:32,520
direction they want to see PHP go you

00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:34,229
can come up with that idea you can join

00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,449
the internals mailing list you can throw

00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:39,779
that idea out there you will have to

00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:42,029
defend that idea but you can make a

00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:45,270
change and make that change happen in

00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:46,800
PHP now the fact is I'm talking about

00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:50,789
all these wonderful people and because

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:53,759
of that I don't want this talks to be

00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:56,939
just my voice I want you to listen to

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,089
the words of some others as well so

00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:01,830
first of all we have Samantha kione's

00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:05,129
she wrote an article for PHP architect

00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:07,979
magazine talking about community and in

00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:09,839
it she wrote sometimes it's hard for me

00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:12,599
to understand how warm and welcoming

00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:14,639
people can be this community opens

00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:16,379
itself up to absolutely anyone who is

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,709
willing to give even a little something

00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:21,779
back it's remarkable the community has

00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:23,639
given me so much and I feel like I can't

00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:26,789
come close to giving back in kind I

00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:28,349
think back to my very first talk feeling

00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:31,110
taken aback by all the support I was

00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:34,260
getting from these new friends what did

00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:38,760
you expect one person asked me I didn't

00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:40,169
expect this Joe Ferguson was being

00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,180
interviewed by cloud ways who has

00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:44,790
interviewed a lot of PHP developers

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:47,430
recently and in that interview they

00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:50,040
asked him about community and he said

00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:52,350
the power of the PHP community comes

00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,630
from the willingness to share we share

00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:57,180
code successes and sometimes heartbreak

00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:59,250
I have seen so many friends in

00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,960
PHP community and we all seem to have

00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:05,100
this common goal of helping anyone

00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:06,750
better themselves there's a million

00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,360
other quotes there's a million other

00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:11,280
people I did want to pull a couple quick

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,290
ones from Twitter if you search for PHP

00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,420
community you can find an amazing amount

00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:17,640
of things on Twitter but just a few of

00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,240
the ones that really drive this home to

00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,030
my mind

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,340
we have an entire Twitter account PHP

00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:26,040
hubs dedicated to sharing the love of

00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:27,360
the community their pins post is if you

00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,520
want to give kudos to a person or

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,750
project in the community tag it with PHP

00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:35,370
hubs I'll retweet and shared the love

00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:38,160
Michael Beckwith attended his very first

00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,990
PHP conference and he posted I have felt

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,420
very welcomed by what parts of the PHP

00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:44,220
community are here for PHP Cruz it's my

00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:47,430
first PHP conference outside of the

00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,840
WordPress bubble and one of my favorite

00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:52,020
ones from Zeb's are ASCII one of the

00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:53,640
architects of PHP 3 was there are

00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,680
thirteen thousand two hundred eighty

00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:59,340
nine times more love than hate in the

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:03,600
community it's only that we humans tend

00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:05,670
to focus on the bad and not the good now

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,190
we talked about the negativity that

00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:10,350
happened with getting PHP seven out but

00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:13,410
the fact is PHP seven is out and it is

00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:15,660
amazing we have scalar type imps we have

00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:18,450
return types most importantly we have a

00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:21,510
70 to 300% speed increase by just

00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:26,520
installing PHP seven it is faster than

00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:29,070
hhv m for many use cases now there are

00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:32,490
also a lot of amazing projects being

00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:35,550
built by members of the community for

00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:38,190
example we have PHP ug a great website

00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:40,140
you can go and see every single user

00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:42,480
group in the world see when they're

00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,920
meeting anywhere you travel it's easy to

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,100
go and look and see where you could

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,200
attend a user group we have PHP map

00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:53,340
which builds on top of that which not

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:55,650
only lists the user groups out there but

00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,780
you yourself can put a dot on that map

00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:59,610
for you showing you our PHP developer

00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:02,640
and where you are and that you are

00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:04,950
willing to connect to anyone and to help

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,800
in to collaborate and you can find PHP

00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:09,930
developers this way and then I talked

00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,980
earlier about IRC versus slack but we

00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:13,560
now have this am a

00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,750
using PHP ugh slack channel if you are

00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,329
not part of it I charge you all to go

00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:21,420
join us go to PHP ug and on the bottom

00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:24,089
there is a link to get an invites to

00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,560
this flat it is I am not sure how many

00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:27,360
thousands of people are on it at the

00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,820
moment but not only is everyone on it

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,139
but a number of different PHP user

00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,790
groups have all made their own sub

00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:34,380
channels on it and are having

00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,850
conversations and there's channels to

00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:39,300
learn about conferences and call for

00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:41,880
papers and all sorts of things and this

00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:44,010
is just a sampling of some of the

00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:48,300
projects that the PHP community has been

00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:51,029
putting out for the community we also do

00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,829
a lot of really good things for example

00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:55,380
there has been a big push in the

00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:57,839
community recently to bring a lot of

00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:00,269
awareness to the mental health problem

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,100
that exists not just in our community

00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:06,410
but the developer community at large

00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:09,660
a lot of this push has been from this

00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:11,910
project nonprofits that has started up

00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:14,670
open sourcing mental illness started by

00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:16,170
Ed Sinclair up there and it has been

00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:17,910
amazing the amount of help that is

00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:20,550
created and now speakers they have been

00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:24,690
providing to various conferences to talk

00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:27,449
about this very important issue the PHP

00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:30,510
community is also amazing at helping

00:12:27,449 --> 00:12:32,069
each other I have lost count of the

00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:34,139
number of times I've heard of someone in

00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:37,290
the community in need and people

00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:38,370
stepping up and helping them out I want

00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,019
to highlight one of them just because

00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:42,269
it's the most recent one that comes to

00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,019
mind that was gigantic it was for this

00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:45,930
man here

00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:49,040
Jeremy Kendall Jeremy and his wife had

00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:52,250
just had a new baby and not long after

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,779
Jeremy found himself without a job

00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:58,350
unfortunately for the job market he was

00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:59,790
in that job did not come quickly and a

00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:01,110
month went by and a couple months went

00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:05,160
by and I believe at least six months

00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:07,350
went by and again they had just had a

00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,050
baby they had all sorts of expenses they

00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:12,800
were needing to meet Jeremy himself

00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:15,449
would not step up and say he needed help

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,190
but someone else in the community who

00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:19,319
knew him and had been talking to him was

00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:22,709
a good friend realized how bad the

00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:24,700
situation was that person started a

00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:26,800
GoFundMe campaign for Jeremy and his

00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,150
wife to make sure that they could have

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,270
the money they needed to take care of

00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:34,080
their baby thousands of people went and

00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:38,080
donated tens of thousands of dollars I

00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:39,790
was talking with Jeremy afterwards and

00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,520
he was almost in tears saying how

00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:44,380
literally without the PHP community he

00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,600
did not know what they would have done

00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,650
if they would have made it that it was

00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,160
literally that bad

00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:53,470
and that's a very big case but it's

00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,450
amazing all the small things that we do

00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:57,580
to help each other out as well I can

00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,620
only speak for my own Twitter feed but

00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,070
it is constantly full at least once a

00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,290
day

00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,940
I see somebody saying hey I have a job

00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:06,430
opportunity for someone like this is

00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:07,960
anyone looking and conversely I see

00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:10,420
people going like hey I know an amazing

00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,460
senior dev or an amazing evangelist who

00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,490
needs one and people helping each other

00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:18,090
out

00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:21,520
now I also wanted to talk about growth

00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:24,550
because PHP is growing we are working

00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:29,100
through those various things so for

00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:31,570
example internals in my opinion

00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:35,560
internals has kind of seen the light it

00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:37,660
has been calming down a lot lately yes

00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,910
there are lots of people with very

00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:42,640
strong opinions who will argue very

00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:46,810
strongly for that we are all geeks we

00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:48,790
like to do that however the amount of

00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:50,760
personal attacks and flame wars that

00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:53,140
come from that has really calmed down

00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:56,650
people have realized that they need to

00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:58,870
keep a professional tone I think part of

00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:01,180
that is somewhat maybe not completely

00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:04,230
this somewhat due to another project

00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:07,000
formed by the PHP community external CEO

00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:08,830
which is a very public very easy to

00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,380
access very pretty

00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:12,820
archive of the internals mailing lists

00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:15,190
the internals mailing list has always

00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:16,810
been public but you had to know the

00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:18,280
magic URL to go through and it was

00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,510
really ugly and a lot of people

00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,820
therefore didn't go look at it

00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:23,860
I have actually seen for example in

00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,660
external study Oh help out on Reddit

00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,370
where in the past someone would just

00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,710
post something if can you believe what

00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:31,900
so-and-so said on internals and a flame

00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:33,790
war erupts on reddit now when someone

00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,740
posts that I often see someone else

00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:37,960
going oh here's actually the link to

00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:39,340
what they said on external study Oh

00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,960
and everyone actually goes and reads it

00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:42,700
and goes oh actually that wasn't that

00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:46,690
bad you're taking it out of context and

00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:49,630
so it has helped out in fact throughout

00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:51,780
the PHP community I see a lot of new

00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:54,700
beginnings happening and blank slates as

00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:57,370
people are seeing that changes needed

00:15:54,700 --> 00:16:00,070
and growth has to happen for example

00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:01,990
right now is sort of the time for figs

00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:05,560
new day they are working on

00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:07,840
restructuring figs 3.0 they are

00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,080
reformulating themselves to be much more

00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,340
of the standards group for PHP that PHP

00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,420
always wanted them to that the community

00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,610
always wanted them to be and that

00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:19,840
originally they did not want to embrace

00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:22,540
that concept in fact the community is

00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:26,050
really sort of waking up we're coming

00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:28,420
out of this extended hibernation there

00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:30,640
was a law that happened and if you look

00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:32,860
back the law started sort of and that

00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:36,130
build up to PHP seven and about the year

00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,700
before it as things started to roll

00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:38,650
forward

00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:41,050
as a lot of drama started to come out

00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:43,890
about PHP seven and all that negativity

00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:45,910
a lot of people started to drop off

00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:47,110
people just went you know I don't want

00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:50,290
anything to do with this right now I'm

00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:52,960
stepping away for a bit then PHP seven

00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:54,580
itself came out and a lot of the people

00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,070
who were pushing so hard and working

00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:59,950
hard to get it out stepped back because

00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:00,640
they were now tired well that's been a

00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:03,150
while now

00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:05,860
the HP sevens been out for over a year

00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:07,660
things are starting to come back all of

00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:09,810
those developers who had stepped out for

00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:12,040
a while are now starting to come back

00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:14,440
things are starting to wake back up for

00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:16,570
example I talked earlier about how those

00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:19,390
New York PHP and Baltimore PHP had not

00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:22,120
met for 11 or 18 months respectively I

00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:24,160
am very happy to announce that within

00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,930
the last couple months both of those

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:32,890
user groups have started having meetings

00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:36,820
again so what does the future hold then

00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:40,690
for the PHP community where can we go

00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:44,980
from here the problem is we have a

00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:48,730
problem of size now what I'm saying is

00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:50,440
that we've really gotten too big but at

00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:54,220
the same time

00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:56,500
we're thinking too small and what I mean

00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:59,530
by that is that PHP is huge

00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:02,590
we are the elephant in the room we run

00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:05,020
82 percent of the web we have enterprise

00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:06,880
adoption we are everywhere we won if

00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:08,410
there was a competition of what

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:13,840
programming language would run the web

00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:15,990
it's us the problem is that means we

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:19,240
aren't the hip new thing anymore

00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:20,470
nobody talks about us we're just PHP

00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:25,780
that other programming language that

00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:28,180
people use what happens then is by the

00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:29,950
old-school definition for those of us

00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:32,770
who are the white hair to remember of

00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:36,820
what we considered the PHP community

00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:39,400
originally the PHP community was the

00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:42,250
internals team and their friends and

00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:45,790
followers on which all hung out in the

00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:49,030
PHP C IRC channel that was a very small

00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:52,500
community and that's what decades ago

00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:57,010
now was considered the PHP community

00:18:52,500 --> 00:19:02,500
that mental image of the community can't

00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:04,870
expand to contain 82% of the web they're

00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:07,270
estimated to be five million PHP

00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:08,890
developers in the world causing that

00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:11,800
eighty two percent of the web to happen

00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:15,250
we can't have 5 million developers all

00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:17,860
be everyone's best buds so that concept

00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:20,740
of community couldn't contain the growth

00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:25,150
that PHP was seeing and so what happened

00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:27,300
we broke apart we formed Islands people

00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:30,580
went off into these sub communities

00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:33,340
Drupal WordPress laravel symphony in

00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:35,980
fact a number of those sub communities

00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:38,290
grew big and grew strong and in many

00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:41,500
senses grew stronger than the PHP

00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:44,290
community itself we're here at one of

00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,720
the premier PHP conferences with 700

00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:48,940
people in the room

00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:52,300
Drupal conferences get 2,000 to 4,000

00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:54,070
people word press conferences get into

00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,900
thousands as well and there's a word

00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:58,690
camp every single weekend somewhere that

00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:01,750
has a few hundred people these other

00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:04,269
communities broke off grew big and grew

00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:05,830
strong the thing is

00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:10,299
work in the last couple years have

00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:11,859
happened to bridge these islands in fact

00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:14,379
but I want to tell a story about the

00:20:11,859 --> 00:20:16,809
Drupal community itself Drupal a few

00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:19,809
years ago actually started a campaign

00:20:16,809 --> 00:20:22,119
called get Drupal off the island they

00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:23,529
realized this had happened to them they

00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:26,619
realized that they were being very

00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:28,919
insular they were rebuilding things they

00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:31,929
were not looking into what was happening

00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:33,759
outside in the PHP world they realized

00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:35,799
that Drupal was built on PHP and

00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:37,809
therefore is very important to be

00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:40,179
connected and have these two canoes be

00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:41,529
connected now there was a big push there

00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:43,779
was a lot of money put behind it there

00:20:41,529 --> 00:20:46,479
was a lot of evangelist sent out to

00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:49,149
different conferences did Drupal get off

00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:52,029
the island no because it's a great

00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:54,609
island very pretty people like it but

00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:59,109
what happened was these bridges got

00:20:54,609 --> 00:21:00,940
built we now have on a regular basis PHP

00:20:59,109 --> 00:21:02,950
developers attending Drupal conferences

00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:05,979
we have Drupal developers attending PHP

00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:08,019
conferences in fact at Drupal cons now

00:21:05,979 --> 00:21:10,149
there is a dedicated PHP track and a

00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:12,489
dedicated Symphony track something they

00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:13,809
had not had in the past in fact the

00:21:12,489 --> 00:21:16,149
reason there's a dedicated Symphony

00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:17,619
track is that Drupal 8 came out as part

00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:20,499
of this get Drupal off the island push

00:21:17,619 --> 00:21:22,539
in Drupal 8 is rebuilt where they've

00:21:20,499 --> 00:21:24,729
thrown away large sections of the

00:21:22,539 --> 00:21:26,409
original Drupal code and pulled in

00:21:24,729 --> 00:21:27,579
symphony and some bits assim framework

00:21:26,409 --> 00:21:30,099
and a few other things primarily

00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:33,459
symphony and replace those parts of

00:21:30,099 --> 00:21:35,379
Drupal with that because they realized

00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:37,779
why do we for example need to write our

00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:40,269
own router when Symphony has a wonderful

00:21:37,779 --> 00:21:41,919
one we can build on top of we can

00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:44,379
contribute back to Symphony symphonies

00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:48,369
contributions come back to us we all

00:21:44,379 --> 00:21:51,549
make edged others project stronger the

00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:54,969
problem is there is a bigger task ahead

00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:58,299
of us and that's reaching what I'm going

00:21:54,969 --> 00:22:00,969
to call the third ring of developers now

00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:02,619
what do I mean the way I'm looking at

00:22:00,969 --> 00:22:04,779
the PHP community right now there are

00:22:02,619 --> 00:22:07,239
three rings so first of all you've got

00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:10,059
the core community now my modern

00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:12,159
definition of the core community is much

00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:14,739
bigger than what the definition was a

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,719
few decades ago the modern definition

00:22:14,739 --> 00:22:17,440
involves yes the internals people and

00:22:16,719 --> 00:22:20,139
Pete

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:23,350
in IRC chat rooms and in slack chat

00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:25,750
rooms it involves every single member of

00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:27,909
every single PHP user group out there it

00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:29,860
involves every single one of you and

00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:32,740
every single person who attends any PHP

00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:35,409
conference in the last few years that's

00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:36,549
a fairly large core community but those

00:22:35,409 --> 00:22:39,850
are the people who are directly

00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:42,730
connected to the PHP community then you

00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:43,899
have this other ring around them this is

00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:48,580
what I'm going to call the extended

00:22:43,899 --> 00:22:52,809
community this is now all of those other

00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:54,100
extended communities such as the

00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:56,169
application communities and the

00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,970
framework communities the people who are

00:22:56,169 --> 00:22:59,590
in the WordPress and Drupal and laravel

00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:02,529
communities who still consider

00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:04,269
themselves I am NOT a PHP developer I am

00:23:02,529 --> 00:23:06,159
a laravel developer I am NOT a PHP

00:23:04,269 --> 00:23:08,919
developer I am a WordPress developer and

00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,659
that's fine there's part of the extended

00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:12,730
community because we have those bridges

00:23:10,659 --> 00:23:15,789
we can still reach them we can still

00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:18,759
connect with them but you this is a

00:23:15,789 --> 00:23:20,679
countable number of people we hard to

00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:24,279
count but it's countable you could go to

00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:26,889
meetup find every single Meetup somewhat

00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:29,769
related to PHP count them find every

00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:31,960
single conference that is in some way

00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:34,090
related to PHP count the number of

00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,340
attendees they have you can add all that

00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:38,860
up that number does not come to 5

00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,360
million it does not come even close to

00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,500
that

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,980
maybe you count a million maybe you

00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:48,580
count 500,000 maybe it's smaller the

00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:51,190
fact is there is a very large outer ring

00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:55,509
around us of people who are developing

00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:58,389
on PHP people to whom PHP is just

00:23:55,509 --> 00:24:00,730
another language and who are not

00:23:58,389 --> 00:24:03,759
connected to the community at all at the

00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:07,929
moment and they are really hard for us

00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:10,570
to reach and part of the problem is that

00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:16,539
when that outer ring starts to get close

00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:20,590
to the inner rings if they see

00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:23,710
negativity if they see bickering if stay

00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:25,389
forbid read reddit they are not going to

00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:30,480
see a community they want to be a part

00:24:25,389 --> 00:24:34,230
of and the thing is this I

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:38,850
or 50% they're always asking this one

00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:40,380
question why so this photograph is from

00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:42,840
a conference I attended called that

00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:44,280
conference makes for wonderful phone

00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,559
conversations when you're trying to book

00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,130
a hotel room you book a hotel room for

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,490
that conference

00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:52,650
what conference that conference it's a

00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:55,679
polyglot web tech event so there are

00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:57,090
people there from with all sorts of

00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,669
different programming languages as their

00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:01,530
base language it's also a huge

00:24:59,669 --> 00:25:02,940
conference thousands of people it's also

00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:04,380
at the water park which is why it's a

00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:07,230
huge conference with thousands of people

00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:09,840
I was at this conference when you're

00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:13,410
speaking and they have an open spaces

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:16,700
uncon area and someone had signed up for

00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:20,340
slots just writing PHP question mark at

00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:22,440
the time I was a member working with PHP

00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:23,790
architect and I was there representing

00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,440
PHP architecture I was there on my

00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:27,390
bright orange shirt with my logo on it

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,000
and I went oh someone has something

00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:32,190
about PHP I should go sit in on that and

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,100
see what they're talking about so I went

00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:38,190
there and I sat down there were about 6

00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:40,770
or 7 guys there they were all very young

00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:42,660
in their early 20s and they were talking

00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:44,669
about PHP and what they're doing with it

00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:47,520
and all this and it became obvious to me

00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:50,100
listening to what they were saying that

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,570
they were all people who had very

00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:54,240
recently within the last couple years

00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:56,360
graduated from college with a degree in

00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,429
computer science or something similar

00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:01,650
went out to get their first job being a

00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:04,169
programmer the job they happen to find

00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:06,120
was that some company where the company

00:26:04,169 --> 00:26:07,590
said by the way we program in PHP and

00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:10,200
they went ok fine that's a programming

00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:12,480
language I can program they had never

00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,400
been connected to the community they

00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,010
didn't know a community existed we

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:20,040
started to talk about that they asked me

00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:21,690
what I did I'm like oh I'm with PHP

00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:24,030
architect can't you see all my shirts

00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:25,890
here we're the magazine that's been

00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:29,220
around for 13 years there's 12 years at

00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:31,169
that time for 12 years dedicated to PHP

00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:34,290
and they all looked at me and almost in

00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:37,169
unison said why why is there a magazine

00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:39,990
dedicated to PHP why would anyone do

00:26:37,169 --> 00:26:41,790
that because it's cool and you can learn

00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:44,370
things and then we got to talking more

00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:46,230
and one of the guys there

00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:49,140
was like yeah I come to this conference

00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:50,970
every year because it's the only

00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:53,640
conference I know of that has stuff

00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:55,590
about PHP in it I was like where do you

00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,380
live he's like I live in DC I'm like I

00:26:55,590 --> 00:27:00,390
run a PHP conference in DC that's

00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,800
dedicated to PHP in fact there are

00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:04,140
hundreds of conferences they indicate

00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:07,980
PHP around the world and again his

00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:09,270
answer was why he has never thought that

00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,510
someone would make a conference about

00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:14,640
just PHP to hear movie like having a

00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:17,460
conference just about C or just about

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,679
assembly there are a few of those out

00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:22,679
there but not many not like we do right

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,210
and the same thing happened we started

00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:26,490
talking I was like hey well what user

00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:27,750
groups do you belong to and a couple of

00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:28,950
them were like oh I belong to this none

00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:30,240
of that when none of them mentioned a

00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:32,309
PHP user group I'm like why don't you

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,200
belong to PHP user group and again they

00:27:32,309 --> 00:27:36,660
said why why are their user groups

00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,220
dedicated to PHP like are their assembly

00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:40,170
user groups are there C user groups I'm

00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:42,420
like well no not really and yes if you

00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:44,160
google you'll find them but hardly any

00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:46,080
compared to what we in the PHP community

00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,780
are and that's the problem is PHP

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,420
started as this small tight-knit

00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:54,150
community of people working on a really

00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:57,900
cool thing we've now expanded to the

00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:59,610
point that we are just PHP to anyone

00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,040
that is not originally part of that

00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:04,530
community we are just another

00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:07,080
programming language and therefore they

00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:09,120
don't even think that there would be a

00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,100
community or why a community would exist

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,630
around it it's just this programming

00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:15,660
language that in some cases has been

00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:21,090
around longer than they were born and so

00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:23,429
it's just always been there so I'm going

00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:28,020
to randomly say 50% of developers

00:28:23,429 --> 00:28:29,790
therefore our outside of our reach they

00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:32,309
don't belong to a user group they don't

00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:36,030
attend PHP conferences they don't

00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:37,380
consider themselves community these are

00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:39,300
the people going out there and reading

00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:42,750
crap about PHP on reddit and believing

00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:45,350
it therefore these are the people who

00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:48,510
are the nine-to-five job workers who

00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:50,520
again graduated college got the job they

00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:52,050
go to work they sit down in the cubicle

00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,240
by themselves they write PHP code all

00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:56,910
day they go home they are absolutely the

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,230
people who could benefit so much by

00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:00,419
connecting with the community the

00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:04,770
people that we would love to help show

00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:06,720
them the things that we can do the fact

00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:09,720
is we need to reach out to these people

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:13,080
at the same time we need to be positive

00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:15,480
within our own community we need to not

00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:18,210
give them a reason to see anything

00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,790
negative we need to show them the

00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:24,450
amazing community that we are we need to

00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:26,340
give them an amazing community we need

00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:30,210
to make a welcoming environment for them

00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:33,270
reach out find to these people pull them

00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:37,730
in and show them the love that the PHP

00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:40,940
community can have for them thank

00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:40,940
