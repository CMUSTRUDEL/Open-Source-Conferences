Description: 
	Growing up with Knight Rider I was sure that we'd all be talking to our computers in no time. Imagine my disappointment when I first tried a dictation app in the 90s - gruesome. Things have changed and now we're all able to have something resembling a conversation with our cell phones. But you couldn't teach it any new tricks unless your work for Apple, Google or Microsoft - how frustrating. Now with Amazon Alexa we as developer can finally create voice interfaces for our own applications. I'd like to show you how to do just that by creating an Alexa Skills Kit using an AWS Lambda function and a RESTful API to have our very own voice based Trivia game.
