Title: PHP UK Conference 2017 - Rouven WeÃŸling - Build a Trivia game using Amazon Alexa and AWS Lambda
Publication date: 2017-04-03
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2017
Description: 
	Growing up with Knight Rider I was sure that we'd all be talking to our computers in no time. Imagine my disappointment when I first tried a dictation app in the 90s - gruesome. Things have changed and now we're all able to have something resembling a conversation with our cell phones. But you couldn't teach it any new tricks unless your work for Apple, Google or Microsoft - how frustrating. Now with Amazon Alexa we as developer can finally create voice interfaces for our own applications. I'd like to show you how to do just that by creating an Alexa Skills Kit using an AWS Lambda function and a RESTful API to have our very own voice based Trivia game.

	00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:11,990
good morning oh very large yeah my name

00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,850
is Ruben I work for a company called

00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:16,160
content for I'm one of the developer

00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:18,380
inventors I'm also the sole PHP echo

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,770
system developer so all things PHP we do

00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:24,890
comes from me to request upfront this

00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:28,430
talk has a lot of Technology complexity

00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:29,660
please be rather quiet because Alexa

00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:32,419
gets easily confused when there's

00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:35,960
background noise and I'm going to life

00:00:32,419 --> 00:00:37,789
deploy code to AWS I need good Wi-Fi so

00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,679
don't download some torrents or anything

00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:41,260
and it's going to really screw up the

00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:43,729
store I don't have a backup at all

00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,559
so really quick electric company called

00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:47,659
contentful we have a content management

00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:50,089
developer platform with an API as its

00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:51,499
core that means with us you cannot just

00:00:50,089 --> 00:00:53,420
build websites you can also build much

00:00:51,499 --> 00:00:55,699
more interesting things like mobile apps

00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,829
or voice case that's why I get to play

00:00:55,699 --> 00:00:59,510
with Alexa if you all know about this

00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:02,600
come meet me afterwards I have cool

00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:05,780
socks helpful well I gave you one then

00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,729
take them back home and one last warning

00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,469
there's going to be no PHP at all in

00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:12,280
this talk so if you came here to see

00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:14,810
some PHP code this is the time to leave

00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,119
so let's get into it why do you want to

00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,920
speak to a computer oh why do I want to

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,409
speak to a computer why when I grew up

00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,030
in the 90s I watched Knight Rider I

00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:24,859
really liked the show

00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,359
night when I Section 8 is show and

00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:29,509
Germany does everything comes 10 years

00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:32,030
later so why did I love Knight Rider but

00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:34,009
first of all it was David Hasselhoff now

00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:37,659
these Germans just love him he's awesome

00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:37,659
but then also there was this

00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,849
[Music]

00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,570
this was a bit shorter than was supposed

00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:51,210
to be but hey a talking car this is

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:53,159
awesome and Kitsch wasn't the only thing

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,399
that inspired us to think how could we

00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,110
talk to all computers I'm sorry Dave I'm

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,049
afraid I can't do that

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:04,979
yes hey 9000 and I wonder how many of

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:06,030
you'd know this one yeah that's what

00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,979
four more games

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,720
he doesn't you can't talk to him but at

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:12,780
least he talks back to you so stay

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:17,430
pretty cool so talking with computers

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:19,200
it's awesome in the movies because let's

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,200
look at the realities at the one two 90s

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,430
and this was set apart ow five five five

00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:28,140
one two one two

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:29,750
phone dial five five five one two one

00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:37,709
two

00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:39,060
Radio tune 101.1 radio two 101.1 fm it's

00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:42,540
a breakthrough technology a

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,260
voice-activated control system for your

00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,480
car

00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,090
and get this you don't have to pre

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,609
program it and it responds to any

00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,920
drivers voice unlike other voice

00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:55,890
recognition technologies this Visteon

00:02:52,920 --> 00:03:00,269
system doesn't need to learn your voice

00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:03,209
first doesn't have to learn your voice

00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:05,780
first this was amazing it was like late

00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:08,459
90s you can take them to video quality

00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:10,889
it was a breakthrough yet if you look at

00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:12,989
it it only knows pre different phrases

00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:16,799
there's no extra understanding of what

00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:18,450
you say just a numbers like 101.1 um you

00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,959
can't just tell it I want to listen to

00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,920
BBC one it doesn't know state it doesn't

00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,130
know what you did last time

00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,780
um so you cannot say what about this it

00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:30,510
just you always have to repeat the full

00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,920
comment and overall is like not a nice

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,989
experience which is probably the reason

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,790
why not all our cows talk back to us

00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:41,160
today but then something changed in 2011

00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:44,630
the future came and ever introduces

00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,630
theory let's see how they did that

00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:51,330
read me the message new message from

00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:55,110
Sebastian great news we got to go ahead

00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:59,400
can you leave a 10 reply definitely I'll

00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:02,250
see you there play my running mix what's

00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:07,319
the traffic like around here here's the

00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:12,660
traffic text my wife I'm gonna be thirty

00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:15,270
minutes plus is it going to be chilly in

00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:18,209
San Francisco this weekend not too cold

00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:19,260
maybe down to 61 degrees in San

00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:22,230
Francisco

00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:26,820
what about Napa Valley doesn't seem like

00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:27,560
it how many cups are in 12 ounces let me

00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,260
think

00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:36,950
okay here you go set my timer for 30

00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:36,950
minutes okay 30 minutes and Counting

00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,619
[Music]

00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:47,930
new notification for messages sandy Chen

00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,930
are we still on for dinner tonight

00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:57,590
reply sure I'll be there here's your

00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:57,590
reply to Sandy Chen sure I'll be there

00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,950
then

00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:10,880
so first of all Evan makes great

00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:12,290
commercials I mean hands down now this

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,600
probably seems pretty ordinary to us

00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:16,670
today but back in 2011 I saw this

00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,800
commercial for the first time it blew my

00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:20,630
mind if you compare this to the 90s

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,370
segment we saw before

00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:24,530
it's stateful you can ask follow-up

00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:26,780
questions you can use very naturally

00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:29,960
phrasing how's the weather in what's the

00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:31,550
weather there what's going on and the

00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,170
thing it's kind of sucks if you look at

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,270
it you also to press a little button to

00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:37,700
activate actually speaking to it they

00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:39,200
fixed it a couple of years later but I

00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,990
actually got pretty close to something

00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:44,600
people want to use and everyone of

00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:45,830
course the only ones like Microsoft had

00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,550
Cortona a couple of years later

00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:51,650
very soon after Google had Google now so

00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:53,270
all our phones we can talk to them and

00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:55,280
actually quite amazing to consider a

00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,750
device of this size can do all of this

00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,080
while they can do it thanks to the cloud

00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:02,450
but still they can do it so why isn't

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,150
this this awesome they won't know P is

00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:08,480
I'm a developer I want to build cool

00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:10,340
stuff and I have these awesome platforms

00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:14,210
there and I really really want to build

00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:18,290
my own voice applications and I can't it

00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:20,350
really sucks so that changed when Amazon

00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:23,630
introduced Alexa and their mother Necker

00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:26,600
from the first day they had AP is

00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:28,040
actually two AP is the one where you can

00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,120
build your own voice interfaces what I'm

00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,190
going to show you in a little bit and

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,010
what many people don't know it actually

00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:36,650
has an API to embed Alexa into your own

00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:39,290
devices so there's a macro s plugin

00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:41,810
there's a browser-based Alexa people

00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:44,150
have used the singing fish to talk to

00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:47,840
Alexa so you can be really creative with

00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:49,430
it and Paige really cool stuff now to

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,350
get started with actually showing you

00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:53,930
how Alexa works I would like to play a

00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:55,580
little game and I wonder volunteer who

00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:59,840
wants to play a game and win a content

00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:01,310
flow Rubik's Cube show of hands somebody

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,000
has to volunteer we're not going forward

00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:04,000
with those presentation

00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:21,499
you'll find out you have to come up on

00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:24,089
stage yeah I plan so watching him

00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:25,259
especially high so you ready to make him

00:07:24,089 --> 00:07:27,719
yeah :

00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:30,389
alright how I do you nope the HTTP so

00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:32,039
I'm suddenly dancing you know standing

00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:33,330
here and you have to speak into the

00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:40,949
microphones like actually about that

00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:43,229
Alexa start HTTP Chris welcome to HTTP

00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:45,449
trivial twist I will ask you four

00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:47,400
questions try to get as many right as

00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:49,050
you can just say the letter of the

00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,469
answer let's begin

00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:54,749
question 1 which of these HTTP headers

00:07:52,469 --> 00:08:01,229
is famously misspelled in the protocol a

00:07:54,749 --> 00:08:05,939
refer be location C host D server with

00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:08,899
her just say the letter the correct

00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:10,589
answer is a refer your score is 0

00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:11,759
questions big louder

00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:15,899
which of these methods is feel

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:21,419
intelligent is safe a put the options C

00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:23,430
post D delete Bing that answer is

00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:26,370
correct well your score is 1

00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:30,300
question 3 the first documented version

00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:41,279
of HTTP had which version number a 0.1

00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:44,459
be 0.5 C 1.1 D 0.9 they that answer is

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,170
correct the present is to question for

00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:50,819
wonderful which of these methods is not

00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:55,620
idempotent a get B patch see options d

00:08:50,819 --> 00:08:58,079
delete repeat the correct answer is B

00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,510
message you got two out of four

00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:02,279
questions correct three four playing

00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,389
three questions right I'm a pastor thank

00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:07,260
you more than most people get your ease

00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:08,939
of the cube thank you and we get

00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,529
specific

00:09:08,939 --> 00:09:13,290
all right so this is a fun of the game

00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:15,579
let's see how does it actually work

00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:17,709
there are three essential parts to this

00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:19,329
we're using content flow to just all the

00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:22,209
questions this doesn't stand for

00:09:19,329 --> 00:09:24,459
whatever what API you have I really

00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:25,809
recommend not just taking the Alexa web

00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:28,119
hooks and putting it into your big

00:09:25,809 --> 00:09:29,470
monolith application that's a recipe for

00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:31,539
disaster

00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:34,569
use a variety for API that uses the

00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:37,809
interface for all your user interactions

00:09:34,569 --> 00:09:41,919
and use AWS lambda alias lambda is the

00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:43,720
function as a service from AWS we just

00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:44,889
upload a JavaScript function button

00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,289
where T is more than one function of

00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:49,749
course you can execute it it gets

00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:51,069
seamlessly scale up and you big bonus

00:09:49,749 --> 00:09:53,739
you don't have to deal with all the

00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:55,660
hassle of setting up HTTP and all the

00:09:53,739 --> 00:09:58,660
other security stuff alexa requires

00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:00,669
because your voice data is private it

00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:04,779
just all taken care of you issues aw

00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:06,669
lambda so let's build one and I really

00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:07,809
hope this works because what the Wi-Fi

00:10:06,669 --> 00:10:14,230
is going to drop out I'm going to be

00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:17,049
really really sad so I'm locked into the

00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:19,539
Amazon developer portal can you all read

00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:21,549
this or should I make it larger Yeah

00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:22,720
right about right about well not be

00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:26,769
complaining sounds good

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,669
so that's great in this game you want to

00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:30,069
go to be English

00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,970
it's like custom interaction model there

00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:32,739
are some three different detection

00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:34,239
models from Amazon we have to do less

00:10:32,739 --> 00:10:37,509
work but we want you to put them to work

00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:40,869
today and let's start with our wonders

00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:43,379
we called PHP UK facts now when I

00:10:40,869 --> 00:10:47,199
started to skill earlier I said start

00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:48,459
HTTP Chris HTTP Chris was the invocation

00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:50,619
name

00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:53,319
Alexa actually in a way is like a mobile

00:10:50,619 --> 00:10:54,480
that's a really bad idea just say the

00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:57,549
name all the time

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,649
want me to repeat something you said say

00:10:57,549 --> 00:11:03,970
Simon Says and then immediately say what

00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:05,619
you want me to repeat thanks Alex up so

00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,850
it always you have to launch an

00:11:05,619 --> 00:11:09,519
application first before you can

00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:11,169
anything do anything that a developer

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,699
whole sort of Hamilton bit

00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:15,539
so then location name for the last one

00:11:12,699 --> 00:11:19,659
was HTTP Chris this one is going to be

00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:21,670
PHP UK facts and I don't want to play

00:11:19,659 --> 00:11:24,960
audio so this is a No

00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:29,020
all right next up now I have to define

00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:31,090
my interaction model that means I have

00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:35,290
to model all the Y's my user can

00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:38,680
interact with my scale now the intent

00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:41,410
schema is just as a license file where

00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:44,680
you say what are the possible ways of

00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:47,860
invoking something application all these

00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:50,560
invocations are quite intense so we

00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:52,270
define an array of intense and since

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,360
this is a simple I want to get effects

00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:59,080
key we can just do with one intent if I

00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:04,330
spent correctly let us which we're going

00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:06,400
to call get new effect intent all right

00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:09,730
so far so clear now

00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:11,800
I taught Amazon or Alexa the way or

00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:14,080
which options they are but it doesn't

00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,480
understand yet the language because it

00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,760
doesn't naturally assume get a new

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,880
effect intent has some certain meaning

00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:24,070
so you have to tell Alexa what it is to

00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,230
do that I repeat my intent name get an

00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:30,180
effect intent and then I have to give

00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:37,630
sample phrases so let's say effect or

00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:39,370
chemi effect or give me effect you don't

00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:41,860
have to list all the possible options um

00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:44,170
Alex a smart enough to interfere some

00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,900
from the ones you do have but the

00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:48,820
reliability is much much better when you

00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:51,280
give it much much more

00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:54,070
I know slaves with over 1,000 Center

00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,090
faces for one intent this is really

00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,260
where you have to put in the work and

00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:58,900
think about all the possible ways of

00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:01,780
phrasing what the user wants to say and

00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,560
that what makes it sound smart so it's

00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:06,940
actually not that smart

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:08,560
it just appears very smart so now this

00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,510
takes a little bit why Amazon is

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:14,830
creating the voice model already done

00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:16,840
awesome good Wi-Fi so now as Auliya said

00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,880
i want to use AWS lambda because it's

00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:21,370
much easier I'm hosting my lambda

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,080
function in North America I took the

00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:25,600
liberty of creating one earlier so I

00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:30,160
just call copy and paste the Amazon with

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:33,010
resource name is resource name sorry in

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:37,150
here sign next

00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:38,830
and so far so done right so now I have a

00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:42,070
voice model but of course I don't have

00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:43,720
any code to actually work with it so if

00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:47,350
my iPad keeps turning off I won't know

00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:51,420
what to do next so let's start writing

00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:51,420
some code I pre set up this project

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,720
which doesn't work this way I want

00:13:54,430 --> 00:14:00,280
alright let's keep it this way

00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:02,770
so I'm whenever you have an 80s lambda

00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:05,650
function and noches you have this little

00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:07,630
definition event is the current event

00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:09,460
that gets set up to you you get some

00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:11,920
context from the lambda function and you

00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:13,330
get a callback to call it back Amazon is

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,190
nice enough to provide us with an Alexa

00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:17,800
voice SDK which makes writing these

00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:20,740
skills much much easier so let's set up

00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:23,860
this SDK to do that

00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:27,190
I just invoke index or Handler and I

00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:30,130
have to pass the event typing it's not

00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:32,620
my strong suit today and the context to

00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:35,740
it next up I have to register some

00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:41,560
handlers so let's just assume we have a

00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:50,880
variable handlers and oh sorry my voice

00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:50,880
is leaving and then I'm going to execute

00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:58,840
alright so this is the boilerplate you

00:14:55,270 --> 00:15:01,720
need just to invoke the LX SDK now of

00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:04,420
course I also need my actual handlers so

00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:06,670
let's create an object and just a value

00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:10,360
map so anybody remember what the intent

00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:13,990
was called we just created yes get me

00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:18,210
effect intent very important it has to

00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:21,790
be complete so it's just a function and

00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:25,030
now we want a lexer to tell us effect so

00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:27,850
I'm saying this emit so it's an event

00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:31,780
I'm giving out and the event name in

00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:36,450
this case is going to be K and then

00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:39,010
let's have the other say grass is green

00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:42,750
big revelation awesome

00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:44,009
so let's publicist

00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:46,430
that's the big disadvantage of

00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:49,410
cloud-hosted code there is no local

00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:51,329
right run test cycle you always have to

00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:53,509
go back to the cloud let's see if this

00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:53,509
works

00:15:54,079 --> 00:16:03,529
Alexa Alexa asked PHP UK effects effect

00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:11,670
there is a problem with the request and

00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:19,980
skills response that's wasn't what's

00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:24,240
supposed to happen I'm sorry ah thank

00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:28,740
you very much this is the reason why you

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:30,389
shouldn't like put on stage and have

00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:33,439
about 50 lines morph culture right so

00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:33,439
it's going to get interesting here

00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,199
that's a good point

00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:38,970
it's like item it pair programming here

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:46,019
all right let's try it again

00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:48,779
Alexa asked PHP UK effects effect grass

00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:54,540
is green hmm so I just made a computer

00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:58,170
speak to me now earlier the effect and

00:16:54,540 --> 00:17:03,660
the scale I started would start screen

00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:07,169
name let's try this hey Alexa start huge

00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:09,449
PUK effects there is a problem with the

00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:14,760
requested skills response now this one

00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:17,760
was intended the reason is you should

00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,740
have put to sleep off there's a magic

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:23,400
intention intent towards the launch

00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:26,010
request and this one gets called when

00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:30,200
you just start just go without telling

00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:32,520
it what to do so by simply doing this I

00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,590
have the same effect just have to

00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,480
duplicate a lot of code duplicating code

00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,640
everybody knows sucks

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,909
so the Alexa SDK has a way around that

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:45,990
for us we can create virtual intents

00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:48,160
like this one get fact let's get the

00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:51,670
code in there

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:57,730
and then I can just dispatch to that

00:17:51,670 --> 00:18:02,800
virtual intent all right

00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:03,430
make sense so let's apply this one and

00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:09,610
try again

00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:11,470
hey Alexa start PHP UK effects sorry I

00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:12,640
didn't understand the question I heard

00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:19,060
so bad

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:23,020
hey Alexa hey Alexa start PHP okay

00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:26,140
effects grass is green

00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:29,050
what's also wonderful now side note I

00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:30,760
have a very bad English accent I'm

00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:32,470
actually terribly impressed that Alexa

00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,920
understands my English at all

00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:37,630
Siri is much much worse at it so be easy

00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,160
on her

00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:40,900
now this is interesting but it's not

00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,300
that interesting we want some more facts

00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:47,370
so let's make us a little bit of an

00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:53,500
array we already have grass is green and

00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:55,750
let's also say the sky is blue now this

00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,640
is not terribly relevant to Alexa it's

00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:00,490
safe but bear with me here

00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:04,560
I want a random index from that array so

00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:08,110
I'm calling random inch between Noah and

00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:11,050
Rob's facts table length minus one

00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:14,560
because it's zero indexed and I'm

00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:19,660
getting my random effect which was ten

00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:22,000
facts and that index all right easy

00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:23,800
enough so now it's a good practice to

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,750
always have your speech output in

00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:28,420
variables we're going to see later a

00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:30,690
little bit why so let's start doing that

00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,690
right now

00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:38,200
here's effect spelling is actually very

00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:41,200
important for Alexa also good

00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,990
punctuation depending on whether you use

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,970
the question mark and exclamation point

00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:47,950
the pronunciation of Alexa is going to

00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,460
solve differently so if you have bad

00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,680
speller

00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:55,330
like I am have somebody double-check

00:19:50,680 --> 00:20:00,360
your stuff so here's effect let's use

00:19:55,330 --> 00:20:00,360
this and then we want our random fact

00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:08,340
alright let's try this once again that's

00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:13,559
actually it doesn't matter because of

00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:15,030
JavaScript JavaScript of semicolons are

00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:17,820
optional I just makes them because I

00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:19,830
used to them from PHP thank you take 4

00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:27,570
pay attention now let's try this once

00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:29,630
more start hey Alexa hey Alexa start PHP

00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:33,720
UK effects

00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:37,049
here's fact grass is green I'm missing

00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:39,809
an age so much for good spelling alright

00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:41,910
so there's a small code let's make this

00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:43,620
slightly more interesting why watch for

00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:46,830
content for so obviously I'm storing all

00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:48,809
my effects in content for so let's do

00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:50,549
that what content alone and I got myself

00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:56,760
a small helper library here which I'm

00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:58,740
going to use now which is the content

00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,390
for client and the content for client

00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:03,809
needs my conflict for my ex is talking

00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:09,380
and now I got contentful effects get

00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:11,520
some content for him get all effects

00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:13,980
anybody here work to JavaScript promises

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,290
before ok Ben expression anybody has not

00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:18,090
worked with JavaScript pharmacist before

00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:21,150
so for those who don't know Java C

00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:23,100
promises is a more convenient way of

00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:26,970
encapsulating asynchronous operations in

00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:29,130
JavaScript and that's the reason why

00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:29,730
we're using it here so this one I don't

00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,620
need anymore

00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:35,010
because all my effects now also live in

00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:40,440
the cloud isn't a cloud awesome alright

00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:42,590
and important trip this is always look

00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,059
for this contact of the current function

00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:47,900
so because my coach here wouldn't work

00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:47,900
let's do this

00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:53,900
alright deploying once more

00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:06,240
cool that's not again hey Alexa hey

00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:13,090
Alexa start PHP UK effect hey Alexa

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:15,430
start PHP UK effects here's a fact

00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:17,560
reven is quite nervous about coding live

00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:20,410
on stage live on stage alright good

00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:23,950
pronunciation there but it works quite

00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:26,830
well now this is a very easy example I

00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:28,210
just do something I tell her something

00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:30,520
like ask you a question and she gives me

00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:33,700
response it's not very interactive it's

00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:36,340
not very exciting so let's make a little

00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:39,280
bit more exciting I talked earlier about

00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:43,050
the importance of having state in your

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:45,580
voice kids so let's introduce some state

00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:47,470
now for this very simple example we're

00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:53,500
just going to have one state beyond the

00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:57,100
initial invocations state yes so let's

00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:58,270
call this effect mode and so everybody

00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:02,500
has is quiet I've been giving it a

00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:05,050
semicolon now I have two handlers that I

00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:07,150
need I need my original handler which is

00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:09,310
dealing with the initial invocation when

00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:12,640
I'm first starting verification and I'm

00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:14,230
also going to need a state handler for

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,830
my new mode and it's going to be the

00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:21,160
effect state handler

00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:24,340
yes and I'm doing that by Alexa create

00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:28,240
state handler I'm giving it the name I

00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:32,410
just gave my state and it just another

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:35,620
object in JavaScript so what I want to

00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:37,360
do now I want Alexa to ask me I want to

00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:41,410
give me effect and then I wanted to ask

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:44,400
me if I want anothers so to do that I

00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:47,830
want first the same options I have here

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:50,140
but then I want it to be able to ask me

00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:52,360
yes or no so let's put this else first

00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:58,630
into another function let's call this

00:23:52,360 --> 00:24:00,940
one get effect all right and before I

00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:04,330
emit my speech here I wanted to

00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:07,389
transition to another state that state

00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:13,019
that I do by saying that handlers

00:24:07,389 --> 00:24:17,829
oops state and just again my state name

00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:20,469
game state fact now if I wanted to

00:24:17,829 --> 00:24:22,089
actually ask me a question the behavior

00:24:20,469 --> 00:24:23,559
from Alexis different it actually keeps

00:24:22,089 --> 00:24:26,049
open the connection so I don't have to

00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:28,959
start again using hey Alexa I can just

00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:33,129
answer it to follow up to do that I have

00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:35,579
to say asked and I'm getting a second

00:24:33,129 --> 00:24:40,200
parable that's called the replant text

00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:45,989
so let's say the read from text here is

00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:49,779
really prompt text do you want another

00:24:45,989 --> 00:24:52,119
awesome and my speech output of course

00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:55,899
should be the speech and three prop text

00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:58,989
so far so simple now when it comes to

00:24:55,899 --> 00:25:02,049
the second invocation I have to handle

00:24:58,989 --> 00:25:05,799
the yes or no responses to do that I'm

00:25:02,049 --> 00:25:11,919
going to add two new intents to my voice

00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:17,049
model and these are going to be the

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:19,690
Amazon dot is intent if I spaced

00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:21,549
correctly this is a magic intent and

00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:24,759
that you don't need to provide simple

00:25:21,549 --> 00:25:27,609
answers for it there aren't no couple of

00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:29,829
dozen of these which Alexa just knows

00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:31,299
already how people want to use us you

00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:32,499
can add more additional ones if you feel

00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:34,899
like your application especially needs

00:25:32,499 --> 00:25:38,799
but this intent already knows all the

00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:39,820
ways of phrasing yes I want something so

00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,859
you don't have to do it yourself and

00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:44,559
when there's a yes there's always the

00:25:41,859 --> 00:25:48,909
possibility for no so we take the no

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:49,799
intent to all right back to it so we

00:25:48,909 --> 00:25:53,619
have the Amazon

00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:57,039
yes intent and the results are going to

00:25:53,619 --> 00:26:03,209
be our get effect function again and of

00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:03,209
course we have an Amazon no intent

00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:09,099
whoops

00:26:04,659 --> 00:26:10,299
and this one's going to us saying her to

00:26:09,099 --> 00:26:15,929
tell us

00:26:10,299 --> 00:26:15,929
oh I mean if you are typing today

00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:23,530
goodbye all right now important

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,500
observation because that has noticed it

00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:29,050
myself I have to pass all the voice hand

00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:31,000
class obviously to register hand class

00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:32,380
otherwise this can't work so we're just

00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,420
ahead of this a very attic function you

00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:36,310
can just add as many as you want the

00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:38,020
common convention is to have one handler

00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:40,420
for the initial ones and then another

00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:41,920
handler for every state doesn't have to

00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:44,140
be that way you can freely mix and match

00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:46,050
that you can split up the initial

00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:48,820
handler off as many object as you want

00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:51,840
usually not necessary though so let's

00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,840
try to get this into the cloud again

00:26:55,410 --> 00:27:08,920
alright hi Alexa asked PHP UK effects

00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:11,350
effect there is a problem with the

00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:15,460
requested skills response anybody some

00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:17,730
one mistake yet you're awesome and so

00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:20,130
what's the problem

00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:23,880
yes yes but that's not the problem

00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:23,880
because they didn't even get that far

00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:33,670
now this one is actually correct because

00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:41,590
this is this Alexa no that's a bouquet

00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:43,510
that's correct I mean here ah yes but

00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:47,320
also not the problem but you you're

00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:49,450
amazing us um actually no I have to look

00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:53,290
up what's correct Jesus Christ such a

00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:56,470
bit preparation I swear I've done this

00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:59,640
ever free before alright let's try this

00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:07,120
again and then just look into the locks

00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:14,520
so hey Alexa hey Alexa start PHP UK

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:14,520
effect hey Alexa start PHP UK effects

00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:21,880
this is going to our art so let us look

00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:24,250
into the lock there is a problem with

00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,630
the requested skills response which

00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:27,280
brings me to an amazing next point I can

00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:30,610
show you how to life debug code on the

00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:32,980
cloud so as I mention before I have this

00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:35,320
ever WS lambda function running here you

00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:37,660
get some bit in monitoring so I see a

00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:39,490
spike in the error rate I wonder why I

00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:42,010
can also tell it was quite interesting

00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:43,810
how long the invocations take so if I

00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:45,190
spend too much time generating responses

00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:46,750
it's probably not going to be a good

00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:49,840
experience for the user if he has to

00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:52,000
wait for very long time for response to

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:57,720
actually see the locks I can look into

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:59,980
cloud watch and let's see the last one

00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:04,030
warning application ID is not set this

00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:07,210
is expected mmm now if I don't get an

00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:08,460
error message I have a problem that's

00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:10,660
going to the one before that

00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:18,340
no underhanded function defined for

00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:19,380
event interesting this shouldn't have

00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:22,920
happened

00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:26,760
all right um I'm just going to cheat

00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:28,780
because of course I came prepared and

00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:31,980
I'm just going to overwrite this with

00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,980
the one that I know it's working

00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:48,290
hi Alexa stops PHP UK effects here's

00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,390
your fact

00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:52,460
Reuven is quite nervous about coding

00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:55,540
live on stage do you want to hear

00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:59,270
another yes

00:29:55,540 --> 00:30:03,280
here's your fact PHP UK has great cakes

00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:07,370
do you not - here's another No

00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:09,920
goodbye so this is the simplest way of

00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:11,060
just asking a question and now for this

00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,860
one we're just dealing with a yes or no

00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:16,010
response which Emma's are nicely covers

00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:18,710
for us but it's also not that hard to

00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:20,090
deal with more complex questions and to

00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:26,000
do that we're going to get back to our

00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:28,460
game so first I have to change my voice

00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,030
key because now it's not a hex pot

00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:32,210
anymore

00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:37,730
now it's a quiz so let's change the name

00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:39,710
and the invocation name and let's think

00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:42,530
about how do i model actually a chris

00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:46,850
why there's two essentials and there I

00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:48,290
need an answer and now I can't type

00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:52,670
because Emma's nested processing the

00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:55,430
modern awesome so let me just talk what

00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:58,310
I'm going to do now it goes so I need an

00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:59,990
intent to taste they use all the answer

00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:02,330
soft no the user text me the answer and

00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:04,700
didn't intend to handle that and because

00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:07,640
we are nice people we also want a don't

00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:10,010
know intent so the user can just skip a

00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:11,980
question now the answer intent is

00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:14,510
special and that it's not just a

00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:16,910
statement I'm making but they're also

00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:19,880
giving it a responding with a choice in

00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:22,310
this case was a B C or D so I could now

00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:25,100
create for different intent a intent the

00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:26,780
intent C intent the intent but its

00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,970
timing very very quickly if you have a

00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:31,280
lot of thoughts like I know some people

00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,750
who in Berlin they build a BVG which is

00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:35,390
our local transportation company skier

00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:37,280
and you can tell it from this station to

00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:38,630
that station how do I get there you

00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,980
don't want to write intense for all the

00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:42,680
station names in Berlin I think there's

00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:44,750
like 400 of them that's really not what

00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:47,840
you want to do so the solution here is

00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:50,870
to add a second property to your object

00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:54,140
which was called slots

00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:55,550
and slots are like variables so when you

00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:57,890
come later to the semper phrases you can

00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:59,900
use whatever you use here as variables

00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:02,750
in your sample advances and whatever

00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:04,190
happens in this yeah

00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:07,040
thereby you get passed to your

00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:09,710
application and don't forget the comma

00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:14,810
so a simple slot would look like this

00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:17,390
the type is going to be the name of my

00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:21,050
variable essentially in this case answer

00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:22,580
and it also needs a type jobs is

00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:25,880
obviously wrong the name is of course

00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:27,890
the name and not the type so and there

00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:31,460
are three different types like number

00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:35,240
States places in the US UK in Germany

00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:37,640
actually I know that doesn't of them but

00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:40,490
sometimes it just doesn't cut it and you

00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:43,510
need your own slot like station names in

00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:46,670
Berlin or in this case a list of answers

00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:50,360
whenever this happens you need to create

00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:53,270
a custom slot type give it the name and

00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:55,610
then give it all the possible values and

00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:58,070
by all I actually mean absolutely all

00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:59,660
there's no intelligence to say oh yeah

00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:02,480
and it might be something similar or

00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:04,880
later on I can't say I wanted simpler

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,080
transistors this is a slot and then the

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,300
user might remember something else

00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:12,530
afterwards this is also the reason why

00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:15,020
when Ashley asked I just said referrer

00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:17,180
as the response it didn't work there's

00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:19,690
no way for me to encode all the possible

00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:22,910
answers for any question that might be

00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:25,400
so either I reflect all my questions and

00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:28,760
answers in this or I'm just out of luck

00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:31,600
so now new simple phrases let's do it

00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:39,710
quick and easy it's the answer intent is

00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:45,860
either just the answer or it could be

00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:50,510
the answer is answer and for the don't

00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:55,970
know intent again by typing it should be

00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:57,560
don't know or don't know what else do

00:33:55,970 --> 00:34:00,820
you guys say in England that's I don't

00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,820
know all right

00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:06,750
now this is a very simplistic what's

00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:08,700
model for the actual HTTP quiz I have a

00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,870
much more elaborate one which I might

00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:12,810
have to copy and paste into this later

00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:15,330
on text together to work let's get back

00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:17,220
to our code so we always talk about the

00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:19,470
game States when our Chris is a little

00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:22,440
bit more complicated so we need some

00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:26,760
more states first of all I needs a

00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:30,560
trivia mode the trivia mode is when

00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:36,870
you're actually responding to questions

00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:39,470
then I have start which is the one when

00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:42,050
you initially start a new game and

00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:44,159
something all skills should have

00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:48,510
otherwise Amazon is not letting you into

00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:50,460
their skills Don is help so since

00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:52,530
there's not a lot of exploration

00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:54,690
possible you have no Yui to just click

00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:56,129
around there's no - - help on the

00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:57,600
comment line you need a way of

00:34:56,129 --> 00:34:59,430
discovering how you can actually

00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:01,470
interact with a given scale and that's

00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,760
what the head keyword is for which I

00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:03,470
haven't registered yet which I might do

00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:08,370
later

00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:11,550
so I also since a proper watch disguise

00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:15,920
complex I give me some papers so I just

00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:19,680
importing some functions and I also

00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:22,710
reset up my hand class a little bit

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,780
alright I have to pay attention that I

00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:25,260
don't have tickets you this one can go

00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:30,390
away

00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:34,110
alright so very simple I have few more

00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:36,240
handlers so I have the generic oops new

00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:37,860
session handlers these are all the

00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:41,250
handlers that get invoked the first time

00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:44,250
you actually start to scale then I have

00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:46,830
the start state handlers the trivial

00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:49,770
state handlers and the hape state

00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:50,880
handlers so this game is already much

00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:52,530
more complex and now if you think about

00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,120
a real application you're probably going

00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:55,740
to end up with quite a few states but

00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,210
again this is what actually makes Alexis

00:35:55,740 --> 00:36:00,170
seem intelligent so it's really

00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:02,730
important to put in the time for this

00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:05,790
let's see where we start we start would

00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:09,110
start the game all right so whenever we

00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:14,100
start the game we wanted to welcome us

00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:14,930
so let's just say welcome to the PHP UK

00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:18,900
first

00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:20,609
alright good enough we're not quite good

00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,440
enough because if the user starts over

00:36:20,609 --> 00:36:25,020
we don't want to repeat that all the

00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:30,050
time so let's make this optional and

00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:32,670
make it empty in this case all right hmm

00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:36,060
well thank you very much

00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:38,220
you're amazing guys so again my

00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:44,790
questions are coming from content I get

00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:46,020
all the questions another promise should

00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:48,510
have made a shortcut from new functions

00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:50,490
I'm doing them right about and I'm

00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:54,960
getting back some items now this is

00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:58,619
mostly set up here importantly since I

00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,300
have a lot of data I want to pass

00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:02,160
between these different states since I

00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:04,230
now dust or have just yes/no questions

00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:07,200
but I also have logic like the previous

00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:09,869
score I need a way of storing that Alexa

00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:12,300
has a bit in session system which I'm

00:37:09,869 --> 00:37:16,200
going to use later on so I want a new

00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:22,260
game so I made this little state object

00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:23,910
and I'm going to inert that state also I

00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:25,520
always need the current question because

00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:29,030
that's the one I'm going to us later

00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:32,940
so I'm asking the state to get current

00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:36,000
yeah where's it get good question and

00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:37,770
also needs again all the items all right

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,080
so that's the boring setup part of how

00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:42,660
to actually get a game now what do we

00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:50,089
want Alexa to tell us and again we have

00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:54,630
the reform text and this is going to be

00:37:50,089 --> 00:37:58,050
question and whereas skip the letter

00:37:54,630 --> 00:38:02,990
lets us say let's call my daughter that

00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:02,990
sucks current question and the question

00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:14,520
wasn't good this should work I've

00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:20,609
trusted myself alright and to speech

00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:25,109
output complete is again just like just

00:38:20,609 --> 00:38:25,980
like equals the reform text so this is

00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:28,349
pretty similar to what we've done before

00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:30,809
we just assigned some text to

00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:33,119
actually get us going the interesting

00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:35,970
thing is that state I've created up here

00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,859
past eight hairpin is game I need to

00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:39,960
save away so Alexa actually needs to

00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:42,229
know or dialects SDK this is part of my

00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:44,489
session I want that information later on

00:38:42,229 --> 00:38:48,359
for that there's a magic variable

00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:52,200
because that in this case called that

00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:53,430
attributes right

00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:56,729
everything that's taught in that

00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:59,130
attributes you can reload on the next

00:38:56,729 --> 00:39:01,289
application of the same scale as long as

00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:04,109
the sessions just open so remember when

00:39:01,289 --> 00:39:05,880
I said asked I've had it ask me

00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:07,829
something I didn't have to say hey LexA

00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,779
again so what's doing the same session

00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:12,450
as soon as the connection closes once

00:39:09,779 --> 00:39:14,039
the session gets deleted so you can

00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:16,140
longer-term storage you actually want to

00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:17,130
remember something what's the user you

00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,450
need to work with a database or

00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:21,509
something you can't just do this with

00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:24,599
the session yeah I'm saving away my

00:39:21,509 --> 00:39:28,349
state and I'm also always recommend

00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:30,569
saving away your reap from text for the

00:39:28,349 --> 00:39:32,910
simple reason a scale always should have

00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:36,690
the option of saying repeat and you get

00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:40,019
asked the question again alright so far

00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:42,509
so good if this actually works and we're

00:39:40,019 --> 00:39:44,700
going to again say that handler stage

00:39:42,509 --> 00:39:49,019
the next stage we're going to use in

00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:56,430
this case is the trivia stage and then

00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:58,890
we're going to say that image and we

00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:02,039
want to ask something so I can speech

00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:03,119
output leap from text now let's see if

00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:05,210
this actually works oh if I screwed up

00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,210
again

00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:13,019
[Music]

00:40:08,569 --> 00:40:14,729
hi Alexa actually I forgot something

00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:17,489
very important I just realized ha ha ha

00:40:14,729 --> 00:40:20,609
ha let's do this again and what's

00:40:17,489 --> 00:40:23,069
missing anybody realized no much more

00:40:20,609 --> 00:40:24,479
significant I'm asking the question but

00:40:23,069 --> 00:40:24,809
I'm not giving you the potential answer

00:40:24,479 --> 00:40:29,460
us

00:40:24,809 --> 00:40:32,579
that's probably not a good idea so let's

00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:35,460
do the two and the state has a nice

00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:40,440
little hyper function defer which is

00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:41,810
called great answer list and it just

00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:52,580
needs the current question

00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:54,600
and to state the space where yes I do I

00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:56,490
love you guys you guys are amazing

00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:58,980
I want to hire all of you and to all my

00:40:56,490 --> 00:41:02,210
coding with you also I think this one is

00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:08,160
wrong so I'm going to peek at my

00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:19,140
solution really quick all right she's

00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:24,960
right I'm amazing hey Alexa start PHP UK

00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:27,450
Chris welcome to the PHP UK quiz

00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:32,850
question what year was the first PHP UK

00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:39,720
conference in London a 1998 B 2006

00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:42,240
C 2017 D 2010 a little bit weird why was

00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:45,000
that right because my problem with the

00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:48,030
requested skills response not to say

00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:53,370
always mute Alexa so why does it sound

00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:55,830
so weird yes and the reason is because I

00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:59,960
didn't have a period there so Alexa has

00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:59,960
thought this won't run long one sentence

00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:09,030
beginning of the replumb text that's

00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:12,570
also very true I also dare that couldn't

00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:13,710
be another period so again punctuation

00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:15,360
is very important to actually make it

00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:19,320
sound good you can get it to work

00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:21,750
without post bounce sound fair way now

00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:24,530
I've saved away my state I also want to

00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:27,540
get to use my state that's the obvious

00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:29,340
second part so I already started writing

00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:31,620
this handle use I guess function so I'm

00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:34,260
going to use this here I'm just going to

00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:36,060
call it and it gets one parameter

00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:39,930
whether the user gave up at this point

00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:42,960
or not if the user answers the question

00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:46,260
he obviously hadn't given up if he says

00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:50,460
don't know then he did give up all right

00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:52,680
so let's deal with that guess so what

00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:55,050
I'm doing here is I'm again I'm

00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,770
accessing this attributes which contains

00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:58,020
all the state

00:42:55,770 --> 00:43:00,150
safe previously I'm decoding that and

00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:01,620
I'm grievin get my state object which is

00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:04,230
a nice little class which encodes some

00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:07,740
of the logic first thing I wanna know is

00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:09,780
is this the correct answer and to do

00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:13,830
that I need to get the response the

00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:25,320
usual set ABCD this one is stored in

00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:27,000
this event request intent so this isn't

00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:28,650
just the answer start there it includes

00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,190
all the logic like what name is self

00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:34,380
intend what slots were used what is on

00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:35,730
all these slots in there but there is

00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:39,440
answer correct function is going to deal

00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:42,930
with all of these problems for us so

00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:46,890
let's say if this is correct then of

00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:49,790
course the score has to go up and MA and

00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:49,790
as Liz's whoops

00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:58,860
copy and pasting is easier than typing

00:43:52,640 --> 00:44:00,960
it's going to be correct and if it's

00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:04,850
wrong we're not going to increase the

00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,850
score and our analysis is going to be

00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:10,590
alright fair enough

00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:12,120
what we're not handling though is what

00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:15,710
does when the user gives up so let's

00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:15,710
deal with that case to use I gave up

00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:20,700
then we're not we don't want to do this

00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:25,380
so let's say if the user didn't give up

00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:27,240
then how analysis and we probably also

00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:29,760
want to tell the user what the correct

00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:32,370
answer is so again more string

00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,140
concatenation if you ever hear the joke

00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:36,480
of web development is just finding a

00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:39,180
million ways of encoding strings boise

00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,890
development is pay similar in the end it

00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:43,080
all comes down to how efficiently can

00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:45,020
you add some strings I would have loved

00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:47,070
to use template strings from a year six

00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:50,090
unfortunately alias lambda runs on an

00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:54,690
ancient version of nodejs so you can't

00:44:50,090 --> 00:45:01,310
as I said the correct answer is and my

00:44:54,690 --> 00:45:01,310
state helper gives me get good scores

00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:10,570
as I said the answer is stage correct

00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:13,150
and swear

00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:15,910
text alright that should be good enough

00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:18,880
all okay so today all right so this is

00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:21,580
my another's the other big part that I

00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:24,160
have to do I want to see if the user is

00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:29,110
at the end of the game so I'm checking

00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:34,560
his stage game over if it's the case if

00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:38,920
the user gave up I'm mistaking myself oh

00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:43,150
yeah ah it's most typing speech output

00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:46,660
alright if the user gave up use I gave

00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:50,230
up then I don't want to tell them

00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:53,890
anything and if it is that not that you

00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:56,860
gave up that answer is alright so this

00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:57,400
is my speech output and more speech

00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:01,860
output

00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:05,080
I want the narratives in there so whoops

00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:11,130
and I want us to know what the score is

00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:15,910
so what's the score the score is stage

00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:17,230
score so now when the game is over what

00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:18,850
we want to do is we want to finish the

00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:21,490
program finishing the program is most

00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:25,630
easily done by just emitting something

00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:30,630
and telling and what we're going to tell

00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:35,920
is this speech output all right

00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:38,950
what's wrong here ah yes thank God for

00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:41,200
syntax highlighting now if the user is

00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:43,000
still playing you want to play around so

00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:46,330
we start doing that by just asking the

00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:49,390
stage to play around for us then they're

00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:52,090
going to get another one of question get

00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:55,290
one question in this case only and the

00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:57,760
state is giving us the question are you

00:46:55,290 --> 00:47:01,000
and we have another one of our lovely

00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:03,070
promises if you don't use promises after

00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,370
those talk somewhere else diverse I was

00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:07,390
going to point here because I've had to

00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:11,260
do this all in cloud base you would

00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:13,240
never get done here at all alright so

00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:15,070
very simple you're just going to

00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:17,660
literally copy some of the code from

00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:22,610
here yes

00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:24,550
this is the current question and there's

00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:27,590
my read from text

00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:31,970
I'm also going to need the answer list

00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:34,130
again which is going to be this part and

00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:35,570
I going to need this part too and this

00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:45,040
part too I'm just going to be generous

00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:49,520
here all right so now my speech output

00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:52,720
it's actually wrong because I yeah too

00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,720
much copy and pasting I'm sorry for that

00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:59,300
going to make that more efficient the

00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:01,070
next time I'm assigning my stage

00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:03,740
wonderful and now I have to ask the

00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:05,060
question once again and then I'm going

00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:21,460
to pray that this actually works after

00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:21,460
all this typing which 182 the score is

00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:29,970
ah the space yes and let's put a period

00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:32,580
here so it actually sounds kind of

00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:35,030
decent at least answer this the answers

00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:35,030
were still enough

00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:45,080
one more 82 this goal is yeah okay I

00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,080
think it has this one perfect right now

00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:48,420
so what's a fiction ism in this room I

00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:57,860
love it

00:48:48,420 --> 00:49:04,500
all right hi Alexa hey Alexa hey Alexa

00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:11,330
start PHP your calculus hey Alexa start

00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:13,050
PHP UK Chris welcome to the PHP UK quiz

00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:15,810
question from how many different

00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:18,990
countries are PHP or RK attendees this

00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:20,070
year a so before we play this who wants

00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:21,300
another chance of any a Rubik's Cube

00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:25,340
because I don't need to play this I

00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:28,950
wrote the question sir is 16 the school

00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:30,090
just make it easier so anybody who wants

00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:32,880
to have another chance of winning a

00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:35,870
Rubik's Cube again this talk is not over

00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,870
until somebody wins a Rubik's Cube

00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:57,820
hey what's in him MA hi applause I'm up

00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:59,770
for being brave enough close to the

00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:06,910
speaker and just the letter please

00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:10,890
yep so hey Alexa hi Alexa start PHP UK

00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:14,020
Chris welcome to the PHP UK quiz

00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:20,520
question what year was the first PHP UK

00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:27,160
conference in London a 2010 be 1984 C

00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:34,630
2017 D 2006 day that answer is correct

00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:37,510
the score is one okay that should enough

00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:43,750
happens but thank you for being good

00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:50,470
sports rep the answer is about 4000 that

00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:51,880
answer is Bo all right stay here you get

00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:53,170
it another ten I have the full version

00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:59,050
that actually works we're going to play

00:50:53,170 --> 00:51:08,590
this properly that's why you should

00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:14,650
never let code hey Alexa start PHP UK

00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:17,320
Chris welcome to the PHP UK trivia quiz

00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:19,690
I will ask you three questions try to

00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:21,730
get as many right as you can just say

00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:24,310
the letter of the answer let's begin

00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:27,160
question 1 from how many different

00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:38,260
countries our PHP UK attendees this year

00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:41,260
a 192 be 16 C 30 D 3 then that answer is

00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:43,600
correct your score is one question too

00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:45,640
about how many tiny cakes will be served

00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:48,460
during refreshment breaks and lunch over

00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:52,690
the two conference days may about 1,000

00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:58,619
be more than 10,000 C about 7,000 D

00:51:52,690 --> 00:52:01,470
about 4,000 day that answer is correct

00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:03,990
your score is to question three what

00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:15,200
year was the first PHP UK I already had

00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:17,279
that one 2017 be 2010 C 1984 D 2006 Dean

00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:19,349
that answer is correct

00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:25,019
you got three out of three questions

00:52:19,349 --> 00:52:26,430
correct I'm afraid that doesn't count

00:52:25,019 --> 00:52:29,789
nothing Sanel yes

00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:32,099
all right so this is except for my lack

00:52:29,789 --> 00:52:32,849
of coding skills life on stage pretty

00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:34,470
easy to do

00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:36,779
now that's one last trick I actually

00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:38,460
want to show you this is all fine

00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:41,210
tentative half Alex I'll speak to you

00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:43,980
but sometimes you want a little bit more

00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:45,390
they're sore a little bit more and I'll

00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:46,499
Sparkle in there and you want to get a

00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:50,519
little more chewy I just know what you

00:52:46,499 --> 00:52:53,190
can do with Alex I'd save so you can

00:52:50,519 --> 00:52:56,960
also get sound files and to do that I've

00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:56,960
thought one once again in content for

00:52:57,799 --> 00:53:04,259
marine ocular type in the heart function

00:53:00,029 --> 00:53:08,700
and there's my settings and I just want

00:53:04,259 --> 00:53:13,380
to get all of this now asynchronously

00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:15,259
nice and easy in here and return ok this

00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:18,269
bait is the same program I had before

00:53:15,259 --> 00:53:22,880
now the interesting thing is I want to

00:53:18,269 --> 00:53:25,259
add in all your attack and to do that

00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:29,099
I'm heading in a low string not like

00:53:25,259 --> 00:53:33,779
this what the heck really really can't

00:53:29,099 --> 00:53:35,539
type today I just going to be audio

00:53:33,779 --> 00:53:41,220
source

00:53:35,539 --> 00:53:45,710
whoops like this and I'll escape iam and

00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:45,710
then I'll say settings

00:53:47,569 --> 00:53:54,630
opening audio levels was caught yes

00:53:50,029 --> 00:53:56,460
perfect um this is right this looks

00:53:54,630 --> 00:54:02,339
fairly right but I'm no I'm less brave

00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:08,549
now I'm checking audio sauce no equal

00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:19,380
sign oh yeah see didn't look right all

00:54:08,549 --> 00:54:29,519
right that's the process once more hey

00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:31,380
Alexa hey Alexa start PHP UK Chris there

00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:34,710
is a problem with the requested skills

00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:37,219
response I'm just going to be copying

00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:37,219
pasting again

00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:59,270
so many files hi Alexa start PHP UK

00:54:52,110 --> 00:55:02,010
Chris welcome to the PHP UK trivia quiz

00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:04,860
shall we

00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:07,200
I will ask you three questions try to

00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:09,750
get as many right as you can just say

00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,830
the letter of the answer now I regret on

00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:12,480
implementing the stuff intent because

00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:15,150
now I can stop this app all right Dennis

00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,710
so this is how much I want to kill

00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:19,680
because we don't want to code anymore -

00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:22,530
stage I hope I got across a little bit

00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:25,250
that you can do and how you interact

00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:28,530
with an API when using him as an Alexa

00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:30,150
it's fairly easy to add this to your

00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:33,390
existing application if you have an API

00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:36,210
if you don't have one you should API so

00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:37,890
awesome the really difficult part in my

00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:40,460
opinion is thinking about all the states

00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:43,380
and the actual interaction model I

00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:44,910
really should be UX challenges I might

00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:47,280
have thought about DX all week so that's

00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:49,590
why that's DX in the slides designing

00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:52,020
voice user interfaces from O'Reilly is

00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:54,690
the best book actually the only really

00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:56,490
good book I've found so far to help you

00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:59,310
think about these problems there's also

00:55:56,490 --> 00:56:00,630
a program in smaller design problem so

00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:02,340
if you want to do this in your company

00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:04,200
rep your designers Python this book and

00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:06,150
then start implementing voice interfaces

00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:08,430
and with that I thank you for your

00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:10,740
attention and Gilad voice interfaces I

00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:12,960
don't think if you careful of table

00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:14,460
thoughts I think we have time for

00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,660
questions so find me after what I'm

00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:17,100
going to hang out near the content field

00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:18,630
sign if you have questions about Alexa

00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:22,699
or content thank you

00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:22,699
