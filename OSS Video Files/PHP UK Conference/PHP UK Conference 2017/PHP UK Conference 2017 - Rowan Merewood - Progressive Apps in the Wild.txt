Title: PHP UK Conference 2017 - Rowan Merewood - Progressive Apps in the Wild
Publication date: 2017-04-03
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2017
Description: 
	Progressive Web App provides a term to encompass what a modern web site can and should be. It builds on the foundations of web and enforces its best practices while allowing sites to adopt advanced features that previously required a native app. We will look at how to build a fast and secure web app while progressively layering in offline support, push notifications, and adding to the homescreen... and all beautifully standards-compliant.

welcome to this talk this is about

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,429
progressive web apps specifically

00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:12,230
examples out in the wild that I can show

00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:15,320
you and demonstrate what they're doing

00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:17,960
and why it's a good idea so firstly

00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,269
because I like to have an idea of who

00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,699
I'm talking to so about like how fast I

00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:24,289
can go and also just to check that it's

00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:26,029
the end of the day and you are still

00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:28,039
awake we'll do the traditional kind of

00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:30,380
putting up hands to answer various

00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:34,370
questions so who has heard the term

00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:38,570
progressive web apps before ok we can

00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:40,430
skip through a lot of this so I guess

00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,980
actually front end and back end the the

00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:44,810
term is all-encompassing who thinks they

00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:54,230
could define what a progressive web app

00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:58,220
is okay oh yes and if you want to follow

00:00:54,230 --> 00:01:00,590
me on Twitter then it's at Roane m and I

00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:02,960
am a developer advocate at Google so I

00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:05,570
focus a lot on web related things and

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,369
working with partners to kind of bring

00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,710
some of this early access technology

00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:11,990
into the real world and prove that it

00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:14,960
can help make you money or make your

00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:17,960
users happier a couple definitions then

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,999
though so for us as developers

00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,009
I feel the PWA is a term that allows us

00:01:19,999 --> 00:01:23,229
to and this is the important bit that

00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:25,880
we'll spend a lot of slides on

00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:28,969
quantifiably define what a good modern

00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:31,429
web experiences so what this means is

00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:34,459
that there is kind of a part of the

00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:36,109
progressive Web Apps term where remember

00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:38,299
in the past everyone would ask if this

00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:41,149
was web 2.0 and you'd roll your eyes

00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:43,399
because you knew that was nonsense we

00:01:41,149 --> 00:01:46,639
have a sort of aspect where it's kind of

00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:50,149
as a user then what we want progressive

00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:52,969
web app to do is allow you to raise your

00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:55,039
expectations for what is possible from

00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:57,200
the web so what we'll do is we'll go

00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:59,569
through and we'll see what these aspects

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:04,549
are and how they can change the way that

00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:07,399
you interact with web sites ok and to

00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:09,950
get a bit more technical then this is

00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:12,440
this is a graph explaining explaining

00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:14,610
the benefits for your users so this is

00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:17,250
happiness up this access

00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,950
axis which is um I don't think access

00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:23,460
makes anyone happy which is measured in

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:27,930
Smiley's and PW a mess along this axis

00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:31,620
which is measured out of a hundred so as

00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:34,260
you can see we have bad websites down

00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:38,070
here then I'm going to show you how we

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:40,350
actually split PWA is up so we sort of

00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:42,990
bucket them into two categories there's

00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:45,390
a baseline PW a which kind of gets you

00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,470
this much user happiness and then

00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,959
there's what we kind of called the

00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:51,690
exemplary PW a so this is where you go

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,810
above and beyond to really polish the

00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:56,160
experience and that takes you up here I

00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,290
probably should have swapped those

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:03,600
around I think this guy looks happier

00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:07,320
than that one but we won't dwell on that

00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:10,260
this is overly technical let's actually

00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,750
get into the definition then so when we

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:16,440
talk about PW a s this is what we mean

00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:18,500
by the baseline so the first thing is we

00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,360
say that the site is served over HTTPS

00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:23,700
secondly these pages are responsive and

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,930
I'll go into detail about exactly what I

00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,750
mean about these things

00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:31,260
we have metadata in for add to

00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:36,540
homescreen who's who has web apps added

00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:38,299
to their home screen Wow okay the other

00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,830
thing I like about doing these talks is

00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:42,269
one getting distracted from my point and

00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,760
segwaying off into something else

00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:47,070
and two I like to try and give you very

00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,670
applicable examples that you can either

00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:52,500
code right now in fact who has like a

00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:55,019
laptop where they have access to like

00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,709
their own site or you don't have to

00:03:55,019 --> 00:04:00,450
close it I'm not going to test you um

00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:02,459
but but you know if like you have stuff

00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:04,290
hosted and github pages then you can

00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:07,170
actually update this while I'm doing the

00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:09,090
talk and you can you can tweet me

00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:12,480
afterwards and I can review the pull

00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:15,299
request or something okay then we also

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,250
start to have this aspect where we have

00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:19,470
an expectation that these sites should

00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,930
be able to work offline so I'll show you

00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:25,169
how that works it's the web so it should

00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,760
also be cross browser and then as the

00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:28,560
capabilities of these pages get more

00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,660
advanced we also want you

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,850
to be able to interact with them in a

00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,680
way that makes sense so transitions

00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:37,440
between pages shouldn't feel like

00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,970
they're being blocked by having tap the

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,980
button and now they simply have to wait

00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:44,639
to see if the request eventually turns

00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:46,380
up and finally and this is one that as

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,180
PHP developers you should be more

00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:51,960
comfortable with rather than JavaScript

00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:55,200
developers each page has a URL it sounds

00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,450
simple but people always go to like one

00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,919
extreme and suddenly decide that you

00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:03,870
know Oh back in the good old days when

00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:05,610
your website was a flash applet okay now

00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,460
of course we wouldn't be developers

00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:11,040
unless we had a tool to automate this so

00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:13,650
what we've released is a tool called

00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:16,200
lighthouse you can get this as an

00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:19,620
extension in chrome it's also available

00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,880
in MPM so you can run it run it via node

00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,479
and sort of incorporate it into your

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,100
gulp build you can get it to run with a

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,830
headless version of chrome there are a

00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:31,350
few caveats to that but on the whole you

00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:34,140
can just install this and you can start

00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:37,169
testing for baseline pwace on any site

00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:41,070
that you visit you see the subliminal

00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:47,400
messaging here lighthouse and use is

00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:49,200
highlighted use lighthouse good okay so

00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,780
let me show you what that looks like

00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,150
here's an example of an arbitrary web

00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:57,240
page that I selected just to run a

00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:58,740
lighthouse test on so I tap the

00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,830
extension and it lets me generate a

00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:04,770
report I'll tap that and it will go off

00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:06,930
and generate a score out of a hundred so

00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,580
you will be able to scroll through here

00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,440
and you can kind of see each of the

00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,539
categories that we talked about and

00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,550
we'll explain what is either missing or

00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:19,530
what is passing so you can see with a

00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:21,450
score of 35 here this is when you

00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,770
weren't doing very well in school but

00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:25,410
they didn't want to make you feel bad

00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,879
they they would say there's room for

00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:30,029
improvement yeah

00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,319
there's there's low-hanging fruit which

00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:34,409
can actually be taken care of very

00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:36,449
easily and hopefully I want to

00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:39,119
demonstrate throughout this talk why

00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:40,709
this isn't simply a case of oh I want to

00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:42,270
take these boxes because I want to be

00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:43,860
using the latest technology and it

00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:46,649
doesn't actually make a difference to my

00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:49,139
site each of these points has a very

00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:52,139
real effect when it comes to how users

00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:54,179
interact with your site and how you can

00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:57,469
have a successful site for whatever

00:06:54,179 --> 00:07:00,389
purpose you're trying to fulfill okay

00:06:57,469 --> 00:07:05,699
rule number one slightly served over

00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:09,569
HTTPS who and not over HTTPS always and

00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:14,550
only served over HTTPS who whose site

00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:17,610
fulfills this category yeah good good so

00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:19,559
this is an example to show you in

00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,819
practice what's going on here and this

00:07:19,559 --> 00:07:23,490
is what you should think about applying

00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:26,099
to your site if you're not already so if

00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:29,159
I do a simple curl call for a stripe

00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:31,319
which is a payment provider on HTTP I'm

00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:34,079
going to get back this 301 redirect

00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:36,389
redirecting me to the HTTPS version so

00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:38,459
this is our sort of default of you just

00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:40,559
type it into the browser and you want to

00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:43,469
make sure you go to the right place now

00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:47,279
if I then curl the HTTPS version of

00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:50,459
stripe I get this back so this the

00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:53,729
strict Transport Security header is an

00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:56,129
important aspect of making HTTPS the

00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:58,349
default for your site so what you get

00:07:56,129 --> 00:08:00,949
here is a max age so we're basically

00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:05,939
saying that we want this to apply for a

00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:09,449
while and and we want to apply it to the

00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:12,959
subdomains of that path as well so this

00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:15,569
is referred to as HSTs or the HTTP

00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,819
strict Transport Security and what that

00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:20,759
header is doing is it's telling your

00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:22,889
browser or basically any compliant

00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,839
client that is receiving that request

00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:28,740
it's telling it that it should only

00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:32,479
interact with that domain over HTTPS and

00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:35,219
one of the benefits of this is it

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,680
lessens the risk of some

00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:39,510
man-in-the-middle and protocol downgrade

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,900
attacks there was when I was looking

00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,480
around

00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:44,810
this there's a good presentation Amit

00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:49,620
Lee from 2009 from Moxie Marlinspike

00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:52,200
where he shows basically how if you take

00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:54,570
over like a Wi-Fi access point then you

00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,630
can just redirect traffic to http all

00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:59,790
the time you can play a few tricks so

00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:03,300
that you can put like a padlock icon in

00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:05,700
the in the address bar and so on but

00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:09,150
basically by telling the browser that

00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:11,670
you only want to do HTTP you sort of you

00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:14,460
mitigate the risks of being downgraded

00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:17,040
to that one of the other things you can

00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:22,200
do then is if you are returning this

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:23,820
header also go to the HSTs preload site

00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,730
because what you can do here is you can

00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:29,610
submit your domain and that means that

00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:32,550
browsers will actually use that list of

00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:34,290
domains to ensure that they only go to

00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:36,540
the HTTPS version of that site

00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:39,600
regardless of what the user types into

00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:44,670
the address bar so we can see an example

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:48,030
of that here I thought I had some more

00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:52,470
slides and maybe someone's man in the

00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:54,240
middle to my presentation okay so this

00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,280
is what's happening so inside of dev

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,990
tools I'm taking a look at the requests

00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:00,420
and what I've done here is I've just

00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:03,300
typed stripe com into the address bar

00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:05,760
and so there's an HTTP request that

00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:08,760
looks like it's going off but I'm seeing

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,040
this status code back a 307 which is a

00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,600
temporary redirect but what is actually

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,090
happening here is if you hover over that

00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,730
in dev tools you'll see it labeled as an

00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:20,460
internal redirect so chrome is actually

00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:23,060
not making that request out to the

00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:25,040
server it is just immediately

00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:28,860
acknowledging the HSTs

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:31,410
header and redirecting you or sorry not

00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:36,450
redirecting you just clearing the HTTPS

00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:41,690
site okay make sense everyone going to

00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:47,670
go implement a header now yes

00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:51,210
right why why is this important so 150

00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:54,000
million is the value of one Bitcoin at

00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:56,790
the moment or it is the projected

00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,360
average cost of a data breach in 2020 I

00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:03,570
don't know where this figure comes from

00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,520
but it's a big scary number and if you

00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:08,760
are looking for reasons to help push

00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:11,040
your organization to go HTTPS only then

00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:14,360
being able to explain that this is the

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:19,710
cost of not doing it is is quite helpful

00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:21,750
and then as the initial sort of aspect

00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:24,030
of progressive web apps as well almost

00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:25,860
all of these other features that are

00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:28,230
included in the kind of progressive web

00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:32,970
app bundle are dependent on the site

00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:35,340
being over HTTPS as well okay second one

00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:37,980
then pages are responsive on tablet and

00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:39,780
mobile devices I don't want to spend a

00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,760
lot of time on this one because design

00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:44,790
is a big topic and I'm a developer not a

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,730
designer so these slides of the extent

00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:49,560
of my creative output but I do want to

00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:53,760
say a few things about it so an example

00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:55,710
of responsive design then is a colleague

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,650
of mine Sebastian runs the amp by

00:11:55,710 --> 00:12:00,210
example site this is one of my other

00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:04,620
opportunities to segue into a different

00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:07,440
topic who knows about amp okay so amp is

00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:10,440
accelerated mobile pages which is a sort

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,480
of a JavaScript framework that we

00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,940
provide or sorry an open-source

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,160
JavaScript framework that is for

00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:20,070
building high-performance cacheable web

00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,930
pages so it has a lot of limitations

00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:23,640
instead of what CSS you're allowed to

00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:26,090
use what JavaScript you're allowed to

00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:30,510
use but you can still build a

00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:31,910
functioning responsive site in it so

00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:34,230
really the key thing here is that

00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:37,350
responsive is a goal I'm not trying to

00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:40,500
prescribe a specific architecture to you

00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:44,130
in this so on amp by example that is a

00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:47,190
fully responsive page that is being

00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:49,380
delivered it is absolutely fine if you

00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:50,880
are doing server-side responsive so

00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,860
you're looking at the user agent that is

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,750
coming in and you're returning something

00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,290
different based on the user agent those

00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,209
kind of bad

00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,730
as long as the user is getting

00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:02,040
functionally equivalent content on the

00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:08,880
URL that is appropriate for their device

00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:11,000
then I'm happy okay next step adding

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,670
metadata for the Add to Home screen

00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,720
functionality so this is one of those

00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:22,050
times where in the in the first Batman

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,790
film the the first like the 1991 the

00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:26,100
Joker has poisoned like a load of

00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:27,360
products and he's threatening the city

00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,279
with them and he has this line about

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,290
it's like you may be using them already

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,380
so that's actually what's going on here

00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:36,029
I'm not trying to poison you but you may

00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:39,089
actually be using add to homescreen

00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:42,300
enabled apps already so if you go to a

00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:45,329
mobile twitter.com and open up dev tools

00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,610
then you'll see the you can go to the

00:13:45,329 --> 00:13:50,490
manifest tab or sorry the application

00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:52,949
tab and then manifest in here and it

00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:55,709
will show you okay that's a bit better

00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:59,630
it will show you the information that is

00:13:55,709 --> 00:14:02,310
available for that now if your site

00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:05,430
fulfills these criteria that your

00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:07,920
manifest has provided a name a short

00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:10,800
name a start URL which is where it's

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,170
going to be launched to and some icons

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,050
then if you're loaded over HTTPS then

00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:20,459
chrome will actually prompt the user to

00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:22,380
add the app to their home screen so this

00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:24,870
this is the opportunity where if you

00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:26,279
want to go to github right now you can

00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,870
add a manifest to your site and you can

00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:30,540
add it to the home screen there are also

00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:32,760
a couple manifest generator tools out

00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,500
there I mean it is just a JSON file but

00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,600
there are a whole bunch of attributes

00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,519
that you can also add to it so this is

00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:42,510
the bare minimum just to describe your

00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:43,920
sort of your icon you can also add a

00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:46,500
number of other things so you can

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,689
specify like do you want the display to

00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,610
be as a standalone so it looks fully

00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:52,050
like an app do you want it to be minimal

00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:54,240
UI so that you still have the address

00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:56,189
bar and so on in there you can specify

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,980
the preferred orientation for your app

00:14:56,189 --> 00:15:00,329
portrait landscape theme color and

00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,130
background color so that when the user

00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:04,709
is going through the switcher or looking

00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:07,840
at the address bar you actually get the

00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:12,850
the theme color applied to that as well

00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:14,710
and then and this this actually gets me

00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,520
quite excited I'm not sure if everybody

00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:17,050
else is

00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,670
I would help we're a web conference

00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:21,880
right you guys are excited by the web

00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:25,029
yes more so than Android apps are you

00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:33,310
excited by Android apps are you excited

00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:35,020
by anything so so this flag inside of

00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:38,560
Chrome enable improved Add to Home

00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:40,330
screen if if you like fiddling with the

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,860
flags in Chrome on your mobile device

00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:45,430
then you can go ahead and enable this

00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:47,230
and what will happen is normally what

00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:50,230
Add to Home screen does is it's kind of

00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:52,570
like the equivalent of a turbocharged

00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:55,270
bookmark right it sits on your desktop

00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:57,310
and when you tap it it launches the URL

00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:58,839
that was specified what improved that to

00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:02,080
homescreen does is it actually takes

00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:04,330
that manifest and in the background kind

00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:07,270
of mints an apk for it so it actually

00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:10,480
installs the app or installs the website

00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:12,820
as its own app onto your phone that

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,790
means that you get things like this when

00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:18,460
I tap a link in another app then the

00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:21,910
website the web app is available to

00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:23,980
handle that link it also means that I

00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:25,839
can go and look at the app info so I can

00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,460
see how much bandwidth has this site

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,160
used how much battery is it responsible

00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:33,820
for consuming basically you get this

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:40,630
much more integrated experience with an

00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:44,740
installed web app it absolutely is yeah

00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:48,490
so manifest Jason in fact everything I'm

00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:51,640
showing you in this presentation is w3

00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:54,370
standards the things that are different

00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:57,580
are the way various browsers choose to

00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:59,500
implement them so opera does opera

00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:01,150
actually has like a gesture that you

00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,250
because of course opera has a gesture

00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:05,439
that you can use to do this I think it's

00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:07,329
like you pull down into the left and you

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,500
can trigger Add to Home screen for the

00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:13,170
site

00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:16,060
I think edge is doing some stuff here

00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:18,550
basically these are all w3c standards

00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:20,439
but surprising enough because I work at

00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:21,040
Google I tend to know more about the

00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:24,280
Google relay

00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:26,200
implementations but yes please don't

00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,850
come away with the the feeling that I am

00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,770
pushing you to try and do some kind of

00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:32,500
Google integration here this is very

00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:37,720
much open standards for all of this

00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:39,280
so the manifesto Jason is what controls

00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,500
this and then it's down to the

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,690
individual browsers as to how they want

00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:47,800
to interpret that and provide an add to

00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:50,320
homescreen experience one one thing you

00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:52,120
you could do is like in the bar later if

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,270
you want to ask Ben at the front here

00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:57,220
about huevos and and how how web apps

00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:59,400
can be amazing then that's that's

00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:02,260
definitely a good topic of conversation

00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,470
so yes this is the point this is just a

00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:08,470
normal website this is not like a

00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:11,530
titanium or Appcelerator or Cordova

00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:13,750
wrapper it is just your website it just

00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:17,500
happens to be more deeply integrated in

00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:19,900
with the operating system okay and then

00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:22,600
more big numbers for you to show to

00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:25,600
business people to to suggest why you

00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:29,200
should be doing this so this is the

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:31,120
alibaba.com site that is a lot less

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,360
readable than I expected it to be but

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:37,120
that is alibaba.com they added add to

00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:39,370
homescreen and they saw a 4x increase in

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,620
the amount of engagement sorry the

00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:44,050
interaction rate the people had from

00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:46,360
launching it to the home screen so I

00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:48,760
think you may have heard this actually

00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,620
from a lot of people is that when they

00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:53,920
sort of talk about you know why do you

00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:56,140
have an app it's because they want some

00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,150
of that home screen real estate so a lot

00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:00,220
of the time the app is not necessarily

00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:02,110
in fact I've seen a lot of apps that are

00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,430
literally just the website wrapped up in

00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:06,430
an apk and deployed to the Play Store

00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:08,740
because it gets a bit more exposure so

00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:10,600
we want to be able to make it so that

00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,730
people don't have to do that because

00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,930
it's a business decision you should be

00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:17,460
able to make what you feel is

00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:17,460
technically the right decision

00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:25,190
oh good question oh yes and actually I'm

00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:29,929
more than happy for people to just

00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:31,549
interrupt through this because they it's

00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:33,559
because I was I've been through these

00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:35,149
slides quite a bit now so I actually get

00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:39,140
a little bit bored going through them so

00:19:35,149 --> 00:19:42,350
if you ask me things so when when you

00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:45,110
specify the start URL you can specify

00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:46,730
any URL so if you want you can just have

00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:47,929
like a get parameter or something on

00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:49,549
there that would allow you to measure

00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:52,370
like how many people are launching from

00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:53,659
the home screen additionally when it's

00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:55,700
launched from the home screen you can

00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:57,350
also access I can't remember exactly

00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,720
what it is but it's one of the media

00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:01,220
queries in the CSS that you can use to

00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:05,299
determine that this is a home screened

00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:07,190
app as well one of the things that I I

00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:10,070
would love to see more of as well is

00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:12,140
that people tend to do add to home

00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:14,659
screen as just an analogue for kind of

00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,970
saying oh if I have example.com then Add

00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:18,679
to Home screen should just be

00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:20,929
example.com right just like a bookmarked

00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:22,909
at the top of the site but what you can

00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:25,279
actually do is you can specify these

00:20:22,909 --> 00:20:27,380
manifests throughout the site and you

00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:30,169
can provide a scope for the manifest as

00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:32,750
well to say what path it is responsible

00:20:30,169 --> 00:20:35,240
for and what that would mean is say if

00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:38,570
you were a hotel booking site you could

00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:40,039
have a web app that was hotel search but

00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:42,950
then you could have another one scoped

00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:44,659
to like slash bookings that was just a

00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:47,000
web app for displaying your current

00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:49,039
booking so you're not limited to say add

00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,380
to homescreen must map directly to my

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:55,070
top-level domain you can map it to any

00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:57,470
path that you want across the site okay

00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:59,120
the next rule then is now that we can

00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:02,120
add stuff to our home screen and they

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,460
they look more like an app to the user

00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,860
we've actually raised the expectations

00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:09,980
because now what happens is if I tap on

00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:11,690
that shortcut why don't want is the you

00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:14,090
know the white page of death or the

00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:17,570
dinosaur game or whatever my offline

00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:19,010
indicator is so this means that now that

00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:20,899
we've installed our web app to the home

00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:26,289
screen we need to be able to provide

00:21:20,899 --> 00:21:28,429
some sort of offline experience there so

00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:31,880
everyone they get surprised by my own

00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:34,040
slides does anyone has anyone heard of

00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,690
the physical

00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:38,730
web-one okay so I turned the

00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:41,520
transmission power up as high as I

00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:43,760
possibly could on this so it may be

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,530
cooking some of you in the front row but

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:49,530
but basically my phone is acting as a

00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:51,420
beacon and broadcasting a URL out which

00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:53,250
is this this is the idea of the physical

00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:55,850
web is that you can attach beacons in

00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:58,830
various places with URLs to represent

00:21:55,850 --> 00:22:01,410
what is happening in them so maybe a

00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:03,660
beacon in here that provides a link to

00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:05,340
the schedule for this room for example

00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:07,770
or beacon in a restaurant that provides

00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:10,230
their menu or something like that

00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:13,920
so obviously what I have is a beacon

00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:18,150
that just goes to a little amp page that

00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:22,380
is about me but the important thing to

00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:26,460
notice here is if you make that request

00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:31,790
and then refresh that page then inside

00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:34,350
of the oddly inside of the size column

00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:39,420
you'll actually see this from service

00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:41,130
worker request there so just so I know

00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:43,260
whether I'm losing people or you're

00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:46,920
falling asleep who who knows what a

00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:50,730
service worker is oh okay actually not

00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:53,460
that many okay so a service worker is

00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:55,920
basically a piece of JavaScript there is

00:22:53,460 --> 00:23:03,300
allowed to run in the background for

00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:06,240
your site so yeah so it is a JavaScript

00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:09,180
worker yeah but then the service worker

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:13,020
is a sort of specific implementation of

00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:16,320
that so basically you can have a service

00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:18,420
worker that again is scoped to a given

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,280
path by default it's just scoped to the

00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:22,890
location of the service worker script

00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:26,250
and what this allows you to do is a

00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:28,440
service worker can sit there and it

00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:30,210
controls the number of pages that are

00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,540
linked to it and it can intercept the

00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:35,460
requests that are coming in in out from

00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:39,000
that page and the responses that are

00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:40,830
coming back this allows you to do some

00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,780
primary things it actually allows you to

00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:44,390
do a ridiculous amount of things because

00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,890
you're basically sitting as a prop

00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:47,840
in between your page so you can

00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:49,820
transform those requests in any way you

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,460
want but that's how to scope for this

00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:54,020
talk the interesting things that we care

00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,750
about is the serviceworker allows you do

00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:58,520
caching it allows you to receive push

00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:00,620
notifications which we'll get onto later

00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:03,590
and allows you to do background sync in

00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:06,680
the site so the reason that you're

00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:10,400
seeing this here and if you go to this

00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:12,470
page and take a look at the the

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,420
application tab you'll actually see a

00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:16,220
link to the serviceworker so you can

00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:18,110
look at the code in there

00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:21,650
ah conveniently I put a slide in to

00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:23,540
explain that so inside of here you can

00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:27,260
see that the serviceworker activated and

00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:30,020
running you've got now service workers

00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:32,750
do introduce some interesting complexity

00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:34,910
into development so it is actually very

00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:36,770
useful to have things like this you can

00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:38,930
specify when you're developing the

00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:40,730
update on reload and bypass for network

00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:42,620
we'll just kind of make sure that it is

00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:44,750
bypassing the serviceworker and you're

00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:46,400
not getting a cached version when you've

00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:49,520
just been busy updating stuff on your

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:53,690
development machine so if I jump into

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:55,250
the serviceworker code then and i just

00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:58,160
want to give you a sort of flavor of

00:24:55,250 --> 00:25:01,070
this because i have a lot of slides to

00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,390
get through in 35 minutes so this is

00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:04,130
just to give you an idea of the

00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:07,640
functionality rather than to try and

00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:09,620
explain how service workers work if you

00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,930
would like to know more then we can do

00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:13,970
some code labs together after this but

00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:15,410
effectively what happens is inside of

00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,090
the serviceworker you can add various

00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:19,220
event listeners for the different events

00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:21,440
that happen so here we're adding event

00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:23,210
listener for the install event which is

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,270
unsurprisingly when the serviceworker is

00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:29,000
installed into the browser an event dot

00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:31,070
wait until it just means that the

00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,170
browser will not kill this request

00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:35,450
before it's done doing what it wants to

00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:39,110
do and in this case what it wants to do

00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:41,420
is it's opening up a cache which is just

00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:44,060
with an arbitrary name and it's going

00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:47,690
through and it's adding all of these

00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:50,720
URLs to the cache so what that means is

00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:53,150
that if I'm offline and I make that

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,610
request then the serviceworker is

00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:58,290
actually returning all of this data for

00:25:55,610 --> 00:26:00,390
me so my basic site works offline

00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:03,590
now the other thing that you can do here

00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:06,750
as well is this would also work that say

00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:09,000
you don't you can't cash the entirety of

00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:10,650
your site not only would that not work

00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,170
it would actually be quite unfriendly

00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:15,000
for the user but what you can do is you

00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:17,010
can detect that you're offline and

00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,780
instead of trying to sit there and go

00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:21,060
out to the network you can return a

00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:23,040
Status page to the user explaining that

00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:25,650
they're offline so that would mean that

00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,510
when I tap your icon from the home

00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:29,400
screen and I'm in airplane mode you

00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:31,050
might choose to do something like show

00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,300
me some cash content that is viewing

00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:34,950
previously or just show me an indicator

00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,210
that I'm offline at the moment and I

00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:41,310
should relaunch the app when I have a

00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:48,540
connection that that makes sense to

00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:51,570
people yeah good ah good question so the

00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:54,240
service worker does pay attention to the

00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:57,570
the cache headers that you put on those

00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,430
requests but these sort of they're both

00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:02,310
a sort of double edged sword with

00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:04,230
service workers is that you are fully in

00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:06,120
control of that so what you'll see in

00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:09,240
these demos is that you are also

00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:11,040
responsible for clearing the cache as

00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,390
well and there are a number of ways that

00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,850
you can do that very easily so the

00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:17,040
default one is that when a new service

00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:18,990
worker is installed you tend to just

00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:23,430
destroy your existing cache and we

00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:26,550
initialize it but effectively and we as

00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:27,810
a service worker actually we're updating

00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:29,610
these but there are some there are some

00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:31,350
existing service worker libraries that

00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:33,360
also provides sort of out-of-the-box

00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:35,400
implementations for a bunch of caching

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,380
strategies so you can either do cache

00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,300
first Network first you can set up a

00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:42,480
race so that it's cache or network

00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:43,950
whichever one responds first and then we

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,720
could even get into the amazing sort of

00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:49,320
streaming stuff that you can do with

00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:52,320
these requests as well so next bit

00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:54,570
siteworx cross browser hopefully this is

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:58,520
not a big surprise for anyone does

00:27:54,570 --> 00:28:01,490
anyone still have to support IE yeah

00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:03,050
it's like government work or something

00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:05,670
anyway

00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:09,030
so the point that I want to make about

00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:11,220
this is this bit this is what we mean by

00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:14,700
the progressive part of progress

00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:17,039
webapps is it's not about saying you

00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:19,559
must have JavaScript to enabled it to

00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:21,090
browse this page it's about saying that

00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:23,640
we will take advantage of the

00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:25,980
capabilities that your browser offers to

00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:30,720
enhance and progressively enhance your

00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:32,309
experience so just to kind of ram that

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,929
point home I went and took a look at the

00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:39,090
the PHP UK conference site in links

00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:40,830
which does work for the info page but

00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:42,870
doesn't work for the schedule page

00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:45,690
because that does appear to be popped in

00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:47,429
via JavaScript but it gave me enough to

00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,760
make a worthwhile slide here so

00:28:47,429 --> 00:28:52,679
hopefully that's made the made the point

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,450
okay so the next bit page transitions

00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:57,870
feel like they don't block on the

00:28:54,450 --> 00:29:00,620
network now what this means is that if

00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:02,520
we look at something like Facebook and

00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:04,440
conveniently I was able to find a

00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:06,570
section of my Facebook where it was

00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,400
actually just to PHP people in the

00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:11,700
stream so I wasn't exposing you to

00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:14,429
anything you shouldn't see so inside of

00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:18,090
here you can see the Eli has posted an

00:29:14,429 --> 00:29:20,580
article and I go to tap on it so when I

00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:23,039
tap what I'm getting is I actually get

00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:25,590
this instant response and I'm getting a

00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:27,809
loading indicator there before I get

00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:31,400
into the actual article itself so this

00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:35,190
is literally all we mean by this is that

00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:37,559
when users interact with elements in the

00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:41,100
page they should get immediate feedback

00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:43,260
that something is happening and did who

00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:45,750
did anyone who did like computer science

00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:49,140
at university or some equivalent thing

00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:52,620
so you probably remember spending some

00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:56,970
UX time on like Nielsen's usability

00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:59,039
heuristics and so on anyway this is 1993

00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:01,740
but this all still applies what this

00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:03,900
basically says is that there are these

00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:06,030
three important time limits for user

00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:07,799
interactions so the first is if

00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:09,840
something happens within point one of a

00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:11,400
second that's basically instantaneous

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,380
you don't need to worry about doing

00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,390
anything if I tap the button and you

00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:17,100
know the story is going to display like

00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:19,320
that you don't need to bother showing a

00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:21,809
loading indicator if it's about one

00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:24,940
second you do want to show some kind of

00:30:21,809 --> 00:30:26,650
in determine spinner or just you know

00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:29,500
little some dots or something like that

00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:31,270
if it's going to go to like 10 seconds

00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:33,130
and above that's when you want to show

00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:36,130
the user some kind of indicator of

00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:37,960
progress and preferably also give them a

00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:40,090
way to cancel out of that and get back

00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,520
the worst feeling is always when you've

00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:44,290
tapped on a link and you know now that

00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:47,080
you're you're committed you're either

00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:49,150
gonna wait for this or if you press back

00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,950
the site's not gonna deal with that and

00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:53,620
it's gonna just leave you in some kind

00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:59,290
of weird have I added this to my basket

00:30:53,620 --> 00:31:01,420
have I booked the flight and another

00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:04,270
important point that I want to make here

00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:06,820
is part of this is also the browser

00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:09,160
gives you a lot of stuff for free right

00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:10,840
when you tap a link you get some kind of

00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,120
indicator showing you that like a

00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,710
request is actually going off depending

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,210
on the browser you may even get like an

00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:18,160
indicator showing that the response is

00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:20,080
coming back as well if the user has

00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:22,300
added your site to their home screen and

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:25,990
you've used the stand alone mode then

00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:27,940
you lose all of that browser chrome that

00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:30,670
provides that feedback to the user I

00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:32,830
mean which means that you have to

00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:36,330
implement mechanisms of making it clear

00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:39,580
to the user that something is happening

00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:41,350
okay this one each page has a URL I

00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:43,840
don't think this is controversial in

00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:45,790
this room unless there any single page

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:51,010
app developers who have snuck in without

00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:53,860
telling us but actually on on that note

00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:57,220
though so this is a single page app this

00:31:53,860 --> 00:32:02,290
is a pokedex org and what you'll see is

00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:06,160
if I go in and tap on one of these then

00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:08,380
what I'm getting is just the anchor tag

00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:12,250
here so the you know the hash slash

00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:14,470
Pokemon but they've still changed it and

00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:16,780
you can also then double check that if

00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:19,360
you if you just copy and paste this out

00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:21,220
and paste it into a new tab then you are

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,110
actually going to come back to this page

00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:26,500
so it doesn't matter that it's just a

00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:29,080
JavaScript anchor tag as far as the user

00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:31,480
is concerned they have a link if they

00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:33,460
send that link to someone else then that

00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,560
person should be able to see the same

00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:37,690
thing that they shared I don't want to

00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:40,809
send this link and then just get direct

00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:43,120
to the homepage okay

00:32:40,809 --> 00:32:45,159
and then of course to manipulate this

00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:48,850
you have the history API which is what

00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:51,940
allows you to push these new these new

00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:54,250
entries into the location bar and it

00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:55,720
then behaves in the predictable way with

00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:58,029
the browser so when you press the back

00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:03,639
button this will also pop that state

00:32:58,029 --> 00:33:07,419
back out of the stack as well okay whoo

00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:09,909
that was the baseline experience so now

00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:11,379
we're also going to accelerate through

00:33:09,909 --> 00:33:14,980
this and go into the exemplary

00:33:11,379 --> 00:33:17,679
experience as well this is the the

00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:19,690
exemplary checklist then so this is the

00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,580
kind of adding on top of what we've done

00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:24,340
with the baseline so the first aspect

00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:27,100
then is the index ability and social

00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:28,990
side so one of the problems you often

00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:31,090
see with single page apps where you're

00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:33,009
using the anchor tags is it's fine for

00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:35,230
the user when they're navigating around

00:33:33,009 --> 00:33:38,889
but if I say share that link to Facebook

00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:40,990
then the Facebook crawler is just

00:33:38,889 --> 00:33:43,690
getting back either no information or

00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:45,879
the generic information for the site so

00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:48,100
you need to make sure that you do have

00:33:45,879 --> 00:33:50,860
some form of either server-side

00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:52,809
rendering or you know that the crawlers

00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:54,190
that are interacting with your pages are

00:33:52,809 --> 00:33:57,129
capable of interpreting enough

00:33:54,190 --> 00:34:00,190
JavaScript to get what they need

00:33:57,129 --> 00:34:02,980
it's also then important in the world of

00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:04,539
kind of amp and other translations and

00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:06,490
other formats and different mobile

00:34:04,539 --> 00:34:09,310
versions to make sure that you are

00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:12,520
specifying what your canonical content

00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:14,440
is so if this for anyone who isn't

00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:17,470
familiar with it is you just have the

00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:19,329
rel canonical links in the the header of

00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:24,700
your document that point back to the

00:34:19,329 --> 00:34:27,700
original content for that site user

00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:32,050
experience so I think I had an example

00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:34,060
for this yes I do good okay so I'm sure

00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:36,010
people have had the experience of you're

00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:38,379
trying to load a page and things keep

00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:40,839
jumping in as they load reflow in the

00:34:38,379 --> 00:34:43,270
text you also want to make sure

00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:45,339
especially in the world now of kind of

00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:47,649
new infinite scrolling through lists

00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:49,960
that when I press back I want to be

00:34:47,649 --> 00:34:50,950
taken back to the same location I was

00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,990
not taken

00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:54,970
at the top of the list or even worse

00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:56,940
taking back to a brand-new search that's

00:34:54,970 --> 00:35:00,280
forgotten all the filtering that I did

00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:01,839
and finally you also have on mobile

00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:05,200
devices you do have some JavaScript

00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:07,390
which cannot remember at the moment but

00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,430
it does mean that there's also the hole

00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:11,260
you tap into a field and the keyboard

00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:12,849
conveniently slides up right over the

00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:15,250
field that you're trying to type into

00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:17,740
you can mitigate this by using the I

00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:21,099
think it's the scroll interview call as

00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:24,520
well so this is the experience that I

00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:26,740
was talking about is I go here and I

00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:28,000
want to see more cat pictures who

00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:30,670
wouldn't want to see more pictures of

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:34,510
that cat so I'm going and I'm going and

00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:38,970
just as I'm about to tap an ad pops in

00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:38,970
and instead of getting my cat pictures

00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:44,770
so I had to use a contrived example here

00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:48,130
because I didn't really want to single

00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:50,490
out real websites and and just min

00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:53,319
ridicule them in front of you anyway

00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:55,599
back to the remaining user experience so

00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:57,430
this now talks about what happens when

00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:00,040
we have added to homescreen and we've

00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:02,410
started taking the browser controls away

00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:04,270
from the user so we also don't give them

00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:06,190
if they've added to homescreen you don't

00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:08,349
have a location bar I can't just copy

00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:10,390
and paste the URL to share it with

00:36:08,349 --> 00:36:12,579
someone else so this means that you want

00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:14,829
to do things like provide sharing

00:36:12,579 --> 00:36:16,530
functionality inside of the site you

00:36:14,829 --> 00:36:19,480
want to ensure that again just

00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:21,970
reiterating the whole this site should

00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:26,049
work across all devices and all form

00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:28,930
factors the app install prompts that you

00:36:26,049 --> 00:36:32,740
get as well so inside of chrome for

00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:35,049
example when it does show the Add to

00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:37,150
Home screen banner you actually get an

00:36:35,049 --> 00:36:39,640
event that you can subscribe to because

00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:41,829
a lot of the time it might not show the

00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:43,299
Add to Home screen banner at a moment

00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:45,069
that is appropriate for you so

00:36:43,299 --> 00:36:47,380
especially if you have say a very funnel

00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:49,599
based site where it's kind of I've been

00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:52,329
browsing I found a product I've added it

00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:53,680
to my basket I'm about to pay and then

00:36:52,329 --> 00:36:55,660
it pops up and says Add to Home screen

00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,700
in the middle of it that's that's gonna

00:36:55,660 --> 00:37:00,369
break the flow of the what the users

00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:01,839
doing Add to Home screen will they

00:37:00,369 --> 00:37:04,330
actually come back to the same location

00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:06,520
that they were in not too sure but you

00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:08,260
can capture that and then you once

00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:10,480
you've got that you can choose to reach

00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:12,250
rigor the prompt at an appropriate time

00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,370
so for example that's when I have

00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:17,080
completed my completed my purchase and

00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:18,970
maybe I get some tracking information

00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,740
that's when you can me

00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:22,360
hey add to homescreen so that you can

00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:26,890
actually just come back and easily track

00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:30,430
the status of your order so this was

00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:33,040
what airberlin did I worked with them

00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:35,320
last year on this progressive web app

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:38,050
that they built out which is actually

00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:40,210
live now so if you if you fly with

00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:42,550
airberlin you can actually use their

00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:45,040
progressive web app to to check into

00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:46,690
your flight so what they do is they

00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:49,540
provide a notification when your

00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:51,420
check-in is ready you tap on that you

00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:54,460
come in you fill in your flight details

00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:58,120
you tap through you get this you check

00:37:54,460 --> 00:38:00,190
in and you get your boarding pass and it

00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:02,500
was here because your boarding pass is

00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:04,540
stored offline so this is always

00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:06,880
available it would be at that point that

00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:08,110
they prompted for add to homescreen so

00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,910
that you can immediately have your

00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:24,100
boarding pass available to you just off

00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:27,640
of a link on the screen ok there's a

00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:31,330
very heavy focus on performance and also

00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:34,060
caching because what we don't want is

00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:36,580
for people to go crazy with all the new

00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:38,830
rich JavaScript functionality and decide

00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:42,520
that that means it's acceptable for web

00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:45,880
pages to have like a 30 Meg payload when

00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:48,760
you hit the front page I was actually at

00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:51,940
a previous conference where the the

00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:54,700
speaker images were just the images that

00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:56,560
the speaker's had emailed to them and I

00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:59,050
was on roaming data at the time and I

00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:02,200
hit the page and it's like the one guy

00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:04,090
who sent like a a 20 Meg headshot that

00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:07,270
is just straight up on the site and

00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:11,980
being downloaded and at that point I had

00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:14,260
to turn my roaming data so make sure

00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:16,250
that you are concentrating on the fast

00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:19,220
first load time that

00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:24,020
I'm too interactive and caching

00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:26,900
appropriately as well so some more big

00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:28,160
numbers that you've probably seen you've

00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,690
probably seen these kind of things

00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,640
before especially when it comes to

00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:33,470
because I think everybody's fairly

00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:35,300
comfortable with the idea that a faster

00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:37,990
page tends to increase a lot of other

00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:40,100
business metrics and positive ways

00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:43,880
housing com

00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:46,370
if you you can look at these showcases

00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:48,170
here that I've linked to I would also

00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:51,260
very much suggest if you want to go into

00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:53,180
more detail on how these were done a lot

00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:55,760
of these developers came to chrome dev

00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:57,530
summit and explained in detail the

00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,450
performance optimizations that they put

00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:02,480
inside of these apps which is goes into

00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:04,760
a lot of detail about the the network

00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,250
sort of setup that they had for

00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:09,920
delivering the quest requests and also

00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:11,870
the JavaScript setup for optimizing for

00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,990
that first view and time to interactive

00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:19,250
so housing comm which is a sort of

00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:22,460
housing a real estate site in India they

00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:26,480
got a 30% faster page load time that led

00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:30,470
to a 40% lower bounce rate 10% longer

00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:33,830
average session time and amazingly 38%

00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:36,230
more conversions that's the sales bit

00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:38,990
over I feel a little bit dirty doing all

00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:41,330
those numbers at once okay then another

00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:44,780
example Flipkart were flip guys another

00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:47,900
Indian e-commerce site they quite

00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:50,120
famously went through a stage where they

00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:52,340
said we are going app only and they

00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:54,980
basically they turned off them of our

00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:56,690
website and then a bit later on they're

00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:59,660
kind of like ah that was actually kind

00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:01,850
of a mistake and so they went back and

00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:03,770
they redid their mobile web site and

00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:06,290
they really embraced all this kind of

00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:08,030
stuff so they their site is a very good

00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:09,590
kind of you can go through and look

00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:12,020
through developer tools to see a lot of

00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:14,390
examples of how to do this right one of

00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:17,420
the nice things they do is when you go

00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:19,700
offline then you get this it Gray's out

00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:22,580
you get a little toast at the bottom

00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:24,260
saying you are offline and one of the

00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:26,120
other iterations they had of this if you

00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:27,740
were browsing through product lists then

00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,430
products that you had already viewed

00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:31,079
remained in color in deck

00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:32,369
that you could actually go back and look

00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:35,069
at those even if you didn't have

00:41:32,369 --> 00:41:38,040
connectivity this is the way you deal

00:41:35,069 --> 00:41:40,609
with that so you're just using you can

00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:43,230
ask for the Navigator dock connection

00:41:40,609 --> 00:41:45,359
inside of JavaScript and that will

00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:47,130
basically return the connection status

00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:49,680
to you and you can add an event listener

00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:51,210
for the the change in the type of

00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,760
connection this will give you more

00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:55,770
information than just on or offline this

00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,329
actually starts to try and give you more

00:41:55,770 --> 00:42:00,450
granular information like are they on

00:41:57,329 --> 00:42:02,790
Wi-Fi are they on a metered connection

00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:06,740
I think bluetooth is in there as well

00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:09,540
for some odd reason and WiMAX as well

00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:11,400
anyway that's that's again that's our

00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:15,839
scope for this but there's a lot of good

00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:18,150
information in there then the remainder

00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:20,670
of the exemplary ones about going into

00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:25,650
more detail about push notifications so

00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:29,190
this is where the other thing we want to

00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:31,980
avoid is giving all this stuff to web

00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:35,430
developers and them suddenly acting like

00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:37,109
native app developers from 1999 where

00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:39,030
it's kind of like we can do push

00:42:37,109 --> 00:42:44,119
notifications we should do push

00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:47,130
notifications for everything because

00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:49,200
chrome in this case is actually a lot

00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:51,299
harsher because whenever you receive a

00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,520
push notification in chrome there is

00:42:51,299 --> 00:42:56,040
always a big button to the site settings

00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,990
where you can just immediately banhammer

00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:01,230
that site from sending you anymore

00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:03,390
notifications so in a way you are

00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:05,010
actually forced to be a bit more

00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:07,260
considerate than the native app would be

00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:08,819
in terms of sending notifications you

00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:10,890
want to ensure that they are actually

00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:12,869
valuable to your users because it's very

00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:16,410
easy for them to turn them off so we've

00:43:12,869 --> 00:43:18,089
provided a few suggestions on you know

00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:20,760
not being overly aggressive but also

00:43:18,089 --> 00:43:23,460
making sure that you make it clear what

00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:26,309
the user is opting into so whether comm

00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:27,540
does this you can if you're you're

00:43:26,309 --> 00:43:29,430
getting bored you can actually try these

00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:33,329
out on your phone while I'm talking as

00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:35,010
well so if you go here and you go into

00:43:33,329 --> 00:43:37,790
their settings you can go to manage

00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:39,720
notifications you flick on the

00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:42,630
notifications there chrome will pop up

00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:44,609
giving you the permission chip

00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:46,589
they're on and the first thing they do

00:43:44,609 --> 00:43:48,269
is they send you a notification to

00:43:46,589 --> 00:43:50,160
explain that you have enabled it so you

00:43:48,269 --> 00:43:51,960
can see there that site settings one

00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:55,920
that will allow me to just go in and

00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:57,960
just manage it for the entire site you

00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,539
can actually do a lot with web

00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:03,119
notifications now as well you can by

00:44:00,539 --> 00:44:05,700
default this is the the icon for from

00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,619
your manifest but you can also send an

00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:10,109
additional image with it

00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:13,349
you can provide additional actions from

00:44:10,109 --> 00:44:16,079
the notifications as well so for example

00:44:13,349 --> 00:44:20,309
if it was I don't know you're doing a

00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:21,839
site based on watching flight statuses

00:44:20,309 --> 00:44:24,359
or something you could include a

00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:25,559
bookmark action inside of here so that

00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:27,569
you can just acknowledge it from the

00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:32,880
notification and then come back to the

00:44:27,569 --> 00:44:35,130
same site later and a super quick super

00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:38,309
abridged version of how this works then

00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:40,799
basically inside of the page this is how

00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:42,479
you would subscribe to a notification so

00:44:40,799 --> 00:44:44,160
you're asking for this you're seeing if

00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:45,720
the serviceworker is currently ready and

00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,969
then out of the serviceworker

00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:50,400
registration you're getting the push

00:44:47,969 --> 00:44:52,380
manager you're calling subscribe that

00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,930
will give you a subscription object that

00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:56,759
you then send off to your server so that

00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:59,460
you actually know who you're sending

00:44:56,759 --> 00:45:03,539
push notifications to and then the other

00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:05,849
aspect is in the serviceworker much like

00:45:03,539 --> 00:45:08,609
we were listening for the install event

00:45:05,849 --> 00:45:11,009
on the caching example here we'll is

00:45:08,609 --> 00:45:14,130
listening for the push event so when a

00:45:11,009 --> 00:45:16,739
push message comes in then we can use

00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:19,950
the show notification option and inside

00:45:16,739 --> 00:45:22,859
of here we can specify a typo

00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:25,410
we can specify the title and anything

00:45:22,859 --> 00:45:28,469
else and again this you can pull this

00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:30,390
data from the notification as well so if

00:45:28,469 --> 00:45:32,910
it is something like hey that flight to

00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:37,349
Hawaii is now 500 pounds then you can

00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:39,269
show that in the notification some more

00:45:37,349 --> 00:45:42,410
numbers about that I think I promised I

00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:45,239
wasn't gonna do more sales stuff okay so

00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:48,509
we actually see a lot of good reception

00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:50,789
to web push notifications 24% opt-in

00:45:48,509 --> 00:45:53,190
rate they're 16% on desktop 32% on

00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:56,190
mobile and a 42 percent open rate this

00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:58,350
is obviously dependent on your use case

00:45:56,190 --> 00:46:02,340
if you send terrible notifications they

00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:05,430
are not going to get opened okay the

00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:08,910
final bits of this we're doing okay for

00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:11,010
time actually so I'm quite happy once I

00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:12,870
sort of finished with the slides to just

00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:15,150
go and look at random other stuff as

00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:17,750
well not like random YouTube videos but

00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:20,610
you know relevant to the topic and so on

00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:27,030
the the kind of end result these are two

00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:30,810
new api's that are coming out credential

00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:33,240
management API basically as the name

00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:35,670
implies allows you to manage the users

00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:40,080
credentials within the browser and the

00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:44,700
web payment the web payment request API

00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:47,160
allows you to request the saved card and

00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:50,520
address details that the user has

00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:52,830
associated with the browser in into the

00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,340
web page as well so I wanted to show you

00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:55,200
ah

00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:57,990
actually this is another bit of homework

00:46:55,200 --> 00:47:02,070
that you can do or that we can do right

00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:04,290
now do whoo

00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:06,420
I'm trying to think of a nice way to ask

00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:10,280
this question does anyone not use

00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:12,840
autocomplete in the forms on their site

00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:17,100
at least tell me that no one blocks

00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:19,350
pasting of passwords good yeah the most

00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:22,020
most developers know that that is not a

00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:24,660
way to win friends but this is like a

00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:26,340
very quick thing so I assume most of you

00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:27,990
have seen your browser prompt you to say

00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:30,150
it can save this username and password

00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:31,560
for you the credential manager is

00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:34,530
basically a way of giving you more

00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:35,940
access to those saved credentials but

00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:37,740
one of the things that's very important

00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:40,020
and very easy as well is to ensure that

00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:43,410
you're correctly hinting to your browser

00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:45,270
which fields are username fields which

00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:46,890
ones are password fields so you can do

00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:49,800
this you can do autocomplete equals

00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:54,000
username this one is even nicer

00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:55,380
autocomplete equals email I can't I lose

00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,350
count of the number of times that I've

00:47:55,380 --> 00:48:00,780
gone angry with sites because I've gone

00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:03,600
to try and log in and they asked me to

00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:06,380
type my email address into a field that

00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:09,050
one tries to auto capitalize the first

00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:11,090
letter the app sign doesn't show up on

00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:13,040
the phone keyboard without pressing to

00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:15,410
the additional screen if you do

00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:17,330
autocomplete equals email the keyboard

00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:19,310
responds intelligently you have an app

00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:21,470
sign there if you have email account

00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:23,740
saved on the phone the browser normally

00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:28,370
autosuggest s-- those as well and

00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:31,190
finally one of the other problems with

00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:33,950
saving passwords to the browser is that

00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:35,600
it often has like one version of the

00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:37,340
password saved which is what you did

00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:39,050
when you logged in the first time but

00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:40,910
then people haven't marked up their

00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:42,890
password change form correctly and

00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:44,630
therefore when I change my password I

00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:46,370
now have the wrong password saved in

00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:50,480
there so you can add this to your

00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:55,400
password safe form so we can take five

00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:57,920
minutes while you all do that or we can

00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:59,540
we can do this at the bar afterwards so

00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,540
just an example to kind of show you how

00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:05,990
this works here you can see on kayak

00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:08,000
here that I'm getting the save prompt

00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:10,250
when I've signed in to the site it's

00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,290
offering me to save that now because

00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:14,900
they're using the credential manager API

00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:16,670
I think actually I haven't put more code

00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:19,250
in for this because I figured you know

00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:21,140
you guys would be a little bit tired of

00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:24,500
code but I do have code if you want to

00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:27,680
see it so what's happening here is this

00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:30,950
is being saved into the browser and then

00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:32,360
what happens is on my phone where I'm

00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:34,370
logged in with the same Google account

00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:36,080
across these devices so the key thing

00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:38,420
here is that the browser in each

00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:39,710
locations has the same identity

00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:43,040
associated with it

00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:45,500
which means when I come to the site for

00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:47,690
the first time it automatically signs me

00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:49,640
in because the mobile site is able to

00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:51,860
see that I have credentials saved for

00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:53,330
that it retrieves them and just takes me

00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:56,450
straight through the authentication

00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:59,660
process immediately so the kind of

00:49:56,450 --> 00:50:01,820
benefit of this is the whole kind of I'm

00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:04,280
here I'm at the office I'm looking for a

00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:06,320
hotel I get part way through booking my

00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:08,570
hotel and then I realize I need to run

00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:11,060
for my train so I get my phone out and I

00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:12,380
just carry on doing that same booking

00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:14,390
when I come back to the site because

00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:16,340
I've been automatically signed in and

00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:17,060
then if you can make sure that on your

00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:19,340
side

00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:20,780
going well let's just drop you back in

00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:25,220
at the same place in your session to

00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:29,120
complete your booking another aspect of

00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:34,280
this and so I apologize this bit is a

00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:36,620
bit googly and not wholly open but who

00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:40,000
who also has or in within the

00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:41,300
organization also has an Android app

00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,180
yeah

00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:48,200
okay and and do people sign into the

00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:52,010
Android app and to the site yep so what

00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:54,170
you can do is there's a there's a format

00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:56,060
called the digital asset links file it's

00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:58,610
you know yeah another JSON file that you

00:50:56,060 --> 00:51:01,850
store on your domain inside of here you

00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:05,000
can specify the the Android apps that

00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:07,790
you want associated with your domain and

00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,640
what that means is that if you use the

00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:13,490
the smart lock library on Android so

00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:15,440
this is this is a good a this is a good

00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:17,600
opportunity if you are in a sort of

00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,460
siloed organization where maybe you

00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:21,380
don't talk to the Android developers

00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:24,500
that much this is kind of an olive

00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:27,170
branch to do like a a bipartisan project

00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:29,750
with them this means you can get

00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:31,960
automatic sign-in across web and native

00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:34,490
apps so if I'm on the web site and

00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:36,140
you've given me an app install button

00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:38,300
I've installed that when I open the app

00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:42,590
for the first time you can sign me

00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:44,030
straight into the app as well so I think

00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:46,130
this might be the last number I keep

00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:48,170
saying that and I keep lying

00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:50,660
The Guardian did this and basically saw

00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:53,420
us 44% increase in the cross-platform

00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:56,480
signed in users so this is actually I

00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:58,490
mean this does have a very measurable

00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:01,900
return on investment for bringing users

00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:11,210
back into a signed in experience

00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:12,800
okay yeah well next so so the question

00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:16,120
there is smart lock only Chrome based

00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:19,250
the so what's actually happening here is

00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:22,640
credential manager API is the w3c

00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:25,640
standard and that means that the browser

00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:27,500
so at the moment it's only chrome that

00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:29,660
supports this but I'm hoping that by

00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:30,440
telling you about it you'll be excited

00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:32,119
about how

00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:33,260
good it is and then the other browsers

00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:36,410
will realize that they should support

00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:38,510
this as well but what's happening here

00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:40,430
is credential manager API is the API for

00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:42,950
presenting those credentials within the

00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:45,410
browser then if you go to you can go to

00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:47,300
passwords google.com and that will show

00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:49,310
you all of the passwords or of the

00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:51,650
credentials that you have saved against

00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:53,990
your Google account then on the Android

00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:56,510
side it is smart lock that makes use of

00:52:53,990 --> 00:53:00,950
that same back end for credential stores

00:52:56,510 --> 00:53:03,500
to offer them across web and Android in

00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:05,450
the long term there's actually I have a

00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:07,640
whole nother talk on this Myrlie mainly

00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:10,940
because the internal code name for smart

00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:13,730
lock was you only log in once or Yolo

00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:15,710
and there's an ongoing project called

00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:17,569
open Yolo which is basically about

00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:20,750
working with password managers to kind

00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:22,700
of decouple the where you're storing

00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:26,390
your passwords versus where you're

00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:29,420
presenting them so what next

00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:33,859
then things to think about the web

00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:36,710
payments API this is super new I do have

00:53:33,859 --> 00:53:39,109
a demo of this on my phone so if anyone

00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:41,960
is interested in how to make money on

00:53:39,109 --> 00:53:44,780
the web then I can I can show you how

00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:49,060
that works afterwards there's also the

00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:51,980
web share API this again I have a very

00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:53,300
shoddy looking github pages demo that I

00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:57,349
can show you of this but what this does

00:53:53,300 --> 00:54:00,740
is this hooks into your browser again to

00:53:57,349 --> 00:54:03,170
do native sharing of URLs so that means

00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:04,880
I can be on a web page I can say share

00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:07,040
and it will trigger the apps on my phone

00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:09,680
to share that piece of content with them

00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:12,560
and of course the physical web as well

00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:15,260
if you if you have this enabled or

00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:17,270
haven't installed it yet and you're

00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:19,400
sitting close enough to whatever

00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:25,910
transmission power that can kick out you

00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:28,069
might even see a link to my site that's

00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:30,220
it that's kind of all I really had to

00:54:28,069 --> 00:54:30,220
say

00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:42,289
so it looks like we do have we've got

00:54:40,009 --> 00:54:43,819
five minutes for questions much like

00:54:42,289 --> 00:54:46,519
everyone else I would very much

00:54:43,819 --> 00:54:48,650
appreciate feedback on the talk feel

00:54:46,519 --> 00:54:51,049
free to say like one nice thing and one

00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:54,109
horrible thing so I can improve as a

00:54:51,049 --> 00:54:55,460
person or maybe I can just tell you to

00:54:54,109 --> 00:54:59,480
improve as a person if it's really

00:54:55,460 --> 00:55:01,609
horrible I'm happy to I'm happy to take

00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:05,000
questions now I'll also be hanging

00:55:01,609 --> 00:55:19,789
around at the bar and and all of

00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:22,640
tomorrow so yes yes and content the

00:55:19,789 --> 00:55:23,599
static nature of the URL and so on in

00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:26,660
the airberlin

00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:27,650
example you showed it was using MDOT

00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:30,470
Evelyn

00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:36,220
yes how do those two things fit together

00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:36,220
so something I will say once I get back

00:55:38,859 --> 00:55:47,509
yeah yeah so the the every page has a

00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:51,140
URL this is this is combined with the

00:55:47,509 --> 00:55:52,910
canonical aspect as well on the whole my

00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:56,210
personal preference would be that you

00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:58,970
always go to example.com slash content

00:55:56,210 --> 00:56:01,880
you don't go to MDOT example.com slash

00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:05,000
content you don't go to touch

00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:07,009
example.com and that the the browser

00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:10,700
responds intelligent lead to those

00:56:07,009 --> 00:56:12,529
requests however has a kind of artifact

00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:14,509
of a lot of the architectural choices

00:56:12,529 --> 00:56:17,269
that people have made in the past and

00:56:14,509 --> 00:56:18,740
like ways of serving up these like a lot

00:56:17,269 --> 00:56:20,210
of the time you know your desktop site

00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:23,450
in your mobile site just happened to be

00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:25,130
separate code bases there that's where

00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:27,769
making sure that you have the rel

00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:29,930
canonical links in place to ensure that

00:56:27,769 --> 00:56:32,240
you're still indicating that there is

00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:33,109
one canonical piece of content like

00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:36,200
example.com

00:56:33,109 --> 00:56:38,960
slash content and then MDOT example.com

00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:41,930
slash content contains a link back to

00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:43,910
that and that's what also signals to

00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:47,660
that's what signals to search engines

00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:49,610
not to index that content multiple times

00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:52,640
and return the same result

00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:55,730
and also depending on the client for

00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:58,250
example it I could conceivably if I was

00:56:55,730 --> 00:56:59,840
sharing like the mobile content I could

00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:02,240
always choose to look at the canonical

00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:04,580
content first and use that for maybe

00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:07,370
like for metadata for a preview image or

00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:09,380
something so so yes on the whole I would

00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:10,910
the other asset the the other kind of

00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:15,110
thing I wanted to stress about this is

00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:18,470
that a lot of people have done PW A's

00:57:15,110 --> 00:57:20,390
and they've sort of they've seen PW a is

00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:23,360
some kind of magical term which means

00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:25,970
they kind of go oh we need to build a PW

00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:27,710
a alongside our existing website the

00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:30,950
point that I really want to make to you

00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:35,060
as developers is that I don't view PW a

00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:37,040
as like a new shiny thing I regard it as

00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:38,900
this collection of best practices that

00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:43,040
you should just be doing for websites

00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:45,260
anyway so a lot of these I wanted to

00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:47,360
include when I was sort of showing you

00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:49,610
the sites to do this that is a mixture

00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:51,290
of people who are incrementally

00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:53,150
improving their existing site other

00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:55,820
people who have built brand new ones

00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:58,970
the airberlin one was a case where they

00:57:55,820 --> 00:58:01,760
built a prototype that they deployed to

00:57:58,970 --> 00:58:03,830
a small number of users first but the

00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:06,050
sort of the end goal is that that

00:58:03,830 --> 00:58:19,600
becomes the default experience down the

00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:21,040
road oh yeah so where do you see

00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:25,420
[Music]

00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:27,740
companies that have native app and PDA

00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:30,590
progressive web apps fitting in where

00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:35,840
does that coming considering that pwace

00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:37,880
aren't supported with iOS so with my

00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:39,830
slide that had progressive on it with

00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:41,450
all the arrows pointing to it which I

00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:48,380
won't spend a hundred years of thinking

00:58:41,450 --> 00:58:51,620
through a couple things one there is

00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:54,110
never like one answer to say like yes

00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:56,510
you must build a website and you must

00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:59,720
build this a native app it's very much a

00:58:56,510 --> 00:59:02,350
case of looking making sure that you you

00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:04,510
have the analytics enabled on your site

00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:06,520
to collect this data to understand how

00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:09,670
your users interact with your service I

00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:12,730
don't feel like each of the the

00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:15,910
platforms has their own strengths

00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:18,340
so I there's always the kind of native

00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:22,060
brings you closer to the hardware so if

00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:24,040
you're doing something that is about any

00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:26,260
kind of Bluetooth functionality there is

00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:27,940
a web Bluetooth standard coming but it

00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:29,470
is definitely not there yet so if you

00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:31,270
want to do something Bluetooth related

00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:33,280
you're building the mobile app for that

00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:36,790
if you're doing something that is like

00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:39,730
an e-commerce app where it's very much

00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:43,330
kind of like I'm presenting content back

00:59:39,730 --> 00:59:45,400
to the user then it's kind of like or or

00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:47,500
even a new site these things sort of

00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:50,710
very naturally lend themselves to a

00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:54,130
web-based approach the other thing I'd

00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:57,370
say then as well is the is very much the

00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:59,580
progressive aspect so all of these

00:59:57,370 --> 01:00:02,770
things that I've shown you a lot of the

00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:04,600
I'll see I'll see if I can dig out some

01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:06,730
of the case studies for this but the

01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:09,100
things like the performance improvements

01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:12,580
these are across the board so these are

01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:14,800
across all browsers not just browsers

01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:17,110
that say support service worker or

01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:18,460
support a certain aspect if you're sort

01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:20,650
of if you're applying these best

01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:24,100
practices you're getting the benefit for

01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:27,700
all of the users and then of course the

01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:30,190
other part of it as well is looking at

01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:32,940
your demographics right if if your

01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:36,280
audience is all iPhone users then

01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:38,620
there's clearly not much point investing

01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:40,480
in technology that is not supported like

01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:42,700
in the in the current set up on the

01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:46,240
iPhone so it's it's very much a kind of

01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:48,250
I hope that this has given you tools to

01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:50,800
do things the right way

01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:55,560
and put you in a better informed

01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:55,560
position to solve your specific problem

01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:08,869
anyone else nice Bluff thank you very

01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:08,869
