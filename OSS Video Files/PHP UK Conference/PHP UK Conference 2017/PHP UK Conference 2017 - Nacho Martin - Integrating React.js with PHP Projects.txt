Title: PHP UK Conference 2017 - Nacho Martin - Integrating React.js with PHP Projects
Publication date: 2017-04-03
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2017
Description: 
	Is React.js a library or a framework? In any case, it is a new way of working that represents a revolution in the way of building web projects. It has very particular characteristics that allow us, for instance, to render React code from the server side, or to include React components from Twig tags. During this talk we will present React.js, we will explore how to take advantage of it from PHP projects and we will give answers to practical problems such as universal (isomorphical) rendering and the generation of React.js forms from Symfony forms without duplication of efforts.

so welcome please thought about

00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,040
integrating react the years with PHP

00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,920
projects

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,920
my name is nacho Martin I work at like

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,779
minis is a agency I co-founded and in

00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,310
the last times every project needs a

00:00:16,779 --> 00:00:19,769
fridge from them for one reason or

00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,210
another when you talk to the customer

00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:24,369
maybe it's a single-page application but

00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:27,009
it will be the best choice for them or

00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:29,050
maybe it's a more relational approach

00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:31,449
what would be best questions an admin

00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,700
panel with but they always have some

00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:35,830
requirement it always happens there is

00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,900
for instance they need to take this some

00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:40,030
kind of super application in their

00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:43,170
complex application which needs a lot of

00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:45,940
JavaScript in there for instance a

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,500
calendar for bookings that you cannot do

00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,200
it in this technical static HTML

00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,370
anymore or week a query so we have been

00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,440
thinking about these how to solve this

00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:56,590
for some time and we really like

00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:00,250
reactive and react native the mobile

00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:03,160
version mmm we can be in using it for

00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:04,299
some time now so this talk would be very

00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,469
practical but they would like to address

00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:11,259
this this question this thing that I see

00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:13,299
from some friends of mine and more and

00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:14,499
more as the front-end has become more

00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:16,390
and more complex and they are always

00:01:14,499 --> 00:01:17,890
negative libraries is always Disney

00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:20,170
libraries is the greatest thing ever

00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,789
invented and then yes next next one

00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,289
appears our new library this is the best

00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:25,509
thing ever invented and you shall

00:01:23,289 --> 00:01:26,710
abandon that as one try some more

00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:31,810
friends much something of mine

00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:34,240
yes I know what I consider myself what

00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,740
developer in the past but nowadays I

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,319
consider myself a back-end developer I

00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:42,159
write PHP and I now specialize so I

00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:45,130
guess yes focus in providing a great API

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,499
like I do the most beautiful API you

00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:50,649
have ever seen and I think this is a

00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:53,740
good site which is that you are

00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:55,899
specialized so you can help your team to

00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:57,310
build really products in unison wait you

00:01:55,899 --> 00:02:00,310
are focusing something so you become

00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:03,310
great but it sometimes comes with this

00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:05,649
other sentence they say this and and you

00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:07,779
know what now that we have drinking some

00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:10,119
beer I tell you I don't care anymore

00:02:07,779 --> 00:02:12,250
about this front and think I think it's

00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:14,349
crazy and I don't care anymore about

00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:17,200
your trip or whatever they is consuming

00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:22,390
my API and this is not so positive

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:25,930
it has some and I think had some Shabbat

00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:28,120
has a website for instance in companies

00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,849
I see sometimes that no there is any API

00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,670
first as a site sometimes to device back

00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:34,840
in front in teams and put some dump on

00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,730
them in the same room for instance I

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,580
have seen teams were fronting these are

00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:41,680
now under marketing umbrella they can

00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:44,440
only talk my issues in a book tracker

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,780
and I haven't even seen a company where

00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,459
they cannot even talk by anyway they so

00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,319
they resort to open the door and

00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:52,120
shouting corridors like you're the App

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:55,569
Engine API is not working what do you

00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:58,780
mean which will and I think that I don't

00:02:55,569 --> 00:03:01,450
think that's like it's not very helpful

00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:04,030
to build great projects right and also

00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:08,680
there is a bad side I think in a bit

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:11,440
personal in the personal level because I

00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,850
think you can make you a bit darker I

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,799
know this feeling because I had this

00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,390
exact feeling in a different context

00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:19,090
this summer not in the front end context

00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:21,370
but very similarly for me which was this

00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,049
context I was watching the TV on summer

00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,640
and there were some kids doing this

00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:27,459
somersaulting the scrolling think an

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,680
eidetic memory I used to do this when I

00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:31,720
was a kid it was like something I could

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,590
just do it could like do here for

00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:38,140
instance then but how long have I been

00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,880
without doing this thing maybe well I

00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:42,609
said ok I have nothing to do I was in

00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:45,040
summer and I think I can just write and

00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:47,230
then I put myself in position and I

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,459
become very clear that they couldn't do

00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:52,660
it anymore it was absolutely impossible

00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:54,700
for me said ok I'm not doing this then

00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,760
but then they came this piece thought

00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,530
this bad thought I thought what if I met

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,890
the 10 year old version of myself what

00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:04,810
would he think of me as a kid what to

00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,380
say ok let's see in the future what I am

00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,079
as an adult

00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:11,560
well I'm these guys cannot even do

00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:13,150
somersaults but when I things can be

00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,370
applied also to web development ok I

00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:18,310
said if I think of the version of myself

00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:20,820
who was so excited all web development

00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:23,800
and so excited about the Internet and

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,720
when the exact moment when he put when I

00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,760
put in my resume I know I will develop

00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,530
and I can do this then if I freeze this

00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,220
moment if I talk to this guy maybe he

00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,110
asks me

00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,640
what are you doing now which kind now

00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,770
your experience which kind of cool

00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,300
things are you are you building what do

00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,100
you mean you are not doing this like

00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,740
what do you mean you only do you can

00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,480
only do one part which part is not what

00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,310
do you mean level free api restful

00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,060
because if he's not level free is no

00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:48,880
rest at all

00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,800
well maybe well maybe what for you you

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,170
know what is with but man it's not what

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,470
I had in mind so this is not like the

00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:58,600
greatest feeling to us but I think the

00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:01,450
good news is that if you are did open to

00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:04,690
the fronton it's very easy to fix this

00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:07,930
and I think that react is brilliant

00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:09,460
library to do - is - because react is

00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:12,070
not a framework in the sense that is not

00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:14,920
a set of tiny tools you have to memorize

00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:16,300
and you have to memorize a lot of course

00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,260
I don't like this kind of knowledge what

00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,090
you have to memorize all those things

00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,850
how they combined together is more about

00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:26,080
a few core concepts that are elegant and

00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:28,270
they are very powerful and learning 3x

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,060
means that you become natural with this

00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:33,430
with this with this with this concepts

00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,169
which are by the way concepts that at

00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:37,090
least made me a better programmer they

00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:38,980
are about functional programming without

00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:42,220
declarative programming they are about

00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,840
managing the state so let's see which is

00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:46,750
the fundamental concepts concept of

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,150
reactor yes so another concept concept

00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:52,000
let's think how to build this to-do list

00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:54,340
okay a to-do list typical application

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,160
and you have this which I did to add

00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:59,350
items ok or we change the order of of

00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,240
items so you can you do the first

00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,980
version it's not an omelet because you

00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,620
need to do this otherwise these fried

00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:07,600
eggs so discover this then how to build

00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,580
this throughout the are two options one

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,760
is to think yes about the state and

00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:14,470
think okay see whenever I have a new

00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,960
version of the state I just rerender

00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:19,750
everything I clean the component and

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,650
rerender everything ok this is simple

00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:25,780
and is the kind of work I like to do is

00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:27,850
so a logic it's about you can unit test

00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:31,210
it it's very nice to do but it's not

00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:33,250
efficient if you do have a 1000 items or

00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:35,500
a million items and you use want to

00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,630
reorder two of them and you repaint all

00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,550
of them every time that's not a good

00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:42,490
user experience so we don't use this

00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:44,080
approach instead we do this order more

00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,610
annoying approach

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,740
which is finding the document model

00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:49,750
which things to change which things to

00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,690
move is typical jQuery world for

00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:54,789
instance we select yours this is complex

00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:56,409
is not the kind of problem I like to

00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:59,050
work but you have to do it because it's

00:06:56,409 --> 00:07:01,150
efficient is at the end you lose your

00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:04,090
users count more than you are enjoying

00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:07,360
what you're doing but what if you had

00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:09,699
something like react saves you okay you

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,319
focus on the first one you do the first

00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:13,060
one you focus on the state which is you

00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:15,669
the part of the job that you you know

00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:17,770
your business and I do the second one so

00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:19,810
I will in fact the Facebook is

00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:22,090
Facebook's engineers will do the second

00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:24,639
one in a very efficient way so and in

00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:26,319
other words give me an estate like care

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,840
on the state and a render method and I

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,979
will call it and do it efficiently so

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,159
you can pretend that you are just

00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:34,659
working with the state if you want more

00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:37,930
control you can of course there are some

00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:39,849
hooks to have control over this then

00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:43,000
with this in mind let's write our first

00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:44,530
component right we have this very simple

00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,840
component which is just a counter we

00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:49,630
click counter and it increases the value

00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:53,259
add plus a new version of the state

00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:55,719
which is plus 1 this is comparing that

00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:58,360
is simple enough to get one is life so

00:07:55,719 --> 00:08:00,159
this is the full code of this component

00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,949
there are some things to notice here we

00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:04,659
will see this component in the Dame

00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:06,819
first I'm using in my slides this new

00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:08,889
JavaScript syntax you will see import

00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:10,930
class things like that this is a new

00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:12,370
version this is much nicer and I think

00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,870
it's more closer for instance to

00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:16,539
object-oriented

00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:19,590
class I think it's nicer just nicer so I

00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:21,849
use it if it's even easier to understand

00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:23,500
but we will see later how to translate

00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:26,110
this to your script so you normally are

00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,699
skip that this is also your skid but

00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:29,639
you'll see that browsers understand

00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:33,099
particularly Internet Explorer of course

00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:35,320
but about react itself we have things

00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:37,570
like initial state here how to set

00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,430
initial state how to change the state or

00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:41,699
not change but produce a new version of

00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:45,910
the state the right way to think and

00:08:41,699 --> 00:08:49,540
render functions in detail initial state

00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:51,730
we produce a new object is we have to

00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:53,350
create an object this state is always a

00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:55,329
large key object yes a simple of that

00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:57,530
and then we can assign the state by

00:08:55,329 --> 00:09:01,850
calling stead state with a new version I

00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:03,350
so it is important this thing of

00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:05,300
producing new estates because we are

00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,430
never modifying the state directly so we

00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,710
are providing a new like a new frame if

00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:11,000
you think of an animation just avoid

00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:13,100
doing these things this is a beginner

00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,240
mistake you just think okay I change the

00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,640
stage and it's not working because

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,490
reacts needs to know when I mean you

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,920
have changed your state and render or do

00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:23,540
whatever it needs to do then about the

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,280
render function which is something that

00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:30,290
again is very controversial just for one

00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:31,820
day or two if you see this like HTML

00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:35,090
inside of JavaScript that looks very

00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:37,700
ugly the beginning is not hTML is jo6

00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:39,860
react will transform it internally into

00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:44,270
JavaScript it will transform it then

00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:46,490
into HTML elements and we will see later

00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:49,070
how to yeah really divide the

00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,840
presentation and the code so but still

00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:53,600
is something like goes against any good

00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:56,390
practice I've ever had like you have to

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,210
prepare but then after two days you are

00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:00,790
but what am i call disclaim so I mean

00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:03,830
this not so bad

00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:05,600
then good practice to make render as

00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,830
clean as possible only a return is

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,140
possible at the beginning

00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:11,090
sorry there are some things that change

00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:12,590
that you have to this is part of

00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:14,240
memorizing but this like class it's not

00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:16,640
class because it's colliding with the

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,640
class in JavaScript and so it's class

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,920
name and very few things like that but

00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,270
and then you can also insert JavaScript

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,500
expressions between these pointy

00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:30,320
brackets right then route making render

00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,450
experience possible it's just only do

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,680
these kind of things at the beginning

00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,850
you don't know where to put your code

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,620
and you know that there is a render

00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,900
method so you try to put your code I try

00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:41,350
to put one Michaels in there or whatever

00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:43,760
I could think of well the first days

00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:47,240
here gee we don't modify the state might

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:50,540
never we see here we don't make a text

00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:53,060
calls here we don't do any other stupid

00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:54,110
or crazy thing we need to do okay we

00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,930
don't do we don't change the state of

00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:58,550
the world here it's not something that

00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,810
will work you have to find somewhere

00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:03,350
else you have to write your own message

00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:05,630
and call them okay with this which is

00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:08,810
that we do so we can start building our

00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:11,500
or application but we are just writing a

00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:13,840
component it will become very large

00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:16,930
like very confusing at the enemy super

00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,310
component is not very clean so one

00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:20,290
important concept in react is to think

00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:22,630
about here keynote part in children

00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,430
relationships with that so who is how we

00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,900
have small components that combine

00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:28,140
together so you have something like this

00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:30,220
you make from the user interface

00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:32,590
typically to finish interpret you

00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,730
extract which component you need we go

00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:36,610
something like this winter this

00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:39,070
separation how do we work with props

00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:41,470
maybe or project manager besides that

00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:44,530
now we need not one counter but two

00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:46,030
counters and they have now absolute

00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:47,920
greeting in Spanish I don't know we

00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:50,200
don't know why say click me amigo click

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,380
knees and your is for we more politely

00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:56,920
polite why but you have to do it so we

00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:59,530
can just use our component we wrote yes

00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:03,160
as if it was just a normal tax it's not

00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:07,300
80 mil a HTML tag if we translate it to

00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:09,730
JavaScript so to our code then and then

00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:12,340
in our counter so now we can receive

00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:14,380
this name this property as what is

00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:16,720
called props state that is given by your

00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:19,330
father or your parent so and you don't

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,100
have a function to set props you can not

00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:23,320
change the props from your from children

00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,150
so this is something that it's immutable

00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,290
for you so you have to provide for

00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:29,380
instance a callback from your parent

00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:31,450
then it is possible but it's one-way

00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:34,030
bending this is important and we this we

00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:36,580
have seen a lot of react like really a

00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:38,950
lot yes it's a matter of writing and not

00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:41,350
committing small mistakes that you make

00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:43,090
at the beginning in fact we have seen so

00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:45,250
much as we can start to provide good

00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:47,590
packages like if your component only

00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:49,240
depends on props you can have this short

00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:52,180
syntax that is only about templating

00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,320
rightly so if if it's just you find

00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:55,120
yourself just writing a render that

00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,520
depending on props you got this you can

00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:01,300
have this shorter syntax is cleaner it's

00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:04,120
like a lambda function in es6 then this

00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:06,960
allows us to do these good practice if

00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:09,820
you have a complex component with logic

00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:13,120
logic like a check scores and so on you

00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:15,880
can split it in two and one component

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,860
has all the logic and then in the render

00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,200
yes friend that's the presentational

00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:24,220
component only depends on the state test

00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:25,180
by its parent then this always you see

00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,850
about the state

00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:30,850
go to render it looks like simple that

00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:33,010
is create powerful and then everything

00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:34,630
depending on the state so we can do

00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:36,910
things like reproduce estates it with

00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:40,000
Thursday we can reproduce the stage of a

00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:41,260
component or even a tree we can rewind

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,440
or time travel this is particularly

00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:46,030
powerful in in relax okay undo for

00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,530
instance is something that is not so

00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:49,900
difficult to do if you are just changing

00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:52,060
your state you can log state changes or

00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:55,660
you can for instance have a storybook so

00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:57,940
you have someone who is yes with noted

00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:00,340
to like change styles of choose a style

00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:01,930
you can have a storybook is a library

00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,280
called react storybook it is great and

00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,020
you put all your presentational

00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,880
components there with different

00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:09,730
combinations of states so Bhutan

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:12,790
disabled like this will do an active

00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:15,820
like this and then they can just change

00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:18,700
instance CSS and see how it changed but

00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:20,290
has more powerful consequences one of

00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,390
the most powerful consequences is this

00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:25,330
what they call learn once right

00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:27,400
everywhere which means that what if

00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:30,670
instead of this what if instead of this

00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,260
like HTML like component that we had you

00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,910
know it's on there what if we have

00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,760
something like this now this doesn't

00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:38,380
look like HTML anymore this has

00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:41,140
something that is suspicious here is

00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:44,380
this switch I use thing this is in fact

00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:46,510
a render view render method of a mobile

00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:51,280
application what is called react native

00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:53,680
then reacts can take two tags to HTML

00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:56,800
tags or es6 tags and translate it to

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,630
JavaScript and then to native components

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,810
so they are more performant damages web

00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:03,580
be that's how react native works and

00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:05,890
it's because yes the web is just one of

00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:08,020
the targets this one side of realities

00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:11,560
react on there is another react native

00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:13,870
and there are more some of them by the

00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:16,000
community not my FAC Facebook itself one

00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:17,680
that I find very cool this is react

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,570
blessed or terminal you will se termina

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,090
what has to do terminal with react well

00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:24,460
Wes is a an awesome library to build

00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:26,980
things like this like you know you see

00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:28,570
it but it's like they has a map has

00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:30,340
charge so if you have for instance in

00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:32,050
DevOps and you don't want to do anything

00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:33,430
with front-end maybe you can still use

00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:36,690
react for things like that I think it's

00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:36,690
super cool and

00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:41,730
but then how do work we know a bit

00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:45,240
reacts it's a bit about practicing this

00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:47,010
how can we just use it like how can we

00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,870
yes for instance translates JavaScript

00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:51,089
the JavaScript modern JavaScript into

00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:53,490
the ASCII that browsers understand well

00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:56,339
recommend is it up is to use webpack

00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:58,110
this is a model model Gundel so you have

00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:01,440
your source files and you have some

00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:05,310
configuration to build your assets that

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:08,220
you serve to the eruption and then web

00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:11,970
pack has many good things and math is

00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:13,410
dependencies for us which is great allow

00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:15,149
certain environment of a production

00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:16,950
environment which is optimized and of

00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:19,200
development which just has the bugging

00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:20,010
options you can do automatic page reload

00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,560
when things change

00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:24,630
or even you don't reload the page but

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,750
you change the code and the state is the

00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:29,100
same so you do the reloading you change

00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,880
the code in there this is particularly

00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:34,260
powerful in triage is about the state

00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,029
you can use proper processor so

00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:40,670
transpilers I don't like much this work

00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:44,040
like because how it sounds like Bayville

00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:45,510
Bayville is like well it's for taking a

00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,500
modern version of javascript you can

00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:48,060
even choose the features even

00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:51,209
experimental features and translate it

00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:54,630
play them to keep that particularly

00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:57,779
internet where you can understand it has

00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:59,490
one drawback it's of course a complex

00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:02,279
write up a complex tool so you need some

00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:05,309
time and we cannot present webpack in

00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:07,740
detail in this talk however I maintain a

00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:08,910
sandbox if you want to look at it I with

00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:11,220
an iteration with Symphony I

00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:13,290
particularly use Symphony with some

00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:15,839
things for development is like that want

00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:16,439
to check it out I will upload twice

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,939
later

00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:24,270
don't worry then but with this I mean

00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:25,410
assume we have web pack in place how can

00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:28,290
we insert react

00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:30,870
into HTML so it's very simple you just

00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:32,910
provide attack I can deselect it and

00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:37,340
then you say to react on the web part of

00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:40,080
react to insert the component in there

00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:42,150
then and this is what a front-end I will

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,900
do we are not talking about PHP yet

00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:48,450
right but we can do some things in PHP

00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:50,130
ok I we wrote a library called react

00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,820
renderer we were looking at some things

00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,309
we wanted to do

00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:55,860
PHP incorrect and we ended up writing

00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:58,200
this library but we were in fact copying

00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,820
another library because we saw what

00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,259
other community is doing and there was

00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,799
this brilliant library called reactive

00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:04,200
rails

00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:06,690
search for Ruby on Rails that's made

00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:09,750
this guy from Hawaii as you can probably

00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:13,710
guess I guess which is really happy

00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:15,509
right and it is libraries rate so it

00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:18,029
discusses two parts one is the Ruby part

00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:20,940
and one JavaScript bug that happens that

00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:23,970
we can use in PHP so we can start using

00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,529
it so you see here react on Rails but

00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:28,620
it's the JavaScript part is nothing to

00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:31,889
do with Ruby so we can just register a

00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:35,129
component here and we wrote a twig tag

00:18:31,889 --> 00:18:37,379
or you can say here insert my component

00:18:35,129 --> 00:18:42,120
with this initial props right and this

00:18:37,379 --> 00:18:44,340
will produce this this element that then

00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,679
react on Rails knows how to where to put

00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:49,830
your component so this is only something

00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:51,269
a bit like nice to see but it's powerful

00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,649
in the sense that now we are entering

00:18:51,269 --> 00:18:54,269
from a twig back so we can render

00:18:52,649 --> 00:18:56,610
whatever we want here we can render this

00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:58,889
or we can render all the stuff and that

00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:00,809
opens at the door to do server-side

00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:04,399
rendering server side rendering or there

00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:06,840
otherwise and also called universal

00:19:04,399 --> 00:19:09,570
applications are also called isomorphic

00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:12,149
tile applications which happens to have

00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:14,460
a very particular meaning in maths it

00:19:12,149 --> 00:19:16,019
has nothing to do with the meaning we

00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:18,299
are using here I don't know who came up

00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:19,529
with this awesome Africa what I like the

00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:21,240
war because I like how it sounds because

00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:23,070
I go home and I tell me how about you

00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,480
what have you been doing today I say

00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:27,179
it's more freaked out things and makes

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,370
me feel good and you only live once but

00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:30,659
just keep in mind that yeah you cannot

00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:34,710
keep this computation further with

00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:36,120
people even oh yeah so we had this

00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,710
fundamental premise and this is another

00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,600
consequence it doesn't say anything

00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:41,129
about browsers it doesn't say anything

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,919
about I need a running versus so you can

00:19:41,129 --> 00:19:46,379
say what if you give me representation

00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,179
of a string a US state you can give me a

00:19:46,379 --> 00:19:51,779
string yes of course so we can do this

00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:54,179
it is good for for instance search

00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:56,070
engine optimization happens at the

00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:57,870
google crowler some of the google

00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:00,330
travels have javascript on others not

00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:03,330
and you never know also the facebook

00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:04,390
Prowler for ShoreTel packs can be useful

00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:06,040
for this

00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:08,260
and just to be shooting search engine

00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:10,330
faster perceived page loads you present

00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:13,960
with an initial state so visual elements

00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:15,850
are in there so instead of a spinner

00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,970
solo there you'll present with a initial

00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:21,130
version to the user and also we can

00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:24,340
catch this response which is quite cool

00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:26,590
then how it works in this trick tag

00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:28,180
which is you can say rendering boss

00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:32,020
which is by the way the default option

00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:34,720
and then it will produce this all the

00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:36,460
code like it will be everything in the

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,070
first state yes rendered for us and then

00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:41,020
when we act on race or react find or

00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:43,240
comprehend wants to inject it we want to

00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:44,920
render it I will say okay I see that

00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,240
it's already render so I just a control

00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:49,240
over the component make it more dynamic

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,520
and make it like you react application

00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,990
typically attack application then how

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,240
this works in the server side I mean

00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:58,480
which options we have to do really like

00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:01,950
low-level thing so first option is to

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:04,570
call another yesu processor okay this is

00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:06,190
yes like it would be the equivalent of

00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,170
opening a terminal we use for this

00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:11,080
simple process complaint isolate Li

00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:14,470
without the framework in this library HP

00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:17,890
a second yes I wrote notation of one

00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:20,710
Ruby library is found so it just looks

00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:22,480
if you have no GS you just like open

00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:24,820
some days and says okay here is my code

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,350
and he I want to render this comprehend

00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:29,740
give me the thing this is slow because

00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:31,480
you have to in how PHP works after every

00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,890
response there are between frequencies

00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,900
on shared state so you have to say

00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:37,900
bye-bye in all these days I will call

00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:39,700
you with 90% of the same call next time

00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:42,010
but yes now I want these other

00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:46,240
components all these other props so this

00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:48,310
is a pity but what then if you have b8zs

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,510
PHP extension installed that allows you

00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:55,960
to write to execute JavaScript code from

00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:57,730
PHP it this library will use it so this

00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,460
is you have to compile it once ok but if

00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:02,500
you see to do this easy to use it has

00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:04,720
the same problem you have to you see

00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:07,120
this piece v8 extension and you see okay

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,780
I have to save you goodbye after is like

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,850
fight up it is using PHP p.m. I think

00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:15,130
it's potentially problem can be solved

00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:16,660
but I've not tried yet I think someone

00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:17,409
wants to try this something that can

00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,609
work

00:22:17,409 --> 00:22:22,219
because there is a third option that is

00:22:19,609 --> 00:22:24,619
fast so is using an external server that

00:22:22,219 --> 00:22:27,889
is always running let's say know

00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:31,489
anything about our code can be or kokum

00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:35,479
PLL banking about health stuff note

00:22:31,489 --> 00:22:36,859
several is the same so it's a bit I know

00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:39,739
in because you have to keep it running

00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:40,219
as another service you have to have to

00:22:39,739 --> 00:22:43,309
be alive

00:22:40,219 --> 00:22:48,409
not super annoying either I need faster

00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:50,570
it is just another thing then options 1

00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:52,849
& 2 in PHP you have to provide these

00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:57,379
render any one piece be xx is renderer

00:22:52,849 --> 00:22:59,349
or external server render it uses say I

00:22:57,379 --> 00:23:02,599
will communicate with another server

00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:07,039
with a unique Sox so unique socket so

00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:08,450
was like this I think that then when

00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,789
possible setup is to have been

00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:13,009
development option 1 or 2 and in

00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:15,379
production use sternal server and if you

00:23:13,009 --> 00:23:17,419
can cash in production but it's always

00:23:15,379 --> 00:23:20,809
better it's something we can cash so

00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:23,839
then now we can now we can do this in

00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:26,570
PHP or even in Ruby or whatever because

00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:28,339
people say if you want to do this kind

00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:30,259
of thing you have to rewrite your code

00:23:28,339 --> 00:23:31,999
in node which freaks me out like I have

00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:34,700
been working for years in my code I have

00:23:31,999 --> 00:23:36,469
my Molitor I like like me they are good

00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,999
artists it I have to rewrite because I

00:23:36,469 --> 00:23:40,219
want to do this yeah yeah Scotia goes

00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:41,839
this is our script well it's not like

00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:43,820
this but doesn't mean either that you

00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:45,799
have to do it every time it's so he that

00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:48,409
introduces some complexity way to have

00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:50,119
our no said we're running you have to do

00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:52,190
some other patience to your code so it's

00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:54,349
not making an AJAX call in the magic

00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:57,950
scroll in the first time things like

00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:59,450
that but something you need it you can

00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:01,399
do it Facebook for instance doesn't do

00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:03,259
it for insta Instagram if Iran doesn't

00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:08,149
do this even if they are experts but

00:24:03,259 --> 00:24:09,859
they are doing in other cases so so and

00:24:08,149 --> 00:24:12,309
then now let's talk about the result

00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:14,839
library has also some support for relax

00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:16,429
we can also in to give a brief

00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:18,649
introduction to relax relax is something

00:24:16,429 --> 00:24:20,989
that is the command even by the author

00:24:18,649 --> 00:24:23,869
of redux which is I think lives in

00:24:20,989 --> 00:24:25,969
London Ollie's it's from London Dan

00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:26,359
Abramoff he says the first time you use

00:24:25,969 --> 00:24:27,739
react

00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:30,049
don't use weather if you don't use

00:24:27,739 --> 00:24:30,530
products if you have to be aware which

00:24:30,049 --> 00:24:33,890
problem

00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:35,240
of problem that's relax solve so when

00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:37,490
you find this problem you know you can

00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:40,310
really reflect on your code and make it

00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:42,020
cleaner by using relax so which kind of

00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:44,300
column is it if you are writing an

00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:45,830
application and it's a bit more complex

00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,870
you will find that you have different

00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:51,500
places where you use the same mistake

00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:54,730
right so let's see we have this here key

00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:58,310
okay then where should this is stay live

00:24:54,730 --> 00:25:01,970
so as children cannot pass their state

00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:03,680
to the parents or siblings is to live in

00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:05,780
the first common parent which is this

00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,610
one because nothing to do with the name

00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:09,770
and also we have this intermediate

00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:11,390
components that are just receiving name

00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:12,740
I'm passing it to the children like I

00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:15,320
received it from my parent

00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:16,310
I passed my children I don't know if

00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,140
they are still there

00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:20,210
so you see the code and you see name

00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:22,190
going around but the company has nothing

00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:23,300
to do with name and maybe you have 50

00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:25,070
things like this and you are like I

00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,330
don't understand my code anymore and

00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:28,400
when do you understand your code anymore

00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:31,550
you know something bad will happen very

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,480
soon so this is the kind of Roland relax

00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:35,570
all right

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:38,930
relax it's actually important part is

00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:40,790
you have an idea of sitri flow okay I

00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:43,190
think this is the main point of relax

00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:44,900
because when you are using relax when

00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:47,150
you are there at the beginning it's not

00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,920
so difficult but the code is split it in

00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:50,240
several files so you have to like so

00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,670
this is going onto this file or maybe

00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,590
this other one so I don't know until you

00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:57,890
have the whole picture and if you want

00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:59,000
you have this circle it's better so in

00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,410
your component you can get this patch

00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,050
now actions instead of changing the

00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:04,520
state and actually like a description or

00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:06,650
something at heart or happen kind of an

00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,330
event it's just a JavaScript object in

00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:12,890
the description of what we want to do

00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:14,600
and then or maybe a click and then there

00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:17,810
is something called reducer that has

00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:19,160
like it's like a huge or well can be

00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:21,290
huge or you can split into several

00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:24,200
reducers tends to be a big switch

00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:26,840
construction where you say okay if I get

00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,520
I simply start this action I know how to

00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,500
produce a new version of the state so I

00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,300
can produce like frames in Makena and I

00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:35,420
measure a trails frames I know how to

00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:37,040
produce new versions of the state the

00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:39,710
state is lives in a store and the store

00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:41,930
is connected to the components so now

00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:43,760
the components can receive I kind of

00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:45,440
connected like they receive as props the

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,740
range so they can

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,240
so is also explained with a picture I

00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,820
don't think they will work in PDF

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,799
version but is there is because it would

00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:59,350
be like a ball moving around like

00:26:54,799 --> 00:27:01,909
following there they are also you you do

00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:03,549
dispatch an action create an action goes

00:27:01,909 --> 00:27:05,929
to the dispatcher and in the reducer

00:27:03,549 --> 00:27:08,299
using the current state and the action

00:27:05,929 --> 00:27:10,880
produces a new version of the state's

00:27:08,299 --> 00:27:13,519
app if connected to the component which

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:18,620
will be updated so same sequel flow

00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:20,629
right yeah okay so we can use this in

00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:23,720
react renderer because Ruby on Rails has

00:27:20,629 --> 00:27:26,210
support forest for it as well so we have

00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,889
adapted it and then you can just

00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:30,139
register store and you can connect your

00:27:27,889 --> 00:27:32,090
components to this source so you can

00:27:30,139 --> 00:27:33,860
have just one complaint using this store

00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:35,990
or you can have several companies using

00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,399
this store which can share state now so

00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:39,320
you can if you are not doing for

00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:40,519
interesting of this application no J's

00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,220
people like to do single page

00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:45,230
applications so mad but I don't do like

00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,490
them so much so you can have written

00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,899
things like this you have static

00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:50,419
components and react components and they

00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:52,820
can just change the state and the state

00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:56,090
well everyone knows because they share a

00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:58,340
store ok and this is why like will be

00:27:56,090 --> 00:28:00,830
like a general Singapore general

00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:03,769
application but there is one special

00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:05,389
moment where we can do even better I

00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:07,809
mean we can really there's a point of

00:28:05,389 --> 00:28:10,039
really a lot of friction which is forms

00:28:07,809 --> 00:28:12,110
friction between front and back in

00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:14,750
themes and technologies because there is

00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:16,970
a lot of other things going on here when

00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:19,220
do we need forms in react which are the

00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:20,690
cases inside of react component you have

00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,629
favorite application you have performing

00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:26,210
there will be a react form important

00:28:23,629 --> 00:28:28,610
forms for instance wither when it's a

00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:30,889
purchase form you are saying or renting

00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:33,110
a house and you say this house is not

00:28:30,889 --> 00:28:35,389
available on these days that you are

00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:37,039
filling your form I see that but I can

00:28:35,389 --> 00:28:39,230
just give you a recommendation of this

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:41,690
other house which means the conversions

00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:45,100
means more money and probably means

00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:47,629
happiness and also very specific forms

00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:50,000
which are very dynamic a low-rise in a

00:28:47,629 --> 00:28:52,330
calendar they speaker like I have this

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,220
customer has this idea ok I can do it

00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:57,690
also forms that are not boring even they

00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:58,830
are not ready to money

00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:01,440
you can for instance this is this

00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:03,210
company type formed will this service or

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,950
they can I think the forms can be used

00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,600
for other things and surveys but this is

00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:10,260
a good example

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:12,660
mmm I guess users are more likely to

00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:14,220
feel this survey is like this and it's

00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:17,160
like check boxes already boodles it is

00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,990
what I will personally do like you you

00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,480
should get your user you have these

00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:23,850
check boxes yes kill them I stop feeling

00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,280
I like to have but suddenly it's not

00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:28,170
happening is better produces then

00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:30,330
typically if please be frameworks have a

00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:31,740
form component that you making it's only

00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:34,980
doing forms but the fact is doing a lot

00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:36,780
of things so in Symphony is called form

00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:38,370
Mary yeah I think you know that

00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:41,730
promotion must be called the same thing

00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:43,230
very confusing otherwise you can

00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:46,140
populate the form with initial values

00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:48,240
you can give hints for which which says

00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:50,520
do you want to use we can binding commit

00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,380
data they serialize it into even

00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:55,130
existing objects which is very cool if

00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:57,990
you try to yourself I can one day

00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:59,370
knowing you can validate which is also

00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:02,190
very annoying to do one more Valley

00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:04,890
maybe with another component but it's

00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:08,160
like integrated and have a way to return

00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:09,570
errors integrated in the form and then

00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:12,030
you they have typically this other side

00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:14,460
create view or helpers in other

00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:17,340
frameworks but like if simply you create

00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:21,150
a form B which is like a presentational

00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:24,270
representation of the form and this does

00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:25,170
render E which is awesome if you give it

00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:27,660
programmed in like it's something

00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:29,370
awesome to have show errors after submit

00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:32,370
in there which is also painful to do and

00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:34,500
some client-side validation right not so

00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:39,780
much but maybe choosing the right type

00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:41,610
for HTML but in API I at least I like to

00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:44,730
use forms still any API is to receive

00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:47,190
requests from post put today create or

00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:51,150
pad things like that to update value so

00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:52,770
creating new new models and you miss

00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:54,180
many of these things that you get for

00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:56,970
granted before and you were so happy you

00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:59,280
didn't know like you can not have any

00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:01,950
values anymore like you can sterilize

00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:03,000
your model maybe but sometimes many

00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:05,400
cases it is not the same representation

00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,460
maybe you have a date in the formative

00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:11,470
selector month year day

00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:13,149
and I use that as your model is a string

00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:15,640
so you have to work a bit more on these

00:31:13,149 --> 00:31:17,649
some overhead you can go give you user

00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:20,049
interface keys you cannot return errors

00:31:17,649 --> 00:31:22,299
easily you have to serialize you forming

00:31:20,049 --> 00:31:24,039
some data you understand and of course

00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:28,179
you miss everything we don't have

00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:30,580
anything in the right side so and also

00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:32,980
if we want to do this kind of work into

00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:35,500
our script we typically want to do even

00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:38,649
more stuff we want also bin validation

00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:39,909
if they are obviously errors in there

00:31:38,649 --> 00:31:42,039
like that price is negative

00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:43,149
I don't want do to even ask the server

00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:45,549
if you did price is negative that's

00:31:43,149 --> 00:31:47,500
wrong so you can just send a net show an

00:31:45,549 --> 00:31:49,870
arrow to the user or on Brewers

00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,289
invalidation password is not strong

00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:53,549
enough

00:31:50,289 --> 00:31:56,169
yes keep working on this form or um

00:31:53,549 --> 00:31:58,419
asking validation yes check with this

00:31:56,169 --> 00:31:59,919
the server your username is really to

00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:02,440
send I have this option for you or

00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:04,450
whatever dynamic I've seen you in a

00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,340
mixing you want so but they still use

00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:10,690
forms for these because this is super

00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:12,990
good to have right then suppose this

00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:15,520
team 20 form this simple form in example

00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:18,279
is typically not another framework it's

00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:21,159
a choice yes with some countries you

00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:22,690
consist in this case and the value you

00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:24,789
show to the user United Kingdom and they

00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:28,960
value want to receive in the for in the

00:32:24,789 --> 00:32:31,059
post VB Deutschland spaniel españa is

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,090
and then a collection of oddities it is

00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:36,580
simple typical but if I have to do this

00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:39,640
you know in an API context I start to

00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:43,390
say okay have to do this why because in

00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:45,340
if you are just using static HTML you

00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:46,860
have this great view and creates perfect

00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:49,059
representation of the phone like

00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:50,980
everything is done so you just gave you

00:32:49,059 --> 00:32:54,399
is there with the right choices with

00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:56,740
everything and then if you submit you

00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:58,899
receive the exact data you want not

00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:00,250
whatever someone interpreted from the

00:32:58,899 --> 00:33:01,720
documentation or whatever was written in

00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:05,679
the recommendation who knows who wrote

00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:07,960
who wrote these recommendations I'm so

00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:10,419
and then you zoom it you bind the

00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:12,940
request and then everything works but in

00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:15,429
the API you don't have a view so you

00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:18,309
have to yeah it guess okay or based on

00:33:15,429 --> 00:33:20,950
the documentation so shopping corridor

00:33:18,309 --> 00:33:23,850
maybe we see where those line is out

00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:25,510
there what's going on so

00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:27,250
presentation what did you mean

00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:30,430
recommendation isn't know even it

00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:31,930
existed and then if even if I'm writing

00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:34,540
this myself the boss part there was

00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:38,530
people HP when I presume it I know that

00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:40,960
it will fail like I I never I never gave

00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:42,490
you no complex form I never guess the

00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,980
right presentation the first try and now

00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:45,640
you start pursuing errors like this no

00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,980
texture feels

00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:49,960
what do you mean value selected is not a

00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:52,030
valid choice okay I'm not sure I have to

00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:54,340
check things like one of more given

00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:58,030
values is invalid you know long form

00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:59,950
like well yeah it's like what's going on

00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:02,080
and then this was animation throw in the

00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:04,060
computer which is the feeling I have and

00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,230
someone is like why is taking you so

00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,880
long it's just a form and you are like

00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:09,490
leave me alone leave me alone I have to

00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:12,280
fix this I know I will fix it what's the

00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:14,470
problem we have so now we have to keep

00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:16,090
in sync three separate things forming a

00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:18,130
server happy documentation API

00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:20,650
documentation and form in the client and

00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:22,960
this introduced some overhead way if you

00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:25,060
have on flew only three four forms

00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,919
that's okay you can leave with these you

00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:28,600
can argue a bit with the front end guy

00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:31,330
for some time and then you can reprint

00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:33,870
but what happens if your application has

00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:35,890
to do a lot with forms like we have

00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:39,580
discussed customer there are some

00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:41,890
additions and they wanted to build like

00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:44,140
an expert system so you they gather

00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:46,419
interview other information from the

00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:48,490
patients in an interview what I mean

00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:52,630
about about them a lot of information

00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:55,510
and we build diets based on what they

00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:58,600
call the ER physically or what they

00:34:55,510 --> 00:35:00,340
prefer so so we were very excited about

00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,680
this so we want this to do this systems

00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:04,060
practitioner leasing is so cool how can

00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:07,180
we do this we were discussing all this

00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:08,320
and some day I asked the guy what do you

00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,340
have in mind about the interview what do

00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,430
you have in mind just tell me what you

00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:14,410
have in mind and he was like well

00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:16,960
actually yeah we rather a lot of data

00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:18,910
and we wanted to have a step-by-step

00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:24,040
form because otherwise we'd be huge

00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:27,340
ok and yeah yes send me the first like

00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:28,720
first thing but yes don't work so much

00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,110
in it but just send me what you have in

00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,090
mind

00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:33,400
and I preserve this document for

00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:36,910
historical reasons in my company which

00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,480
was this or like ok and they stand aside

00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:39,340
this is justified

00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,840
because we learn different markets and

00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:43,270
yeah it will be like we're changing

00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:45,609
things all the time and they send out

00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:47,890
like some ideas dakar like if you choose

00:35:45,609 --> 00:35:50,230
you are your woman of course it excuse

00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:53,410
you are pregnant which month pregnancy

00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:55,900
stuff like that if you so this is asking

00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:59,230
you pregnant in spanish that way or if

00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:00,880
you say i must practice the spores

00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:03,730
houses are you you are taking

00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,460
supplements before after kind of things

00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:09,220
a lot of ramifications also they wanted

00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:10,270
always to use ipad i use iPad and they

00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,859
want like this for everything like

00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:13,990
everything can be used for with advisors

00:36:11,859 --> 00:36:15,490
they want to do this thing so it was

00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:17,830
like the most important things i try

00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:21,010
this i four hours for everything okay

00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:22,750
that's then if your front end american

00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:24,220
teams are just communicating base with

00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,550
an IP i and they don't care about each

00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,410
other

00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:29,410
this can introduce a lot of overhead a

00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:31,330
lot of delays i think and which i think

00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:33,100
is even more important if you project

00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:35,350
see the light maybe you will see that

00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:36,070
the front end guy and the backing guy in

00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:38,980
the christmas party

00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:40,240
they tend to not sit together like they

00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,040
are like now i've been arguing with

00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:46,030
these guys for the whole year

00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:47,650
III hate him so this is this is not

00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:50,320
great to have I mean it's not the way to

00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:52,780
build rated many products right so we

00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:55,690
are thinking how can we fix this what we

00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:57,580
do we need so we're missing this we're

00:36:55,690 --> 00:37:00,460
missing this create building so we can

00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:02,680
build something maybe right in API is

00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:04,869
always mean sterilizing so the answer of

00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:07,570
everything is realizing okay then in

00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:09,070
which format what happens that these are

00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:12,760
very good for our for this which is a

00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:14,710
Xuan schema using standard people I see

00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,030
in to use it to satellite models but I

00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:20,380
think it's also great for say writing

00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:22,630
forms so what I think I'm more people

00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:25,480
think that it's not our idea three nice

00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:27,910
forms with area standard happens that

00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,740
when you read the specification at least

00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:30,790
me I don't understand anything it's

00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:34,240
impossible to understand these kind of

00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:36,070
sentences but it is here if you see an

00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,230
example like this is how is my schema

00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:41,710
looks has properties valuation rules

00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:43,660
dives you can even add your own options

00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:45,670
in there is not so strict about that so

00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:47,980
we can add like user interface we want

00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:50,740
to use these widgets here so I said okay

00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:51,759
this is great let's use this let's say

00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:53,289
realize we are looking

00:37:51,759 --> 00:37:55,749
about people who are doing things like

00:37:53,289 --> 00:37:58,179
that where people using symphony we're

00:37:55,749 --> 00:37:59,349
using symphony so Symphony component you

00:37:58,179 --> 00:38:01,719
can take this idea to your other

00:37:59,349 --> 00:38:04,809
frameworks as well we will I sell for

00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:07,689
Symphony companies so there was decided

00:38:04,809 --> 00:38:10,059
was do using forms to to create forms in

00:38:07,689 --> 00:38:12,729
the terminal in the console so we use

00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:16,479
the same approach that he was using the

00:38:12,729 --> 00:38:18,939
library I do pieces one so basically you

00:38:16,479 --> 00:38:20,559
are you have a resolver who has a lot of

00:38:18,939 --> 00:38:22,479
transformers register you can register

00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:25,449
Mauro create your own so on these

00:38:22,479 --> 00:38:26,949
transformers resolve it looks field by

00:38:25,449 --> 00:38:29,589
field and says ok I apply this

00:38:26,949 --> 00:38:32,649
transformer to this to this field and I

00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:34,749
get this slice of their recursively I

00:38:32,649 --> 00:38:36,639
you get this slice of the form so you

00:38:34,749 --> 00:38:38,679
get a full representation maybe this one

00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:41,259
is a text area so you can expect a lot

00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:42,609
of information from here or maybe for

00:38:41,259 --> 00:38:44,199
instance is a date time sometimes you

00:38:42,609 --> 00:38:46,269
can say the format is date time with

00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:48,699
this date time you have required values

00:38:46,269 --> 00:38:51,549
and in fact you can extract potentially

00:38:48,699 --> 00:38:55,919
I think all the information that form

00:38:51,549 --> 00:38:58,479
you can use if you salute Anna will be

00:38:55,919 --> 00:39:00,609
so we were very happy because we are

00:38:58,479 --> 00:39:03,130
sorry we also need it to she realizes

00:39:00,609 --> 00:39:07,149
that we wrote or the second one we

00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:09,969
copied from first res bundle which is a

00:39:07,149 --> 00:39:12,069
bundle in Symphony to serialize error

00:39:09,969 --> 00:39:14,199
and to realize initial values from the

00:39:12,069 --> 00:39:17,499
phone I to all the things we need it I

00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:19,479
think easier but also useful and with

00:39:17,499 --> 00:39:22,630
this we had this left part complete

00:39:19,479 --> 00:39:24,339
right so but we're still missing the

00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:26,289
second part way we can say ok we're back

00:39:24,339 --> 00:39:28,719
in developers we have done our job

00:39:26,289 --> 00:39:30,759
because now we have back-end and even a

00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:34,149
documentation is always NSYNC describes

00:39:30,759 --> 00:39:37,689
what we can do so we the number of

00:39:34,149 --> 00:39:38,049
issues decreases right that happens that

00:39:37,689 --> 00:39:40,119
wench

00:39:38,049 --> 00:39:41,499
once you have additional schema you want

00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:44,019
more things because you can just have

00:39:41,499 --> 00:39:45,999
them for free like for instance you can

00:39:44,019 --> 00:39:46,299
just say look we have this met schema

00:39:45,999 --> 00:39:47,919
now

00:39:46,299 --> 00:39:49,989
yes using this HIV library or other

00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:52,089
libraries you can validate your data in

00:39:49,989 --> 00:39:53,919
the schema and you if you see the

00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:55,449
relation errors present to the user and

00:39:53,919 --> 00:39:57,459
you don't even have to send me a request

00:39:55,449 --> 00:40:00,099
because maybe a price is negative or

00:39:57,459 --> 00:40:00,689
something very expression is not it's

00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:03,699
not right

00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:05,270
so we start with wingless frequencies

00:40:03,699 --> 00:40:07,480
also nice

00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:10,250
and also happens that we have a complete

00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:12,770
representation of their form so we can

00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:15,470
write generators and there are many

00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:18,230
generators for react or Manila

00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:19,310
javascript have not explored full field

00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:21,980
of generators but they've learned

00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:24,020
explore than react ones I think if you

00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:25,820
want to use one I think maybe the first

00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:28,310
option of the first option will be used

00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:30,770
a mozilla one which is like has been for

00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:32,540
some time and people contribute it has

00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:35,420
contributed a lot I think it's quite

00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:37,220
this table we couldn't use it so we

00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:39,890
wrote our own because it was not the

00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:43,610
extensible enough we couldn't do easily

00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:45,530
or I even so the way to build we serve

00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:47,720
form for instance or to customize it so

00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:50,270
much so we wrote around also using

00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:53,960
relaxed form which is a library that we

00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:55,640
think is awesome for forms and anyways

00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,840
if you are going to create your young

00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,700
generator is not something crazy

00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,990
especially if you only support some with

00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,820
widgets you don't need a color picker

00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:03,380
like I had to provide a color picker to

00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,850
provide providing this publishing this

00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:07,580
library I was like like maybe someone

00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:09,710
gives a Gore picker so I wrote this

00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:10,330
widget but sometimes you don't need all

00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:13,730
of them

00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:16,190
then relax form which is they were

00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:18,920
libraries doing the work in our case at

00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:20,870
work has a representation which powerful

00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:23,630
in relaxed you can use it without of

00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:25,670
course without this library you can have

00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:27,560
all kinds of validation you can write

00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:28,430
your own widgets and you know from the

00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,110
beginning that is flexible enough

00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:32,000
because if you see the from page they

00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:34,040
have an example for instance perhaps for

00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,960
wizard forms which is something you are

00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,970
writing our form library it's not

00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,290
something people tend to do like in the

00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:39,830
first place they say okay maybe you can

00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:42,620
allowed

00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:43,730
library but if they are flexible you

00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,710
know they say right you can use it

00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:47,810
whatever you want I mean what you want

00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:50,990
and they did so we need we can succeed

00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:52,370
doing this then using this is well it's

00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:55,940
some boilerplate importing so on but

00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:59,870
important part is like this it's this

00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:01,700
using this component deform and passing

00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:05,030
on a schema and and submit function it

00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:07,070
also has validation stuff you can also

00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:08,300
control it passing more props write more

00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:12,350
arguments but this is a simpler version

00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:15,650
that also feeds the screen and then with

00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:18,180
this basically we can have a schema and

00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:20,100
create react

00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:22,920
react representation like a react form

00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:24,900
and with this yak we had all of this so

00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,940
we said okay now what can focus on the

00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:29,340
part that we would like to do in this

00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:32,970
project and we were so happy and we had

00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:35,460
everything and then well as I said I

00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:36,780
maintain a sandbox for these concepts as

00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:38,490
libraries with publishing or someone

00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:40,050
maybe you can you are using symphony you

00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:42,090
can take directly the concepts or you

00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:44,490
can use the sandbox maybe for something

00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:45,960
for starting something or taking

00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:47,490
examples if you are not using symphony

00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,080
maybe you can use the libraries without

00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:50,460
like the bundle part it's like the

00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:53,220
connection of the libraries which has

00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:57,120
beaut PHP with symphony but the

00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:59,130
libraries can be used standalone and if

00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,870
you are using if you are not using react

00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:02,460
maybe you can take the idea from this

00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:05,040
talk of using for instance different

00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:06,810
schema or using Reb acts can be used

00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:11,100
without react react by the way she's

00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:13,740
many nice library but in any case I will

00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:16,350
if you are not doing any front-end at

00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:19,020
all like I would like yes ask you to be

00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:21,420
a bit yes open all these front-end

00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:23,340
people because there's my thinking out

00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:25,920
what they do or I was thinking about the

00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:29,370
project front-end you can something many

00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:32,130
times yes do a better job together and

00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:34,140
also which is the main goal of this talk

00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:37,020
which is that you have a nice Christmas

00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:39,180
party like save Christmas so people are

00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:40,980
really happy in Christmas party which is

00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:43,410
very important so you have questions all

00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:46,890
over this is my context exit one right

00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:48,030
there or I don't know that's it thank

00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:52,289
you

00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:52,289
