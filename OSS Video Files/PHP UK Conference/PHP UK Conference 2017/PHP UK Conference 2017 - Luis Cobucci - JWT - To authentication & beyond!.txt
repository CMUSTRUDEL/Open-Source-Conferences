Description: 
	Tokens are widely used to identify resources and try to add some security to insecure environments, but sometimes the management of those identifiers can get a bit complex - even more on distributed systems. What if we could have an intelligent token, one that simplifies the way things works without losing integrity or security? In this talk we present Json Web Tokens as an alternative for smart and self contained tokens, explaining how to use each claim and giving some common use cases.
