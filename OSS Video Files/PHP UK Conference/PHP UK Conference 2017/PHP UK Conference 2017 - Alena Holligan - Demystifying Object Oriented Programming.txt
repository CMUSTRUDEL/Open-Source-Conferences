Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2017
Description: 
	Abstraction, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Interfaces: whether you’ve been programming in PHP for years or are just starting your journey, these terms can be overwhelming even on a good day. Variables, conditionals, those all make sense. But this whole Object-Oriented thing is WAY more complicated. Not only that, people that already understand it act like it’s so easy and they talk right over the simple questions and never explain the basic concepts in a way that actually makes sense. In this session we’ll take you through real life examples of Object-Oriented terminology in a way that will make sense of all the mumbo jumbo and allow you to utilizing OOP immediately.
