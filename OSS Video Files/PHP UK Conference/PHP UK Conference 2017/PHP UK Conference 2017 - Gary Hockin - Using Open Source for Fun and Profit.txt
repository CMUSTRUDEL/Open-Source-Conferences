Title: PHP UK Conference 2017 - Gary Hockin - Using Open Source for Fun and Profit
Publication date: 2017-04-03
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2017
Description: 
	10 years ago I was a lonely developer sitting in a small room quietly turning out code between 9am and 5pm, Monday to Friday. Fast-forward to now and you'll see me standing in front of audiences all around the world talking to developers about numerous topics."Why are you bragging like that at me?" I hear you ask. Because it could happen to you too. The question I always ask myself is ""How the hell did that happen?!?!"". The truth is that the only reason I've managed to advance my career so far in a decade is because of the people that make up the communities of open source projects. Not only do open source projects save you time and money, but the friendships and support groups that can be made within these communities is, frankly, staggering. Join me as I chart my journey from wage slave to conference speaker, and look at how you can leverage the power of open source to make real friends, real money, and real happiness.

	00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:07,990
I'm going to tell you a story I know

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,820
that everybody wants to go and drink the

00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:12,039
air need mini-burgers so I'll try not to

00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,690
keep you here too long I do find it

00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:16,000
difficult to stop talking once I've

00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:18,279
started so there's that but we'll try

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,949
and get through this it's my story and

00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:22,390
it starts a long time ago when I was a

00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:26,949
lot younger than I am now

00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:31,390
yeah that's me I had hair and not quite

00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:33,010
so fat but it is mean honestly and we

00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:36,100
should really get started on this story

00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:37,390
at a point where I went to university so

00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,520
I'd be interested to know even though I

00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:42,400
can't really see you all how many people

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,620
here have got a university degree or a

00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,170
university education yeah that's pretty

00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:49,120
cool a lot of people I really enjoyed my

00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:51,850
time in university but I never ended up

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:55,810
actually getting a degree and yeah

00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:57,580
I failed University I said University

00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:59,650
twice which is kind of a record I guess

00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:02,140
I went to last University and partly

00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:04,150
doing a computer science course which I

00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,290
found really difficult apparently

00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,570
there's a lot of maths in computer

00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,590
science who thought it didn't find that

00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:11,469
too easy at all

00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:13,119
so I did what everyone does and stop

00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:15,759
going to lectures and got a job at

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,679
British Gas on a database system earning

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,380
something like something crazy like

00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:22,689
seven pounds an hour which put me a god

00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:25,689
among students back in the 90s so that

00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:28,600
was really cool then I went to Ponte

00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:32,170
Preta University it probably was also a

00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:36,249
Chia then I couldn't hoo-yeah I went to

00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:38,439
party preview knee and again really

00:01:36,249 --> 00:01:39,850
didn't take the Uni but I was very lucky

00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:41,649
that I got offered a job which would

00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,569
have been a job I wanted to do when I

00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:46,630
finished University anyway so I was very

00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:49,689
fortunate at this point it's probably

00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:51,130
worth addressing the fact that I am

00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:52,950
Welsh if you hadn't noticed

00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:56,200
[Laughter]

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,929
I'm from this tiny town in South Wales

00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,819
it's called portal but it's very much

00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:02,649
for one thing and one thing only portal

00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:05,469
but for scale were actually somewhere

00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:07,659
out here I think correct me if I'm wrong

00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:10,830
but portal bots are really interesting

00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:13,000
town very small town in South Wales I

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,319
mean if you do a google image search for

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,420
land then this is the kind of thing you

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,310
see some really amazing photograph

00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:20,319
we made in skyline and also makes red

00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,940
buses and if you do a google image

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,120
search for Port Oliver this is what you

00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,500
see so we're kind of defined by one

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,120
thing in Portola but and that's the

00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,280
steel industry there's a huge steel

00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,319
works looming over the town and that is

00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,660
how close to the town it is it's right

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,850
there on the houses but it's really

00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,980
fortunate for me because obviously steel

00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:40,720
works have computer systems so when I

00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,970
wanted to get a job in the computer

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,760
industry I was really lucky to have this

00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:47,140
industry right on my door so yeah I went

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,670
to work for British steel which then

00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,520
became chorus which then became Tata

00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:53,950
blah blah blah and I started work in

00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,550
1999 on a really interesting problem so

00:02:53,950 --> 00:03:00,430
how many people remember the y2k bug

00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:02,380
yeah I can see you it's good yeah a few

00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,690
people it's a few people there with as

00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,760
old as me and so I went to start working

00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:09,670
on their white ok problem obviously they

00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,830
have a ton of micro processors across

00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,630
the whole steelworks record in you know

00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:16,300
the weight of this vast the thickness of

00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:17,530
the steel right do you know how much is

00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,570
in this system how much is in that

00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:22,799
system and all of those micro processes

00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:25,120
had a problem in 1999 because

00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:27,160
short-sighted coders in the 60s and 70s

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,290
had stored the date as two digits

00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,370
instead of four digits for the year so

00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:32,500
nobody knew what was going to happen

00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:34,420
when 99 rolled around with zero zero

00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,400
what was going to happen I mean why

00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,540
didn't these developers in the 60s think

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,910
their cords was going to last that long

00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,590
the first question I guess that's what

00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:44,920
happens to all of us but it's a really

00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:47,620
interesting job or in theory and but

00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,870
really what I was doing was looking at a

00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:52,030
spreadsheet and looking at a list of all

00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:54,100
of the makes and models of the process

00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,750
that micro processors we had and then

00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,850
falling them up and saying excuse me

00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:00,280
manufacturer is this product why you can

00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:02,230
K compliant and if they say yes I put a

00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,090
tick and we can forget it and if they

00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,350
say no then somebody more intelligent

00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,900
than me has to go and look at the ladder

00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:09,630
logic in the code so it was not a very

00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,769
interesting job at all it turns out

00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:13,239
there's a lot of hanging around waiting

00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:14,859
for people to call you back there's a

00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:16,269
lot of waiting for emails there's a lot

00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:18,400
of search in the web to find out if

00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:20,709
anyone else's check this stuff and so

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,020
what I did is what most people who have

00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:24,789
a window computer who have to hang

00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,669
around a lot is I played a ton of name

00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:30,199
wrong does anyone know this game you can

00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:33,689
shout out if you know it

00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:36,989
SuperMario dear me that's terrible over

00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:39,479
here that was a circus Charlie yeah who

00:04:36,989 --> 00:04:40,919
said that I'll buy you a beer good or

00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:44,149
you've seen this talk before that does

00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:47,069
not count that does not count

00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:49,439
yeah luckily I changed up some of the

00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:51,689
other ones so we're okay yeah I started

00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,189
so much hanging around and so much

00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:56,489
messing about sorry this microphone is

00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:57,779
really annoying me but you know there

00:04:56,489 --> 00:05:00,379
was a whole process Control Department

00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:02,699
so there wasn't just me doing this and

00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:05,369
Stefan you know looking at the y2k

00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:06,749
problem we had a whole huge Oracle

00:05:05,369 --> 00:05:08,429
database that used to take in all of

00:05:06,749 --> 00:05:11,339
these metrics and all of this data and

00:05:08,429 --> 00:05:14,069
what we would do then is pay expensive

00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:15,719
third parties to write screens so the

00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:16,889
managers can see exactly what's going on

00:05:15,719 --> 00:05:19,019
on the plant at any one time

00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:21,509
of course this was only being stored in

00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:24,149
a database and so why did we need to

00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:25,889
actually pay somebody to come in and

00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:27,419
take this data and presented surely

00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:30,209
there's a better way that we can do this

00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:33,419
where we can use existing infrastructure

00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:35,369
and display this data as cheaper and we

00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:37,519
already reuse in a Windows NT full

00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:38,789
domain if anyone goes back that far

00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:43,319
excuse me

00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:46,949
I did say there should be beer when I

00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:48,779
had my right a turbine fine we leave the

00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:51,239
window venting for domain so we had a

00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:52,889
Microsoft and infrastructure we had you

00:05:51,239 --> 00:05:54,539
know Microsoft sequel server and

00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:56,639
Internet Information server at the time

00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:59,399
and we know we had all this

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,289
infrastructure so I started looking at

00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:02,999
active server pages which could pull the

00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:05,219
data out of the database and display it

00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:07,079
in a format we had a corporate intranet

00:06:05,219 --> 00:06:09,799
which used to be like a really big deal

00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:12,029
back in there like late 90s early 2000s

00:06:09,799 --> 00:06:13,829
and yet to see anyone watch we had a

00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:14,969
corporate internet that used to display

00:06:13,829 --> 00:06:19,110
any information that was of any value

00:06:14,969 --> 00:06:20,699
but we had one so it was all good so yep

00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:22,019
we started I started to think around

00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,759
without the server pages and they were

00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:26,729
really cool so as anyone does anyone

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:30,179
remember ASP classic ASP yeah a ton of

00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:31,860
people I did a Google search forum for

00:06:30,179 --> 00:06:33,719
ESP and this is a genuine image that

00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,549
came up which kind of sums up how ASP

00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:37,279
was working for me it's like trying to

00:06:35,549 --> 00:06:39,389
get it to work is like rolling a dice

00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:39,809
sometimes it works and sometimes it

00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:41,909
doesn't

00:06:39,809 --> 00:06:43,090
more interestingly together to work

00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:44,919
really well it's like

00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:47,230
Dyce end-on-end which is like really

00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:49,120
hard so yeah I started working with ASP

00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:51,010
and that was a pretty cool thing you

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,949
know I really started to enjoy this

00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:56,860
whole more development oriented job that

00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:58,510
I was doing and and then I decided you

00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,860
know this is really cool stuff and I

00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:02,440
want to be able to do this in my own

00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:05,380
time as well as you know in works time

00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,990
but ASP has a fundamental flaw back then

00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:09,280
in the in the 2000 the early 2000 which

00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,620
is the cost of the licenses were

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,389
extraordinary like Internet Information

00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:15,940
server was really expensive and a

00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:18,190
Microsoft Windows NT server was really

00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:21,160
expensive so it wasn't really something

00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:22,540
the hobbyist could do and so I stumbled

00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,360
across something called personal

00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:27,220
homepage or HP pre-prepare

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,010
HP had to be able to much recursion

00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:32,320
sleeve out there and I wanted to be able

00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:34,600
to use this stuff for my own kind of

00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:37,000
hobbies now I was playing a ton of

00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,220
online gaming kind of come to strike

00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,860
back then if anyone remembers for the

00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:45,370
semi competitive come to strike and of

00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:47,650
course we were in a clan and back then I

00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:49,870
think people were more interested not in

00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:51,639
how you would do in in the clan leagues

00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,590
in your ladder with your win-loss ratio

00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,930
you know the best clans were the ones

00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:58,150
are the best websites so they got I can

00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:00,220
use PHP e to you know create my own

00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:03,910
website for my own clan so we can look

00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:05,860
really cool and I came up with it and

00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:09,370
that's a genuine website I did in the

00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:11,020
early 2000 using PHP my design skills

00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,430
are actually gone worse since then so

00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,680
that's kind of embarrassing

00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:16,330
laughing but yeah this is the kind of

00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,550
thing that you could do as a hobbyist

00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:20,139
program about then you know I have to

00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:21,520
search the wayback machine for this I

00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:23,740
didn't actually have a copy of this you

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,060
know anywhere on my own system and it

00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,800
was very interesting when I looked at

00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:29,500
the wayback machine because there was

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,120
only three snapshots there was and they

00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:34,390
were in very quick succession the first

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,650
snapshot was of class login I don't have

00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,570
anyone remembers like shared hosting

00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:39,430
where you log into class and set up your

00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:41,800
hosting but that was the first map shop

00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:44,580
this was the second snapshot and this is

00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,580
the third chapter

00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:52,910
kind of sums up my PHP : of the day yeah

00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:55,370
kind of become familiar to me ever since

00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:56,990
then but that's cool so I was back at

00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,580
work I was tending to do less

00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,140
development in work and more development

00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,300
at home at this point I'd gone back to

00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,670
doing kind of mundane work rolling out

00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:07,310
new PCs and you know not stuff that I

00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:08,870
was really enjoying so yeah I kind of my

00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:10,370
attention slip that I ended up playing a

00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:13,060
lot more main runs and I probably should

00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:15,410
have anyone want to show this one out

00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:16,760
double dragon from the back and at the

00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:18,320
front so good yep

00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,960
so I ended up thinking you know it's

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,510
time for me to move on I can make an

00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:26,240
amazing plan page in PHP you know I am

00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:28,790
the boss of this language now so I did

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,470
what everyone does when they want to do

00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,910
more kind of something of a hobby that

00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:34,940
they want to do more of I became a

00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:36,710
contractor of course because I can do a

00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,470
hobbyist clan website therefore I should

00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:41,870
be charging top dollar to corporations

00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,340
right yet that wasn't the best move I've

00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:47,530
ever done in my career I'll be honest

00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,530
because I was a terrible developer

00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:55,640
whoever mustered you still are in the

00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:57,740
front row I was a terrible developer but

00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,610
I quickly found a niche which is really

00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,800
interesting to me

00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,630
I found a niche where I may have been a

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,210
terrible developer if your metrics were

00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:07,490
called reusability and maintainability

00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:10,130
and copy and pasting and solid and all

00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:12,770
of that stuff but I found a really quick

00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:14,690
niche where I had got a really good

00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:16,250
reputation for being able to get the job

00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,050
done quickly and being able to pick up

00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:21,050
projects that had faltered and get them

00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:22,790
finished so I was a low-key developer if

00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:25,250
getting stuff done on time and on budget

00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:27,770
was important a lot of the stuff I was

00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:29,630
doing was like six to eight week

00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:31,550
marketing campaign so the code wasn't

00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:33,050
going to be long-lived anyway so didn't

00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:35,210
really matter if it was held together by

00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:37,520
you know string and duct tape for six or

00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:39,950
eight weeks interestingly one of the

00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,690
jobs I did was for Intel the the

00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:43,850
processor manufacturer where they wanted

00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:46,970
to run a promotion for their resellers

00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:49,220
and they they wanted to just basically

00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:51,020
show a flash movie where you move to

00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:53,360
remember flash yeah where you move along

00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:55,340
the this path to say how close you are

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,940
to winning the grand prize and that was

00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,830
really cool you know it it

00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,590
was a hard job because they were giving

00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:03,180
me the data in an Excel spreadsheet

00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:05,130
twice a week which I then have it

00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,780
important to PHP and then render opens

00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,670
XML which sounds really easy but of

00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:11,220
course the spreadsheet didn't come in

00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:12,780
the same format any two days so real

00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,550
pain in the ass but I got a really good

00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,960
reputation of being able to get the job

00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,430
done when other people had kind of

00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,160
failed or they would start to panic

00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:22,200
which is really good so yeah not the

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:27,690
best card I've ever written but you know

00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:29,850
the money was okay so there's that and

00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,930
then I my my daughters born so it was

00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,600
time for me to get a full-time job

00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:34,860
because my life as a contractor than as

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,660
a single man you know I was either

00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,090
really really rich or really really poor

00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:42,030
there was a kind of middle ground I was

00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:43,680
either going on huge fall style holidays

00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:46,110
or I was like trying to see if my

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,550
parents would buy you some food so it's

00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:49,080
time to kind of get a bit more stability

00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:50,970
here so I went to work for a company

00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:55,680
called VEVO digital a really nice little

00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:57,030
company who were doing TV over IP which

00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,140
is kind of a new thing then now is

00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:00,660
something we all take for granted

00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:03,060
watching TV over the internet or over IP

00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:05,070
networks but back then is kind of a new

00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,630
and interesting thing and we were doing

00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:09,000
this digital signage stuff which is

00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:11,010
again you see this in like the smallest

00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,540
corner shop will have a digital sign on

00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:15,000
the on the till on the front of the till

00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:18,210
but back then is kind of spangly and new

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,310
and that was pretty cool and I got some

00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:21,780
time where I could rewrite the whole PHP

00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:23,820
back-end that managed the digital

00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:25,650
signage system back then the way that we

00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,720
would allow people to have more

00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:29,340
expensive systems so you could buy the

00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,590
basic system or you could buy the more

00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:33,390
expensive system and the way that we

00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:35,910
decided if people could have the more

00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:37,830
expensive features was to comment out

00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:39,360
the anchor link in the HTML before we

00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:41,640
ship the product to them and that's the

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,960
truth it's like oh yeah you haven't paid

00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,660
for that I'll just comment it out in the

00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,920
HTML it's fine you'll never know so

00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:49,650
there has to be a better way than that

00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,180
right so we have some time it was cool I

00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:53,100
got some time to rewrite the whole

00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,630
system so I was thinking oh we really

00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,850
need something modular where we can just

00:12:54,630 --> 00:13:01,380
drop modules in if this stuff is enabled

00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:04,530
so I googled and as you do PHP modular

00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:08,100
framework I think there must be people

00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:09,510
you know I've seen PHP classes so I knew

00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,499
there were things out there where you

00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:13,589
could sort of use

00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:16,049
the people's called and I stumbled

00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:17,399
across it which is design framework 1.7

00:13:16,049 --> 00:13:19,889
this is the first version of the Zen

00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:22,439
framework I ever used kind of a

00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:24,509
red-letter day for me there because up

00:13:22,439 --> 00:13:27,959
until this point I should have the new

00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:30,269
keyword but I didn't know what it was my

00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:31,799
old my PHP was like require head there

00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:33,959
require database and then running some

00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:35,879
sequel command in in amongst the HTML

00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:38,459
and then I'll put that straight into the

00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:40,469
browser you know looking back terrible

00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:42,329
but it was at the time it was fine so

00:13:40,469 --> 00:13:43,859
it's this is a point where not only did

00:13:42,329 --> 00:13:46,019
I find the framework but I started to

00:13:43,859 --> 00:13:49,499
learn object-oriented PHP it's kind of

00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:51,179
important and after a while of of using

00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:52,529
Zen from work I got to understand it

00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:54,089
there's a very steep learning curve

00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:55,919
enzyme frame of 1 but I got over that

00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:59,939
hill and became an amazing developer

00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:01,439
again excellent yeah that's kind of the

00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:03,509
most dangerous position I've seen them

00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:05,969
where I think I'm an amazing developer

00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:08,099
because I can do anything I want in this

00:14:05,969 --> 00:14:10,229
one specific framework but I don't

00:14:08,099 --> 00:14:12,479
really know what I don't really know I'm

00:14:10,229 --> 00:14:13,979
looking up thinking I'm climbing this

00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,629
mountain and there's the peak right in

00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:17,970
front of me and I've only got 10% ago

00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:19,499
and then you take a few more steps and

00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:21,329
you find out that's not the peak at all

00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:23,339
there's another huge peak behind it that

00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:24,720
you have to climb and this point is the

00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:26,999
point where I think I was at my most

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,979
dangerous because I was a terrible

00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:29,639
developer I just gave my own joke away

00:14:28,979 --> 00:14:31,769
but I'm fine

00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:33,359
I was a terrible developer I didn't

00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:34,859
really know anything about what I was

00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:36,809
doing I could copy and paste stuff from

00:14:34,859 --> 00:14:39,929
Stack Overflow with great efficiency but

00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:41,759
that was about it but at least I

00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:43,829
suddenly came to the realization that I

00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:46,199
had huge huge holes in my in my

00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:49,229
knowledge so I had a lot of questions

00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:51,959
that I wanted to ask anyone who used

00:14:49,229 --> 00:14:54,419
them framework one or two will know the

00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:57,269
documentation is not the best

00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:58,349
let's just go that far I can say that

00:14:57,269 --> 00:15:00,329
because I'm the maintainer the

00:14:58,349 --> 00:15:03,089
documentation so you can hate on me if

00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:04,559
we use M framework I am sorry so I had

00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:06,269
so many questions and going back to my

00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:08,759
counter-strike roots I was really lucky

00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:10,439
that I knew what is he was and I was a

00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:15,779
channel called direct rock on freenode

00:15:10,439 --> 00:15:17,489
so I joined that channel not that you

00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:19,649
know not that long into my development

00:15:17,489 --> 00:15:21,629
career with Zen framework and that's

00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:24,060
kind of when I had the first epiphany

00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:26,430
that I had about developing

00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:28,710
I'd work for small companies I worked on

00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:31,020
my own or I group for small command

00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:33,540
small single developer companies I

00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:36,750
didn't realize that I'm not the only

00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:38,310
person who's doing my job you know

00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,990
there's a whole community in this room a

00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:41,760
huge community of developers in this

00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:43,140
room and everyone you know some people

00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,120
will be working for bigger companies

00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:47,160
where they'll have had peers they work

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,990
with every day but for people like me in

00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,940
the room there's this real kind of

00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:53,010
moment where you think oh I'm not alone

00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,960
as a developer other people have the

00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:56,820
same problems that I have and other

00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,200
people can help me to solve those

00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:01,080
problems and that's kind of a really

00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:03,510
cool moment in my career when I met some

00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,950
amazing people in that channel I met

00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:07,890
people like Ryan Moser who was

00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:10,200
absolutely tireless in answering all of

00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:12,210
my questions even when I thought I was

00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,040
asking then framework questions and what

00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:16,380
I was actually asking was basic object

00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,570
oriented programming questions Ryan

00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:20,520
still helped me out he was amazing you

00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:21,840
know people like Rob Allen who is in

00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,490
here this year but had spoken on this

00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,340
stage many times you know really really

00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:28,260
helpful people like Katherine Reed who's

00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,850
in the front row who really helped me

00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,770
out without you know you can't tell you

00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:34,050
how helpful to help me get over that

00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:35,460
thumb and to better myself so I thank

00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:35,910
all these people who have helped me

00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,970
along the way

00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:41,760
but Robin Ryan was speaking to me we've

00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:45,300
been speaking on IRC for a while bless

00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:47,930
you and they found out that there was a

00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,920
new user group starting in Bristol a PHP

00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:51,870
Southwest which started in Bristol and

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,980
basically they dragged me along they

00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:55,830
wouldn't take no for an answer

00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:57,780
and they dragged me along to this user

00:16:55,830 --> 00:17:00,660
group so this is the first time I went

00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:04,500
and I met some people I met on the

00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:06,240
Internet in real life I think that's

00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,970
kind of a weird thing to laugh at now

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,010
where you know we all do this fairly

00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:13,290
regularly but back then it was kind of a

00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:14,880
weird thing I'm like kind of say to my

00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:16,590
girlfriend at the time now my wife yeah

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,790
I'm just going to meet a group of men

00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:21,250
that I met on the Internet

00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:24,490
and it was old man I apologize I am

00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:26,140
sayin man deliberately but I did go they

00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:29,680
did persuade me to go I was there this

00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:31,000
is a photo from the first-ever PHP

00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,940
Southwest native I am there

00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,100
there I am you could just see my my big

00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:37,690
fat belly but they're poking out but I

00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,070
went and it was amazing it was

00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,990
completely amazed that I met some people

00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,190
like Stewart Herbert and other people

00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:44,830
who I now countless friends is

00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:46,660
absolutely fantastic so again another

00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:48,160
red light today and everyone here you

00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,570
know I hope people here who come to

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,610
conferences will be going to user groups

00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:54,910
as well because it's amazing that was

00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:56,710
really cool meanwhile back in my job we

00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:58,540
kind of ground or halt this amazing

00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:00,400
small company it suddenly stopped

00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:02,140
getting any sales and I didn't really

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,520
have a lot of work to do so I bet you

00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:07,170
can guess that I started playing some

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:12,010
AMRAAM anyone want to show this one

00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:13,180
gauntlet no no no no ghouls and ghosts

00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:15,670
those who said ghosts and goblins

00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:18,130
clothes or you owe me a drink

00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:20,620
so yeah ghouls and ghosts this so I

00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:22,600
started to taper off we didn't get the

00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:24,400
work I look for some new jobs and I was

00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,590
a really cool company in Cardiff called

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,150
micro cotton games a gaming company

00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:30,220
which is perfect for me you can tell

00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:32,860
already that I really are not really

00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,300
enjoy my game in so this company and

00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:37,150
this was would have been for the

00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:39,760
mid-2000s this company wrote games for

00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:43,660
Facebook and when I say games I

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:46,360
obviously mean games really they would

00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:47,920
database is wrapped in pretty pictures

00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,870
that were intended to just spam your

00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,580
friends as much as humanly possible I'm

00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:54,190
sure anyone who's been in on Facebook

00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:55,870
since like the mid-2000s will remember

00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:57,910
it was the Golden Age of people like me

00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:59,500
because they were no they were no limits

00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:00,880
you could just do everything you wanted

00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,150
to try and get as many signups as you

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,710
can but it was quite cool because

00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:07,630
believe it or not the tiny team of six

00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:09,820
developers in Cardiff had the official

00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:12,310
license to produce the Lord of the Rings

00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,890
game on Facebook which now is staggering

00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:16,150
to think of that you know that is

00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:18,310
unbelievable but we did we had that and

00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,540
we wrote some crappy sort of grind the

00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:21,280
game where you literally just press

00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:23,680
buttons in random orders and level up

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,660
and then we try and make you pay to get

00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,520
more energy and one of those great

00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,350
classic Facebook games but it works

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,600
really well it works really well the

00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:33,420
most interesting thing to me at this

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,800
point

00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:38,530
was that we started using Zefram with

00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:40,450
tool for our one of our back-end systems

00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:43,960
same framework who would just come out

00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:45,700
it was still in sort of pre betta they

00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,010
release an alpha it's an calm but it was

00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:51,730
way too early but it was it was there it

00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:53,500
was working and I found a bug and new

00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:55,540
versions were coming out every sort of

00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,280
three weeks and every three weeks I had

00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,960
to go and patch this same file because I

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,820
found the bug and of course I'm not

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,130
going to contribute that back but in the

00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:05,470
end I got persuaded to to create a pull

00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:07,210
request you know instead of monkey patch

00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,620
in this file every single release why

00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:10,660
can you just create the pull request and

00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:13,080
you know it all everybody will benefit

00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:15,790
so here it is my first ever pull request

00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,650
in 2011 so we've skipped ahead a few

00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:20,350
years but it's in 2011 my first ever

00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:21,880
pull request not that long ago and you

00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:23,920
can see that the important thing here is

00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,080
that created the pull request it was

00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,730
merged and Matthew we're if any one of

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,170
the nicest people I've ever met you know

00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:31,930
this is the way to welcome people into

00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:33,280
your open-source project that's the way

00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:35,530
to respond to people who were given

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:39,040
their first contribution their note that

00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:42,010
he served particularly the test I can

00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:43,210
write care whoa so let's just take a

00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,800
look at walked up for the request

00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:47,710
actually entails before I start

00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,330
congratulate myself too much so there

00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:51,070
gives the test which I literally just

00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:52,420
copy and pasted from some other tests

00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:54,100
are in the file and change the string

00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:56,350
you know I didn't know what that was at

00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:58,270
this point um but I still I wrote the

00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:59,470
test right copy and paste changed a

00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:01,900
couple of strings and then you get a

00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:03,340
nice message from the maintainer more

00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:06,070
importantly let's take a look at what

00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:07,570
the actual code change was that I did so

00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:11,230
this is my first day of a contribution

00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:15,520
to open-source you know I added three

00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:19,870
characters to a regular expression but

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:22,030
it comes right it does count so I got to

00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:23,140
mention Matthew finials honestly one of

00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,480
the nicest people I've ever met been

00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:27,760
amazing to me in my career mentor to me

00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:30,160
and I guess an unofficial one but

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,720
definitely a mentor anyway at the

00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:34,060
question here I'd like to ask everyone

00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:37,660
is this got merged on the 11th of

00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:39,820
November 2011 and any case is what I did

00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:41,940
on the 12th of November 2011 the next

00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,940
day

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,740
claiming roms is a good guess but it's

00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:48,970
not right yeah honey remove them no I

00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:52,690
didn't revert that that would have been

00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:53,230
crazy no I made another protest a good

00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:57,030
guess

00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:57,030
actually I updated my CV

00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:02,209
[Applause]

00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:07,330
obviously I am now looking for video to

00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:10,390
design framework and so I should put

00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:11,920
that on my CV right and I say that as a

00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:16,630
joke but I really mean it you know

00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:18,880
that's that's valid but is valid the

00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:21,490
pointer is the contribute in my first

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,080
pull request you know is a really small

00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:25,990
change and I will not tell you how

00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:28,300
scared I was even submitting that I had

00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:30,160
several people some may even be in this

00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:32,200
room to review that for me under the

00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:34,960
table before I put it public you know I

00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,520
really it took push in from my peers and

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,170
my friends to get me to do that timely

00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,640
pull requests because contributing is

00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:42,040
scary nobody wants to be criticized

00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,390
right nobody wants to be told oh you've

00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,860
done this wrong you've done that wrong

00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:48,010
why are you doing it like this this way

00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:50,200
is better horrible thought but for me

00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:52,210
there was a moment really early on in my

00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,330
contributions where I realized that if

00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:57,760
you don't take it of criticism take it

00:22:55,330 --> 00:23:01,060
as freak old reviews it doesn't suddenly

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:03,910
seem to be so scary I've learned so much

00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:05,410
stuff from code reviews of my code on

00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:07,300
open source project by people are more

00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:09,400
experienced smarter than me you know

00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:11,230
Noah 10 more than I know and I've

00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,820
learned so much in my career from these

00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:14,950
free code reviews that I've gotten

00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,090
contributing to open so it's pretty cool

00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:17,920
when you think of it that way

00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:19,240
you know it's not quite so scary to

00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,100
think of it as all they're going to

00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,530
criticize me as or they're going to

00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:26,710
teach me so much nicer way to think of

00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:28,510
what your contributions will mean the

00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:30,460
other point that is important to make is

00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:34,390
most people really want you to get your

00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:36,760
stuff merged very few people in very few

00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:39,610
projects will want you not want you to

00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:41,470
get your stuff page because if you fix a

00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:43,720
bug and it gets merged it's moved for

00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:46,600
everyone everyone gets that bug fix if

00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:48,190
you add a new feature everybody gets

00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,660
that new feature you know everybody wins

00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:52,840
so most people want you to get your

00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:55,630
stuff made and that's probably the time

00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:58,690
to mention this guy does anyone know

00:23:55,630 --> 00:24:01,540
Michael yeah Marcus maintainer of the

00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:02,950
doctoring product project so if you use

00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,990
doctrine Michael's the person you should

00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:08,050
thank his tireless work and the

00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:11,310
doctoring happen exalt so a maintainer

00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:13,420
of Zen framework he's also like the most

00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:14,130
tireless called reviewer that I've ever

00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:16,840
met in my life

00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:18,429
in a commercial sense after we

00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,779
good you know I think he's even going to

00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:21,640
start the business giving called reviews

00:24:19,779 --> 00:24:25,299
to people because he his core drillings

00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:27,900
are spectacularly detailed you know he

00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:30,730
can review your code with such clarity

00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:32,590
his comments are like really succinct

00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:34,630
and he really comments really well but

00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:37,510
he does comment quite the last on your

00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:40,360
code reviews and the comments do keep

00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:41,799
coming for quite a while and even when

00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,090
you fix one thing there will be a

00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:44,440
comment coming about something else

00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:46,690
little bit further down the line until

00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,159
the comments are just starting to really

00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:52,360
annoy you when you see this little Mario

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:53,950
in your sleep looking at you Mario then

00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,149
suddenly starts appearing in your inbox

00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,740
and in your discipline or vacations

00:24:55,149 --> 00:24:59,529
there's Mario everywhere

00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:04,330
Mario is watching you Marco is always

00:24:59,529 --> 00:25:05,740
watching you he's a hard man to please

00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:07,779
Michael but I've learned to turn from

00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:11,320
him and he knows this joke so you know

00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:13,720
it's all good but most people want you

00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,549
to get your stuff merged and this is a

00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,320
free experience to learn that's a really

00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:20,080
important thing to think about if you're

00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:22,270
trying to learn a new product I wouldn't

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,100
you know advise giving terrible

00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:26,169
submitting terrible code just to get the

00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,490
free code review but if you look like

00:25:26,169 --> 00:25:29,440
you've thought things out and if you

00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:31,809
look like he's sorting through and if

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,070
you just need a small hint this is the

00:25:31,809 --> 00:25:39,490
time to get free code reviews because

00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:41,470
free chord reviews are free learning so

00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:45,090
meanwhile these two people who have

00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:47,440
dragged me to PHP sorry PHP Southwest

00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:48,909
told me that I was now going to a

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,350
conference and again they didn't take an

00:25:48,909 --> 00:25:52,450
offer answer they're like nah we gone to

00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:54,820
a conference and you're coming so I went

00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:56,710
to PHP Northwest in Manchester in 2012

00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:59,020
which is not that long ago either kind

00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:02,590
of cool I had an amazing time there I

00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:04,750
met this guy Evan Corey who we'll come

00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:07,630
back to later super cool guys and more

00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:09,730
at 19 than I'd done at 30 something so

00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:11,860
an amazing amazing developer and a

00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:13,539
really good friend of mine now I met

00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:15,429
Laura Mitchell again a stalwart of this

00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:17,740
conference who became my kind of

00:26:15,429 --> 00:26:19,059
speaking mentor really and she's a

00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:21,220
person who told me that it's a bad idea

00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:23,460
to give a talk in a Hawaiian shirt

00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:25,890
so you can thank her for that

00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:29,549
I'm still not convinced but I do take

00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:31,230
your opinion yeah and I also give myself

00:26:29,549 --> 00:26:33,059
some contact at the first conference I

00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:34,500
went to which is really weird when I

00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:36,419
think back about that now but it seemed

00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:38,490
okay at the time and the uncomf in these

00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:39,659
conferences I know some don't companies

00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:41,070
don't have them but if you go to a

00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:42,960
conference where they do have one an

00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:45,840
amazing place to just get up and give a

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,880
talk it would be nice to me to say look

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,309
I had four star on Jung din my first

00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:53,760
talk but everybody in my room in the

00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:55,890
room was my friend so I only had four

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,720
stars off my friends in the first talk I

00:26:55,890 --> 00:27:00,149
ever give probably a better way to frame

00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,590
that but I was really cool to get to a

00:27:00,149 --> 00:27:03,990
conference so now I've gone from a small

00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:05,730
user group to meeting new people and a

00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:07,350
lot of them at the same time you know

00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:09,779
really again everyone here is probably

00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:11,190
felt that buzz you get when you come

00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:13,500
home from a conference and you feel

00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:16,789
motivated and you've got new things you

00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,789
want to try out and that's really cool

00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:23,909
yeah things were going well again I

00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:27,059
ended up playing the 10 mm roms again

00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:31,350
life was going downhill in my job most

00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:32,880
people should know this one right yeah

00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:36,450
that they may that may be lost in

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:38,460
translation Burger Time yeah one of my

00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:40,980
favorites so it was time to move on from

00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:42,419
microcosm games we'd lost the license

00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,130
the Lord of the Rings apparently like a

00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:46,919
real games company wanted to be able to

00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:48,720
do that so we lost the license overnight

00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:50,610
so it's kind of it wasn't it wasn't a

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,110
great separation but you know it was

00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:54,059
fine I still had to work out a northeast

00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:55,200
period which is a great time to meet

00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:57,480
play main roms if you're of that

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,220
persuasion I went to work for a company

00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,080
called yong-go which transitioned into

00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:03,539
ads groups really cool company in

00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:05,220
Swansea I really enjoyed it but more

00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:08,279
importantly I started to submit the

00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:10,950
conference's and I started to submit the

00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:12,630
conference's because I loved coming up

00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:14,370
as you can tell and talked into a room

00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:17,149
full of people where nobody can walk out

00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:17,149
oh sorry

00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:22,450
but the important thing is to say that

00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:26,260
this is kind of the red letter day for

00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:28,090
me you know this is a nun contour uncon

00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,500
and the middle one is a kind of small

00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:32,050
community conference which was accepted

00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:33,580
after I got accepted to vent on so I got

00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:36,130
accepted to Zen con for my first ever

00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:37,270
conference and the reason that then con

00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:41,110
accepted me is because of my

00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:42,970
contributions to their project I wasn't

00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:44,560
an unknown entity they knew that I'd

00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:45,970
been contributing to Zen framework so I

00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:48,010
knew that I could speak about them

00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:50,770
framework because I'm contributing

00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:52,930
therefore I can be trusted so that door

00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:55,450
was definitely opened by my contribution

00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:56,890
to open source and my veinte PHP UK a

00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:58,900
couple of times is worth mentioning I've

00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:02,140
met some really cool people here people

00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:04,480
will come until later and apparently

00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:07,540
this happened when I googled my name and

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,540
PHP UK so yeah I was that was a good

00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:12,220
night I think if I can remember rightly

00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:14,620
and but more importantly you know this

00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:16,360
rolled for me started with contributions

00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:19,240
and if you're scared about putting your

00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:23,380
cord out there contributing is not just

00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:26,530
about coding I would recommend anyone

00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:27,640
tries to aspire to to submit some pull

00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:29,890
request to open source software

00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,450
so-called but if you can't contribute

00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:33,550
with code or if you know you're not that

00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:35,080
comfortable yet and documentation is a

00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:36,670
great place to contribute people will

00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,800
absolutely love you if you start

00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:42,190
contributing documentation a wonderful

00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,600
way to do yeah and if you do want to

00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,810
start contributing documentation then

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,790
frameworks a good project to do it on so

00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:51,160
it's all good but triage is an amazing

00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:52,900
thing you can do if you see bugs being

00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,490
reported all you need to do is look at

00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:56,530
that bug and see if you can reproduce it

00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:58,480
and if you can reproduce it just put the

00:29:56,530 --> 00:30:00,010
stuff you did on the issue because the

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,960
people come in behind you have to fix

00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:03,340
those bugs will absolutely love you for

00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,380
that for them to have just a

00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:07,480
reproducible set of steps now that's

00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:09,040
really cool I'm writing tests there's

00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,390
another really good thing you can do for

00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,180
projects that don't have a huge test

00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:15,190
coverage if you were in Anna's talk

00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:16,870
earlier and she speaking spoke really

00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:18,430
well about testing and you want to level

00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:19,750
up your testing skills there's tons of

00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:21,430
open source projects out there like

00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:24,550
joined in where we all give feedback

00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:26,200
which is got low test coverage and if

00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:27,310
you start submitting tests they're just

00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,440
because you want to practice writing

00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:30,880
tests they love you for it and you get

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,300
to practice writing tests

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:37,870
it's a win-win giving answers on places

00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:39,940
like Stack Overflow or on on IRC which

00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:43,000
is what we used to use before slack came

00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:45,130
along for giving answers on slack right

00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,570
in right in a personal blog about what

00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:48,820
problems you solved that day is an

00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:49,690
amazing way to start contributing it may

00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,790
not feel like you're contributing

00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:53,350
officially but you really are because if

00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:55,270
you're giving answers when people Google

00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:56,650
problems you're really helping the

00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:59,080
community and the project that you're

00:30:56,650 --> 00:31:00,370
supporting to grow it's also really good

00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,590
for building a personal brand

00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:05,410
I found the plug-in is something that I

00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:07,900
don't do enough now but early on in my

00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:09,490
career really really helping people like

00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,110
Rob Allen who we mentioned only blogs

00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:13,390
when you know if he solves a problem for

00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:15,700
himself he blogs to remind himself when

00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:17,050
he needs that fix that same problem in

00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,610
two or three years and that's a really

00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:20,950
good way to do it it doesn't need to be

00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:23,440
ten thousand words a hundred words is

00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:26,830
good enough just to do regularly that's

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,850
a really easy way to get into it if I

00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:29,860
the sound of the fact that when you

00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:31,960
contribute to a project that you use

00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:34,000
then you're you're forced to look

00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,500
further than just the public API you're

00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,270
forced to look into the code in the

00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:41,260
vendor folder and understand what's

00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:42,730
going on under the hood and once you

00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:45,940
kind of know what's going on under the

00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:46,840
hood then you're an expert in that

00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,400
project

00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,100
you know library framework whatever it

00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,660
is if you understand how the code works

00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:55,390
internally and you don't just use the

00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:57,580
code the public API so to call methods

00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:59,680
you're an expert in that framework or

00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:01,120
that project or that library and when

00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,310
you're an expert you get all the

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,840
benefits to come with that expert and it

00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:06,460
sounds like I'm trivializing what it

00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:09,160
takes to be an expert that trust me I'm

00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:11,020
not I'm really not as long as you if you

00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,910
can understand if you use Symphony and

00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:14,230
you can understand exactly what goes on

00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:16,600
under the hood then you're an expert in

00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:18,910
Symphony and when you're an expert in

00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:21,940
any project or framework it has a huge

00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:24,880
benefit in your career effectively

00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:26,650
contributing can help you to earn more

00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,440
money and that's a fact

00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:31,180
and it's kind of frowned upon in in

00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,000
these kind of community events to talk

00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:39,040
about money it's like oh but honestly I

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:41,170
really like money and I learn in more

00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,790
money now because I started contributing

00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:44,020
to open source than I was before I

00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:46,000
started to really country

00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:49,420
and that's a fact that's an absolute

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,740
fact when you contribute home towards

00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:52,690
you also make connections for the other

00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:54,580
contributors which is also really cool

00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:57,550
because those connections are really

00:32:54,580 --> 00:33:00,640
valuable to employers as well so if

00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:02,470
somebody says to you oh you know how

00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,510
this works in monologue but you can say

00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:05,500
no but I know Geordi fairly well I can

00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:06,520
probably ask him and get an answer

00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:09,030
fairly quickly

00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:11,020
then there's value in that to employers

00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:12,970
so this is another way where you can

00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:14,500
learn more money by making these

00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:16,210
connections at the events you're in or

00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:19,360
making connections to open source and

00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:20,830
that's really cool in valleys I was

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,450
surprised when I realized just how

00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:26,830
valuable these connections are to

00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:28,990
employers more importantly I guess is

00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:31,540
that the connections I've made to all

00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:33,580
them sources come on to become real

00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:35,260
lasting friends friends I make an effort

00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:37,630
to go and see even outside of

00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:39,400
conferences are outside of PHP or

00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:44,530
development you know and there's no

00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:46,000
value on that really let's be honest so

00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:47,770
yeah if we go back to add spruce things

00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,300
that kind of had a downturn and I had a

00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:51,460
three month notice period to work when I

00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:55,210
gave my notice so I ended up laying some

00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:56,260
meme roms anyone know this one not Daley

00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:59,980
Thompson is a good guy

00:33:56,260 --> 00:34:06,190
track-and-field yeah soccer field an

00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:08,590
excellent game yeah I started working

00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:11,230
for a company called roll roll this kind

00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:13,179
of how we describe wolf a high-end

00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:15,130
consultancy I guess for Zen framework

00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:17,740
Zen framework doesn't have a consultancy

00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:19,060
brand attached to it like Symphony house

00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:20,860
fence your labs you know there's nothing

00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:23,260
there for centering work so we started

00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:25,380
our own company and and it was this guy

00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:27,250
who I met the PHP Northwest who

00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:28,840
persuaded me to come and work for him

00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:31,330
which is the best thing I ever did an

00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:34,090
amazing company to work for amazing team

00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:36,190
of developers including Marco Marco

00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:39,490
Parvati as I call him I know his name's

00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:42,100
professor sorry James had come my go-to

00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:44,440
guy for a beer when I'm when I'm at any

00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,700
conference and I need to chill out James

00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,810
is always there for me there's a food

00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,190
people at conferences they're always

00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:51,100
there for me when I need to be it to be

00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:55,860
fair remember when I said Michael's

00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:55,860
always watching you there he is look

00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:02,050
darah graph ends another good go-to guy

00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:03,760
for me for a beer and also Derek world

00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:04,900
XD bug and dead time so there's that in

00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,540
my back pocket when I need those

00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:09,730
questions answered it's all good and

00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:12,730
Kyra McNulty who's speaking here this

00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:15,040
conference who's another go to be a

00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:16,780
person and maintains PHP spec so when I

00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,150
have questions about that I've got that

00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:21,369
too there's a really interesting piece

00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:22,119
of trivia about Kieran and where are you

00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:24,160
clear on account

00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:26,050
oh right there in front of me hello

00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,510
there's an interesting piece of trivia

00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:30,460
about Kieran which I'd like to say is if

00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:31,600
you google so if you would say right

00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:33,850
than a slide deck and you needed a

00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:36,369
picture of t1 to put in a a top from

00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:38,080
card and you did a Google image search

00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:40,750
on Kieran's name you get a very

00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:44,530
interesting result so here's a Google

00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:47,730
image search on keel and then if you

00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:47,730
can't see it I'll give you a hint

00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:52,990
so some reason is a picture of me

00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:54,340
pulling a bad face drinking a pint of

00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:59,109
beer when you google image search for a

00:35:54,340 --> 00:36:01,119
keyword that's kind of scary yeah we're

00:35:59,109 --> 00:36:04,450
back to the main room so I would love to

00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:06,280
say at this point that lifer grover got

00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:08,800
terrible and I started playing my mom

00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:11,200
says plainly not who I absolutely loved

00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,910
working at rules I'd go back there in a

00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:16,780
heartbeat if you know the situation of

00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:18,160
it was needed but because of everything

00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:21,220
that I've done or before we move on

00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:24,460
anyone know this game raff Sam yeah yeah

00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:26,260
one of my favorite rules it would have

00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:28,660
taken a pretty special company to come

00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:31,119
and let me move move on from rule and

00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:33,400
that company came with an offer for a

00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:35,350
developer advocacy job JetBrains the

00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:41,940
company I work for now makers of fine

00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:41,940
IDs how many people use phpstorm whoa

00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:48,180
I'm web beg any any IntelliJ IDEA counts

00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:50,560
guy yeah that's a lot of people

00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:52,240
interestingly my job is like really

00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,760
weird I'm a developer advocate which

00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,630
means like I get tweets like these

00:36:53,760 --> 00:37:00,010
pretty often

00:36:55,630 --> 00:37:01,960
I'm good old CRISPR but yeah it would

00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:03,970
have taken a pretty special thing Cal

00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,650
Evans who I met many times are events

00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:07,540
and of would be interface between Jeff

00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:09,520
brings amiright again I only really got

00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:10,900
the job because of people I knew and I

00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,630
only knew these people because of my

00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:15,400
contribution to open source it's so

00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:17,290
important to think there's a path for me

00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,880
being on this stage talking to you at

00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:22,540
this amazing event from this first ever

00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,840
pull request and it's not you know it's

00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:27,400
a direct path I'm not saying this is

00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:28,720
anything but a very obvious path between

00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,880
me it's not that contribute to open

00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:33,099
source and me getting the job of my

00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,930
dreams which I absolutely love and it

00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:38,920
will be really cool if you know I'd love

00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:40,660
to end my my amazing talk there and have

00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,040
a standing ovation and everybody goes

00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:44,470
off and drinks beer that will be awesome

00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:48,460
but I'm not going to yet so I'm sorry

00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:50,050
and because there's only a few more

00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:51,070
minutes so bear with me I know everybody

00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:53,770
wants to attack the bar

00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:55,480
and but there's a few other things that

00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:57,430
need to be said so we've talked about my

00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,950
career and my love of money and which is

00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:02,290
legendary but there's other things to be

00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:04,540
said because it's not actually all about

00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:08,260
the beer and and the hot dogs and the

00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:10,000
money before I started working in Alton

00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:11,380
Souls I was living in a tiny town the

00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,510
steelwork in town in south wales

00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:17,859
everybody looked like me everybody spoke

00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:19,210
like me it's awful who laughed when I

00:38:17,859 --> 00:38:21,730
said that

00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:24,010
everybody spoke like me you know I was

00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:25,300
guilty of living in a very small minded

00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:27,880
small town environment

00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:29,590
I was I was living in a community where

00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,880
anyone different you know maybe a

00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:32,530
snigger behind your hand and have a

00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,510
little laugh and a joke and that's not a

00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:36,370
nice thing to admit but it's the truth

00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:38,530
you know I'm getting out there and

00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:40,630
meeting new people has opened my mind

00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:42,550
amazingly and it improved me as a person

00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:44,350
and as a really important aspect to

00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:46,270
think about to everyone in this room is

00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:48,310
doing it you're all here at events and

00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:50,500
asked like one of the best things that's

00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:52,300
ever happened for me and it's also

00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:55,120
important to think that it's not about

00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:57,310
the beer and the hot dogs oh hello the

00:38:55,120 --> 00:39:00,990
hot dogs and the elephant and the money

00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:03,930
of course and too much PHP are you a

00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:07,570
year ago not last earlier before I met

00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:11,410
this big fat jerk Chris arches the

00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:13,420
testing advocate Mikey said enemy if

00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:16,030
anyone knows what I mean the man I love

00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:17,260
the hate on Twitter but really nice to

00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:19,510
run into Chris but kind of more

00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:23,200
importantly and I'm sure Chris won't

00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:24,310
like that but I met a dinkler who has

00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:27,610
been touched on in this morning's

00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:29,520
keynote and I saw his talk where he

00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:32,410
spoke about mental mental health in

00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:35,110
mental wellness in the tech community I

00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:36,520
mean amazing revelation for me moves me

00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:38,380
to tears when I was out there because

00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:40,840
I've been keeping something deep down

00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:43,950
inside I know I suffer with anxiety

00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:46,060
quite badly myself so to see edge

00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:48,130
standing up on that stage and openly

00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:50,740
talking about it made me say it's my

00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:52,330
realization where I live in Swansea now

00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:53,620
you know there's still a lot of stigma

00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:55,690
around mental health issues and

00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:57,010
discussing mental health issues I had

00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:59,410
issues I didn't even discuss with my

00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:01,660
wife my parents my my closest friend so

00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:03,250
to be able to actually get treatment for

00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:05,170
that which I'm getting treatment now and

00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:06,760
have that life-changing experience

00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:09,160
because I'm at a conference is an

00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:10,810
amazing thing if you need more

00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:12,400
information about a spas Niehaus dog

00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:14,410
come on finally at any point in the

00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,700
conference so I can always talk to you

00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:20,680
about that stuff but that's really

00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:23,110
really amazing so yeah it turns out it

00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:25,540
is actually about the beer and the hot

00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:28,930
dogs it's about the elephants and the

00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:31,750
bumper count more importantly it's about

00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:37,720
the money and the friendships

00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:39,460
I mean open-source has changed my life

00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:41,170
and I know that's a really grandeur

00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:42,040
statement to finish on but it's the

00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:44,260
absolute truth

00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:46,300
it really has from that moment that I

00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:48,310
first stumbled into an IRC channel it

00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:50,320
started incessantly asking horrible

00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:51,790
questions for people it's it's changed

00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,980
my life in ways that you can't imagine

00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:55,900
so I urge everybody to get involved I

00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:57,490
really do I'm there's plenty of people

00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:59,350
who can help you most of the speakers of

00:40:57,490 --> 00:41:01,390
this event will be more than happy to

00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:03,790
