Title: PHP UK Conference 2017 - James Mallison - Websockets and Torrents: A match made in PHP
Publication date: 2017-04-03
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2017
Description: 
	Websockets are a technology allowing bi-directional communication between the server and the client and are not often the topic of focus when it comes to writing standard web applications due to their architectural complexity and learning curve required. This talk is the story of my first real project involving sending torrent data from the server to the browser so I could build my own Torrent Web GUI. What is an event loop? How does it work? How about authentication when using both HTTP and Websocket requests? How do I make my code non-blocking? These are some of the topics covered from both a theoretical and a practical standpoint. I also talk about security and privacy and how not to get caught when setting up a server designed solely for streaming Ubuntu downloads.
