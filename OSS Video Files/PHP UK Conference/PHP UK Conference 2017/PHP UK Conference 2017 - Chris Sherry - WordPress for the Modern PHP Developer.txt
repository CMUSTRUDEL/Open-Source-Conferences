Title: PHP UK Conference 2017 - Chris Sherry - WordPress for the Modern PHP Developer
Publication date: 2017-04-03
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2017
Description: 
	Chris has a love-hate relationship with WordPress, but whether you like it or not, it powers 26% of the Internet. Many of these projects have outgrown their humble beginnings as blogs or websites and are now highly customised web applications. However the modern tools we use as PHP developers can be tricky to utilise with the popular blogging platform. This technical talk will guide you through how to make the use of Git, Composer, and other tools familiar to PHP developers within your WordPress install - and help you take back control of your themes, plug-ins, database and environments in a growing application.
