Publication date: 2017-04-03
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2017
Description: 
	Static analysis tools checks PHP code without running them. Fully automated, they bring expertise to review the code, enforce good practices when programming, keep code ready for the next PHP version. PHP 7 has developed tremendously our capacity to audit code - thanks to AST and return types, it is possible to go deeper and prevent more bugs. During this session, we'll review the current state of static analysis tools, learn what they can find for us, and how to integrate it in the development cycle - security bugs, migration incompatibilities, directives recommendations. Simply said, better PHP coding.
