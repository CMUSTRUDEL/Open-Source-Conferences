Publication date: 2017-04-03
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2017
Description: 
	Modelling by Example is a set of practices that combine BDD (Behaviour Driven Development) and DDD (Domain Driven Design) techniques to create a workflow that directly drives code from a starting point of user requirements. We will see how a simple feature can be defined via conversation with stakeholders, captured as automatable requirements, and expressed directly in the object model using tools such as Behat and PhpSpec.
