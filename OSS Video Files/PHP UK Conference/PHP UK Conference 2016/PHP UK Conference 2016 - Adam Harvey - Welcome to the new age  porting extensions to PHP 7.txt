Publication date: 2016-03-17
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2016
Description: 
	While PHP 7 largely managed the delicate juggling act of maintaining backward compatibility for userland developers, extension developers will find that many of the APIs they've relied on since PHP 4 have either changed significantly or been replaced entirely in PHP 7. In this talk, I'll discuss porting PHP 5 extensions to PHP 7, techniques for maintaining compatibility between both versions, and the best ways to test across a matrix of PHP versions.
