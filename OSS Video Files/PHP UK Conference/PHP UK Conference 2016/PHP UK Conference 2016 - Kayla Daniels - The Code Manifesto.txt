Title: PHP UK Conference 2016 - Kayla Daniels - The Code Manifesto
Publication date: 2016-03-16
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2016
Description: 
	The Code Manifesto is a set of values, created in hopes of guiding our community towards a place that is welcoming, safe, and empowering to all. Currently, our communities are greatly lacking in diversity, and sometimes outright hostile towards the minority members that we do have. In this talk I try to illustrate that problem, and also cover WHY it matters, and finally what we can do to help fix it.

	00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:10,160
my name is Kayla Daniels that's my

00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:14,389
Twitter handle I am a software engineer

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,730
i work refinery29 in manhattan and i'm

00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:18,289
also a mommy it's pretty important if

00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,940
you follow me on twitter i'm either

00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:24,919
usually talking about software or my

00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:26,119
kids so what to expect from this we're

00:00:24,919 --> 00:00:30,050
going to talk about community and

00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:33,290
quality and diversity will cover what

00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:38,300
the problem is why does it matter and

00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:40,280
what you can do so diving right in what

00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:46,550
is the problem that the code manifesto

00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:49,519
talks about this quote for me from lyric

00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:50,960
on us in 2014 and yes it is completely

00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:54,440
legitimate to quote yourself in your

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,179
slides the industry that I work in is

00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,129
not the industry that I want to work in

00:00:56,179 --> 00:01:00,800
it's not to say that I don't love my job

00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:03,980
I don't love what I do I absolutely do

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,600
love those things but there is a lot of

00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:10,130
things that are currently wrong with our

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:13,700
industry in a nutshell we're grossly

00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:16,990
lacking in diversity minority members in

00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:20,180
our community are often filtered out and

00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:22,580
vastly underrepresented I'll give a

00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,560
small caveat to this a lot of this talk

00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:27,500
is going to talk about gender diversity

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,780
I have a pretty large amount of

00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:33,740
experience in that I've been a woman for

00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:35,870
all my life there's a lot of other

00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:38,180
different kinds of diversities that are

00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:39,680
grossly lacking as well I'll touch on

00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:43,400
that a little bit but i probably don't

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,720
give it as much coverage as it needs

00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,960
just because i don't have a lot of

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,370
personal experience with that so it's

00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,200
not to say that those kinds of diversity

00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:55,220
aren't just as important this just

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,810
happens to be my personal experience so

00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:59,180
the problem that I as I say it is

00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:02,060
twofold we have a pipeline problem and

00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:04,490
we also have a culture problem so the

00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:07,220
pipeline problem has to do with not much

00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:09,200
diversity coming in the diversity that

00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:12,700
does come in we have a severe culture

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:16,340
problem and so they get filtered out

00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:19,080
with the pipeline

00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:21,989
this is a fairly somewhat old slides

00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,420
from 2010-2011 I couldn't find any more

00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:26,760
recent sets but we're looking at twelve

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:31,700
percent of cs bachelor's degrees going

00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:34,890
to women in the u.s. twelve percent

00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,060
these are stats and i'm going to go

00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,980
through them a little bit quickly but

00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,220
these are from major tech companies

00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:43,040
you're all familiar with them and the

00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:50,130
trend that you see here from twitter

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:51,720
facebook google yahoo and apple all the

00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:54,630
sets very little but apple i think is

00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,280
the best as far as gender diversity but

00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:59,310
you're looking if you look at all of

00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:02,370
these graphs we are looking at vastly

00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:03,959
male vastly white demographics that's

00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,930
what makes up the majority of our

00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:10,830
industry you know Twitter we're looking

00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:13,709
at n % in tech Facebook post a whopping

00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:16,620
sixteen percent Google's at 18 yahoo

00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:19,769
comes in at 15 and then Apple at 22 and

00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,420
these are all sets from to 2015 so these

00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:23,970
were their diversity reports that were

00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,620
put out last year there are a number of

00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,900
other companies that I didn't include I

00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:31,049
think slack is actually looking at

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:33,480
twenty-six percent diversity which is

00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:36,060
kind of unheard of a little bit i mean

00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:40,940
it's high and that that at twenty-six

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,940
percent being high is pretty gross but

00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:46,410
are these numbers really the problem or

00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:49,160
are we just looking at a symptom and i

00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:53,120
would say that it's really a symptom and

00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:55,290
this starts a lot further back then now

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,730
further back then when we're established

00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,280
in our careers or even just starting in

00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:04,079
our careers how far back are we going to

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:06,450
go legos these are some really awesome

00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:09,810
lego sets I don't currently own any of

00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:12,690
these but I wish that I did and if you

00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:15,750
notice all of these are very boy centric

00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:17,880
they're marketed boys now I do have a

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,700
female friend that is a huge lego

00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,520
fanatic she owns like multi thousand

00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:25,470
pieces of Legos but for the vast

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,400
majority when you're looking for girl

00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:32,240
toys this is what you get

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,300
it's a nauseating wall of pink and as I

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,900
mentioned I'm a mom I have two boys and

00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:41,389
a girl and my daughter loves playing

00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,630
with building blocks and Legos and when

00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:48,199
she does it she's normally going to get

00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:50,120
minecraft or Star Trek or Star Wars and

00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:52,190
different kind of LEGO sets and she

00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,690
likes that just smudge but she's asked

00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:56,180
me a number of times why there aren't

00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:58,400
more girl Legos why there aren't more

00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,410
things that she would want to do why

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,100
aren't there Monster High Legos or you

00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:07,250
know doll Legos there are some there

00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:09,590
normally for the the younger crowd

00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:11,870
there's the the bigger building block

00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:14,530
Legos but for the most part girls toys

00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:17,330
that you're seeing or nurturing dolls

00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:19,940
plaisance they have a lot of cleaning

00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:21,680
and playing house toys for girls and

00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:24,320
when you walk into a store you're hit

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,110
with this overwhelming just barrage of

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:31,490
pink it's very nauseating and

00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:32,780
disorienting at least for me so the

00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,520
building blocks and why this is

00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,990
important building blocks and other toys

00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,940
like that help build your

00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:40,550
problem-solving skills and your spatial

00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:44,539
reasoning skills so from a very young

00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:47,599
age we are conditioning our children to

00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:50,150
for our young boys we're conditioning

00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:51,710
them to solve problems and have spatial

00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:55,580
reasoning and our girls we conditioned

00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:58,070
to be more nurturing and a lot of this

00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,539
is done unwittingly I did this for a

00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,639
long time and I never really saw it as a

00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:04,370
problem until I started thinking about

00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:10,729
it why is this a social norm why is it

00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:12,500
acceptable the other side of it after

00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:14,120
you know we've killed with the

00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,130
conditioning and we deal with people not

00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:20,199
coming into our industry once we get

00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:23,720
them here we have a huge culture problem

00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:27,800
so with that culture problem we have two

00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:29,780
kinds of discrimination the first kind

00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,930
of discrimination that you see is gross

00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:35,590
and dangerous the other side of that is

00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:38,900
that it's usually really easy to spot

00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:40,880
these include death threats right

00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:43,190
threats hate speech

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,470
I don't know if you guys see the same

00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:47,960
stuff that I see on twitter but i have

00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:52,240
opened twitter and seen tweets directed

00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:56,870
at women people of color that are

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:59,420
disgusting heartbreaking i have been

00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:03,680
really lucky that that's never happened

00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:06,590
to me and it's sad and gross just to say

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,950
that I'm lucky that that's never

00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:12,350
happened to me but I can think of what

00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:14,600
that would be like you know I like

00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:16,040
Twitter I like social media I like it

00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,570
when my phone goes off and like a

00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,490
someone said something to me on the

00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:21,530
internet that's exciting let's go see

00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,420
what it is could you imagine what it

00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:25,220
would feel like to have that little gay

00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:27,710
phone went off let's go Jack and then

00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:31,790
someone threatening to cause you

00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:34,580
physical harm um to cause physical harm

00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:36,380
to your family for really no reason

00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,570
other than the fact that you happen to

00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:43,400
be born a girl and had the audacity to

00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:45,290
want a computer for a living or be

00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,090
outspoken about the fact that we have a

00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:50,480
diversity problem and somehow that makes

00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:53,960
you the enemy and somehow that makes it

00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:57,140
okay to talk to you like that it's a

00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,730
real problem that but like i said it's

00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:01,040
easy to spot and most people can usually

00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:02,990
say that's wrong you don't normally get

00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,480
too many people arguing that like no no

00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:07,220
great friends are totally okay we all

00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,850
know it's gross if you're a semi decent

00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:12,320
human being you know that that's wrong

00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:15,530
but there's another kind it's more

00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:18,050
insidious and ingrained really really

00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:21,020
hard to spot and it's really hard to

00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:24,290
explain this you will get arguments

00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:25,850
about why is that not a problem and then

00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:28,340
when you try to explain why it's a

00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:34,580
problem people don't get it they don't

00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:36,650
understand so as examples again drawing

00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,300
off of my own personal experience I can

00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:43,219
tell you some lovely things that you

00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:45,500
hear being a girl developer I had

00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:47,570
someone tell me that I was the first

00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,730
woman they'd ever worked with and they

00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:53,980
were really impressed by how competent I

00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:57,260
am this was a compliment

00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:59,090
try explaining to someone how they are

00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:04,010
complimenting you in their mind and

00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:05,900
being disgustingly offensive and I spent

00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:08,810
ten minutes trying to explain to him

00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:10,130
when that was just the stupidest thing

00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:12,860
I'd ever heard come out of another

00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:14,450
person's mouth and they didn't at the

00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:17,240
end of it didn't understand why that was

00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:19,160
why that was a problem and I've told

00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,870
this story anecdotally to other people

00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,760
and about half the time they're like

00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:26,690
wooden he was giving you a compliment

00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:28,280
say thank you know on behalf of myself

00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,810
and I'm we have every other woman that

00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,730
works in our industry or anywhere i will

00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:35,440
not say thank you to someone telling me

00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:39,100
that they're surprised at my competence

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:43,280
you're a pretty good coder for a girl

00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:45,800
again this is compliments absolutely is

00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:48,740
not if you were ever going to talk to a

00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:52,370
woman or anyone and you feel the need to

00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:57,530
qualify for a girl for a woman for a

00:09:52,370 --> 00:10:01,730
chick don't I am not to sound conceited

00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:04,040
I am a pretty good coder for a coder I'm

00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:07,040
a really good developer for a developer

00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:09,290
and everything that I've earned in my

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:13,190
career and everything that I've done I

00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:15,650
did as a developer who happens to be a

00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:19,310
woman they guarantee the fact that I'm a

00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:21,620
woman plays absolutely no consequence in

00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:23,390
my career it doesn't make me a better

00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,370
cutter doesn't make me a word or worse

00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:27,890
coder and I'm sure that being a man

00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:31,280
doesn't make you better or worse being

00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:33,470
white or black or Asian it has

00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:40,060
absolutely no effect on your ability to

00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:43,400
type girls don't like to solve problems

00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:46,820
this wasn't said to me it was actually

00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:49,120
in a video that was one of it was

00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:52,370
TechCrunch covering one of Google's

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,440
girls code initiatives and the

00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:56,300
interviewer interviewing someone said

00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:01,920
girls don't like to solve problems and

00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:07,210
how are you overcoming that what

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:09,730
really what this thing is going a little

00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:10,960
fast um girls make great front-end

00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:15,070
developers because they like to make

00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:19,780
things pretty couple very wrong things

00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:20,890
about this number one girls don't always

00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:23,620
like to make things pretty that's

00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:24,760
obviously really stupid number two it's

00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:26,200
really insulting the front-end

00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:29,880
developers because they do a hell a

00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:33,070
whole lot more than make things pretty I

00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:37,510
couldn't front-end my way out of a box

00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:40,090
I'm really disgustingly bad at it and I

00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:43,660
have the utmost respect for what those

00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:45,640
people do but that's not what I do and

00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:47,860
the idea that that is what I do because

00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:51,790
I'm a woman is offensive and disgusting

00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:54,610
I had the CFO at a small startup that I

00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:57,940
worker worked at come around introducing

00:11:54,610 --> 00:12:00,540
our new accountant and literally said

00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:03,910
this is kayla she makes things pretty

00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:05,920
i'm a senior back and engineer you sign

00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:07,990
my paychecks you have absolutely no idea

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:13,240
what i do for you but it's definitely

00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:15,160
not making things pretty um I've heard

00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,870
other things that I didn't include in

00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,390
here I mean this is just a small subset

00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:23,500
of stuff that you hear every single day

00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:27,280
as a female developer I recently heard a

00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:31,030
quote that angered me to the point of

00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:32,800
like sputtering rage it said it's not

00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:36,790
that women aren't in technology it's

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:40,150
just that they haven't made it yet it's

00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:44,680
gross and offensive and its people

00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:46,690
trying to say good things and so other

00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,430
than my sputtering rage which makes it

00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:51,310
really hard to explain to people why

00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:53,680
they're wrong it's that they think

00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:57,970
they're saying good things and they

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,770
can't fathom how they're not and why

00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:05,650
does that matter why does any of this

00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:06,760
matter what do you do for a living I'm

00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:08,730
going to assume that the great majority

00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:13,750
of people in this room are developers

00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:18,220
I'm a developer what we do is met

00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:20,500
that kind of magic it's exciting think

00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:23,580
about it you sit down at a computer and

00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:26,470
whether you're using them gross nano

00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:29,980
phpstorm whatever you're doing you're

00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:32,380
going to type random gibberish it looks

00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:34,180
like random gibberish the majority of

00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:38,080
the world and I've tried to show people

00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:40,420
source code and it is Greek to them you

00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:43,690
type this stuff on a computer and then

00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:45,970
you've made the internet we make the

00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:48,880
internet for a living that is literally

00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:52,090
magic I remember when I was studying

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:55,510
school and I was learning c and in

00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:57,370
terminal and spending hours bashing my

00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:59,710
head against the keyboard trying to

00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:02,740
figure the stupid thing out the

00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:06,490
assignment was to type my first initial

00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:11,890
with k's so use all case to make the

00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:13,600
letter K took hours I cried and then

00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:15,790
there was at one moment when it finally

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,110
worked and it compiled and it spit it

00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:22,240
out and there was as K made of k's and

00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:24,850
it was the the best moment of elation I

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,410
was hooked it was magic that's what i do

00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:28,990
now there are plenty of times where i

00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:31,480
spent hours trying to solve a problem

00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:36,520
and I'm frustrated I'm angry and I want

00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:38,589
to cry and then it works and it's magic

00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:42,940
every day and that's what we get to do

00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:47,650
for a living they pay us they pay us

00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:49,390
really really well our industry is one

00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:53,050
of the better paid industries out there

00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:57,850
our jobs are really flexible and we're

00:14:53,050 --> 00:15:00,760
in really high demand for instance the

00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:03,510
company that I work for is amazing not

00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:07,240
only we have about forty five percent

00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:10,300
female in our tech department which is

00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:13,900
just it's an honor and a pleasure to

00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:15,400
work in that environment but you know

00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,710
when I got hired I said I'm a single mom

00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:21,610
I have three kids it's really important

00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:23,679
that I be there for all the recitals and

00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:27,589
all of this and all that

00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:30,019
they said okay your stuff on the results

00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:32,299
driven environment you know be there for

00:15:30,019 --> 00:15:34,220
your stand-up whether it's remote or in

00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:38,179
person get your stuff done and then do

00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:40,399
what you do so for as soon as school

00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:41,899
started I show up at nine thirty in the

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,730
morning i leave at one thirty in the

00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:45,949
afternoon to go pick up my kids I pick

00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:47,470
up my kids I'm there for them in the

00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:49,759
afternoon as soon as they get off school

00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:51,709
you know I get to do their homework with

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,929
them and then once they're in bed I can

00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:57,040
finish my job and that's completely okay

00:15:53,929 --> 00:16:00,709
do you think bankers get to do that

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,689
accountants know like ninety percent of

00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:04,309
the world doesn't get to do that and I

00:16:02,689 --> 00:16:06,109
get to say this is what's important to

00:16:04,309 --> 00:16:09,889
me this is what I need for my career and

00:16:06,109 --> 00:16:11,540
people go okay not a problem you

00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:14,540
mentioned we get paid really really well

00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:18,230
and we're in high demand I don't know

00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:21,230
about the rest of you but I have to fend

00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:24,019
off rock rotors you get calls every week

00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:25,519
do you like your job be happy they treat

00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:27,859
you well how are your insurance how your

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,239
benefits you get free lunch what if we

00:16:27,859 --> 00:16:32,959
get cater your lunch give you massages

00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:37,009
we have a nap room seriously this is

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:39,279
what happens to us every day you know we

00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:43,279
live at least you know in America we

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:49,549
have a great majority of minorities that

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:52,189
are you know lower lower paid they're

00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:54,230
not there economically disadvantaged

00:16:52,189 --> 00:16:55,970
it's a problem there's under education

00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:58,220
problems and here we are at an industry

00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:03,339
where we make good money we have high

00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:08,240
flexibility and we're mostly white guys

00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:10,309
that's a problem I've mentioned a bunch

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,010
of times here that I'm a mom because

00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:15,380
it's really really important than me and

00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:18,470
I'm not lying these these are mine all

00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:20,569
three of them it's my youngest Sean the

00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:24,319
little ones my oldest Lydia and then on

00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:27,079
the end his name's Matthew there are my

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:30,010
life they're why I do everything that I

00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:32,680
do and

00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:39,070
I work really hard so that I can provide

00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:40,570
them a life that is good and I want to

00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:44,970
be able to tell them you can do whatever

00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:44,970
you want to do the world is your oyster

00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:51,580
except you little girl you can do

00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:56,980
whatever you want to do but it's gonna

00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:59,290
be hard grow a thick skin kid cuz that's

00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,030
what my dad told me when I little girl

00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:02,740
and I wanted to be in mathletes and I

00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:05,710
wanted to be a science olympiad and I

00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:07,420
got picked on constantly and I would

00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:10,930
come home crying because the kids were

00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:16,480
so mean to me and he would say grow a

00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:21,550
thick skin kid chin up keep going and it

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:24,400
was hard and it was scary and it sucked

00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:28,780
and I did it because I loved it and I

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:31,360
wanted to do it but I wouldn't blame

00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:35,200
anyone who didn't put up with that so

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:37,120
much easier just to not do that I don't

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,610
want to look at my little girl and tell

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,130
her you can do it if you really really

00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:44,560
love it but it's gonna be hard every

00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:45,820
single day and you're gonna have to

00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,160
fight and you're going to have to be

00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:55,080
determined and you're gonna have to not

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:58,900
listen to them every day that sucks I

00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:02,020
refuse to tell my daughter that for any

00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:03,850
of you that have children I am sure that

00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:07,660
you don't want to tell your little girls

00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:09,520
that you know my daughter and I she's

00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:12,520
almost 10 now she'll be 10 in a few

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,680
weeks um we work on Python together she

00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:17,200
has a little Cano computer yeah I know

00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:19,960
it's paisan but that's what it happens

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,750
to have on it and so you know we go

00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,400
through little exercises we do little

00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,440
domain waddling things she's got a

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,480
whiteboard she loves and we'll draw out

00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:31,740
you know relationships and she

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:35,410
understands like everything is an object

00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:40,090
so much fun I want her to be able to do

00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:43,059
that unopposed and unimpeded and right

00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:45,700
now she doesn't get too

00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:47,710
she wouldn't get to it would be hard for

00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:52,210
her every day like it's hard for a lot

00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:57,039
of us most today's like he said she's 10

00:19:52,210 --> 00:20:00,029
so essentially this industry has roughly

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:02,499
eight years seeketh their crap together

00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:04,450
because in eight years from my little

00:20:02,499 --> 00:20:07,570
girl turns 18 and wants to go to college

00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:09,879
or get a job she will be welcomed into

00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:12,700
this industry if she wants to be with

00:20:09,879 --> 00:20:14,529
open arms and nobody better give her or

00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,720
any other little girls the kind of

00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:19,960
treatment that myself and other women

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:24,190
have had to go through the bottom line I

00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:28,379
am invested in this personally we need

00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:31,570
to get better my house does it matter

00:20:28,379 --> 00:20:33,970
invisible my mortgage it's pretty easy

00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:37,869
to see that I'm a woman can kind of look

00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:41,679
at me fairly woman ish it's pretty easy

00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:43,960
to see if somebody's black or Asian or

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:47,019
not white those are fairly visible

00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:49,149
minorities but there are invisible

00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:51,659
minorities that you don't see you

00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:53,799
wouldn't see what someone told you I

00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:58,450
suffer from bipolar disorder and

00:20:53,799 --> 00:21:00,730
depression I started a organization of

00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:04,029
sorts called hack the stigma and I

00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:06,309
talked about these things a lot it's not

00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:07,600
easy to talk about when i talk about it

00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:11,610
so that people know that it's a thing

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,610
then it's okay to talk about it

00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:16,570
sometimes this is easier than others

00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:22,389
sometimes it's really really really hard

00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:27,129
I spent some time in a psychiatric

00:21:22,389 --> 00:21:30,070
facility think the end of 2014 I was

00:21:27,129 --> 00:21:36,999
there for 10 days after an attempt to

00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:40,149
not be alive anymore it sucks you don't

00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:43,119
know how hard it is or could be for me

00:21:40,149 --> 00:21:45,100
to stand up here or maybe for me to get

00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:47,619
up on a random Wednesday and get out of

00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:50,559
bed you don't know how hard it could be

00:21:47,619 --> 00:21:53,470
for someone to just be sitting at work

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,460
or sitting on the other end of a of the

00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:57,580
internet other

00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:59,680
of a stack overflow question or the

00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,090
ender and Twitter you don't know how

00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:06,400
hard it was for them to wake up this

00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:08,500
morning or just to keep trying and you

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,750
don't know if that horrible disgusting

00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:13,600
or even well-intentioned discussing

00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:15,370
thing you said to them is the 9000

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,340
horrible disgusting or well-intentioned

00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:20,860
disgusting thing that they've heard

00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:24,370
she'd be cognizant of that you don't

00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:26,980
want to be you know another nail in the

00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:31,870
coffin or another straw on a camel's

00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:34,060
back you don't want to be that one also

00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:35,830
we have impostor syndrome which gets

00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:38,770
pretty good amount of talk in our

00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:40,750
industry I'm sure most of you know what

00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:43,420
it is it's the feeling that you're

00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:45,760
faking it any success you have is due to

00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:48,070
luck and you don't really know what

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:51,940
you're doing sure most of us feel like

00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:53,350
this at some point in time but studies

00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:56,170
show that this is extremely more

00:22:53,350 --> 00:23:00,160
prevalent an intense and women in

00:22:56,170 --> 00:23:02,290
persons of color why would that be could

00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,660
be because we're told from like yay high

00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:08,140
that we can't we're not good enough or

00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:09,400
not smart enough for we can't do this so

00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:11,380
of course when it's coming from the

00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,790
outside constantly you're going to start

00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:16,480
to internalize it you're going to start

00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:19,300
to feel that way it's really hard you

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,990
know for myself I've been a single mom

00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:25,450
pretty much most of my career I worked

00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:27,670
really hard I'm fairly successful and

00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:29,590
they're still day is from like no idea

00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:31,870
what I'm doing I've got all of these

00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:32,950
people fooled doing really well at that

00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:34,270
but someday they're going to wake up and

00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:36,400
all of this is just going to fall away

00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:41,010
because I don't deserve it it didn't

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,010
earn it I just locked my way into this

00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:46,600
we have something that I like to call

00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:48,910
the worth it scale so when we start out

00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:51,550
you graduate from college or your you

00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:54,550
get your first job and you have a scale

00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:57,940
I think all of us have this scale pros

00:23:54,550 --> 00:24:02,320
and cons of being in this industry first

00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:03,730
aproape get the magic the yay super

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,230
passionate we love our jobs are going to

00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:06,550
get up every day and do it we're

00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,820
actually one of the only industries I

00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:09,650
can think of that you work and

00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:14,150
our day and then you go home and you do

00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:17,200
it again for fun this is great love it

00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:19,430
I'm going to do it for fun and for free

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,800
learning constantly learning this

00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:23,180
changes all the time this is one of the

00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,280
things that I love most about our

00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:28,100
industries that it never gets stale

00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,990
never gets old in fact if you're not

00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:32,210
constantly learning you're going to fall

00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:34,190
behind you just have to constantly be

00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:35,870
getting better and that's amazing you

00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:39,350
don't get bored you could not possibly

00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:41,420
give ord doing what we do and you for

00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:44,360
solving problems constantly like that

00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:45,710
it's fantastic so you start out and

00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,420
you've got your pros way up here and

00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:51,380
everything's exciting and wonderful and

00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:55,720
then people start to disrespect you it

00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:58,280
gets tiring and you're being harassed

00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:02,600
then you start to doubt yourself and

00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:03,890
eventually you get this women are

00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:07,340
leaving around a straight nearly two

00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:10,100
times the rate of men so not only are we

00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:12,110
having trouble getting them in once we

00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:14,960
get them in at our whopping twelve to

00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:19,460
sixteen percent females in our industry

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:21,710
versus males we can't keep them you

00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:23,090
fight an uphill battle to get in here

00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:26,320
and then you get in here you realize

00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:29,270
what did I work so hard for their mean

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:33,380
and then they leave and they go do other

00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:35,660
things where people aren't so mean so

00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,860
what we do to fix that it's all good and

00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,300
fine to talk about the problem till

00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:41,330
we're blue in the face but we have to do

00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:46,190
something to fix it this is an a woman

00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:49,610
problem it's not a minority problem even

00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:54,440
more it's not a man problem either it's

00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:58,280
not all on men to fix this this isn't

00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:00,020
everyone problem all of us we're all

00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:03,800
suffering from it and we can all help to

00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:05,960
fix it so there are a couple would I

00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,670
call anti solutions similar to

00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:11,030
anti-patterns we've all heard of those

00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:14,120
sorts of things they look or sound

00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:15,830
really good just great this is a all

00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:18,260
purpose fix I'm going to do this and

00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:20,570
then the world will be better does it

00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:23,170
actually work like that and usually

00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:26,680
causes more harm than

00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:29,840
so there's the shiny uniform syndrome I

00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:31,280
wrote about this actually before I wrote

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:35,590
the code manifesto it's kind of what

00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:39,710
spurred it on i am not a shiny unicorn I

00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:42,110
get lots of people that offer me jobs or

00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:44,090
scholarships or perks because I'm a

00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:46,640
woman because I'm a shiny even a corn

00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:48,350
and that I mean I understand that you're

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,120
trying to solve the problem you're

00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:51,830
trying to be diverse but treating us

00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,350
like we're special shiny unicorns is

00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:57,710
kind of annoying it a little bit

00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:59,780
offensive in my opinion of kitty gloves

00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:01,730
I've gotten this a lot I used to sit

00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:03,290
through code reviews you know our small

00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:05,110
team at our Center puts it down in a

00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:08,930
room and we do group code reviews and

00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:10,460
you know the senior back and male

00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:12,920
developer would put his stuff up there

00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:14,330
and the manager this is awful and this

00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,460
is bad and what were you thinking and

00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:18,620
are you stuck that's not the best way to

00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:21,140
do a cult review its kind of wrong

00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:24,950
anyway I would put myself up there you

00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:25,910
go well and I see that you tried and I

00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:29,120
understand where you're trying to go

00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:30,860
with this no my code was just as crap as

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,290
the other guys crap they just tell me

00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:38,390
that it's crap don't go easy on me being

00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:40,550
in be gentle no one to make her cry girl

00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:42,940
fiying programming this you see a lot

00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:45,350
and it's a personal pet peeve of mine

00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:46,820
google goes out there and says we're

00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:48,050
gonna do this you know get young girls

00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:53,900
into programming will teach him how to

00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:55,160
make bracelets what's excuse me and it's

00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,690
great I mean I understand you're trying

00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:59,840
to appeal to what they want to do but

00:27:56,690 --> 00:28:01,790
girls want to solve problems normal

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,490
problems just like boys want to solve

00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:05,720
problems all same problems I don't you

00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:07,460
don't need to teach them how to make

00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,130
bracelets teach them how to solve

00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:12,140
problems get them to go to the same kind

00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:17,000
of hackathons these you teach little

00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:21,650
boys there's no difference quotients

00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,720
quotas are bad you're terrible don't do

00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:26,000
it you can have a goal to increase

00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:29,270
diversity at your company you can make

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,780
an inserted effort to do that don't say

00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:34,130
we need thirty percent women so we're

00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,040
going to hire thirty percent women

00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:36,330
whether

00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,790
fight or not words we're going to get

00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:43,620
thirty percent in there speaking quotas

00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:45,810
I would not ever accept a speaking

00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:48,630
position or stand on a stage in front of

00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:53,190
people knowing that they were filling a

00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:54,840
quota I can't be the girl quota I don't

00:28:53,190 --> 00:29:00,660
think any woman out there would fill

00:28:54,840 --> 00:29:02,220
that quota because a good majority of

00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:04,800
the time people already think that I

00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,660
don't deserve to be up here gotten that

00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,820
a number of times I don't want to

00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:14,580
reinforce that by being up here to fill

00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:17,450
a vagina quota it's offensive you don't

00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:20,220
need to be a minority to in Tower us

00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:21,930
which is you know kind of good since a

00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:25,950
great majority of our industry happens

00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:28,800
to be white guys you guys can can be

00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:32,460
there just as much and have a voice just

00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:34,980
as much to help empower minorities and

00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:39,150
do that through advocacy empowerment

00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:41,790
encouragement there's a fine line

00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:44,190
between being an advocate being

00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:46,830
encouraging and being condescension

00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:49,560
they're being condescending so you need

00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:51,240
to make sure that you're not being

00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:53,430
condescending not doing the kitty gloves

00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:56,040
not doing the shiny unicorn thing but

00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:58,620
essentially the best way to do it it's

00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:01,940
kind of revolutionary you're going to

00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:04,740
talk to minorities like their people

00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:08,100
take genuine interest in them like their

00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:09,690
people in fact you have to treat them

00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:13,910
absolutely no different than if you were

00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:19,110
talking to a white guy just be nice

00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:21,590
that's really huge step as a code

00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:26,010
manifesto this is something that I wrote

00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:29,400
in the middle of 2014 and I was trying

00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:31,170
to address these problems trying to kind

00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:34,350
of codify a way to maybe make them

00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:38,670
better and it is specifically written to

00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:41,700
be values in that actions I had actually

00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:43,490
the first version of this that I wrote

00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,420
was do and do not do this don't do that

00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:46,759
and I should have read of mine and he

00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:50,329
said you know it's a lot easier

00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:52,219
get people to maybe except values and

00:30:50,329 --> 00:30:54,099
incorporate them into their lives and

00:30:52,219 --> 00:30:55,969
telling them what to do and not to do I

00:30:54,099 --> 00:30:58,940
thought that was really smart so I

00:30:55,969 --> 00:31:01,369
rewrote it its values not actions there

00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:03,199
are eight values I'm actually started

00:31:01,369 --> 00:31:07,159
out as six and then there's been

00:31:03,199 --> 00:31:08,749
community contributions because it is

00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:12,409
open source on github you can make full

00:31:08,749 --> 00:31:14,239
requests to major thinks respects and

00:31:12,409 --> 00:31:15,529
giving back these are things that I

00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:17,449
think are really really important for

00:31:15,529 --> 00:31:19,249
our industry and will help solve part of

00:31:17,449 --> 00:31:21,949
these problems so number one

00:31:19,249 --> 00:31:25,759
discrimination limits us I've talked a

00:31:21,949 --> 00:31:28,309
lot about that in this pretty obvious if

00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:30,109
you're immediately disqualifying half or

00:31:28,309 --> 00:31:34,879
more of the population it's nothing

00:31:30,109 --> 00:31:37,809
short of insane boundaries are really

00:31:34,879 --> 00:31:40,459
really important so boundaries honor us

00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:42,469
they're healthy everybody is different

00:31:40,459 --> 00:31:44,799
what bothers me doesn't necessarily

00:31:42,469 --> 00:31:47,329
bother another person what bothers you

00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:49,639
might not be on my radar as being a

00:31:47,329 --> 00:31:51,139
problem so it's important to remember

00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:53,659
that everyone's boundaries are different

00:31:51,139 --> 00:31:54,589
and if someone brings it to your

00:31:53,659 --> 00:31:56,929
attention that you're stepping over

00:31:54,589 --> 00:32:00,979
their boundaries you should pay

00:31:56,929 --> 00:32:04,459
attention to that we are our biggest

00:32:00,979 --> 00:32:05,949
assets so a great many of you I know in

00:32:04,459 --> 00:32:09,649
this room contribute to open source

00:32:05,949 --> 00:32:11,239
thank you you know you're helping you're

00:32:09,649 --> 00:32:16,159
giving back to the community that is

00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:19,249
really important none of you were born

00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:21,440
brilliant no offense but I promise you

00:32:19,249 --> 00:32:24,529
none of you including myself we weren't

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:27,619
born just out of the box you're you know

00:32:24,529 --> 00:32:31,399
the next Steve Jobs even Steve Jobs

00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:32,779
wasn't born brilliant we've been helped

00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:36,979
along the way they've been people who

00:32:32,779 --> 00:32:39,949
came before us that led the way and it's

00:32:36,979 --> 00:32:41,659
important to return that favor there's a

00:32:39,949 --> 00:32:44,629
lot of ways to do this write a blog

00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:46,429
Stack Overflow to a screencast you know

00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:48,919
Google hangout straight to YouTube makes

00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:50,569
our really simple you can stand up here

00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:51,709
like a great many people are going to do

00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:54,049
over the next two days you can give a

00:32:51,709 --> 00:32:56,209
talk and share what you know you can

00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:57,829
write or contribute to open source it

00:32:56,209 --> 00:33:00,720
have makes that really easy it's pretty

00:32:57,829 --> 00:33:03,360
nice we are also resource

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,130
for the future so not only should we be

00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,530
helping each other we have to remember

00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:10,169
that the people who come after us we're

00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:13,440
going to look up to us so be really

00:33:10,169 --> 00:33:15,240
cognitive that cognizant of that you

00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,559
guys are role models believe it or not

00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,059
people are going to come after you and

00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,909
look up to you people probably already

00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:23,700
do look up to you so we should be worthy

00:33:20,909 --> 00:33:25,440
of that and we should make ourselves

00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:30,210
resources to those who are going to come

00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:32,400
later respects defines us pretty simple

00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:36,360
kind of silly that these sorts of things

00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:38,909
need to be said the golden rule make all

00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:41,970
of your conversations from a point of

00:33:38,909 --> 00:33:44,970
respectfulness one thing I like to do

00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:47,820
when having conversations ask myself is

00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:49,440
this true necessary is it constructive

00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:51,510
there are plenty of things that we can

00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,450
say that they're just flat-out not true

00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:57,450
um lots of things we can say that don't

00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:59,820
really need to be said and they're great

00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:03,000
many things you can say that it's not

00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:04,679
helping anyone anything less than this

00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,629
should really be in tolerated by all of

00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:12,359
us all of our reactions require grace so

00:34:09,629 --> 00:34:16,530
I've seen this a great many times we

00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:18,300
like to do this somebody says something

00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:20,849
stupid on the internet and all of a

00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:22,710
sudden grabs a pitchforks burn them with

00:34:20,849 --> 00:34:28,190
fire they're the most terrible person on

00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:30,659
the entire planet no you know honestly

00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:32,429
things are really you know people say

00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:34,020
really stupid things sometimes there

00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:37,320
will intention sometimes they're really

00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:39,389
legitimately jerks regardless treating

00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,849
them with respect being constructive

00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:43,710
means not directly turning it up to 11

00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:49,589
and just freaking the hell out right

00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:52,639
away opinions are opinions your opinion

00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:56,250
is not fact your opinion is your opinion

00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:58,950
let's be aware of that this was actually

00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:00,330
one of the first because as I said it

00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:03,180
started with six this was the first

00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:05,520
contribution from the community it came

00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:09,240
from gentleman on Twitter his name's

00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:10,910
artisan goose um so he wanted to add

00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,680
this this is a quote from him on why he

00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:14,329
submitted it

00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,530
because it encourages an environment

00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:17,180
where people understand that every

00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:19,130
person is different in more ways than

00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:21,170
one so we should understand that

00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:25,369
opinions again are not fact and should

00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:27,470
be respected the newest one is to err is

00:35:25,369 --> 00:35:29,559
human and that kind of goes hand in hand

00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:31,430
with so don't turn it up to eleven

00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:34,099
everyone's going to make mistakes

00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:35,990
sometimes they're just mistakes we all

00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:38,660
need to be able to make mistakes and

00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:39,619
this is really important if you fear

00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:41,720
that you're going to say something

00:35:39,619 --> 00:35:45,260
stupid and the world is just going to

00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:47,300
explode then you're not going to say

00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:48,650
stupid things and we all need to be able

00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,839
to say stupid things because that's how

00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:52,940
we learn and you can say stupid things

00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:54,680
respectfully and say you know what I'm

00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:56,800
ignorant in this area and I don't really

00:35:54,680 --> 00:36:00,140
know what's going on or why this is a

00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:02,540
republic an you help me understand this

00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:04,339
but if we're scared to say those kinds

00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:08,720
of things and no one is ever going to

00:36:04,339 --> 00:36:12,109
learn hatred really very rarely inspires

00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:15,109
gross if you go immediately from someone

00:36:12,109 --> 00:36:18,049
made a mistake to you're the stupidest

00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:19,760
most horrible person on the planet no

00:36:18,049 --> 00:36:21,589
one's going to say okay well I should

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,690
become better for that very rarely will

00:36:21,589 --> 00:36:26,000
people say that usually if somebody

00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:27,260
tells you you are the literal worst your

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,710
immediate response is gonna be a little

00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:32,109
scream forget it just stop not gonna

00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:34,730
grow you're not going to consider

00:36:32,109 --> 00:36:36,319
generally that's not a good way to get

00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:37,819
people to change their minds or they are

00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:42,140
their outlooks it's a good way to make

00:36:37,819 --> 00:36:44,089
them angry supporting this isn't enough

00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:46,040
you can go to code manifesto calm and

00:36:44,089 --> 00:36:48,140
you can pledge support for this there's

00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:51,470
a list of people on the website who have

00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:53,180
done so that's not enough that's really

00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:55,520
cheap and easy to do go type your

00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:57,440
twitter handle in click Submit you

00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,210
support the code manifesto I really

00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:03,290
appreciate that and thank you for anyone

00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:06,530
who is signed but it's not enough live

00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:08,359
it remember it keep it top of mind I do

00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:11,270
this which is you know kind of easy

00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:13,430
because I wrote it but when I'm having

00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:14,990
interactions online or in person I try

00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:18,710
to think about these things like I keep

00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:24,110
it in front and center in my mind as

00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:28,770
much as possible other things you can do

00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:32,430
stand up every single time when you see

00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:34,890
somebody being questionably intelligent

00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:37,230
whether it's good intentioned or not say

00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:38,640
something about it and this can be

00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:40,290
simple things I mean when you see the

00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,470
overt aggression you can say that that's

00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:46,200
not acceptable when you see the kind of

00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:47,640
just well-intentioned stupidity you can

00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:51,660
say like hey you know that's not good

00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:53,850
that's not cool um I personally get

00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:55,620
really annoyed when people say man up at

00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:57,090
work I mean some people at work to say

00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:59,220
that all the time and it really annoys

00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:02,460
me and so every time I'm like that's

00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:05,820
pretty sexist shouldn't say that don't

00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:07,350
do that it's annoying steamed up every

00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:09,180
time make your voice heard let people

00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:12,020
know that that's not okay don't just you

00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:14,730
know sit there and let it go unanswered

00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:17,850
no your own bias this is pretty

00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:19,940
important when I started this I thought

00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:22,080
I was completely unbiased and no problem

00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:25,680
and then I started thinking about it and

00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:27,420
I was at one point in a hiring position

00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,490
of sorts i did a lot of interviewing for

00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:32,970
a company that I worked for and I

00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:34,530
noticed that any time an old an older

00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:36,090
gentleman walked in i would immediately

00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:39,450
thank like oh he probably looked page

00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:42,960
before doesn't know new stuff clearly

00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:45,270
this is going to be you know close you

00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,190
know open close this is done and i

00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:48,630
realized that that is no better than me

00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:50,010
walking into an interview and people

00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:52,170
saying like clearly she doesn't know

00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:54,300
what the hell she's doing and so i had

00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:56,850
to face that and and really own the fact

00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:58,770
that i wasn't as you know

00:38:56,850 --> 00:39:00,480
open-mindedness and close to as I should

00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:02,820
be and then I worked really hard to get

00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,220
over that and change you know the way I

00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:06,570
thought about things and it's it wasn't

00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:09,140
true just like it wouldn't have been

00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:12,660
true for the people who think that of me

00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:15,630
own your privilege this was really hard

00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:18,870
for me to you know I grew up in a

00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:21,600
trailer park i clawed my way up from you

00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:24,030
know being super poor as a kid to having

00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,650
a really successful career and being

00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:27,120
able to support my kids by myself it's

00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:29,760
really hard for me to think that I am

00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:32,910
privileged nobody gave me anything I

00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:35,490
worked for all this this is mine it's

00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:36,900
not true I may be a girl things may have

00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:37,800
been really hard but you know I'm a

00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,260
white girl

00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:44,270
life has been easier for me just because

00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:47,790
of that and it's hard to to own that I

00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:49,830
heard an analogy if you think of

00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:52,140
everyone for instance sitting in this

00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:53,700
room and put a trash can up here and

00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,590
give you all pieces of paper and ask you

00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,490
throw in the trash can everyone in the

00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:59,220
front row is going to think that's

00:39:56,490 --> 00:40:00,990
difficult and you will not realize that

00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:03,210
it's more difficult for the people

00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:05,270
behind you because you can't see them so

00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:07,920
it's easy to think that your struggle is

00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:09,810
the only struggle it's the hardest

00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,970
struggle when really in fact there's

00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:16,410
rows of people that behind you that it's

00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:17,880
even harder for so own the fact that you

00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:19,620
know you have privileged there are

00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:23,820
people behind you and that there are

00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:27,420
things that we can do to help them and

00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:31,020
you know things like this are the first

00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:33,950
step to that none of this is a solution

00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:36,900
if we had a solution we wouldn't be here

00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:39,390
but these in my opinion are steps that

00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:42,750
we can take to make it better to get

00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:44,460
these industry ready for for my little

00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:46,320
girl and for all little girls that are

00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:48,870
going to come later for all minorities

00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,400
to make it easier to be here and to make

00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:55,080
it more welcoming for anyone who wants

00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:57,450

multilingual I speak English poorly but

00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:21,810
there I think half close to a dozen

00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:24,240
different translations for anyone who

00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:26,100
speaks other languages if you speak a

00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,920
language it's not on there please submit

00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:31,010
a translation i'll happily merge that

00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:34,070
