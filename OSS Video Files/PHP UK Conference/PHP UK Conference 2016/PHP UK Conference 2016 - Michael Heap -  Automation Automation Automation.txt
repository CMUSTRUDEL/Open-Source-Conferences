Title: PHP UK Conference 2016 - Michael Heap -  Automation Automation Automation
Publication date: 2016-03-16
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2016
Description: 
	A good rule of thumb to have as a developer is that if you have to do something three times or more, you should automate it. Imagine that a task takes you a minute to do, twice a day. Now imagine that you could write something that does it for you, but it would take an hour. Initially, you'll have lost an hour, but after the first month you'll be breaking even, as you've saved those two minutes per day. Then after the second month, you've essentially gained a free hour. Automation is a developer's best friend. Some things are easier to automate than others, but almost anything can be automated. In this talk, we'll take a look at what can be automated, what tools are available to help us and crucially, *if* we should automate it. Surprisingly, sometimes the answer to the question "should we?" is "no".

and Michael I am M heap on Twitter if

00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,900
you want to say nice things about this

00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,340
talk if you want to say bad things come

00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,830
a fact me afterwards let's not put on

00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:19,160
the internet and I'm a developer with a

00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:22,970
company called ed sift a ditch shift we

00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,890
process huge volumes of information and

00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:27,110
we started out by having one guy sitting

00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:30,619
over me dit item-by-item but that didn't

00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:33,440
build a scale so we automated it and we

00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:36,710
thought omitting this what else can we

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:41,300
get away with so this is my my

00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:43,219
experience about automating simplest

00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:47,329
things to the most complicated things we

00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:48,890
could find a couple of facets to

00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:51,409
automation we're going to cover them

00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:54,050
today we're going to start by a take a

00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:55,699
look at what automation is we're going

00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,760
to go through a step by step guide to

00:00:55,699 --> 00:01:00,129
automation importantly we're going to

00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,120
talk about making automation

00:01:00,129 --> 00:01:04,330
institutionalized it's not good knowing

00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,450
how to do it if you're not allowed to

00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:09,829
we're going to think outside the box

00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:13,789
it's very easy to automate the simple

00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:15,939
things but there's a lot more to it once

00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:18,649
you're convinced we're going to live

00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:21,680
we're going to learn how to automate

00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:23,180
things and finally we'll take a look at

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,619
a couple of useful tools they'll help

00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:31,310
you along the way but first there's an

00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:34,789
xkcd there's an xkcd for everything and

00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:36,289
this is one my favorites it shows you

00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:38,450
how long you can spend automating

00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:41,240
something I still get a pair back within

00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:44,539
five years if something takes an hour

00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:47,060
every week generating spending reports

00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:49,789
for the boss if that's X and out of a

00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:55,310
week you can spend 10 full days working

00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:56,899
on that ten days and so long as you run

00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:59,229
it every week it will pay for itself

00:01:56,899 --> 00:02:01,640
within five years

00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:07,100
you can spend ten days automating an

00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:11,259
hour's work but skc do you say let's

00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,259
just dive straight in what is automation

00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:18,820
a lot of people think that automation is

00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:21,580
something that it's automatic it doesn't

00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:24,670
necessarily have to be take this

00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:28,600
command-line tool for example does

00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:32,020
anyone have any idea what it does not

00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:34,320
mean either I made it up but well if I

00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,510
did this

00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,740
this is automation

00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,630
you've automated where the command line

00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:44,620
parameters you don't need to type them

00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:47,170
you don't need to know them Automation

00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:50,350
is a way to abstract a task to reduce

00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:51,910
institutional knowledge and if it

00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:57,550
decreases the time it takes to run it

00:02:51,910 --> 00:03:01,360
that's just a nice side effect so I

00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:05,200
ultimate not one reason why we should

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:08,020
alternate these people and when I say

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,390
people I mainly mean myself because

00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:15,580
people to have the best intentions but

00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:18,060
no time they don't have tests and when

00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:23,170
they do have tests they don't learn them

00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:25,600
same goes for documentation but perhaps

00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:28,930
the most important thing is the people

00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:31,120
are not deterministic they can do the

00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:33,340
same thing twice and get two different

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,250
outputs isn't this what computers were

00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,660
invented for you give them an input it

00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:41,380
gives you an output it's gonna be same

00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:43,420
every time you do it but well the

00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:48,370
reasons do you have other than people

00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:49,959
not being deterministic what about you

00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:53,770
want to make more money with less effort

00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:56,020
who doesn't want that but if your

00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:59,170
company wants less overhead in the day

00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:01,239
to day work that you do or perhaps it's

00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,890
less work focused and you just want to

00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:05,650
spend more time with your partner with

00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:10,330
your kids or if you like me playing

00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:13,560
League of Legends but still not get into

00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:17,980
the call of it for me

00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:20,850
automation is all about fear the fear of

00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:23,169
doing something in case you break it

00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:26,800
thia costs money

00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:30,460
it makes people necklace it leads to bad

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,960
decisions and bad productivity if people

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,409
are scared of making a change they won't

00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,560
do it

00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:37,060
you'll never progress by automating the

00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,530
scary things we can increase

00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:44,379
productivity and happiness in our

00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:45,629
development teams Automation isn't about

00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:50,110
being lazy

00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:51,669
it's about being efficient and if that

00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:58,150
gets us to the pub half an hour we run a

00:04:51,669 --> 00:05:00,669
flair there who might complain so we

00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:02,439
should automate everything right like

00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:06,099
the salt we've seen all the reasons that

00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:09,099
we should no you definitely shouldn't

00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:12,159
automate everything you need to feel the

00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:14,560
pen I have a great example of this I

00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:17,169
once worked in a team what if something

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,830
would learn fine for about three weeks

00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:22,300
and then the server will crash and it's

00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:24,729
because the program on there wasn't

00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,099
clearing up file descriptors and it will

00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:29,620
run out and so for crashing they go in

00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:31,240
and fix it so instead of fixing the

00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,289
actual issue we went in and we added a

00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,669
cron job that we started every four days

00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:39,819
if it's the issue but I it's bad

00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:42,879
automation anything where you need to

00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:45,699
feel the ped you need to feel it you

00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:47,289
really need to get in there it wants to

00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:49,029
keep you awake at night you need to fix

00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:55,210
it that is not a valid use case for

00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:56,439
automation this most debatable but if

00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:59,169
we're gonna put it in here anyway

00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:01,240
I don't like automated security or grids

00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:03,400
I want to know what I miss dawned on my

00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:07,779
box what I need to restart we had the

00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:09,159
big G webzine update installing the

00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:11,770
package wasn't enough you had to restart

00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:13,569
all the processes that you step if you

00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:16,870
automated that was to say that you won't

00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:18,189
have downtime security upgrades are

00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:23,139
something that I personally would not

00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:26,370
omit the general rule is anything you

00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:30,060
need to see that shouldn't be automated

00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:30,060
don't learn them in a cron job

00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:37,139
so if that's what we should have what

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:40,199
should we automate everything else

00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:43,660
deployments reporting regeneration

00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:49,169
anything anything you can think of if

00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:52,030
it'll save you time do it now

00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:54,759
sure we've all got that one person my

00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:57,479
company who says no automation is

00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:01,960
rubbish I don't like it

00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:04,930
people that say things like my system is

00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:09,340
too complicated to ultimate we've all

00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:12,789
read it before if that's true you have

00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:14,860
bigger problems start thinking about it

00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:17,669
decompose your system into smaller parts

00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:20,500
that you cannot omit those pipelines

00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:23,050
things did it output data that feeds

00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,240
into another part it's easier to test

00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:29,080
the smaller unit of card it leads to

00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,639
less coupling moist level card less

00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:36,460
coupling and moist devil card that is it

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:39,070
opens for extinction another common one

00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:43,120
that here is we don't have time to

00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:45,430
automate close enough but if you don't

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,860
have time now you're never going to have

00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:50,380
time it's a short-term pain for the

00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:52,270
long-term game you need to put in the

00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:58,479
effort now to reap the rewards in the

00:07:52,270 --> 00:08:00,880
future so I can see it in all your eyes

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,560
you saw them automation you want to you

00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,340
won't leave right now

00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:07,990
just get the keynote you want the gun

00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:15,219
you understand alternating things you

00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:17,280
fire it up when should we ultimate we

00:08:15,219 --> 00:08:19,570
need to know when it's applicable to

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,860
automate it's not good going out

00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:22,240
tomorrow and saying hey this looks good

00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:26,139
let's automate it because it may not

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,930
have a real business value for me I

00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:31,930
automate it as soon as it makes sense to

00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:34,209
invest the time if something takes a

00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:37,930
minute to do I might wait until I fill

00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:40,029
me a dozen times and then at some point

00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:41,500
I know it's gonna be a regular thing and

00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:43,420
I'll start looking at how to automate it

00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:47,029
down to a few seconds

00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:49,370
more complex things I might have it in

00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:51,380
in mind when I'm doing the first time I

00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,120
may be thinking this feels like the kind

00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,800
of thing that is sufficiently evolved a

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,130
magma enough they shall be automating

00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:02,660
this if that's likely to happen I'll

00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:04,310
probably automate it as I build it this

00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,529
conference talk for example this is the

00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:08,060
first time I'm giving it but you know

00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:09,680
that the next time I'm going to get the

00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,240
video I'm gonna sit in the front row and

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,810
I'm gonna watch it with you because hey

00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:16,070
I've done the effort if you can do it

00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:18,290
more than once and it takes a

00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:24,130
significant amount of effort automate it

00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:26,810
so I promised you a step-by-step guide

00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:28,970
this is gonna feel a little little bit

00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:31,700
counterintuitive for an automation talk

00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:36,290
but the first step is to do it by hand

00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:38,120
and this is very important make notes

00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:40,339
the notes are the most important part

00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:45,170
but you need to understand what you're

00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:48,140
doing before you can automate it once

00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:49,910
you have those comprehensive notes you

00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,100
know exactly what you did you copied and

00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:55,000
pasted every command into a text

00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:59,080
document then the next time you do it

00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,630
you automate the first part it could be

00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:05,150
again weekly avoiding if the first part

00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:07,460
of your weekly reporting is to fetch the

00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:10,460
data from a production database just

00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:13,280
thoughts to make that point and then

00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:15,260
once you've got the data run the reports

00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:18,740
by hand do whatever you need to do email

00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:21,760
it on and then the week after you do it

00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:25,130
again you automate the second part you

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,050
have the first point done the data is

00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:30,589
just there he's free you don't have to

00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:35,060
invest any time now producing the report

00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:37,280
that's free you've automated it and if

00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:39,920
you follow this step by step you will

00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:42,980
automate your entire florrum until it's

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,390
all automated and then on Friday

00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:48,020
afternoon all you have to do it's gone

00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:49,910
plus a button something used to take you

00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,380
an hour has been built up bit by bit you

00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:54,680
didn't need to sit down and say hey I

00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:56,300
need 10 hours to do this you just did it

00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,310
piece by piece

00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:01,490
and now it's all automated it saves you

00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:03,650
time every week at this point you still

00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:06,290
livin it yourself that's very important

00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:08,660
you need to keep an eye on the data make

00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:10,670
sure it's accurate because you

00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:13,100
ultimately think it's gonna do the same

00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:16,360
thing every time that's that's great if

00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:18,500
it's right but terrible if it's wrong

00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,510
and then once you're confident in today

00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:24,430
so once you know it's sending to create

00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:30,440
data out to people but it's unattended

00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:32,180
put it in a cron job the end goal is is

00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,730
that you never hear about this report

00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:36,590
again because it should just boom in the

00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:39,230
background every week and development

00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:40,520
people get it done on time you should

00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:47,750
hear about it is when something doesn't

00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:51,670
work which is ideal that's all five

00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:55,540
steps it's not that hard

00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:59,530
take a look at the problem do it by hand

00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:02,080
work out what the problem is make notes

00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:05,630
it takes motion curve it an automated

00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:09,230
the first part then the second part it's

00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:11,260
like your job hey you eatin Ameth one

00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:13,700
bite at a time

00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:19,100
topical as you see the little elephant's

00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:20,870
right if anyone's got one I want one by

00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:23,330
the end of it you'll have a fully

00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:25,070
automated system you can just stick in

00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:31,190
the background somewhere and it will

00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:33,770
essentially do your job for you so now

00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:36,170
we have a set of steps to follow we need

00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:40,400
to find something to automate amount of

00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:43,930
ice here you start small automation can

00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:47,780
be quite daunting this is a huge project

00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:49,340
find a small pipe like the reporting the

00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:53,120
fetching of the data from a production

00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:56,360
database and that's a small part that

00:12:53,120 --> 00:13:00,550
you can automate today there are small

00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,550
incremental improvements the rewards

00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:06,970
we're looking for things to ultimate

00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:09,790
start with the whining what do people

00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:14,130
complain about find out what will make

00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:14,130
people's lives easier and start their

00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:21,010
deploying it's too hard like you can do

00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:23,529
that I don't understand it is that

00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:28,060
because your deployment process looks

00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:30,430
something like this they just they're

00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,709
doing different on the desktop they

00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:34,540
might get things that avoid her it is it

00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:35,430
well you're in some way does it's not

00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,630
too bad

00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:39,730
assuming you type divide things which I

00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:41,290
never do but what can we do in this

00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,570
situation how could we make this easier

00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:47,110
people complained about it it's climbed

00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:49,480
through automation these are things

00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:52,899
there is just ignore them but that

00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,550
doesn't get us anywhere we could help we

00:13:52,899 --> 00:14:01,449
could bite a little shell script that

00:13:54,550 --> 00:14:03,790
turns this into this it does everything

00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:06,040
for them it's faster it's more

00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:08,819
predictable and all this doing is

00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,819
running those commands

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:19,389
we've gone from this to this

00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:22,750
start with whining find the pinpoints in

00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:26,260
your organization and solve them people

00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:28,389
might not thank you for it but you're

00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,130
making everyone's life easier there

00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:32,110
today

00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:35,079
I'm giving this example you're actually

00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:36,279
reducing risk in your deployments you're

00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:38,639
making the real difference to your

00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:38,639
company

00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:47,829
so we've got this automation we need

00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:50,509
people to use it

00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:52,639
going back to my deployment example the

00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:54,649
script is better than the old system but

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,749
still not perfect some people are still

00:14:54,649 --> 00:14:58,369
doing it by hand you have an inversion

00:14:56,749 --> 00:15:01,249
for the scripts when else is run in

00:14:58,369 --> 00:15:03,249
version 7 but how do you keep everyone

00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:07,160
on the same page

00:15:03,249 --> 00:15:11,979
we need the centralized automation and

00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:14,720
thankfully this is a solved problem did

00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:20,509
this is continuous integration narcotic

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:23,629
matter continuous integration is out

00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:26,209
there there's tons of servers Jenkins is

00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:28,789
probably the biggest we use core CD it

00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:30,319
really works for us we've got bamboo

00:15:28,789 --> 00:15:33,679
from our last year and circle CIA

00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:35,449
semaphore I could go on there's so many

00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:41,600
there's gonna be one that she's your use

00:15:35,449 --> 00:15:45,769
case continuous integration if generally

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:49,879
used for something to look like this you

00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:53,329
call changes even some tests but you can

00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:55,009
use it for all kinds of things you can

00:15:53,329 --> 00:15:57,229
use it to spin up new service to deploy

00:15:55,009 --> 00:16:01,669
features to or follow the QA team or

00:15:57,229 --> 00:16:02,659
even in production you can use it to

00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:06,019
generate vacuo

00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:07,489
or ad hoc reports instead of putting in

00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:10,009
a cron job put it in the CI system

00:16:07,489 --> 00:16:11,779
everyone can see you someone needs a

00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:16,369
report right now they're going to just

00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:18,409
press the button it's not just for

00:16:16,369 --> 00:16:20,209
builds continuous integration is

00:16:18,409 --> 00:16:22,669
generally thought of a build felt off as

00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:26,720
a build system but there's so much more

00:16:22,669 --> 00:16:28,939
than that the automation systems live on

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:33,259
commands that you specify when you

00:16:28,939 --> 00:16:36,699
specify I can be on demand it could be a

00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:38,509
blanket of intervals at a specific time

00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:42,919
the reason when something else happens

00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:46,059
set up a web hook from github any time

00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:49,069
code changes it will do something

00:16:46,059 --> 00:16:52,239
continuous integration systems are just

00:16:49,069 --> 00:16:52,239
bigger automation engines

00:16:55,050 --> 00:17:01,620
but perhaps the greatest accomplishment

00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:03,640
of continuous integration systems though

00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:06,010
they're not just continuous integration

00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:10,180
systems they're centralized information

00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:12,490
systems anyone can go it provides a

00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:15,670
centralized point of information and

00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:17,110
orchestration I need something I log in

00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:19,060
I can see the last time I deployed to

00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:21,480
production I can generate a report if I

00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:23,800
need it your co-workers can do the same

00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,570
the script signed just hidden away on

00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:29,740
your machine anymore they're accessible

00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:31,390
for everyone the business analysts okay

00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,950
jakey's doesn't look that it but I'm

00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:34,360
sure they can go in click the play

00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:42,580
button and get the report out the earth

00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:45,930
event there's a great side effect of

00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:49,200
having all of this information be public

00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:53,860
it gets people to take notice

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:59,590
think about tests you've got a whole set

00:17:53,860 --> 00:18:01,870
of applications you've got 15 14 if them

00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:05,500
agree and one of them is one of them is

00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:09,100
read if not one can see that does anyone

00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:11,890
care but as soon as you have a lovely

00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,120
green screen on one block of eco select

00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:15,130
people going to jump on that they're

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,600
going to say no that's my screen I want

00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:20,230
you to be green and they're going to fix

00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:24,120
the issue just by making things more

00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:24,120
public people are more invested

00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:36,090
so everything so far has been pretty

00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:40,440
standard automated terrorist continuous

00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:43,940
integration systems reporting point four

00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,940
is all about thinking outside of the box

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,540
this is us we'd have to move for depth

00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:54,540
here it's not for outside the box

00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:58,110
at all but heck we make our own lives

00:18:54,540 --> 00:19:02,190
easier by doing this how many of you use

00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:04,100
in PHP seven okay so this bits only

00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:07,500
going to apply to you

00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:09,210
but da blocks did you know that your

00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:12,990
talk blocks been generated from scalar

00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:17,130
type hints you don't have to make them

00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:19,260
yourself anymore but did you also know

00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:21,930
that there were tools out there that can

00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:24,060
take those dog blocks and January code

00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:28,080
from them you can generate client

00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:29,580
libraries just by writing your code I'm

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,740
working with the artifacts the dog

00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,060
blocks not through another process you

00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:37,290
can automatically generate client

00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:39,240
libraries for your applications it's not

00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:41,960
something that I'd normally think of but

00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,960
it's definitely possible

00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,850
what about core generators most really

00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:51,840
most of them

00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:53,910
Symphony house them laravel cake the

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,850
ultimately common tasks like code

00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:58,290
generation for controllers why we

00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:00,480
mention controllers by hand

00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:03,450
do it tools out there that will do it

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,730
for us it's a solved problem they always

00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:08,250
have the same format initially at least

00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:14,220
anyway so let's something else take care

00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:16,350
of it for you now we can use generators

00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:20,070
for creating and control those new

00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:23,160
entities but before we even get there we

00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:26,610
need to project we can use composite if

00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:29,730
we can say hey composer give me Symphony

00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:32,550
standardization and that gets you post

00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:34,410
of the weather but what about all the

00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,830
other things that we never simply gone

00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,200
out

00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:40,500
I said pipe lines things like golf and

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:43,820
grunt Tesh structures we like to add

00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:46,649
conception tests Bihar tests

00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:48,899
even things like seed data in a database

00:20:46,649 --> 00:20:51,480
you have a skeleton project

00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:53,070
you always have users sign up wouldn't

00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,720
it be great if when you boost truffle

00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:56,309
projects there's already an admin user

00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,059
though they'd have to log in and work

00:20:56,309 --> 00:21:01,710
with things like seed databases make a

00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:05,130
big difference when you're bootstrapping

00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:08,130
projects these are all things that you

00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:10,200
will do anyway these are all things that

00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:13,409
you do every time you spin a project so

00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:20,240
why are you doing it by hand this can be

00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:22,679
automated there is a downside to

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,539
skeleton packages and that's that when

00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:26,340
you notice a book and you will notice a

00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:29,580
bug you've got to fix ten different

00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:32,760
projects rather than one and that's what

00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:35,730
composite packages come in you can take

00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:39,210
the generic functionality abstract it

00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:41,789
out and idea it's a dependency you need

00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:43,320
new functionality great and it's the

00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:45,630
composite package you'll notice a book

00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:48,649
great fix it in the composite package

00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:52,409
then everything else just depends on it

00:21:48,649 --> 00:21:55,620
by the end of it your frameworks and

00:21:52,409 --> 00:21:59,149
your projects should just be the minimum

00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:59,149
called needed for your business logic

00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:09,299
but what if we go even further like the

00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:15,390
boxes all the way down here now and

00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:20,669
we're all the way up here what if we

00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:24,360
think about some more crazy ideas from

00:22:20,669 --> 00:22:26,480
fact I used to play space-based game

00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:29,880
online when I was falling about 15 or 16

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:32,340
it was called the evolution and the way

00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:34,590
it worked is you bought land but your

00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:37,500
first piece was 150 gold you second this

00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:41,399
300 to 450 and so on and so forth

00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:43,830
and when you're banging on one or two

00:22:41,399 --> 00:22:45,480
pieces it's not too bad to do that math

00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:47,480
in your head but once you start getting

00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,710
these thousands it was quite tough and

00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,760
this was about the time that it's all

00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:53,610
called greasemonkey

00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:56,130
Kimmo increase monkeys let's you've run

00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:56,909
user scripts little pieces of JavaScript

00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:00,570
on

00:22:56,909 --> 00:23:02,220
any webpage that you want so we thought

00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:04,590
actually we can have a little box on the

00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:07,559
webpage that tells us how many we can

00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:09,899
buy we can automate that maths we can

00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:13,649
make a formula and have it automatically

00:23:09,899 --> 00:23:17,700
Sean long story short I ended up

00:23:13,649 --> 00:23:20,879
maintaining one single 1800 Lian file of

00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:23,909
JavaScript but I did learn JavaScript

00:23:20,879 --> 00:23:25,919
that's how I learned yes just trying to

00:23:23,909 --> 00:23:28,549
scratch an itch on a space based game

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,549
when I was 15

00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:39,929
what about bank statements we go online

00:23:35,729 --> 00:23:41,849
we could see our bank statement in 18

00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:43,649
months time you say hold on something

00:23:41,849 --> 00:23:46,679
doesn't look quite right here

00:23:43,649 --> 00:23:48,149
you want to go back you say oh damn have

00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:51,899
been when I was in London that PHP you

00:23:48,149 --> 00:23:54,840
care but your bank says I'm sorry we

00:23:51,899 --> 00:23:56,429
only support 12 months of statements

00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:59,729
online if you would like a paper copy

00:23:56,429 --> 00:24:01,200
that would be 15 pounds please what if

00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:03,779
you convert it scripts that every month

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,999
logged in to your online banking account

00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:07,940
downloaded the PDF and put it in your

00:24:05,999 --> 00:24:11,549
box

00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:13,999
it's not a photo of the box but when you

00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:16,080
need it it's gonna be really useful you

00:24:13,999 --> 00:24:21,899
don't have to pay 50 pounds for the

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:25,649
privilege anymore I used to work at a

00:24:21,899 --> 00:24:29,609
startup and we have this really cool

00:24:25,649 --> 00:24:32,639
idea where we were still quite small it

00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:35,669
was slow going but every time there was

00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:37,679
an upgrade on to a pay plan had this

00:24:35,669 --> 00:24:41,399
little speaker plays sound it just went

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:43,470
chi-ching it was wonderful because

00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:46,429
everyone in the office knew that

00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:46,429
mentioned up credit

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,750
yes we could have sent an email out

00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:55,630
because the sensor just the bar size of

00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:57,280
the entire team there's just something a

00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:01,660
little bit different everyone knew that

00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:04,059
that sound Mende we're doing better well

00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:05,980
we are now we don't have that in fact we

00:25:04,059 --> 00:25:07,679
have the opposite now we have a big

00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:09,850
police light attached to the ceiling and

00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:13,929
anytime there's a critical production

00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:15,940
incident that light goes off it's crazy

00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:17,620
you see people flying down the office on

00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,940
scooters trance gets the operations area

00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:22,990
saying what's wrong what's wrong we can

00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:25,780
fix it but it would have been so easy

00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:29,410
just to send an email to the operations

00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:30,820
team but by looking at the automation

00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:32,530
that we had and making it more visible

00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:35,429
to people you get more people involved

00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:35,429
more people to help

00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,970
finally I've mentioned this to a couple

00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:44,860
of people and they really like this idea

00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:48,220
there's a tool called selenium which

00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:52,270
will let you automate web browsers and

00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:54,750
imagine this you press a button and it

00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:56,980
fades up a web browser loads of selenium

00:25:54,750 --> 00:26:01,690
navigates your favorite takeaway and

00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:03,820
nord is your pizza why not

00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:08,200
the tools are there it's just about how

00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:13,630
you apply them your imagination is your

00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:16,150
only limitation so I wasn't sure how I

00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:21,480
wanted to show you this bit because you

00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:21,480
might think I'm a little bit crazy Bert

00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:33,390
let's just do this yep that's fine

00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:36,990
so last year I was making I was

00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:41,220
producing a video series an educational

00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:43,590
video series and I realized that I can't

00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:47,250
talk and type at the same time it's

00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:54,450
really hard so I started to find out why

00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:56,520
it's going to do so this is what I'm

00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:58,140
gonna say this is what I'm going to type

00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,450
this is what I'm gonna say

00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:05,280
this is one common type and what this is

00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:07,680
this example is it's a bowling cutter so

00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:10,200
it creates something that represents a

00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,430
bowling game and invites a test for it

00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,740
to prove that working this initiative

00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:22,500
without an exception being fun really

00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:24,210
simple and I got to thinking if I'm

00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:28,830
writing the script why am I the one

00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:36,060
reading it come to computer do it okay I

00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:39,690
just keep backing relax and talk and

00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:44,040
yeah I can this is a natural terminal

00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:48,390
this is item 2 that is reading my script

00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:49,710
on the right hand side here we're going

00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:51,450
to do Nate what we're going to do next

00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:55,530
is initialize the compost like JSON file

00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:58,050
that's of your vim have any of you knew

00:27:55,530 --> 00:28:00,690
that you could automate of him it has a

00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:04,140
server you can remotely send commands to

00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:07,380
it how many of you knew that you could

00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:09,060
automate oh I didn't until yesterday

00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:12,600
morning when I realized that I didn't

00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:15,560
have a Linux machine but you come there

00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:23,010
are tools for everything Automator on

00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:26,520
OSX x do tool on linux theme house a a

00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:29,100
client-server model and it's just going

00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:32,870
to keep going this takes about a minute

00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,870
and a half 1 minute and 40 seconds

00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:48,679
but look ma no hands it's just doing it

00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:51,650
yourself this was fantastic when those

00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:54,380
doing the video series because now I

00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:57,980
don't have to think about typing all I

00:28:54,380 --> 00:29:01,610
do is I've even my script so then we

00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:03,050
creates a test for that class first test

00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:04,670
we might just prove that we can create

00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:05,470
an instance without an exception being

00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:10,700
filmed

00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:11,809
see how easy days I talk to you you

00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:15,880
might think I'm a little bit and said

00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:19,670
because Oh today you even dream this up

00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:21,020
like what inspired me to think I hey I

00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:23,900
wonder if you can make vim type

00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:27,050
automatically it's not a question that

00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:28,370
comes up every day but just by far

00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:30,490
enough to know and thinking that's not a

00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:33,650
stupid idea like anything is possible

00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:36,770
your imagination is your only limitation

00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:41,480
look about it it passed the test and I

00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:43,640
can go in a lot of them block the test

00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:48,010
it's there I'm I'm talking to and it's

00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,010
not a video it's the actual terminal

00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:06,000
so

00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,220
point five is better actually doing it

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,559
you're convinced you're gonna go into

00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:12,299
the office tomorrow you can say we're

00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,280
gonna alternate I saw this awesome

00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:17,610
conference talk and he's really sold me

00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:21,200
on it you're ready to commit what do you

00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:25,470
need next you need business buying

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:28,860
Automation is hard you need hardware you

00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:31,070
need people give me time you need to be

00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:33,240
ready for hard work

00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:35,490
Automation isn't all unicorns and

00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,850
puppies in fact if you're anything like

00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:41,160
us it will go a little bit like this why

00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:43,350
two weeks in you just you sound out if

00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:46,200
you think you know what this is the best

00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:49,860
thing ever my work lost dropped

00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:51,210
everything's working perfectly then

00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:53,910
about two months in you start to think

00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:57,090
actually this is a little bit harder

00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:59,460
than we thought then six months in you

00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:01,049
start saying things like can we just go

00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,160
back to the week-long test cycle we used

00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:05,460
to have where everyone just drops

00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:07,919
everything and does he bear happened the

00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:10,490
twelve-month said you ship in so much

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:14,390
cool stuff that you've forgotten the bed

00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:17,990
at that point you've done the homework

00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:17,990
everything is awesome

00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:31,070
go for the quick wins what really annoys

00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,350
people that we can fix with minimal

00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:34,430
effort

00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:37,090
that's your first port of call when

00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:40,960
you're looking for things to ultimate it

00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:44,440
when you're doing that keep it quick

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:47,150
focus on immediate feedback sure

00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:50,390
automating an entire end-to-end test on

00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:52,640
Jenkins it's fantastic but if it takes

00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:55,940
18 hours to run people are going to get

00:31:52,640 --> 00:32:01,060
bored not gonna wait see if the test

00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:05,120
past focus on the high value things

00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:06,980
focus on small tests your application

00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:11,270
youko about whether people can log in

00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:12,770
check out pay for things do you really

00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:15,560
care if people can't change the floor

00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:18,650
file picture if your social network

00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:23,090
maybe if you're not ecommerce store

00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:25,400
probably not still test it but when they

00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:27,680
overnight in a nightly job don't have

00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:33,950
that as a blocker if you are dead to

00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:37,490
their belts you need to make sure that

00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:38,600
everyone is on board addict

00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:42,190
I think the continuous integration

00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:44,030
system creates a commitment to testing

00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:47,780
all the developers on your team

00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:52,100
interested in that if the test coverage

00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:54,290
drops does that feel the build yes is a

00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:56,150
knockout sir here but you need to get

00:32:54,290 --> 00:33:02,840
buy-in from everyone involved before you

00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:05,150
made those decisions you need to be

00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:07,000
aware that automation is that you need

00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:12,020
to be prepared to mentor in this work

00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:18,080
chord is called maintaining this

00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:19,220
automation will take time the key is to

00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,490
make sure that the time you spend

00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:25,310
maintaining this it's less than the time

00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:27,290
it saves you if it takes longer to

00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:29,720
maintain then it saves you're doing it

00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:32,870
by hand you in a false economy it's a

00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:35,030
net loss don't be afraid to throw

00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:35,830
something away if it is a little bit too

00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:39,159
brittle and

00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:40,750
doesn't I do what you expect it's only

00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:47,440
worthwhile alternation whilst it's

00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:50,200
saving you time don't skip on you go

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:53,190
handling that's number one on my list of

00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:56,049
automation essentials expect failures

00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:59,950
what happens if halfway through a push

00:33:56,049 --> 00:34:01,720
the network disappears what happens if

00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:03,480
you try and learn something and the

00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,039
current user doesn't have permission

00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:08,500
it's very easy to automate things to the

00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:10,659
happy path you assume that everything

00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:13,570
will work I mean it does it works

00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:15,339
perfectly but when it doesn't you need

00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:17,770
to be able to recover you need to know

00:34:15,339 --> 00:34:20,500
what state your automation script was in

00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:24,190
any diagnostic information especially if

00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:26,950
it's running and it's in a cron job that

00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:29,649
you can't see if it's running in an

00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:31,060
automatic way you need all of that

00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:32,649
information to work out what went wrong

00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:34,919
to fix it and make sure it doesn't

00:34:32,649 --> 00:34:34,919
happen again

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:45,040
I'd important say this one is important

00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:48,010
can I have on this multiple times and

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,050
they'll have the same effect so one

00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:53,310
example is you have a script that

00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:55,720
creates your hosts file on the machine

00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:58,330
and any time a new developer joins your

00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:00,160
team they've run their script and they

00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:02,740
get all of your internal DNS service

00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:05,320
things like that it doesn't matter how

00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:06,400
many times you run that script it's

00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:10,990
always going to produce the same

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:12,820
horsepower it's an important you have a

00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:15,130
script that emails over voucher codes

00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:16,359
for your customers you have a business

00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:19,170
rule that says we're only allowed to

00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:21,880
send it once per day to each customer

00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:24,550
what happens if someone puts a story in

00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,940
the one place in the cron job will this

00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:28,660
end

00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:29,760
every hour if that's the way the use for

00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:33,520
it was written that's what they will do

00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:37,330
Computers do what we tell them to do but

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:38,500
the world ways to mitigate it by storing

00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:40,930
the last time that you sent that email

00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:42,970
and in the script checking the last time

00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:45,400
you can run it every second if you

00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:47,950
wanted to as long as the logic in that

00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,330
script knows that it should only send

00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:52,070
one poder

00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:54,920
if you can run in multiple times without

00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:56,570
having any bad side effects from the

00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:04,820
multiple times having the same action

00:35:56,570 --> 00:36:08,300
every time is that important build on

00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:11,770
the shoulders of giants there's a lot of

00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:14,480
work out they've already for automation

00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:17,710
in the automation world things are

00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:21,860
generally one of three things a fetcher

00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:25,690
100 a scaffold oh we're going to talked

00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:29,480
about all of these fetches a goat you

00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:31,910
say give me check Weaver that's finally

00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:34,850
downloads it puts it in your project but

00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:36,970
when you say give me this specific color

00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:39,470
cell it says okay I'll get the cow cell

00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:40,910
and I says well actually that depends on

00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:45,020
jQuery so I'll get that as well

00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:48,890
it handles dependencies composer it's a

00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:54,710
great example of a fetcher it gets

00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:58,580
things that you need donors they do the

00:36:54,710 --> 00:37:04,790
same thing over and over you know make

00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:06,350
Varick cake they'll find an egg unless

00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:09,830
you've a JavaScript and that nice girl

00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:12,200
from gumm's no that's not like gulp and

00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:14,390
grunt I don't know why they don't end an

00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:16,840
egg there is one called Jake but they

00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:21,470
just like to be a little bit different

00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:23,660
and finally scaffolders also knowledge

00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:25,790
generators we toss babies earlier love

00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:30,410
her husband cake has the same thing as

00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:32,990
them anything you need to do can

00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:34,880
generally be built on top of these if

00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:39,320
you're a low fell developer you may have

00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:41,840
seen Jeffery ways generators package he

00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:44,180
went out he saw the Dalton generators

00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:46,700
are good but actually I find I'm doing

00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:49,520
this over and over again so he built on

00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:51,770
top if the engine that was there he

00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,120
built on top of the scaffolding engine

00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:56,390
that is built into lower felt and built

00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:57,470
his own stuff builds on the shoulders of

00:37:56,390 --> 00:38:00,110
giants they've done the heavy lifting

00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:02,380
you only have to specialized for what

00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:02,380
you need

00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:07,839
now that we have things that can be

00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,599
automated

00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:12,760
how do we trigger those we can go in

00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:14,260
with them on the script by hand we can

00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:17,770
run it in the cron job through

00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:19,569
continuous integration systems but

00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:22,150
there's a couple others as well we

00:38:19,569 --> 00:38:24,190
couldn't pull an endpoint on the web for

00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:27,609
changes we needed web hooks from github

00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:30,819
or we can use something like a sepia or

00:38:27,609 --> 00:38:34,809
if this then that there ought to mention

00:38:30,819 --> 00:38:37,420
engines I can say something that says

00:38:34,809 --> 00:38:41,549
hey if they stand up watch the weather

00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:43,900
for my location if it's forecast to read

00:38:41,549 --> 00:38:46,539
indica wind death send me an email

00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:48,089
before 8 a.m. and I know how to pick

00:38:46,539 --> 00:38:51,039
that I need to pick up an umbrella

00:38:48,089 --> 00:38:54,730
that's automation something that makes

00:38:51,039 --> 00:39:00,460
my life easier it's just a different way

00:38:54,730 --> 00:39:03,010
to trigger those things I mentioned

00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:07,270
visibility earlier visibility is very

00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:10,809
important for anything all the time I

00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:11,380
recommend using graphite draw it on a

00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:14,049
graph

00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:16,150
put on the screen somewhere this could

00:39:14,049 --> 00:39:19,480
be the time at which you deployed lost

00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:22,480
production it could be the number of 500

00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:25,829
responses per minute it can be anything

00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:28,289
that has a timestamp associated with it

00:39:25,829 --> 00:39:31,450
if it's not time-based

00:39:28,289 --> 00:39:36,900
stick it in an email have something

00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:42,460
tweet you put it into YC jabber anything

00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:45,779
so long as you can see it personally I'm

00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,779
a little bit partial to slack

00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:51,680
we send everything slack I have entire

00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,589
channels is dedicated to defense dreams

00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:56,510
I have one channel video shows all

00:39:54,589 --> 00:40:00,050
projects that I'm interested in a work

00:39:56,510 --> 00:40:01,550
the shows or commits or pull requests if

00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:04,609
people are changing projects that I'm

00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:06,260
involved with I'd like to know they're

00:40:04,609 --> 00:40:09,109
not always going to come say hey Michael

00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:10,609
we're making radical changes here but if

00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:12,410
I can see that as soon as we made a

00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:15,230
first commit I can jump in and say Oh

00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:16,910
have you have you considered this like

00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:17,630
what happens with this integration work

00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:21,859
wise up

00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:23,119
I'm visibility is really important all

00:40:21,859 --> 00:40:26,569
of the Challenger shows all the Phil

00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:28,760
builds in the company anytime anything

00:40:26,569 --> 00:40:31,130
goes red it gets put into slack people

00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,300
who are doing their chat in a way they

00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:37,250
don't even have to look for the screen

00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:39,589
anymore it's in the conversation you can

00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:42,530
even trigger things from slack it's not

00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:45,470
just a receiver you can send things you

00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:48,710
can trigger a deployment create a pull

00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:50,750
request there's a framework from github

00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:54,710
called Hugh bot which is fantastic for

00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:55,880
this it's got all kinds of plugins if

00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:58,040
you're interested in it go and have a

00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:00,710
look at the term that you want to be

00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,390
looking for it's chat ops it's a real

00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:04,670
thing

00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:06,559
where people run the entire development

00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:09,049
infrastructure the production

00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:15,770
infrastructure from chatting with a lot

00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:16,849
of robot in their chat travel finally

00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:19,930

00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,930
useful tools

00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:28,220
there's so many out there that discover

00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:32,390
even any of them in reasonable depth

00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:34,040
will be in their tail in new talk but I

00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:35,650
just wanted to give you some ideas about

00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:38,869
what is available

00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:42,140
imagine that you join a company what do

00:41:38,869 --> 00:41:43,820
you need to start doing your job the

00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:47,329
first thing you probably need

00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:49,450
development environment they've they've

00:41:47,329 --> 00:41:51,740
gotten a virtual box perfect for this

00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:54,950
we're really easy way to get up and

00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:56,750
running this works really well whilst

00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:59,770
you need one eye two machines maybe a

00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:02,060
web server and the database server

00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:03,380
developer environments at death's iftaar

00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,910
with a little bit more complicated than

00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:08,570
that you know we're now up to 12

00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:11,329
machines for each developer and vehicle

00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:14,329
wasn't really working for us so we moved

00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:17,650
something called OpenStack which is it's

00:42:14,329 --> 00:42:20,990
essentially a self-hosted version of AWS

00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:23,900
all the vagrant all of OpenStack it can

00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:26,839
be automated they have a API is you can

00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:32,510
automatically create destroy these

00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:35,720
environments on-demand at this point are

00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:38,950
they're just empty machines you need

00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:41,089
something like puppet chef ansible

00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:43,609
you need something to configure those

00:42:41,089 --> 00:42:45,349
systems install the right packages put

00:42:43,609 --> 00:42:49,670
the very conflicts in place tell them

00:42:45,349 --> 00:42:51,589
how to talk to each other by using these

00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:54,530
tools you can define your infrastructure

00:42:51,589 --> 00:42:57,140
is called it can be versioned committed

00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:59,710
to get this between two points work out

00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:02,240
when a package has something changed and

00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:04,250
this condemned even automatically on

00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,660
your vagrant machines and your office

00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:08,980
that machines to provide a complete

00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:08,980
developer environment

00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:15,050
at this point you have an environment

00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:19,640
you probably need something to start

00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:24,860
where to you could yes using an ID for

00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:26,870
development is automation automatic dot

00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:29,360
blocks from skill that happens did you

00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:33,290
have to type it no it did it for you

00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:36,530
it's saving your time well the less

00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:38,870
obvious things like in phpstorm if you

00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:40,670
go in them being a method it will go

00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:43,780
through your corpus and mean them all

00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:49,240
callers of that method as well for you

00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:49,240
this is your ID automating your job away

00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:56,390
there's liquid base for database

00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:58,010
migrations now I don't have a huge a

00:43:56,390 --> 00:44:00,950
huge amount of experience with it

00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:03,470
personally but our JVM teams love it

00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:04,610
they use it all the time it's something

00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:07,340
that we're starting to look at in the

00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:10,880
PHP world in our team there's also

00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:12,980
things like doctorate migrations there's

00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,790
another one called Baloo which I saw at

00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:15,590
or Cartman's

00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:19,420
fosston about which was quite

00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:21,680
interesting just choose something

00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:23,680
copying and pasting sequel commands into

00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,120
production isn't sustainable

00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:31,610
you need something to manage the

00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:34,730
migration process we have called a

00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:37,460
database changes it's time to test and

00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:40,790
package it up use Jenkins teamcity

00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:46,610
go CD use whatever you want just have a

00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:52,490
CI system that produces artifacts it

00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:54,950
produces a zip file an IPM whatever

00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:58,550
however you ship your code it will come

00:44:54,950 --> 00:45:01,280
out of your CI system you can use Amazon

00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:02,960
AWS and its API it's managed integration

00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:07,160
environment stage and environment

00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:08,720
production environments you just need

00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:10,340
somewhere to ship those artifacts so

00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:15,230
that people can play around and test

00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:17,900
them but dear WS API is they're not the

00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:18,920
friendliest thing in the world so you

00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:22,730
probably want to use something like

00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:25,070
terrified terrified is

00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:27,230
company called hash accord unless you

00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:30,350
define the environment in an executable

00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:32,510
format you can define their take VPC

00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:35,540
different subnets different instance

00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:38,570
configurations and have TOA form enforce

00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:43,609
that state for you on the AWS and many

00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:45,020
of the collective riders if you're

00:45:43,609 --> 00:45:47,990
automatically spinning up new resources

00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:50,560
how do you keep track of them you can

00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:52,580
use console for service discovery

00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:56,000
console is another one from hash Accord

00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:58,130
as it is vagrant basically anything they

00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:02,330
touch is gold they have my seal of

00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:04,160
approval when you spin up new things

00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:07,580
they say hey console this is where I

00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:09,440
live I'm on your application boots up it

00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:13,130
says hey console where does the database

00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,840
live it's all about the service it's all

00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:16,520
about the services not knowing where

00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:19,640
each other live and having a central

00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:20,810
point that you can check in with their

00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,760
foundation this is if your database

00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:27,230
server goes down and you have to quickly

00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:28,609
change to a replica con someone handle

00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:31,700
that because your application doesn't

00:46:28,609 --> 00:46:33,859
have a hike audit database you are they

00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:35,600
it was just a console and the next time

00:46:33,859 --> 00:46:40,760
console will give it back the new

00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:42,350
address whilst all these tools are

00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:45,640
available don't underestimate the power

00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:48,490
of a small shell script you've got bash

00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:51,950
you've got Python basically everywhere

00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:56,840
unless you're using census 5 in which

00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:59,090
case you have my condolences but PHP

00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:02,060
Python 2 6 is available basically

00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:03,410
everywhere if you know that you can be

00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:07,160
working on the machine that has PHP on

00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:09,200
it those groups in PHP use the tools

00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:14,600
that you have available they're just

00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:17,540
tools and finally slack again I love it

00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:18,170
it keeps everything visible something

00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:20,720
feels a build

00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:22,250
put it in slack the pipeline that

00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:24,800
rebuilds you staging a van when ghost

00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:26,119
blood put it in slack there's an

00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,930
important meeting that people shouldn't

00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:31,790
miss how Google Calendar put it in slack

00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:34,450
if people are looking at it already get

00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:34,450
it in front of them

00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:41,970
welcome into the end now I hear the size

00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,710
of a leaf but there's just a few more

00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:47,250
considerations for when your vault

00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:50,460
amazing things first they should it be

00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:54,360
automated manual things do have their

00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:56,310
place is your height test say you're

00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:59,700
testing temperature sensors in the real

00:47:56,310 --> 00:48:01,890
world it's easier to just do it manually

00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:04,640
and we're gonna do it less than five

00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:07,440
times anyway so why invest the time I

00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:10,830
wife it's an extreme case that you can't

00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,760
be producing you're in production a lot

00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:13,740
of those probably going to be

00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,360
exploratory work you can be

00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:18,000
investigating what's happened you can

00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:20,550
automate that there are certain

00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:26,870
situations that doing it manually it's

00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:30,390
the best decision security is a huge one

00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:32,880
you need security policies automation is

00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:34,830
wonderful until you talk to your head of

00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,420
security and they say okay so what

00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:39,770
permissions does this user need and you

00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:39,770
say oh it just needs to see everything

00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:45,210
yes they may be read-only but that's

00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:46,800
still dangerous you should have them the

00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:53,040
minimum permissions required to do each

00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:55,910
job pipelines split up through

00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:58,470
automation stages thinking pipelines

00:48:55,910 --> 00:49:03,000
instead of having one lowest job have

00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:05,880
five small jobs first or staging release

00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,770
pipeline and it has five different steps

00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:09,300
what the compiles cookbooks and make

00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:10,770
sure if everything is okay and of one

00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:12,630
that was it's the chef server

00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:16,320
another one of my chef on these staging

00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:20,250
machines if we were then every worth it

00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:23,340
takes about five hours all in all but

00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:26,700
that might be an hour of that is testing

00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:28,200
with the first stage if that passes but

00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:30,720
network gets interrupted in the third

00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:32,880
stage and we could naturally run chef on

00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,170
all the machines do you want to go all

00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,600
the way back to the beginning and then

00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:38,760
all the tests again we knew that they

00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:40,980
passed what's changed it's the same

00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:43,110
codebase we want to be able to be

00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:45,240
started about third point and say okay

00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:47,370
the network went to where but we've come

00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:48,559
D start from where we left off by

00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:50,930
splitting

00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:53,509
large jobs of in smaller ones you can

00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:54,829
save yourself a lot of time you can be

00:49:53,509 --> 00:49:56,630
slight only the stage that failed

00:49:54,829 --> 00:50:01,749
there's no need to repeat the BET the

00:49:56,630 --> 00:50:05,749
bits of the past and last but not least

00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:07,219
implementation details don't expect to

00:50:05,749 --> 00:50:10,910
go out tomorrow and build the perfect

00:50:07,219 --> 00:50:15,920
automation system built for your team

00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:18,619
today spoke with the work floor and then

00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,209
automate it don't go in and say oh hey I

00:50:18,619 --> 00:50:21,799
think we're gonna be 50 developers next

00:50:20,209 --> 00:50:23,809
year so this is what I think we should

00:50:21,799 --> 00:50:25,969
be working like at that point so let's

00:50:23,809 --> 00:50:28,009
automate it that's just not gonna work

00:50:25,969 --> 00:50:30,709
go ahead look at how you currently do

00:50:28,009 --> 00:50:36,670
things look at the actions that you do

00:50:30,709 --> 00:50:40,609
by happened build what your team needs

00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:43,160
do you need an auto scaling group on AWS

00:50:40,609 --> 00:50:44,779
with multiple replicas of my sequel and

00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:49,789
do you need it in multiple availability

00:50:44,779 --> 00:50:51,829
zones or do you need a single ed of us

00:50:49,789 --> 00:50:55,400
instance stick an application on sabbia

00:50:51,829 --> 00:50:59,229
client can check it build what you need

00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,229
and then add the core stuff afterwards

00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:04,549
if I was going to go out tomorrow from

00:51:01,789 --> 00:51:07,729
the start automating something I start

00:51:04,549 --> 00:51:09,709
with notifications even if it's just

00:51:07,729 --> 00:51:11,479
something that announces the time on the

00:51:09,709 --> 00:51:13,549
hour at least thing you've got the

00:51:11,479 --> 00:51:15,079
infrastructure there and when you start

00:51:13,549 --> 00:51:17,689
doing things like report generation

00:51:15,079 --> 00:51:19,189
wrongfully deployments developer

00:51:17,689 --> 00:51:22,699
environment setup you have somewhere to

00:51:19,189 --> 00:51:25,130
push all of that information you can do

00:51:22,699 --> 00:51:27,279
deploy history in tracking anything that

00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:31,339
you do more than once a month

00:51:27,279 --> 00:51:33,349
start with notifications look at the

00:51:31,339 --> 00:51:35,319
problems that you're facing and the rest

00:51:33,349 --> 00:51:39,469
will follow

00:51:35,319 --> 00:51:42,650
so it's summer automation is awesome

00:51:39,469 --> 00:51:45,829
it really is it's a logical investment

00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:50,469
but it pays for itself 10 times 100

00:51:45,829 --> 00:51:52,609
times over thinking pipelines small

00:51:50,469 --> 00:51:54,570
composable tasks that feed into each

00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:57,270
other

00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:59,730
and finally be very careful what you

00:51:57,270 --> 00:52:03,710
alternate there are some things that you

00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:06,210
shouldn't not many but they do exist

00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:06,920
I've been M heap you guys have been

00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:09,720
awesome

00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:11,280
if you've got any feedback I would love

00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:13,800
to hear it I'm trained in as with all

00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,600
the rest of the speakers I'm they've

00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:20,910
probably got time for one or two

00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:27,870
questions yeah any questions straight in

00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:30,690
there not entirely really into the

00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:32,400
automation but do you have a github for

00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:34,430
you know that thing you did with them

00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:37,770
that was fascinating and very impressive

00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:39,420
can we go look at it and so I actually

00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:42,300
wrote it about twelve months ago and

00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:43,620
then put it on bit bucket because I can

00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:46,530
have FIFA laughs and repos and then one

00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:49,320
can see it's horrible cold but I do

00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:51,420
intend on polishing it up a little bit

00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:53,190
or even not polishing it and just

00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:55,400
open-source an accessory go people may

00:52:53,190 --> 00:53:03,470
be interested to having seen the devil

00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:03,470
yeah tweets it out the hashtag anymore

00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:10,190
okay I must have done a really good job

00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:11,900
then now if you do have questions I'm

00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:13,640
gonna be around for the rest of the

00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:15,430
afternoon and evening I'm wearing the

00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:17,780
blue jacket so I should be easy to spot

00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:18,530
I'm just going to say hello and I'll

00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:21,370
talk about anything

00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:21,370
