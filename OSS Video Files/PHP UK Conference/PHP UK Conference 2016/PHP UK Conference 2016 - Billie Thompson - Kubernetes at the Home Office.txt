Title: PHP UK Conference 2016 - Billie Thompson - Kubernetes at the Home Office
Publication date: 2016-03-17
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2016
Description: 
	At the Home Office we had a problem. Hundreds of lines of infrastructure, everyone doing their own thing, and reinventing the wheel. During this talk I'll tell you how we are attempting resolve that using Docker, Kubernetes and changing developer culture. This talk consists of 3 parts. In the first I will introduce you to docker and talk about how to use it to create reusable infrastructure components, then I will talk about how to deploy and manage those components with the open source PaaS Kubernetes, and finally I'll talk about changing our culture using tools and techniques to ensure we keep reusing into the future.
