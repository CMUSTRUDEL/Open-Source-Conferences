Publication date: 2016-03-16
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2016
Description: 
	Many of us have great intentions for giving back to the developer community, yet not all of us act on these charitable aspirations. Using some real-life examples, we will look at several ways you can contribute and make a difference to our community without needing to have hours of surplus time to spare.

	00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:10,080
it's a real honor to be giving keynote

00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,059
my first big talk was actually this

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,950
conference one year ago in the Volt's

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:19,890
downstairs so to go from 200 people to a

00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:22,680
few more than 200 people is her it's a

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:26,610
bit of a bit scary but it's awesome so

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,770
community we all talk about it we all

00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:31,649
know that it's something that's

00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:34,950
important we know that it's vital to how

00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:39,980
for PHP but do we all give it the

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:42,570
support it needs I think without us

00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:46,350
without the people in this room the

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:49,620
community doesn't exist so we're all

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:53,039
responsible for making the community

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:56,460
what it is and for giving back yes

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,010
life's busy you know I've got four kids

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:02,429
and a horse and dog and whatever else

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:05,060
you know life is mental but no matter

00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:08,430
how crazy your life is I promise you

00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:12,960
everyone in this room can make a

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:21,030
difference and the clicks are not

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:23,940
working awesome that's better so Who am

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,400
I my name is Lynn Wiltshire cancers

00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:30,380
there and I'm the director of web

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,380
development for these guys

00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:39,450
before I go on to this next slide who

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:45,380
did see my talk here last year or saw me

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:47,969
a PHP Northwest show of hands uh

00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,070
anyone that did feel free to use the

00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:51,450
next minute or so to tweet how I need

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,850
two points from new material that's

00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:57,780
absolutely fine so I've worked with PHP

00:01:53,850 --> 00:02:00,210
for about ten years I'm still involved

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,380
in a hands-on role which is awesome

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,970
because of the director of development

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,979
it basically means like to pick all the

00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:09,000
good projects I actually first learn PHP

00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:10,910
definitely program embassies there was a

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,530
book called PHP for the World Wide Web

00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:15,150
Cutler's by Larry almond it was a quick

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:19,530
start but I late me know if they still

00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:22,590
publish those do they know anyway if you

00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:25,140
ask me the devs in my department are

00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:27,810
incredibly lucky because you know I'm an

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,360
awesome facilitator fact and I'm a great

00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,400
leader if you spoke to those guys

00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:39,569
however they might say more like this

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:41,760
guy yeah so anyway obvious question here

00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:45,750
who feels here that they give back to

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,519
the community yeah I've saved fair few

00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,260
they like the fact that you're coming to

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,750
a conference means you obviously care

00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,280
enough you care about your development

00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,920
and you care about the community enough

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,799
to be here so you know I am probably for

00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,350
reaching to convert it so I guess the

00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:05,310
more relevant question is who feels they

00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:08,819
could give back more that's pretty much

00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:10,019
every single hand here awesome so just

00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:13,319
have a thing yourself for a moment

00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:14,880
perhaps why do you feel that you don't

00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:17,130
give them back as much as you could do

00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:20,519
or why'd you feel you could contribute

00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:22,799
more there can be a number of reasons

00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:28,200
but I think from my experience at least

00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:30,599
it boils down to two main points being

00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,579
too busy we touched upon this at the

00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:34,950
start you know we're probably all

00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:36,599
fellows from time to time I know that

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:39,269
getting up and running on a new project

00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:40,889
takes time it takes time to read through

00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:43,519
the documentation understand the

00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:45,449
contribution guidelines understand their

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,930
coding standards if they're different

00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:48,180
what you're you

00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:49,739
do perhaps you don't have time to you

00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,170
know pull down the project certainly if

00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:54,150
you're in taxes terrible as mine and

00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:56,340
just getting up to speed with the

00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,680
project to be in a situation to be able

00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,540
to contribute does take time and perhaps

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,579
you know you've just got other things

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,799
going on perhaps you've got a partner

00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:07,469
perhaps you've got kids god forbid maybe

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,870
you've even got a project a hobby that

00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:14,430
doesn't involve computers when that be

00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:15,569
mental but those things all add up so

00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,310
you know you might have the best

00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:19,410
intention I you're right this this year

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,789
this is the year i am going to give back

00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,500
i'm going to pull that project out of

00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:24,780
get I'm gonna make some pull requests

00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:28,740
then the world will be better and it

00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:31,139
doesn't happen who's found this at one

00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:35,729
point or another in their career again

00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:38,400
most people this is the other common one

00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:42,930
this was kind of what was talked about

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,280
this morning so you look at the people

00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,419
that are contributing to those projects

00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,430
you look at who the project maintainers

00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:49,889
are got this little voice in luck your

00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,720
head and it's going there's no way I'm

00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:53,520
good enough there's no way I can

00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,460
contribute there's nothing new i can add

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,330
and to be honest I'm more my submissions

00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:01,740
to be laughed at the door for being crap

00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:03,570
you know i'm not going to treat hands at

00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,250
this time because that's completely

00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:08,220
unfair but i'm sure there's a lot of

00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:09,900
people going you know what yeah well i

00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,030
know i feel that like that multiple

00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:15,440
times a week so I'm sure I'm not the

00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:19,650
only one I have got a secret to tell you

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:22,979
you might not realize it but if if you

00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:25,740
do have that voice in your head if you

00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:28,409
tell yourself you're not good enough you

00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,599
are lying to yourself no matter if

00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:32,400
you've got two months experience or if

00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:34,949
you've got two years experience all your

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,949
name is Rasmus then you have something

00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:39,570
to contribute just the simple fact that

00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:41,789
you're here today the fact that you

00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:44,430
spent the last two days learning about

00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:46,979
PHP expanding your knowledge talking to

00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:49,110
other developers and getting your ideas

00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:51,690
exploring areas that that you perhaps

00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:55,889
haven't got as much skill in means that

00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:57,349
you have knowledge and ideas the people

00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:59,699
who aren't here don't

00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:04,440
you have something that you can take

00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:05,759
away and give back to those people think

00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,860
about when you started out as a

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,539
developer remember your first few days

00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,460
and you're like you know HTML entities

00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:12,960
without an underscore HTML underscore

00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,819
entity underscore decode with

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,970
underscores is it needle haystack and

00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:24,659
haystack needle case or a saw I saw what

00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:27,509
the guess what someone starting out

00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:28,770
today has those exact same feelings

00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:31,860
they've got that going through their

00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:34,469
head they've got this entire brain of

00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:37,050
mash up of all the weird and wonderful

00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:41,460
decisions that PHP is made through the

00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:42,960
years you have that experience you know

00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,699
what it's like to go through that in

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,469
that sense that actually i would say

00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:48,330
someone who's been doing this for

00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:50,219
perhaps not so long has more to give

00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,650
back in that way then someone's been

00:06:50,219 --> 00:06:53,789
doing it for a while because as

00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:56,430
developers and specifically as PHP

00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:59,159
developers we have this weird ability to

00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:01,770
take all that pain and anguish and kind

00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:05,880
of lock it somewhere deep dark inside it

00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:07,889
doesn't come out very often so you do

00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:12,120
have sent to your back you aren't good

00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:15,300
enough and besides giving back doesn't

00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,279
have to be about contributing coat both

00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:21,449
these arguments kind of sprout from that

00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:22,949
that we kind of somehow assume that in

00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:24,990
order to be given back to community you

00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:28,229
have to be writing code and contributing

00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:30,710
code and this isn't the case saying that

00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:35,279
that draw lead touched upon yesterday

00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:37,710
yes of course giving back can be in the

00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:39,300
form of contributing code and there are

00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,590
plenty of project main tenants in here

00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,060
that would love for you to be doing that

00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:44,279
so if I didn't say that I'd probably get

00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,889
beaten up afterwards but it doesn't have

00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:48,560
to be I mean I've taken a look at the

00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:51,090
inner workings as I left before and

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,729
after getting really really confused and

00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:55,080
probably crying a little bit I realized

00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:56,849
there's no in hell I'm going to be

00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,129
contributing to that project anytime

00:07:56,849 --> 00:08:01,680
soon I then looked at as LF tunes out of

00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:05,339
3 and new fairies and worse but there we

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,680
are but there are plenty of other ways

00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:10,000
that you can be giving back ways you can

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,540
be making a difference without

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,650
writing code so we've already said but

00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,600
we don't necessarily have all the time

00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:18,940
in the world to do this so let's focus

00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,680
on that we have manic lives of course a

00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:24,130
day but what if i had said to you could

00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:26,290
you find 15 minutes i would imagine that

00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:28,870
most people probably could find 10 or 15

00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:31,780
minutes maybe that's 15 minutes during

00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:35,169
lunch or if you're like me you press

00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:39,060
snooze a couple less times if you can

00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:42,370
find 15 minutes what can you do with it

00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:46,000
who here has used stack overflow or any

00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:48,820
other stack exchange sites yeah pretty

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,330
much everyone yeah most of us have used

00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:55,230
them probably at least once probably

00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:58,300
many many times but have you also

00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:00,370
answered questions on their answering

00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,980
other developers questions doesn't take

00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:04,210
long to do you know it can be certain if

00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,570
it sent that you have knowledge of it

00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:09,370
can be a really quick way of giving back

00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:11,350
this is an example on here from the

00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:12,610
Magento stack exchange site it was a

00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,140
really simple question it was basically

00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,520
just I've got the default theme and I

00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,830
want to remove this block how do I go

00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:21,220
about doing it in the XML is easy enough

00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:24,370
answer but by answering it not only has

00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,740
the original poster now got that answer

00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:29,950
anyone else who isn't sure who's perhaps

00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:32,350
new to magento and as loaded up feed the

00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:35,320
base theme and can't figure it out can

00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:37,540
find that answer as well and it kind of

00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,650
keeps on giving and it took two minutes

00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:44,050
to answer I guess on Stack Exchange

00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:46,750
there are somewhere between six to seven

00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:50,320
hundred questions asked each day tagged

00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:52,990
with PHP and there have been about seven

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,990
hundred people at this conference go

00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:57,610
figure if everyone in this room everyone

00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:00,760
came to this conference just spent ten

00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:02,830
minutes answering one question each we

00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:07,930
could go through an entire days worth of

00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:10,120
stack overflow questions by that imagine

00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:13,450
how big a benefit that would have to our

00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:15,520
community with so many questions the

00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:17,140
great thing about it is that there are

00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,640
kind of questions that are massively

00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,740
complicated that I read them go I don't

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,320
even understand the question they're

00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,920
also kind of people the news PHP that

00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,470
have

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,269
simple questions like the XML example

00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:30,490
before so no matter what your experience

00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:32,019
level there will be something that you

00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:34,630
can answer in a way that you can give

00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:36,190
back and it's not just a k Flay I've

00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:38,079
used a code flow because we will use it

00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:40,149
but a lot of projects have their own

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:43,029
four rooms communities whether that's

00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:45,459
wordpress or laravel or magenta or

00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:48,040
whatever else so you know haunt those

00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:49,930
places people ask questions on those

00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:55,870
forums as well if you have that

00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:58,060
knowledge make sure you share it the

00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:59,680
great thing about contributing to forums

00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:01,269
and sites like stackoverflow is the

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,250
number of people you can reach really

00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:06,399
quickly so this is an example of a

00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:08,860
question I answered three years ago and

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,110
it's been seen by almost 4,000 people

00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:13,209
now let's be realistic probably not

00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:15,550
everyone a family answer they wanted or

00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:18,250
be even wanted that page someone probly

00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,870
used it as link bait other night but

00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:22,060
even if let's say half lives people

00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:24,130
let's say 2000 people actually found the

00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:26,589
answer they were looking for that's more

00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:30,459
people than I could possibly be reach

00:11:26,589 --> 00:11:32,740
out to in hours of time just by

00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:35,649
something that took maybe five minutes

00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:38,500
today that way of sharing our knowledge

00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:40,540
of growing our collective knowledge is

00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:43,769
really powerful and is something that

00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:47,560
every single person here could do

00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:50,170
testing testing is just as valuable as

00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:53,040
contributing code yeah it's not the most

00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:56,380
exciting part of a project but it is

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,899
equally equally vital in order for a

00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,949
project to keep moving forwards think

00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:02,199
about some of the big projects out there

00:11:59,949 --> 00:12:05,920
think about again wordpress or magento

00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:08,260
or you know anything a framework said f

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,360
whatever don't just think that the

00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,890
developers using it the building tools

00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,089
with these things but think about the

00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,319
websites that they're producing the

00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:16,240
applications they're using the people

00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:18,640
using those applications and visiting

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,699
those websites just by perhaps spending

00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:24,130
15 or 20 minutes testing a new patch you

00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:27,779
could be helping more people than you're

00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:31,959
likely to meet in your entire life in

00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:35,560
court of an hour this was a screenshot

00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:36,459
from the WordPress build site about four

00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,300
months ago five months ago something

00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:39,220
like that

00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,050
any one time that could be like says

00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:44,200
here over 200 patches waiting to be

00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:46,510
tested now perhaps testing particular on

00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,920
WordPress isn't difficult I'm pretty

00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:50,019
sure there's a grunt tool that basically

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,339
installs the patch for you and tells you

00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,480
exactly what you need to test and you

00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:54,450
literatures have to work work through

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,720
the steps it's really straightforward

00:12:54,450 --> 00:13:00,579
but if no one does it then those 219

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,260
patches which might be new features or

00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:04,570
there might be bug fixes or security

00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:07,450
fixes and come back to a topic that's

00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:09,790
been kind of quite important today if

00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:13,380
known tests them they will never reach

00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:16,420
production they will never grow God so

00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:21,310
the project won't go forward it will

00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:23,640
just die so at the moment we've looked

00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:26,829
at ways to help kind of lots of people

00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:29,560
but there is more to than that you can

00:13:26,829 --> 00:13:34,570
actually just give back by helping one

00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:36,490
fellow developer this quite up here was

00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:38,470
made on twitter i think by a really

00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:45,070
talented and incredibly good-looking

00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:48,670
developer yeah helping other developers

00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:50,649
can take on many many forms I've been

00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:52,930
lucky enough that the last few days I've

00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:55,899
actually been mentoring one of the

00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:57,880
diversity scholarship awardees it's been

00:13:55,899 --> 00:14:01,570
a dream as I probably learned more than

00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:03,070
they have but just by being able to

00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:05,470
support someone introduced into

00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:07,420
community hopefully there we have to

00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:10,060
come back in years to come hopefully

00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:12,970
perhaps they'll then mentor the next

00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:14,260
group of people are coming that's the

00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:16,180
sort of thing that it kind of

00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:18,940
proliferate squiggly that's a long word

00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:20,380
for me and yeah by helping one person

00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:23,790
they can help someone else you can have

00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:27,339
more people can't more people and so on

00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:28,930
offering assistance you know can be in

00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:31,839
person it can be digital there is a web

00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:33,880
site PHP mentoring dorg that I know if

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,529
yo you're looking to mentor someone or

00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:39,040
you're looking to be mentored that's a

00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:40,660
great place to go by building up

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,940
developers in this way who perhaps are

00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,740
new to the community are new to PHP all

00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:49,959
you're doing is making an our community

00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:51,070
stronger offering assistance kind of on

00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:54,250
a one-off kind of

00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:56,950
hoc basis is equally valid no matter

00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:59,440
what it is if you're passing knowledge

00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:03,040
on that you have in someone else is yet

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,030
to have then you are increasing their

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,770
knowledge base and therefore your

00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:07,780
release increasing the knowledge base of

00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:09,400
the entire Trinity because they can then

00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:11,260
pass that knowledge on to perhaps two

00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,690
more developers who might pass it on to

00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:16,300
formal developers should really know my

00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:19,600
base to shouldn't I whatever point being

00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:21,700
that as we pass that knowledge on it's

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,850
just making what we know stronger and

00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:27,430
stronger this was an example that

00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:29,080
happened to me last year there's a

00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,910
developer who was at the conference last

00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:33,190
year who was having some problems with

00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:34,840
some database performance and I

00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:36,910
mentioned I've done a talk here last

00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,350
year and it was on kind of basic things

00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:43,870
you can do with my single performance

00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:46,000
and Oh howdy and most of my own

00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:48,640
amazement not only did a someone come to

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,020
my talk be they remembered it and see I

00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,870
somehow managed to trick them into

00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:54,240
thinking i knew what i was talking about

00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:57,190
so you got in touch with me on twitter

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,720
sent over some bits and pieces to be

00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,130
honest i don't actually think I did that

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,090
much I kind of looked at it and went

00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:05,440
yeah you got some big numbers there I

00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:07,330
did I kind of pointed out a few things

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,230
but that was about it and he definitely

00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:13,000
did the hard miles but he did manage to

00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:15,220
massively increase his database

00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,290
performance so hopefully some of those

00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:19,390
things that he did kind of pick up from

00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:21,280
doing that he can now share with other

00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:27,220
developers who you know perhaps are

00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:29,500
having similar issues documentation you

00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:33,010
know what it's not the most sexy part

00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:36,010
contributing but it is really really

00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:38,080
important think about any open source

00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:43,510
project you're using that might be a

00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:45,150
framework MIB scms might be PHP and PHP

00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:49,870
developers at PHP conference go figure

00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:51,490
now I would suggest that if you could

00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,990
turn round to me go you know I've never

00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:57,970
looked at peace documentation in my life

00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:59,260
I'd go you're lying I know just on PHP

00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:00,220
it south I probably look at the

00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:03,070
documentation at least two or three

00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:05,650
times a week or a day

00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:06,880
so I'm sure that most people here

00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,520
probably look at the documentation on a

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,140
regular basis now just thank you for a

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,660
minute that none of that documentation

00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:17,470
exists there's a readme that just said

00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:20,250
here's the code good luck now okay some

00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:23,020
projects this is pretty much the case

00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:24,130
but you probably could figure out for

00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:26,110
yourself you probably could figure out

00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:27,970
how to compile PHP you've already could

00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:30,010
figure out kind of what order the

00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:31,690
arguments went in but it'd probably take

00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:36,100
you an awful lot more time and probably

00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:38,500
result in an awful lot more swearing so

00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:41,950
this is an example from the symphony

00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:44,290
documentation github repo when I took

00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:48,220
the screenshot I think there were 212

00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:50,530
open issues some of those yes were quite

00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:52,060
complicated some of them are things that

00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:54,010
unless you really understand how

00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:56,350
Symphony works you understand kind of

00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:57,610
how the underlying implementation works

00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:59,470
whatever else you're probably not going

00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:01,740
out to help with but equally there are

00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:04,120
plenty of them that are either typos

00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:06,010
changing variable names where it

00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,300
aversion the variables the argument

00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:09,010
names changed and they've not actually

00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:11,290
changed it in the documentation those

00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:14,500
sorts of things that anyone could pick

00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:16,150
up and change five minutes pull request

00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,290
prating fight you fro even went to check

00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:19,330
out you probably use the inline editing

00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:22,440
tool and create a pull request and do

00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:24,880
the same job there are sorts of things

00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:28,030
even without that in-depth knowledge you

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,530
could do and by doing that the next

00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:31,150
person who comes across the project

00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:32,980
isn't going to get confused because the

00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:34,540
variable name is different isn't going

00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:36,340
to kind of get hung up on some

00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:43,480
insignificant detail about there being a

00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:45,970
typo because you fixed it yes okay bug

00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,310
fixing counselors writing code so I've

00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:50,770
kind of lied a little bit but it is

00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:54,580
valid and it is a valuable contribution

00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:56,830
a lot of code contribution on projects

00:18:54,580 --> 00:19:00,130
often looks adding new features because

00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:02,260
that is exciting but what about the bugs

00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:04,270
that already exist in the code base yes

00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:06,490
we'll do our best we all try and write

00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:08,890
perfect code and we follow all coding

00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:10,540
standards we write our unit tests and we

00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:15,350
do everything we're supposed to do but

00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:18,980
you know what bugs happen so

00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:21,740
what we do about it I find that bugs

00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:24,740
tend to fall into two categories they

00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:27,500
tend to be annoyances or they tend to be

00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:29,179
actual bugs really ought to come up with

00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,380
a better name for the second category so

00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:34,370
if anyone's got one then you know

00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:36,289
Lebanon Twitter um but what whatever you

00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:38,539
classify them as there are often really

00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:40,700
small things that anyone can pick up

00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:46,490
with little pro experience on a project

00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:48,770
and help fix so this is an example of an

00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:51,049
annoyance and this was actually it's the

00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:52,549
joined in Android app and it certainly

00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:54,740
happened last year while I was here I

00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:56,600
found that if you're on a particular to

00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,250
this was before the new I the new UI if

00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,669
you want to particularly talk and you

00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:03,409
press the back option in the top menu it

00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:04,669
didn't actually do anything you just

00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:06,740
stayed on the page there any way to do

00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:08,450
it was because I had no soft back key so

00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,490
I had to close the app and reload it

00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,169
which was really frustrating so I spent

00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:14,510
the whole of Thursday bitching about it

00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:17,030
and then come thought you know what I

00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:20,090
should probably stop whining and do

00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:22,309
something about it I mean I've never

00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:26,090
touched android app development in my

00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:29,419
life and I'd probably written about 200

00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:33,260
lines of Java total but I thought how

00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:34,610
can it be so I pulled the code down I

00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,530
kind of found somewhere else where it

00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:37,520
worked and I can't wait either that's

00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:39,230
how they're doing it right fun let's

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,299
look at the code that doesn't work okay

00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:43,130
fine I then couldn't figure out how to

00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:46,640
get it to compile onto my phone but I've

00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:48,950
got that working eventually and I did

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:52,490
all this kind of got it working and I

00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:54,710
did it during lunch on the Friday so

00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:55,990
yeah that's not going to in the world

00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:58,940
it's not going to start World War three

00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:00,710
but by doing it anyone else that was

00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:03,049
using the Android app that was finding

00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:04,549
that exact strain frustration I was

00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:06,740
solving it for those people as well and

00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:08,750
people that moving forward are using it

00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:11,120
that piece of code that I wrote is still

00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,740
in the Android app code base today so

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,230
people that downloading it now are still

00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:16,520
benefiting from that fix so Brennan when

00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:19,669
it's sent that I've never done before I

00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:25,230
was really proud of my contribution so

00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:31,290
this is what it was yeah one line

00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:33,840
I for my sins do quite a lot of work

00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:36,090
with magento and there is a particular

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,010
product importer called mag me that we

00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:41,429
use quite a lot to kind of spin up test

00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:43,169
products and whatever else in magento as

00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:46,710
with most similar platforms you can

00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:49,049
create prefixes few database tables so

00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:52,230
you might have you know mgs under school

00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:55,320
whatever and there was a bug in some of

00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:57,299
the magma importers that if you had a

00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,100
prefix the actual table names in the

00:21:57,299 --> 00:22:00,660
importer were hard coded so just for

00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,880
errors and the whole thing fell over and

00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:05,250
you end up with corrupted tables it's

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,350
not wasn't great this has been causing

00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:10,860
us hell of a lot of problems when we

00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:11,730
were spinning up new projects so I kind

00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,730
of did some digging through the code

00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:17,429
base and found the issue and a fixed it

00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:18,990
now I could have just fixed that bug in

00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:20,730
the vision we had I could have put it

00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:22,020
back into our local repo call it a day

00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:24,179
and gone off with whatever else I was

00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:26,400
doing but what about the next person

00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:28,530
that comes across that book alright the

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,929
next person who perhaps can't go through

00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:33,059
the code and it corrupts our database

00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:36,179
tables and there wasn't idea what

00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:38,660
they're doing so instead I submit a pull

00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:42,210
request back to the the main git repo

00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:44,150
took five minutes I guess and now no one

00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:48,870
else is going to have that same issue

00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:51,090
again it was a tiny tiny tiny change but

00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:53,370
those things those small fixes that make

00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:55,559
everyone else's life better are just as

00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:59,790
valuable as adding new features and

00:22:55,559 --> 00:23:03,090
writing buckets of new code the other

00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:05,640
side of bug fixing is bug reporting this

00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:08,340
is a awesome little demonstration of how

00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:10,320
to report a book if you do come across

00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,970
an issue in a package or a library

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,830
you're using don't just thinkin all

00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:15,870
right don't just find something else

00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:18,720
that fixes it don't just moan about it

00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:22,350
on Twitter as in the keynote yesterday

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:24,900
file a bug report think about if you

00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:27,059
were trying to fix that bug think about

00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:29,220
the information you would need to be

00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:32,160
able to do a good job of fixing you

00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:33,720
provide as much detail as you can so

00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,360
that the dev fixing it doesn't have to

00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,299
spend an hour figure out what the hell

00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,029
you are going on about

00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:42,100
tell them what the issue is what it

00:23:40,029 --> 00:23:43,509
should have done how you reap how you

00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:46,539
created it and if you're able to

00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:49,119
reproduce it just basic simple things

00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:50,679
that make the person who is going to do

00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:52,480
the bug fixing which hopefully will be

00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:58,749
one of you guys to make their lives

00:23:52,480 --> 00:24:00,070
easier so in this talk I aimed to show

00:23:58,749 --> 00:24:03,999
you that anyone could give back to

00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:06,629
community in a very real way but without

00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:09,820
requiring a huge time investment and

00:24:06,629 --> 00:24:11,789
hopeful of a now to see that so just to

00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:14,559
kind of wrap up and to summarize I

00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:18,820
wanted to leave you with a couple of

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:21,190
thoughts if we if we could all find 15

00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:23,200
minutes a week I'm not saying 15 minutes

00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:26,529
a day I'm saying 15 minutes once a week

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,210
so that's an hour a month then in one

00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:30,609
year the people in this room would have

00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:34,629
given back over 9,000 hours to our

00:24:30,609 --> 00:24:38,019
community that's 379 days that's more

00:24:34,629 --> 00:24:40,539
than a year of dev time just from 15

00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:43,480
minutes a week imagine what we could

00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:45,340
achieve with that time and imagine how

00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:50,700
much better our community would be for

00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:50,700
it thank you

00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,290
