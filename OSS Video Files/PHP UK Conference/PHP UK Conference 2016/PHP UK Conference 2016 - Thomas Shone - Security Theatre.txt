Title: PHP UK Conference 2016 - Thomas Shone - Security Theatre
Publication date: 2016-03-18
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2016
Description: 
	This is not your normal security talk. Sure we talk about secure communication and the importance of hashing and encrypting (and why rolling your own is never a solution). We might even get frisky and cover some more interesting topics like true randomness, timed attacks and social engineering. But what we're really interested in is understanding what that hacker is trying to do on your site, what the motivation is and, using this, understand where you need to be vigilant. We're also going to talk about the results from an ongoing 4 year project to see just how vulnerable the average consumer website is. Theodore Sturgeon famously said 90% of everything is crud, we'll get to see just how close we come to that number. So if you're ready to see how scary the dark depths of security can be and just how scary it is when you look up and see all the leaky boats above us is, this is for you.

when it's early because this is a really

00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:13,690
long talk and I apologize for that I

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,950
work for these guys just like pretty

00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,630
much everyone else in the world we're

00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,490
hiring so if anyone wants to come work

00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:21,640
for booking we do really cool stuff with

00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:24,099
big numbers experiments and building for

00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,200
scale so anyone wants to do that come

00:00:24,099 --> 00:00:31,980
chat to me afterwards we do however work

00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:35,410
in Perl all right

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,899
security theater the practice of

00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,670
investing time and effort into creating

00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:43,780
the illusion of security rather than

00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:45,489
actually doing anything about it now

00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,109
some of you might be aware of this

00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:50,500
there's some very great world examples

00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:53,050
about security theater if anyone knows

00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,429
what these are you have a great story to

00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,719
tell the person next to you afterwards

00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:58,539
because I really don't even have time to

00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:59,530
go through all of this but we're not

00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:01,539
going to be talking about this today

00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:03,940
we're gonna talk about what we as

00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:06,159
developers are doing and why it is

00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:09,100
security theater because a lot of the

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:13,780
stuff we do around security doesn't work

00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:16,330
and this is a hard fact to swallow in

00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:18,190
fact so hard we're gonna have to have a

00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:20,950
little bit of a break up with our

00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:24,790
illusion and first stage of any break up

00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:27,880
is denial and you're probably going I'm

00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:32,320
a good developer I what's right I'm not

00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:33,310
gonna have a problem I'm not just

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,250
talking about what we do as developers

00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:37,780
I'm talking about everything we do the

00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:40,390
whole process from our own development

00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:44,980
machines to our servers to our customers

00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:47,860
the whole thing you might say I know a

00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:51,310
wasp any of you do not know what a wasp

00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:54,520
is the open web application security

00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:55,840
project they're the guys who put our

00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,550
list every year saying these are the top

00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,930
10 reasons why everything is and

00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:04,090
have some very good guides on how to fix

00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:05,320
it and that's great you're probably not

00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,240
going to be compromised because of your

00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,660
code but you're still going to have a

00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,360
problem

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,430
in fact getting compromised by the OWASP

00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:20,580
top 10 is no longer a sophisticated

00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:22,880
attack it's just the basics and when I

00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:26,850
talk about compromised I don't mean just

00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:30,450
hacked I mean losing things like your

00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:31,890
reputation data loss financial loss and

00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,320
anyone who doesn't think reputation is

00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:37,070
important anyone know about a company

00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,070
called digi Notah

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,520
there you go

00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,120
saying you're secure because your code

00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:51,480
is secure is a sign of security theater

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:55,020
but you use antivirus let me introduce

00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,030
you to a system record crypting crypting

00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,510
is not so new but what it is is a

00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:02,460
service where you write some malware

00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:05,040
then you use all the markets available

00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,810
anti viruses to scan it and to see which

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,370
one let's say adds a virus or it's not

00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,140
then you run it through an OP

00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,400
sophistication program and then you run

00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,900
it against all these anti viruses again

00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,040
and you keep doing that and so all of

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:19,140
them go this file is fine

00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:21,000
this defeats pretty much every single

00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:23,970
form of heuristic antivirus out there on

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,590
the market at the moment and it's worse

00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:30,000
they're organized

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:31,860
they have websites they offer REST API s

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,110
that you can integrate with your Jenkins

00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,850
build process to take your binary up

00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:39,390
load it up the skated Cinna back to you

00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:39,960
in a nice cool package they supports you

00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,870
on Twitter

00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:44,280
they take Bitcoin they're organized you

00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,170
can find them on Google this is the

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,650
first hit on Google just for searching

00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:55,260
for crypting on the flip side let's look

00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:57,270
at the people who are protecting us so

00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,190
besides effect that's node recently

00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:01,830
released a vulnerability that was right

00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:04,680
in the core they loud arbitrary memory

00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:06,030
reading micro-trend decided what they

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,470
really wanted to do was put one on your

00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:12,510
computer and that allowed anyone whose

00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,970
website you visit to run anything they

00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,460
want on your computer or lift all your

00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:20,880
saved passwords from the trend

00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:23,060
Microsystems password manager and it's

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,940
not just trend

00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:29,430
sofas I think that's a UK company remote

00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,080
mail execution they didn't bother to

00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:33,510
check for buffer overflows in the thing

00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,830
that scans for viruses so every single

00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:39,000
time they scan for a virus the virus

00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:40,770
could take over your computer any disk

00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,080
operation your computer does the

00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,700
antivirus scans at first so I could take

00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,780
your computer over by sending you an

00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:53,370
email so first would scan the email

00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:55,560
compromised but unless you're feeling

00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,200
left out or feeling you know confident

00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,240
about your own company that you use I've

00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,010
compiled a comprehensive list of every

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,840
piece of antivirus software that hasn't

00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:10,410
had a major vulnerability in the last

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:12,060
two years now I could keep going on

00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:15,750
embarrassing the industry more but we

00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:21,750
have a limited amount of time Internet

00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:27,360
of Things god this is a problem on its

00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:32,550
own who has one of those at home when

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,800
was the last time you updated it thank

00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:37,110
you

00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,640
if anyone has ever had to connect to

00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,870
their route they know it runs a web

00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,970
server because you've loaded some

00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,320
webpage which means it has Apache or

00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,120
nginx or something like that installed

00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,830
and probably as Linux as a kernel it

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:52,260
also means that has open SSL because

00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:53,370
that's what you need for Apache but most

00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,710
of those were bundled about five years

00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:57,180
ago and I haven't changed which means

00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,740
pretty much everyone's routing here is

00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,410
vulnerable to heartbleed if anyone ever

00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:05,580
heard of it pretty much your route the

00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:08,460
Gateway to your home is a big invitation

00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:10,650
to anyone talking and this this is what

00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:12,540
Aaron has now the Internet of is

00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:14,850
going to expand to everything else in

00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:17,210
your house which probably has the same

00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:21,150
kind of update cycle as your route oh in

00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:22,919
fact cherdon is a Google for finding all

00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:26,100
those things if you want to find an

00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:28,330
unsecured web server in America type it

00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:32,430
in they'll give you a list

00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:34,750
and then there's people like Samsung

00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,710
anyone ever bought a Samsung phone you

00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,060
know the first thing that happens when

00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:38,440
you get it it asks you to update and

00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,349
then you never see that update

00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:44,770
notification again because Samsung

00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:47,949
doesn't bother updating their phones six

00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:50,889
months after it's been sold who has a

00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:53,139
phone for less than six months most of

00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:55,210
us don't unlike a two-year cycle there's

00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:57,400
a Dutch herb ski group trying to get

00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:00,690
Samsung to agree just to keep updating a

00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:03,340
phone for those two years from purchase

00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:04,900
because they I mean it's sort of like

00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:09,879
the phone has everything to do with our

00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:15,030
life on it factors we're all pretty bad

00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:17,680
security our users of added security I

00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:19,599
mean the the recent list of the most

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,969
commonly used passwords for 2015 came

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,610
out number one still surprisingly one

00:07:21,969 --> 00:07:25,930
two three four five

00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:31,840
although of interest number six is now

00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:34,240
Star Wars developers are pretty bad at

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,650
security I ran this search about three

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,020
weeks ago thanks guys

00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:44,110
still submitting your secure

00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:48,130
authentication keys to github even the

00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:50,919
hackers are really bad the author of one

00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:52,719
of the encode viruses which once it gets

00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:54,400
in your your computer will encrypt all

00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:56,069
your files and demand a ransom otherwise

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,419
you'll never get your files back again

00:07:56,069 --> 00:08:03,909
apparently the encryption doesn't work

00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:06,900
properly so I'm gonna take a quick step

00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:09,219
out of our break up with our illusion

00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:13,240
and talk about a project I've been

00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:15,219
working on since mid 2012 I was with a

00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,159
small hosting company in South Africa

00:08:15,219 --> 00:08:19,539
and they were having problems with their

00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:20,860
hosting environments many shared hosting

00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:23,349
environments which are pretty much the

00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:25,210
worst they were having problems where

00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:27,069
they get their customers were constantly

00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,240
being compromised their websites were

00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:30,909
being hacked and they were spending a

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,019
lot of time having to fix and get their

00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:34,000
servers up and running again especially

00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:35,440
if it's one of the shared ones where one

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,029
website will affect all the others

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,370
because you know shared hosting is the

00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:40,050
cheapest

00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:43,560
worst possible setup to actually run a

00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:45,960
website on and so we sat down with them

00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,970
and we built up a list of the most

00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,860
commonly used software that they were

00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:52,080
aware of on their hosting environment

00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:56,460
and we built up a list of 43

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:59,340
applications and built a fingerprinting

00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:03,710
system in Sirte we've imported about

00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:06,480
4800 versions of those applications in

00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:08,640
total over 10 million files we've

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,010
indexed to be able to identify what

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:15,450
versions of a software are running

00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:16,380
somewhere and then we started scanning

00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,870
every month

00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:21,000
we ran the scan on every website to see

00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:22,410
what versions were there what software

00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,180
were they running what version was it

00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:28,410
and when we'd cross-index those with

00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:32,160
what vulnerabilities women in total we

00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:37,740
processed 255 thousand scans about 6,000

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:40,380
per month from June and these are the

00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,360
results for July 2015 now I would show

00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:45,090
more recent data but they had some

00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,650
server changes and pretty much the

00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:48,810
results from then onwards are a lot less

00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:50,310
statistically significant got a lot

00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:52,140
fewer because they shut down some

00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:56,400
servers then set up on other servers and

00:09:52,140 --> 00:10:00,230
I'm here but this is probably the best

00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:03,770
results best most recent results I have

00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:06,240
so let's start with the fun stuff first

00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:13,260
what do you think was the most popular

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:17,910
piece of software all right right before

00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:21,300
we start and we'll do this like the

00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:22,680
British hands up I have a wisdom of the

00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,810
elephants that I'll give away to either

00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,080
the person who guesses it all the person

00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:31,010
with the most funny answer all right

00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,010
this was the distribution

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:46,029
all right any guesses nope nope

00:10:42,689 --> 00:10:48,629
os comas no PHP myadmin

00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:56,139
new Joomla No now we're ready a drummer

00:10:48,629 --> 00:11:02,370
not Drupal sorry MIDI Oh MediaWiki no

00:10:56,139 --> 00:11:02,370
not MediaWiki who sits on EMT

00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:14,320
I didn't even have to get through to the

00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:21,400
hints that's Joomla that's WordPress is

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:24,610
Drupal tiny MCE WordPress uses tiny MCE

00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:28,740
PrestaShop uses tiny MCE PHP Beebe uses

00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:31,030
tiny MCE SugarCRM I think uses tiny MC

00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,800
which which is important because it

00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:34,750
means that if a vulnerability comes out

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:42,040
for tiny MCE it could potentially affect

00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:44,670
all these other things so fun side stuff

00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:51,040
aside how bad do you think it was

00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:54,580
we scanned for July 6440 websites of

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,740
those websites we found 1082 that had

00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,660
something we could identify all the

00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,820
others either were placeholder websites

00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:02,740
or static websites or were custom

00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,620
written or used a piece of software we

00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:08,710
didn't actually bother to index or you

00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:12,610
know commercial off-the-shelf stuff on

00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:14,320
those 1082 websites we found 2324

00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:18,490
different software installs or libraries

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,860
and so forth so any guesses on how many

00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:25,000
websites with all the software it's

00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:28,950
vulnerable you guys way more pissed

00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,150
mister than me all vulnerabilities

00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:34,600
norming a range in a scale from one to

00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:36,280
ten one being information disclosure

00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:41,740
stuff that went instantly compromised

00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:43,300
your machine but will provide some

00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:46,240
information that could be leveraged to

00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,560
do something else like you might tell

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,510
someone what's your version of PHP is

00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,130
which one means the software is

00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:53,940
compromised but we can then go and look

00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:58,150
up even abilities and use those and

00:12:53,940 --> 00:13:00,040
intend being sequel injection or remote

00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:02,110
file a conclusion or remote code

00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,350
execution pretty much they now own your

00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,350
machine

00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:11,699
with this is good this kid we got some

00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:13,319
people who aren't fun at all but more

00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:15,209
people who are you know in complete

00:13:13,319 --> 00:13:16,410
trouble and then and then there's a

00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:20,029
little bit in the middle who are not

00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:20,029
quite sure which side they're they're on

00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:25,499
pretty much almost 60% of all web sites

00:13:23,189 --> 00:13:27,480
were vulnerable to least one

00:13:25,499 --> 00:13:33,059
vulnerability some of them absolutely

00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:35,220
terrible it could be worse now we know

00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:36,959
who is actually to blame here so let's

00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:44,489
just exclude all the others and just

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:46,519
look at the CMS's so interesting to note

00:13:44,489 --> 00:13:48,509
WordPress has an auto update system

00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:50,639
which means a lot of them kind of said

00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:55,199
over here but also means these guys are

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:59,609
just not right and of course no surprise

00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:03,480
Joomla Drupal I have no idea what it's

00:13:59,609 --> 00:14:05,009
doing up here this is just a CLE

00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,819
significance but interesting on the list

00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:10,859
the frameworks really we do not have the

00:14:08,819 --> 00:14:20,009
numbers to make any judgments here but

00:14:10,859 --> 00:14:25,049
I'm judging Zend so why is it so bad it

00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:26,850
comes down to time we brought in all

00:14:25,049 --> 00:14:28,709
these vulnerabilities and compared them

00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:30,720
to the versions in our system and we

00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:33,449
could work out based on winner versions

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,389
released how long it took for a

00:14:33,449 --> 00:14:37,709
vulnerability to be discovered for it

00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:40,799
the medium time it takes for a version

00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:41,819
to be released to us finding a problem

00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:43,579
with it not not that there was no

00:14:41,819 --> 00:14:48,299
problem before but finding a problem is

00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:50,819
just over 20 months although you can see

00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:52,889
these huge spikes right here so we could

00:14:50,819 --> 00:14:53,999
actually say 25% of all software is

00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:58,589
vulnerable within three months of

00:14:53,999 --> 00:15:00,720
release which is fine as long as the

00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:02,519
average age of the websites and the

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,699
software they're running is less than

00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,699
that

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:21,920
oops so the average age of the websites

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,810
is 26 months although as you can see

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,279
there's a nice little spike here of all

00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:27,860
the people who updated fairly recently

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,740
although because websites tend you tend

00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,209
to get more websites over time people

00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:33,320
want websites than they add websites and

00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:34,430
they sit there forever because shared

00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:38,899
hosting and you're only paying like what

00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:40,070
two pounds a month people tend to add

00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:41,990
web sites all the time so I kind of

00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:43,579
expected a hockey stick anyway because

00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:47,180
people are adding web sites faster than

00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:49,070
the older ones getting old in these were

00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:51,350
quite interesting these spikes here

00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:53,300
those were specials at the company ran

00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:55,240
where people who previously won the

00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,860
fence about paying two pounds a month

00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,810
decided we'll get a website and they

00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:07,190
install a website and then they forgot

00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:10,220
about it now it looks bad this is an

00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:11,839
improvement because when we started the

00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,339
project and one of the goals was to

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,930
start informing the customers so at the

00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:17,300
end of 2012 we started sending out

00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:21,680
notifications to everyone so say hi your

00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:23,560
website's vulnerable please update so

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,600
what it was before

00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:30,350
was about 30 months and a lot more

00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:32,870
distributed so this is an improvement

00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:34,880
we've we've reduced the number of

00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:38,779
vulnerable websites from almost all of

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,670
them to most of them there's a little

00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:43,640
side-by-side comparison the this this

00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:45,860
all my effort and and and all the

00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:48,230
efforts of the company and contacting

00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:56,570
the the customers has moved the bar from

00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:59,980
there to there was it worth it because

00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:59,980
let me tell you I have seen things

00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:14,350
horrible horrible things like this what

00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:14,350
the hell is that

00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:20,640
I do not know if a vulnerability goes

00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:23,280
above that or below that what's the next

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,640
one in the line this is not even the

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,950
worst one the worst one anyone who works

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,000
with WordPress or WordPress themes might

00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:33,510
have come across something called Tim

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,370
thumb it's a little one file application

00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:38,820
that allows you to do snapshots of your

00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:40,950
website maintained by someone who has no

00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:43,950
idea how to version the version is

00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:45,960
stored inside the file which was fun but

00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:47,520
also he didn't update it every single

00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,680
time he updated the file so if

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,060
vulnerability would come out he had fix

00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,420
it but then he wouldn't bump the version

00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:59,190
number so we had to do some absolutely

00:17:54,420 --> 00:18:02,820
horrendous things also not the worst

00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:05,570
thing I've ever seen open X had a

00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:09,660
backdoor in it for over a year

00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:16,980
open X which was previously PHP add new

00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:18,960
new add which became open X from 2012

00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:21,810
November to August 2013

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,910
it had a big backdoor built into it then

00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:26,070
no one knew about

00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:27,690
shortly after 2013 it was bought by

00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:31,530
another company and changed to revive ad

00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:34,050
server so if you're running PHP add new

00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:38,070
or appendix or revive add server you

00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:43,050
might want to rethink it but the worst

00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:46,260
thing the worst thing I saw was this

00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:47,760
result now this guy obviously got the

00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,250
idea that you want to update your

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,630
software but he didn't quite catch on

00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:54,600
that you supposed to remove the old one

00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:58,860
so we have what is this one two three

00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:02,250
four five six seven eight Jim learn

00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,910
stores in back up back up back up back

00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,950
up back up

00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:09,110
old back up back up back up back up back

00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:09,110
up back up old stuff

00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:22,530
also he's running joomla 1.5 joomla is

00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:24,090
now on 3.5 beta this is 2015 another

00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:27,450
interesting fact is there is so much

00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:29,160
copy paste code in joomla 1.5 that my

00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:30,840
software was having problems identifying

00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,640
the roots of joomla it kept thinking the

00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:40,790
administration folder was another german

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:42,690
air install so what did I learn I

00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:47,010
learned that projects with bad

00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:48,630
versioning are bad at security that

00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:51,650
automatic patching if it's available

00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,650
gets used

00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:57,810
if someone couldn't update because it

00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:59,670
would break a plugin or a templates and

00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:02,190
that a choice between running our

00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:04,800
vulnerable websites and know if it

00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:10,890
required and updating it and spending

00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:12,120
time and effort they won't update we

00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:14,190
need to make plug-ins and templates

00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:20,790
updatable joomla i'm looking at you

00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:22,200
and finally patch fatigue exists when we

00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:24,690
first started informing the customers

00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,670
about these vulnerabilities at set them

00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,900
in a email saying wait this website

00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:29,760
you're running this please updated today

00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,080
at least this version and we'll get a

00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,150
reply back saying thank you very much

00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,980
that was incredibly useful we've updated

00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:37,560
it and we'd pat ourselves on the back

00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,820
and then two months later winner

00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,890
vulnerability comes out with that

00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:43,140
version we seminar that the email hurry

00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:47,640
another version update please and they

00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:48,810
go wow okay fine fine updates it two

00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,640
months later we send it again

00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:57,630
hi that version are vulnerable peas

00:20:50,640 --> 00:21:03,530
update and they're like juggle so let's

00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:03,530
get back to our breakup anger

00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:13,210
why doesn't someone do something about

00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:15,100
it well the private history

00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:20,280
unfortunately at the moment still has a

00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:22,720
very lawyer attitude towards security a

00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,700
lot of security researchers still get

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,400
threatened with lawsuits I myself have

00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:29,620
been threatened by a lawsuit

00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,539
now some tech companies have started

00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:35,169
offering bug bounties which is great but

00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:36,789
does the exceptions generally its don't

00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:38,530
tell anyone always and always

00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:43,090
because if not knows about it it is

00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:45,220
secure I have had to integrate multiple

00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:46,990
payment gateway systems before and one

00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,150
of them had a whole slew of

00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:50,919
vulnerabilities which I reported on

00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:53,620
there incredibly terrible customer

00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:55,929
portal it was closed the next morning

00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:57,970
but quite a journey I found the customer

00:21:55,929 --> 00:22:00,280
portal didn't encode anything so I

00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:01,840
resubmitted the bug report with some

00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:10,000
JavaScript inline which disabled the

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:12,600
close button that's when I got a letter

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,610
from a lawyer

00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,809
they didn't fix anything and we still

00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:19,210
had to implement it because it was the

00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:21,250
decision handed down from above and that

00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:25,509
is something we as developers need to

00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:26,740
change I don't feel comfortable handing

00:22:25,509 --> 00:22:28,779
my customers details over to these

00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:31,090
people but I didn't have a choice in the

00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:34,169
matter because it was dictated to me

00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:38,309
is this something we need to push back

00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:38,309
unfortunately lawyers are very expensive

00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:48,549
and quite ously they're not doing a

00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:51,549
particular job themselves well you might

00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:54,639
say why don't we have some form of

00:22:51,549 --> 00:22:56,379
standard for this you know some standard

00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:58,210
we could get behind come together work

00:22:56,379 --> 00:22:59,980
one out then we say everyone has to

00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,389
follow the standard you can get the

00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,460
insurance companies not to insure you

00:23:01,389 --> 00:23:08,799
unless you follow that standard no

00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:15,909
problem we do we have a whole bunch of

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:18,009
them actually and therefore different

00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:20,139
things as well then they some of them

00:23:18,009 --> 00:23:21,929
actually conflict you can't do certain

00:23:20,139 --> 00:23:25,919
combinations of them because they will

00:23:21,929 --> 00:23:30,220
tell you to do different things and and

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:33,070
let's say the top one the ISO to 700 1/2

00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:36,519
one apparently it's a very good one I

00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:39,909
don't know I'm not gonna spend 650 euros

00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:41,559
to pay to read it I'm definitely not

00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:44,350
going to spend 50,000 euros to get

00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:46,179
certified in it and that's actually

00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:48,279
completely useless for me if I want to

00:23:46,179 --> 00:23:51,279
do credit card systems because I need

00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:54,490
the plastic card industry security

00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:55,929
standards PCI one if I want to deal with

00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:57,480
credit cards which is completely

00:23:55,929 --> 00:23:59,980
different with a completely different

00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,120
approval process and if I ever want to

00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:06,370
work with the American governments in

00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:10,269
some form I need this one because I

00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:12,129
won't accept any other ones alright you

00:24:10,269 --> 00:24:14,370
say why doesn't the government do

00:24:12,129 --> 00:24:17,170
something about it

00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:19,929
not so sure I trust these people doing

00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:23,250
that and quite honestly most of them

00:24:19,929 --> 00:24:23,250
haven't got their act together either

00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:33,370
and they still haven't figured out it

00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:35,080
was the Russians I don't have enough

00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:36,280
time or slides to put up every single

00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:40,120
incidents in the last year from

00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:42,850
government side so we'll use this as a

00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,830
catch-all and quite we'll see even when

00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:49,419
they aren't getting compromised they're

00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:53,140
not really helping us out much sort your

00:24:49,419 --> 00:24:55,690
act out guys and when they're not trying

00:24:53,140 --> 00:25:04,540
to compromise our security they're just

00:24:55,690 --> 00:25:07,210
compromising our security there is one

00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:09,549
small ray of light out of this the the

00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:12,010
government's side of security around

00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:13,330
disclosure laws where if a company gets

00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,980
hacked and they lose certain amounts of

00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:16,780
information they need to disclose it to

00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,730
their customers a lot of this is still

00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:20,919
very optional and only applies to

00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:22,270
certain types of data but it means now

00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:27,929
that you least get told you've been

00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:30,700
screwed over let's move on bargaining

00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:32,470
things are bad but maybe maybe we can

00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,960
make a plan maybe we can make a plan I

00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:37,360
don't know let's install some idea

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,490
systems or web application fire

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,919
firewalls or you know get some

00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:44,380
specialized network equipment to handle

00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:47,169
our security you know we could go to one

00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:55,179
of the industry leaders like Juniper who

00:25:47,169 --> 00:25:57,000
build security hardware they actually

00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:59,080
only found out about one of the

00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,710
backdoors in their system because the

00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,760
NSA told them I think the NSA told them

00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:05,860
because they were kind of fed up with

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,830
having to share the rooters with the

00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:10,530
Chinese

00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:11,850
so one was definitely the Chinese's back

00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:17,430
door and the other one we're pretty sure

00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:18,900
was the nsa's and i don't know if any of

00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:20,790
you have ever had to maintain an idea

00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:23,010
system before but waking up at 1:00 in

00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:24,660
the morning because some manager in some

00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:27,330
remote office has managed to trigger the

00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:29,940
idea system to lock them out because

00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:33,150
they have been visiting some really

00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:34,520
dodgy websites I'm talking about cold

00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:37,320
fusion websites here

00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:39,210
cold fusion by the way sits or they go

00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,800
all their cookies to global which means

00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:42,360
once your visits a cold fusion website

00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,650
and you go to another one you have all

00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,560
the cold fusion cookies sitting there

00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:48,630
and it kind of looks like a sequel

00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:53,250
injection because they pack all this

00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:55,530
stuff in it and quite honestly I've had

00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:56,790
to water down ideas rules so much to

00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:59,160
make sure the people who should have

00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:02,750
access have access that they're not

00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:05,160
going to warn me about major problems

00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:06,420
you might say well we'll start following

00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,710
some of those prescribe security

00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:09,740
standards that they're they came up with

00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:12,660
pay the money

00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:16,160
verify ourselves get started that's

00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:18,390
great for your insurance pyramids

00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,610
because a lot of these standards are

00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:21,810
checklists they are pretty much you

00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:25,560
cannot work with us and this you've

00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:30,960
taped every box regardless of how weird

00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:32,430
or obtuse that tick box is and of course

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,920
they get use by your insurance companies

00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:37,020
to determine how much premiums you pay

00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:39,180
but they're not really going to make you

00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:40,530
that much more secure remember these are

00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,970
the people who still think an eight

00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:44,670
character password with one upper case

00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:47,030
one digit and no special characters is

00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,030
secure

00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:55,790
I like to think of this whenever I feel

00:27:53,450 --> 00:28:02,600
depressed because it means there's 10%

00:27:55,790 --> 00:28:04,580
worth fighting for and now that we're

00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,710
past the depression phase we can move on

00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:09,140
to acceptance and accept this new

00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:19,730
reality and start thinking about what we

00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:26,270
can do to fix it so why are our

00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:27,800
practices not effective most of them are

00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:31,280
pretty ineffective but not for the

00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:34,550
reasons you think it's because we do

00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:37,190
security in isolation bolted on after

00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:40,070
the fact quick patch make it work get up

00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:41,030
and running again but security is not

00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:44,780
something that should be done in

00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:51,740
isolation it's holistic it's the whole

00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:56,450
thing this is our area of influence the

00:28:51,740 --> 00:29:00,650
software and dependencies we have but

00:28:56,450 --> 00:29:02,570
there's this whole other stack that we

00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:06,050
don't exert direct influence over that

00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:07,700
is part of the security I mean if we

00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:10,250
actually distort these to show a number

00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:15,950
of lines of code for each section it'll

00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:17,630
probably look something like that you

00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:20,960
are tiny little bit of code up there and

00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:21,950
I set that to 500,000 lines which you

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,630
know is about your average dreamer

00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:30,230
install there's all this that you're

00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:33,020
depending on to be right I mean

00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:34,970
technically the human DNA is about seven

00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:38,160
billion lines of code so if we include

00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:39,980
humans it's actually more like that

00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:47,640
so I'll be more worried about the

00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:49,080
security vulnerabilities in this code so

00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,840
you need to reach out to these other

00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:54,020
parts of the system you need to reach

00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:57,150
out to HR training make sure they know

00:29:54,020 --> 00:30:00,240
how to reset passwords how to reset

00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:01,440
accounts you need to reach out to your

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,940
sis happens and I hope you have some

00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,590
really good sentence because they make

00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:09,180
all the difference to deal with all of

00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:12,440
this and the internet is full of eels so

00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:12,440
you don't have much control over that

00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:20,310
security is led should be made when a

00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:21,870
part of your system gets compromised

00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:25,410
they shouldn't suddenly have full access

00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:27,090
to your whole system preferably there

00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:33,030
should be another wall with really

00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:35,190
pissed off arches on top security is

00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:36,840
about your attack surface where can you

00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:38,220
be attacked that's where you need to

00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:42,810
marshal your forces that's where you

00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:45,510
need to pay attention security is about

00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:47,520
alertness you doing that you knew no one

00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,960
here wants to be the company that says

00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,310
well apparently our systems been

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,370
compromised for last six months but we

00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:56,670
just found out now so that's good you

00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:59,370
are more likely to be to be made aware

00:30:56,670 --> 00:31:00,990
that your system is compromised by being

00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:03,090
woken up at 2:00 in the morning by

00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:06,870
really pissed off DBA saying your code

00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:09,120
is making my databases too hot sort that

00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:10,260
 out and then you load it up and

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:14,190
you'll find out oh someone's doing a

00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:16,620
sequel dump your IDs isn't going to do

00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:20,870
that Pistols DBA is and trust me

00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:20,870
pissed-off DBAs are scary you will check

00:31:23,669 --> 00:31:29,290
Security's about mitigation if someone

00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:31,059
gets into your system they need to be

00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:34,210
limited to what that part of the system

00:31:31,059 --> 00:31:36,160
has access to so if someone compromises

00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:37,870
you'll see me as he mas there's no

00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:42,790
reason at all they should have access to

00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:44,770
your custom information if and I

00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:46,330
understand that marketing might have a

00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:48,730
valid reason to have that WordPress site

00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:50,860
but if they insist on pardon having a

00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:52,299
wordpress site make sure it is so far

00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:55,860
away from the rest of your system that

00:31:52,299 --> 00:31:55,860
you have to communicate via smoke signal

00:31:56,070 --> 00:32:05,049
and finally security is about trust

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:09,370
rayray I thought the whole point was

00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:12,040
Trust doesn't work with security but it

00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:15,220
is actually a lot of security is about

00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:18,760
trust it's about being aware of what

00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:22,000
you're trusting the hardest part of

00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:24,130
security is not writing secure code it

00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:29,760
is understanding where you misplaced

00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:29,760
your trust because Trust is a chain I

00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:35,320
trust my computer here is not

00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:39,220
compromised because it's up-to-date and

00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:40,570
also it's links not running any

00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:43,650
antivirus of course because you know

00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:45,610
you're more likely to become vulnerable

00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:47,940
if you're running Windows run antivirus

00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:47,940
please

00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:54,419
I trust that the software I'm using

00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:56,009
using is without vulnerabilities and we

00:32:54,419 --> 00:33:01,440
found out that via run it vulnerability

00:32:56,009 --> 00:33:03,269
research and security updates I trust

00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,119
that the software I'm using is properly

00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:07,110
configured if you have to provision 50

00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:09,299
servers I hope you're doing it

00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:10,559
automatically because if you make one

00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:11,639
mistake there you could have

00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,399
accidentally left one of your servers

00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:16,619
open for all sites sorts of abuse most

00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:18,419
software by default comes with the most

00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:20,669
broadest permissions enabled so you can

00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:22,259
get the service up and running because

00:33:20,669 --> 00:33:24,080
no one wants to figure out why the LDAP

00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:27,450
connection is not working with you and

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,710
they set it up gets working then you

00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:33,779
start restricting it that's how most

00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:36,059
software works I trust that the network

00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:38,730
I'm using is configured properly and

00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:43,740
secure hire yourself good system

00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:45,869
administrators I trust that you are who

00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:47,519
you say you are you log into the website

00:33:45,869 --> 00:33:49,889
you give me username password I'm now

00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:54,779
now assume it is you and not your

00:33:49,889 --> 00:33:55,590
brother who stolen your password when

00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:57,149
you connect to a website

00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:59,429
I trust that they are who they say they

00:33:57,149 --> 00:34:01,980
are and we do that via peer verification

00:33:59,429 --> 00:34:02,850
using certificates and if anyone is

00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,950
aware how that works

00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:07,289
every computer ships with a bunch of

00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:09,179
root certificates and these are the

00:34:07,289 --> 00:34:13,679
companies that sell SSL certificates

00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:15,270
mainly and they say if that certificate

00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,819
on the remote website is signed by one

00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:20,579
of us it's good you can trust it I mean

00:34:17,819 --> 00:34:22,980
that's why we pay exorbitant fees for

00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:26,159
these tickety's certificates is for them

00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:27,809
to do do Jillian's due diligence and say

00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,069
yes you are who you say you are because

00:34:27,809 --> 00:34:32,609
you can afford this money actually that

00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:36,270
that's the only reason and that we will

00:34:32,609 --> 00:34:37,589
keep our private keys secure the company

00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:39,869
I spoke about earlier did you notice

00:34:37,589 --> 00:34:42,240
that no one seems to know about was one

00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:43,980
of those companies Dutch company they

00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,290
lost their private key within a month

00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:48,629
they were bankrupt because every single

00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:54,690
certificate they ever issued became

00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:55,799
invalid by the way you don't hear aware

00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:57,839
that windows can install new

00:34:55,799 --> 00:35:00,990
certificates rid certificates on your

00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:02,130
computer without even informing you not

00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:06,420
even through the update manager

00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:07,859
Oh as Becky Stein is now requiring

00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:14,069
everyone in the country to install the

00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:15,420
government's one for reasons I trust

00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:17,160
that we are allowed to talk about what

00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:21,690
we're talking about hi I'd like my bank

00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:24,690
balance not the same as authentication

00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:31,229
authentication is I am me authorization

00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:32,640
I'm allowed to do I trust that what you

00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:34,950
sent me hasn't been tampered I'm gonna

00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:37,619
send you a file you trust me you'll just

00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:39,089
install it Exe run on your machine how

00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:42,329
do I know that someone hasn't modified

00:35:39,089 --> 00:35:44,940
that file when I sentence you we can use

00:35:42,329 --> 00:35:47,609
hashes or signatures did someone modify

00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:52,470
the email us into you has someone

00:35:47,609 --> 00:35:55,140
tampered with this binary I trust that

00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:57,359
what we talk about is private no one

00:35:55,140 --> 00:36:00,960
else can over you know eavesdrop and our

00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:02,640
conversation public and private keys we

00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,359
trust that the system we implement here

00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:09,359
works I trust that your computer's not

00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:14,099
compromised I have absolutely no way to

00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:16,249
verify that I trust that what we talk

00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:18,719
about you won't share with other people

00:36:16,249 --> 00:36:23,640
there is no technical solution to this

00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:26,910
at all contracts yes legalities yes

00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:29,039
terms and use on the web sites terms use

00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:31,829
and conditions and all that kind of

00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:33,119
stuff yes sort of but there's no

00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:34,229
technical solution to make sure that you

00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,119
weren't sent around until the person

00:36:34,229 --> 00:36:37,739
next to you what I just told you hi

00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:40,140
Facebook I'm having a baby

00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:41,430
that's great we won't tell anyone by the

00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:47,130
way would you like to buy this push pram

00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:50,700
I trust that the user won't be the weak

00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:56,009
link good training procedures will help

00:36:50,700 --> 00:37:01,319
with that but how can we make this chain

00:36:56,009 --> 00:37:04,859
better we have this chain and the

00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:08,309
weakest link in that chain breaks and

00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:10,559
the whole system falls apart if we can

00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:13,529
turn those into leaving links into more

00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:15,720
of a mesh we can make ourselves more

00:37:13,529 --> 00:37:18,330
secure we are spreading

00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,800
trust around and we can do it thing with

00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:21,930
things like two-factor authentication

00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,580
not only do you need to have a username

00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:26,220
and password but you also need to have a

00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:27,750
specific token then if you lose your

00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:29,630
password someone else gets it they still

00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:33,420
can't use it because they need the token

00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:37,830
if you are dealing with large amounts of

00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:39,119
money transfers or refunds is one person

00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:40,500
allowed to put in the number and refund

00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,760
to anyone they want because that's a

00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:45,660
great way to go on a very expensive

00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,859
holiday do you have someone else who has

00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,780
to come along and sign off on those

00:37:46,859 --> 00:37:52,250
there are now two people dependence on

00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:54,210
that a lot harder for abuse to happen

00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:56,550
signatures on emails to make sure they

00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:58,109
haven't been modified in coding your

00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:59,640
HTML output when it comes out of the

00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:02,340
database because you don't know who put

00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:05,670
it in there these are all extra chicks

00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:07,770
you can add and if you have to make an

00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:08,940
assumption is there a way you can code

00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:13,530
for that assumption because then there's

00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:15,210
no need for it and there are a lot of

00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:18,570
common mistakes we make that break this

00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:20,990
trust generate breaking the trust

00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:23,040
involves weakening one of the links

00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:24,990
normally it's around encryption or

00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:30,420
hashing that's where we really get it

00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:37,320
wrong how we implement it will affect

00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:39,240
its strength for authentication I can go

00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,650
on for hours for the section but pretty

00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,300
much there you go two-factor

00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:43,650
authentication I actually could not

00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:47,070
create a slide that was simpler than the

00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:50,580
readme on this user's google app

00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:54,990
authentication included voila two-factor

00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:55,980
authentication although even better make

00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:58,740
someone else have to deal with your

00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:00,359
customer data both makes it's someone

00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:02,400
else's problem which means you don't

00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:03,720
need to deal with all the legal issues

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,119
that come with holding someone's data

00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,109
like the right to be forgotten and what

00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:16,550
happens when you lose all that

00:39:07,109 --> 00:39:16,550
information sessions never all your own

00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:23,900
here is a mistake that was made in

00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:27,440
phpMyAdmin and it's not a mistake most

00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:29,600
people would spot because that bit of

00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,360
code now allows anyone to login as admin

00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:35,450
user this is piece of code was used to

00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:44,000
allow someone to delete someone else's

00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:45,710
session so this by the way if anyone has

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,090
ever wondered why when you're running it

00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:49,400
on your test machine you have two pages

00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:51,050
open that take a long time to load one

00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,700
one won't start loading until the other

00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:55,910
ones completely finished it's got to do

00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:57,140
with the session locks this prematurely

00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:59,320
closes that session lock because no me

00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:04,130
it ends at the end of the script and

00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:05,690
writes it to disk so right the disk open

00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:07,070
up a new session for the session ID when

00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:10,010
you want to get rid of get rid of the

00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:12,280
session exit great except for the fact

00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:18,890
for the little command right before it

00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:20,030
posturing which takes a Ural and imports

00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:21,890
it into the namespace kind of like

00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:24,710
registered Global's because there was a

00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:26,960
good idea which also allows you to

00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:28,760
override the session variable which

00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,700
means override the session variable

00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,960
write it to storage

00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:39,460
never mind the rest refresh the page

00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:39,460
you're now Edmund encryption

00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,170
there's a very good reason for this

00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:53,760
leave it to the professionals

00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:55,650
even they get it wrong avoid all

00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,840
tutorials if you take one piece of

00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:59,700
device away from this is ignore all

00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:02,340
tutorials and security because generally

00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:05,670
security changes rapidly and often the

00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:07,619
advice is bad this URL here is to a

00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:09,390
guest that's maintained by security

00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:12,060
researchers who keep it updated with the

00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:13,950
very latest industry recommendations for

00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:18,030
encryption which formula to use which

00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:23,490
random algorithms H macking so if you

00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:26,910
are interested that avoid advice like

00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:28,950
this hi I'm trying to use curl and I get

00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:29,460
the certificates verification issue what

00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:34,010
should I do

00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:34,010
don't worry turn off peer verification

00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:39,660
Stack Overflow is riddled with these I I

00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:41,430
spend my weekends looking over Stack

00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:45,930
Overflow finding these and adding very

00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:48,300
nasty notes to them thankfully from PHP

00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:50,339
5.6 onwards a very nice guy called

00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,830
Daniel Larry has made it no longer an

00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:54,060
issue pretty much it finds out what your

00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:55,680
Ritz certificates are wherever they are

00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:57,869
on your system and handles it for you

00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,190
and it's of course you've done that if

00:41:57,869 --> 00:42:10,349
you have go through your code and remove

00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:11,940
it now hashing hashing is once again one

00:42:10,349 --> 00:42:14,640
way encoding taking something and

00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:17,190
turning it into a new form that is

00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:20,099
smaller easy to move around and cannot

00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:27,210
be turned back very good for password

00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:29,700
hashing and file integrity checks have I

00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:33,180
been pawned is a website managed by a

00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:35,880
guy called Troy something and it lists

00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:38,310
all the publicly available dumps of

00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,470
passwords that have been released to the

00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:43,589
wild there currently are saying it's 278

00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:46,020
million accounts be aware that the

00:42:43,589 --> 00:42:48,089
number of Internet users in the world I

00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:53,099
think is only sitting at 2 billion so 10

00:42:48,089 --> 00:42:56,370
percent ish so I think there's the Adobe

00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:59,520
hack in there all the passwords listed

00:42:56,370 --> 00:43:03,300
in hashed encrypted multi hash plain

00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:07,080
text form pretty much 66% of those were

00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:08,490
either plain text plain md5 or encrypted

00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:11,660
which you don't do with passwords

00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:11,660
because it means you can decrypt them

00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:17,190
which means with a rainbow table 66% of

00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,690
the passwords in the world can be

00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:23,820
decrypted which is why we know what the

00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:25,410
top worst passwords are in the world and

00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:27,360
it's also implementation this stuff we

00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:30,300
don't know we don't know they can trip

00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:35,160
us up which of these two implementations

00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:38,280
of hash checking is secure they both

00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:47,660
return the same value true or false in

00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:47,660
all cases this one that one yeah

00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:55,950
the first one is vulnerable to something

00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:58,620
called timing attack which I never knew

00:43:55,950 --> 00:44:01,050
about its brute forcing those functions

00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:04,200
by for working out how long it takes to

00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:07,500
execute because with string comparison

00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:10,290
as opposed to a slightly different

00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:13,440
formula which is used here you can work

00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:16,680
out how long if you try it enough times

00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:20,550
it takes to compare two strings so here

00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:22,500
we have a b c d and a b c e we compare

00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:27,750
those 10,000 times there is a distinct

00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:28,800
time if we compare ABCD to a CD which

00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:30,540
only has to check the first two

00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,920
characters before it fails you can see

00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:33,920
there is a distinct time difference so

00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:40,950
you can iterate numerous times over and

00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:43,020
over again to see if you can get those

00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:46,230
string comparisons to match by working

00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:47,490
out the time this can also be used to

00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:49,800
figure out if the username exists

00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:52,230
because first thing you do is pass

00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,640
username the password checks using muse

00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:55,620
and M exists there check the password

00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:57,000
otherwise return straight away so you

00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:58,410
can use a username you know but the

00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,730
password you know is incorrect and then

00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:00,630
a username you don't know if it exists

00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:02,960
and just keep going through different

00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:05,640
user names and compare the two times and

00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:07,380
see if some one of them the time starts

00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:10,040
matching closely then you know that

00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:10,040
username exists

00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,490
okay I'm gonna actually well actually

00:45:14,059 --> 00:45:17,780
myself well actually those two crypting

00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:19,910
fire of those two hashing functions were

00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:22,640
actually fine for bcrypt because bcrypt

00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:24,640
actually has enough randomness to make

00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:29,510
sure that they're not determinable

00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:31,250
sometimes see bcrypt is a bit of a

00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:33,109
balancing act you either have a

00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:35,780
cryptographic function that is expensive

00:45:33,109 --> 00:45:37,280
to run and thus takes a long time which

00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:38,690
makes it a dose vector so someone can

00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,030
dust your website by hitting your login

00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:45,500
page or you make it too easy and it's

00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:47,450
predictable PHP for point three to five

00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:48,500
point two point nine did not have enough

00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:50,510
randomness in bcrypt

00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:52,569
which means all the passwords that were

00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:56,500
encrypted for any of those PHP versions

00:45:52,569 --> 00:45:58,430
were cryptographically not so secure and

00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:01,430
vulnerable to timing attack but it's

00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:02,450
okay we all store what version of PHP we

00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:09,740
were using when you created that hash

00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:12,200
right and the thing is standards will

00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:14,569
change B crypt at some point will be

00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:16,069
decided that it's not so secure md5 used

00:46:14,569 --> 00:46:19,579
to be secure now it's not sha-1 used to

00:46:16,069 --> 00:46:24,170
be secure now it's not at some point B

00:46:19,579 --> 00:46:28,069
crypt won't be and it's gonna change you

00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:32,569
notice we have a password default in PHP

00:46:28,069 --> 00:46:33,680
that is the considered best default so

00:46:32,569 --> 00:46:35,030
if you build your code like this you

00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,200
verify the posture because the only time

00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:37,400
you should ever know what a person's

00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:40,400
password is is when they're entering

00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:41,599
into your website at the time they enter

00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,069
it you can check if it needs to be

00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:45,559
rehash because maybe a bit of formulas

00:46:43,069 --> 00:46:47,660
come out and you need to move up you can

00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:48,829
do that with that chick and then just

00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:50,750
rehash the past and store it again

00:46:48,829 --> 00:46:54,910
you'll never ever have to worry about

00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:59,059
using a weak hashing algorithm anymore

00:46:54,910 --> 00:47:01,930
and then there's randomness and you

00:46:59,059 --> 00:47:01,930
might be noticing a trend

00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:06,579
non-deterministic randomness is critical

00:47:05,569 --> 00:47:10,579
for encryption

00:47:06,579 --> 00:47:12,799
Mariza critical it's hard the dual

00:47:10,579 --> 00:47:14,059
elliptic curve something's unavailing

00:47:12,799 --> 00:47:18,280
was used for seven years

00:47:14,059 --> 00:47:18,280
it was the default in our SAS software

00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:22,700
until people found out that it was

00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:24,260
actually planted there by the NSA

00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:26,240
and had a hidden mathematical weakness

00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:28,910
it took seven years to provide the proof

00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:32,420
of that they were there was suspicious

00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:33,770
before and I'm sure RSA were not too

00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:35,329
happy about the fact that it was

00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:39,560
disclosed they'd been paid ten million

00:47:35,329 --> 00:47:41,150
dollars by the NSA to do that so seven

00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,859
years to figure out that something had

00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:45,550
been planted there and was actually not

00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:50,420
secured by mathematical cryptographers

00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:53,089
don't think you can do it yourself also

00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:54,740
be aware where you getting your analyst

00:47:53,089 --> 00:47:56,660
from you don't always need cryptographic

00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:58,190
on that randomest there's different

00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:01,130
types of random astiz pseudo-random

00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:02,750
which is great for like non important

00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:04,520
randomness there's cryptographically

00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:06,380
secure random which is important for

00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:07,880
cryptography and there's true randomness

00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:11,260
which is very expensive and takes a long

00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:15,200
time to process and is useful for

00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:17,210
gambling games no wait you're getting it

00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:19,579
from Rand is not cryptographic clean and

00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:22,849
secure but ran into random bytes and

00:48:19,579 --> 00:48:26,079
open SSL random pseudo bytes is until

00:48:22,849 --> 00:48:26,079
there's another vulnerability Ness or so

00:48:26,589 --> 00:48:33,170
information disclosure every single

00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:35,930
times you ask for a website they send a

00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:36,950
whole bunch of header information this

00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:39,200
is some of the header information they

00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:41,690
can send you might be particular

00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:43,520
interested in those two pieces look your

00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:46,970
ring a Pesci and PHP five point five

00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:48,470
point eleven that's can old that's great

00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:51,530
I can look this up right now there's

00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:53,000
about five pretty serious

00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:55,310
vulnerabilities with five point five

00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,930
point eleven and now I know how to

00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:59,660
attack your website because you've given

00:48:56,930 --> 00:49:01,130
all that information turn it off no one

00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:04,579
needs to know that you're running PHP or

00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:10,810
Apache just change it to return iis or

00:49:04,579 --> 00:49:10,810
something he'll make Microsoft happier

00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:15,840
there's a good reason we also turn off

00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:19,290
warnings besides the fact Google will

00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:22,050
index this for you very nicely it also

00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:23,820
discloses your paths how many paths how

00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:26,160
many folders down do we need to get back

00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:28,410
down to your route of your system it's

00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,820
not necessary a vulnerability but it

00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:33,300
allows you to leverage the information

00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:37,890
to use another vulnerability with the

00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:43,500
information you leverage and in my

00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:46,680
favorite social engineering weak

00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:48,900
password reset processes if I can google

00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:52,590
the answer to your reset questions

00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:55,160
that's not secure where did I live if

00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:59,280
when I was fifteen it can be googled

00:49:55,160 --> 00:50:00,870
what school did I go to Google pretty

00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,240
much most of the question they ask

00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:08,130
nowadays are very easy very easy to find

00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:10,580
out make sure that your support staff is

00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:13,050
trained there's this big toss-up between

00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:14,580
convenience and security if you make it

00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:16,050
too hard for someone to be able to reset

00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:17,310
for a valid reason they're gonna bugger

00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:20,220
off elsewhere but if you make it too

00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:22,610
easy it's gonna be imbues I actually

00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:24,900
have an interesting story about that

00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:26,970
this guy whose name I'm not gonna trim

00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:30,930
pronounced has the Twitter handle in and

00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:33,030
a hacker wanted that so obviously he's

00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:34,770
not gonna hand it over after a bit of

00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:38,460
looking up online he found out that this

00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:42,480
chap had a domain we all his email win

00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:44,240
su hosted with GoDaddy and so the hacker

00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,740
wins I was going he said hey GoDaddy uh

00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:49,200
I need to reset my accounts I lost my

00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:51,030
password and GoDaddy said uh well I'm

00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,080
afraid we can't help you with that in

00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:54,840
this you can give us last four digits

00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:56,820
you credit card number uh heck I said

00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:57,780
okay tell you what tell me what the last

00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:59,100
four digits of the social security

00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:00,390
account says cuz I'm not sure if it's

00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:02,130
mine on my wife's and then I have to go

00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:03,990
and find which credit card to use and

00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:06,200
I'm sure that's what digits of your

00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:11,160
social security number are or XYZ one

00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:12,960
thank you I'll be right back hey Popo uh

00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:14,790
which credit card do I have attached to

00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,980
my accounts III give me the last four

00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:18,300
digits them I think it's expired now and

00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:19,500
the guy said well you know we can only

00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,460
give you that information if you brought

00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:24,190
us with the last four digits of your

00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:26,859
social security number oh well

00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:30,390
there you go great here's the last four

00:51:26,859 --> 00:51:34,059
digits if you get a card number yes

00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:35,920
hey GoDaddy thanks for holding last four

00:51:34,059 --> 00:51:38,920
digits not a problem reset the account

00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:42,240
logs and changes the MX domain waits an

00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:45,990
hour goes to Twitter resets the password

00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:49,030
done how do you defend against that

00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:52,829
whose fault was that there wasn't

00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:58,359
Twitter's fault I think was GoDaddy's

00:51:52,829 --> 00:52:00,309
PayPal if you are interested in hearing

00:51:58,359 --> 00:52:03,280
more of this kind of stuff and the

00:52:00,309 --> 00:52:15,430
coding stuff I recommend you pop on over

00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:18,490
to James talk and the New Relic track so

00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:23,920
we've dealt with our break up last time

00:52:18,490 --> 00:52:26,490
for a little bit of hope security is

00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:28,569
holistic this is a problem that everyone

00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:30,099
needs to be part of the solution for

00:52:28,569 --> 00:52:37,390
there's not something we can do

00:52:30,099 --> 00:52:39,069
individually we need to remember our ABC

00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:40,420
this is probably the most important

00:52:39,069 --> 00:52:47,490
advice I want you to take away from this

00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:47,490
talk always be pageant

00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:52,740
have a patching strategy if it appends

00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:55,500
dependency right now is preventing you

00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:58,470
from updating or patching fix it now

00:52:55,500 --> 00:53:00,030
it's not gonna get any better and what's

00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:01,730
worse is when something major does come

00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:05,490
out and you're stuck unable to patch

00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:07,080
you're gonna be screwed this also

00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:08,730
includes if you're using any kind of

00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:10,800
version of software that's kind of more

00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:13,560
points something it hasn't really stable

00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:15,570
release yet be aware that I think was a

00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:16,800
node broke all backwards compatibility

00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:21,180
and there's still people using more

00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:23,090
point something node version properly it

00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:25,020
makes my life easier it makes

00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:28,550
determining what versions are vulnerable

00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:31,320
easier get it right it's not complicated

00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:34,140
major number it goes up when you break

00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:35,910
backwards compatibility minor when you

00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:37,710
add a feature but it doesn't break wit

00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:39,780
back with compatibility you put that

00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:41,130
number up and if it's just a fix to fix

00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:43,140
a bug or security issue

00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:44,940
put that up I should be able to update

00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:46,650
any change in the patch without ever

00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:48,740
having to test my code it should just

00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:48,740
work

00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:54,869
don't become comfortable if you're aware

00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:56,700
of a hole in your system somewhere deal

00:53:54,869 --> 00:53:58,260
with it the longer you leave it there

00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:00,450
the more comfortable you become with it

00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:01,490
the more contempt you'll show it's it's

00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:04,910
not that serious

00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:09,599
does your pass ru password still in md5

00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:14,570
sort that out now not when we busy

00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:18,330
uploading them - have I been poned read

00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:20,520
read know about what's happening if you

00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:24,300
use any piece of software third party

00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:26,430
sign up for their security mails read up

00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:31,170
on the best practices for security from

00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:32,940
reputable sources not Stack Overflow 90%

00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:38,130
of security is about knowing what's

00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:41,580
going on not about fixing stuff have a

00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:44,040
training strategy make sure your agents

00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:46,500
know how to reset locks on accounts how

00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:48,540
to reset passwords what process you go

00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:50,760
through make sure that they don't it's

00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:52,109
it falls within a gap where you're happy

00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:53,460
with the level of security that someone

00:54:52,109 --> 00:54:55,530
has to go through to verify their owner

00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:58,410
accounts but not so far they have to

00:54:55,530 --> 00:55:01,230
send DNA samples

00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:02,220
have a compromise strategy have a plan

00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:04,700
before you need it

00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:07,410
write it down store it somewhere

00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:10,020
practice it once a year even if your

00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:11,850
plan is we have no plan because we don't

00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:15,120
have time or budget write that down

00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:17,610
because when goes wrong you need to

00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:19,980
be able to find that plan should contain

00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:24,300
who needs to be contacted what needs to

00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:28,920
be done who needs to be informed what

00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:31,200
systems need to be shut down so your

00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,830
mother information only stole what you

00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,170
actually need

00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:35,550
I mean marketing department might cry

00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:38,010
that they don't get like the third

00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:41,040
cousin's name of your customer but store

00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:42,330
only what really is needed the less

00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:48,180
information you store the list you can

00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:51,630
lose you gotta make mistakes learn from

00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:54,030
them if when when you get compromised if

00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:55,380
it's just a matter of Patchett and carry

00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:56,730
on as normal you haven't learned

00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:58,590
anything your company hasn't learned

00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:59,580
anything you might find they're a little

00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:01,590
interested in the problem for a little

00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:02,550
while throw tons of resources at it for

00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:05,490
about a week and then they forget about

00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:06,810
it if you suddenly get access to a lot

00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:14,430
more resources for security make sure

00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:15,210
it's sustainable read limits but now you

00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:17,490
don't to build it when there's an

00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:18,660
incident going on if you can only login

00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:21,090
five times your website

00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:23,370
no one can do timing a attempts login

00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:24,900
five times a minutes on your website no

00:56:23,370 --> 00:56:28,740
one can do a timing attack no one can do

00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:31,830
a brute-force this also applies if you

00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:32,910
have any kind of product that's someone

00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:35,400
who wants to compromise your system

00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:39,150
wants to use like AWS make sure

00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:42,210
everything is rate limited monitor

00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:46,290
you're more likely to be notified by

00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:48,570
that DBA then the ideas as was famously

00:56:46,290 --> 00:56:50,940
said by someone at eat see if it moves

00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:53,840
graph it if it doesn't move graph it's

00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:53,840
just in case it starts moving

00:56:54,269 --> 00:57:00,579
d couple rolls put the data where it

00:56:57,819 --> 00:57:02,229
needs to be far from each other there's

00:57:00,579 --> 00:57:03,729
no reason why that WordPress site I was

00:57:02,229 --> 00:57:05,789
talking about and needs to have any

00:57:03,729 --> 00:57:08,019
access to your custom information and

00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:13,930
should be very very far away from the

00:57:08,019 --> 00:57:15,519
ratio servers compose everything makes

00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:19,479
it easier to update there's no excuses

00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:21,279
anymore we should be doing this D couple

00:57:19,479 --> 00:57:24,369
your plugins and templates if I cannot

00:57:21,279 --> 00:57:25,749
update my plugins and templates update

00:57:24,369 --> 00:57:27,789
my software because it'll break all of

00:57:25,749 --> 00:57:30,160
those you're doing it wrong

00:57:27,789 --> 00:57:31,749
we have composer a lot of people to

00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:36,910
install plugins and templates via

00:57:31,749 --> 00:57:39,309
composer now and a personal request

00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:42,759
please get behind Pearson I'm Anton

00:57:39,309 --> 00:57:44,199
Pierce online is about disclosure how to

00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:45,789
get hold of you when we spot something

00:57:44,199 --> 00:57:49,869
wrong in your software how you will

00:57:45,789 --> 00:57:52,630
respond who you'll notify once again

00:57:49,869 --> 00:57:54,069
having that plan and 10 is about how to

00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:55,449
store in a standard way

00:57:54,069 --> 00:57:57,489
vulnerabilities in your software so

00:57:55,449 --> 00:57:59,140
people like me can easily import those

00:57:57,489 --> 00:58:01,299
lists imagine if you went to packages

00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:02,440
any went right I want to install this

00:58:01,299 --> 00:58:03,849
version and it goes well no actually

00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:05,859
that version has a vulnerability piston

00:58:03,849 --> 00:58:09,630
missile division that would be cool

00:58:05,859 --> 00:58:09,630
we're not gonna have that without that

00:58:10,829 --> 00:58:15,339
this theater is group performance this

00:58:14,289 --> 00:58:15,910
is not something we're gonna be able to

00:58:15,339 --> 00:58:17,469
do alone

00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:20,199
this is something we have to do as an

00:58:17,469 --> 00:58:24,069
entire group each of us is a link in our

00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:29,039
own trust chain and we are strong as the

00:58:24,069 --> 00:58:29,039
weakest link here thank you very much

00:58:38,830 --> 00:59:07,640
any questions no one needs to know what

00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:08,500
version of anything you are running on

00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:10,610
your website

00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:12,070
pretty much the header information is

00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:14,750
more for debug use than anything else

00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:16,940
yes you might miss a bit with web craft

00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:18,350
stats I mean they try and figure out how

00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:22,550
many people running Apache as opposed to

00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:24,260
aya-san done things but there's no

00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:32,810
reason to weaken your security for

00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:35,590
statistics Oh none of that is got to do

00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:35,590
with anything that I'm running

00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:43,280
information disclosures is is it's quite

00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:44,630
interesting because it's it's something

00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,700
that people don't think is important

00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:49,930
until it is important because it's been

00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:53,330
used to figure out something else

00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:59,470
limits as much as possible bare

00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:59,470
essentials pretty much anyone else

01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:06,250
