Title: PHP UK Conference 2016 - Jessica Rose - Imposter Syndrome and Individual Competence
Publication date: 2016-03-18
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2016
Description: 
	This talk will focus on how Impostor Syndrome and the Dunning-Kruger effect work to undermine our estimation of our individual skills as developers. Who do these cognitive biases affect? And how do they collectively shape the face of the software development industry? The impact of these biases on personal and professional relationships among individuals and groups will be examined, along with what can be done to diagnose and cope with them.

good morning is everybody feeling all

00:00:06,979 --> 00:00:13,700
right for those of you watching this on

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,230
the video later this is the second day

00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:18,830
of the conference and what I like to

00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:21,349
call the hangover keynote so if you hear

00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:23,390
on the video groans and disapproval and

00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:26,480
that's absolutely got nothing to do with

00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:28,489
the talk so I'm here to talk to you

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,439
about impostor syndrome and individual

00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:32,029
competence and the first thing I'm going

00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:34,190
to do is I'm to talk oh I'm gonna turn

00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:35,660
on my clicker I had the first thing I'm

00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,910
to do is give you a little bit of

00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,350
background about myself so my name is

00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,960
Jessica rose and I've got a background

00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:44,900
in education and linguistics before I

00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,300
moved into technology I'm afraid that

00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,160
I'm terribly American and terribly

00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,079
terribly chipper so it's going to be a

00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:55,790
bit of a hard keynote for those of you

00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:57,380
who are hungover sorry but now i'm

00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:01,370
working in developer relations with

00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:03,559
Dream Factory and it's amazing like I

00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:05,780
get to work with these almost

00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:07,970
intimidating the clever people and my

00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:11,270
whole job is to go to conferences and go

00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:12,979
to communities and talk to terrifyingly

00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:14,899
brilliant people about what they're

00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:20,119
doing with open source technology and

00:01:14,899 --> 00:01:21,649
that's great and that's scary and so if

00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:23,959
you have to spend a lot of your time

00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:27,409
talking to brilliant people it occurs to

00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:34,579
you a lot that perhaps they're much

00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:37,369
smarter than you as a former educator

00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:41,109
and networking technology I'm super into

00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:44,869
the brain like our brains are glorious

00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:48,319
they are these weird wet piles of meat

00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:50,569
that love learning that care about the

00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,639
world around us and they're just going

00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:57,469
out of their ways to make us better

00:01:52,639 --> 00:01:59,329
people hopefully and as a former

00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:01,009
linguist I'm really interested in the

00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:04,189
idea of the zone of proximal development

00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:06,169
and this is a really key language

00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:09,319
learning concept which I think carries

00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:11,390
into larger issues of learning so the

00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:12,680
zone of proximal development is a really

00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,790
basic concept saying that if you're

00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,379
working on a task

00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,120
so in language learning if you're

00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:18,769
working on a language learning task or I

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,510
think in technology if you're working on

00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:25,340
work if your task is too easy you don't

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,290
really get any learning done your brain

00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,000
is just going through the motions you're

00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:31,659
not getting new things you're not

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,430
learning new things you could do the job

00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:36,799
but you might not care that much it's

00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:38,439
great for practice but learning new

00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:41,209
things doesn't really happen here but

00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:44,030
similarly if you're doing stuff that's

00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:47,599
way above your level you're not learning

00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:49,819
things so you can dip high above your

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,250
level with amazing support with people

00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:54,109
helping you out but if you're constantly

00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,269
doing things far far above your level

00:02:54,109 --> 00:02:58,730
not only are you not learning your brain

00:02:56,269 --> 00:03:00,439
doesn't get that traction it needs but

00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:02,629
you could do some really serious damage

00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:05,389
to your motivation if you're constantly

00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:07,790
working high high above your level you

00:03:05,389 --> 00:03:10,370
feel dumb and you feel bad and you want

00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:13,310
to stop so the zone of proximal

00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:16,790
development is kind of a space it's this

00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:19,190
sweet spot in tasks where your brain is

00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:22,489
getting one level up from your current

00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:24,949
skill level and I think it's a little

00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:26,629
bit like RPG video games or I guess

00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:29,060
tabletop games if you're a better geek

00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:32,150
than I am you want to aim for monsters

00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,260
just a little bit up here and the zone

00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,819
of proximal development is this

00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,269
marvelous sweet spot where your brain

00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:39,739
desperately wants to be your brain

00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:42,379
craves the zone of proximal development

00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:44,629
and that would be amazing if your brain

00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:47,540
was good at assessment if your brain

00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:49,879
knew how smart you were and if your

00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:51,979
brain knew how smart your peers are it

00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:54,849
would be so easy to get into the zone of

00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:58,909
proximal development your brain is

00:03:54,849 --> 00:04:01,609
terrible at assessment you have no idea

00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:05,090
how clever you are because brains are

00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:09,019
terrible so who here knows what a

00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:11,030
cognitive biases for people on the video

00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:13,659
everyone looked wide awake people were

00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:17,419
mouthing the answer it was brilliant as

00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:19,190
a lazy school child I would have used

00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:21,500
wikipedia had it been around and they

00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:23,300
say it's a systemic pattern of deviation

00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,030
from norm or rationality and judgment

00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,380
whereby which is a marvelous work

00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:29,060
differences about other people and

00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,010
situations may be drawn in an illogical

00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:33,500
fashion subjects create their own

00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:37,070
subjective social reality from their

00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:39,770
perception of the input this definition

00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:42,350
is okay but my husband actually gave me

00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:44,480
one I really like a cognitive bias is

00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:46,669
your brain using bad data to produce

00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:50,120
worse conclusions that it's really

00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:52,280
attached to your brain is using junk

00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,760
information coming up with a conclusion

00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,430
and then just will not let that go

00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,840
humans we hate to admit that we're wrong

00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:03,530
even when it's are terrible meet brains

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:06,410
telling us that things are wrong so

00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:08,600
imposter syndrome imposter syndrome I

00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:13,280
like to talk about it as a feeling as

00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:16,700
this cold wet hollow feeling that you

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,470
sometimes get in your chest where you

00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,600
have no idea what you're doing and

00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:23,260
everybody around you all of your peers

00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:26,440
they seem to know what they're doing and

00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:28,430
oh god they're gonna catch me soon

00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,500
imposter syndrome is this idea that

00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:37,310
you're just faking your way through it

00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:39,320
and everybody else is fine it's great so

00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:40,880
the feeling of imposter syndrome and I

00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,580
think your individual results may vary

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,870
maybe it's a cold wet feeling in your

00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,150
head instead of your chest for

00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:49,460
individuals but what does it actually do

00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:52,340
what's the impact on individuals how is

00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:55,340
it keeping you or helping you from

00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:57,530
getting stuff done imes and glance did

00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,210
some research back in the late 70s and

00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,650
they did some research on a pool of

00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:03,950
high-achieving women Europe

00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:06,080
self-reported impostor syndrome and they

00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:09,260
found that people really reported

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,700
feelings of inadequacy and when reading

00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:13,910
about Social Sciences it's really

00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,050
tempting to take your own feelings on

00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,700
your own view of the world you're on

00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:19,160
anecdotal evidence and apply it to the

00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:22,640
data and for me at least that feels

00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,200
right they found that people who

00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,890
reported suffering from impostor

00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:29,470
syndrome actively avoided displaying the

00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:34,900
skills that they felt that they were

00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:37,640
lacking in and again that feels right

00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:39,420
but they also found the people who

00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,820
reported suffering from a

00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:44,160
sundram reported the use of charm of

00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:48,300
social mitigation that they would often

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,730
use soft skills to an often in avoiding

00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,770
displays of their skills they would use

00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:55,620
people skills to sort of weave around

00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:57,930
that oh I would love to do that thing

00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,340
that I feel terrible about but you know

00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:01,530
before we do this thing that I'm

00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,000
terrified of can we talk about this

00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:04,590
thing you've done recently that's really

00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,440
cool can we talk about how great you are

00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:12,270
and hopefully stall through that and

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,850
they also found the people who suffered

00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:18,330
from Impostors and reported increased

00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:20,730
levels of contact with their skill they

00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:22,710
were much less likely to display the

00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:24,690
skill that they felt inadequate at but

00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:27,930
they spent longer contact hours working

00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:31,230
at it solon all impostor syndrome is a

00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:32,910
terrible feeling but the results on an

00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:36,120
individual's competency what you

00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:39,180
actually get out of the work kind of

00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:45,510
varies it's a bit good and it sucks a

00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:46,890
lot so who's impacted by it I've already

00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:50,340
warned you guys that I was a teacher

00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:52,170
I've already warned you guys that I am a

00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,850
little bit cheaper for the hangover

00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:56,400
thing could we get the house lights for

00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:58,670
a second please if you've ever felt like

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,660
a fraud could I get your hands up please

00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:01,890
great keep them up for just a second

00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,400
everybody look around to see who does

00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:08,850
not have their hands up ah this is going

00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,990
to be relevant later so for those of you

00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,340
on the video who can't see all the

00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:14,040
beautiful people i'd say like maybe

00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:18,720
seventy percent of our lovely attendees

00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:21,300
are today and this is a great quick and

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,220
dirty sampling but let's let's look at

00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,860
the studies so coming back to ions and

00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:27,810
clans they found you know we think that

00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:30,630
high-achieving women are most often

00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:33,600
impacted by impostor syndrome and okay

00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:37,110
but i kind of deliberately set out to

00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:39,570
look at high-achieving women so let's

00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:45,260
look at another study Vera Vasquez in

00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:47,550
corona in 2006 which is a decade ago ah

00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:49,540
found that high-achieving women of color

00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:52,209
were most often impacted

00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:53,589
and I'm gonna be slightly hyperbolic

00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:56,980
because I didn't read all of the studies

00:08:53,589 --> 00:08:59,560
but after reading all of the studies the

00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:01,839
TLDR is high achieving visible

00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,540
minorities especially women in those

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:09,639
groups reported feeling imposter

00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:11,139
syndrome at a much higher level but we

00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:12,839
just did a quick and dirty sampling and

00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:17,560
we've got a really representative group

00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:19,420
who all were just like a bit so what's

00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,980
with the discrepancy why do we have I

00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:23,649
don't think we're ready to peer review

00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:25,569
our hand raising but what's with the

00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:27,339
discrepancy between what the studies are

00:09:25,569 --> 00:09:30,910
reporting and what we're seeing reported

00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:34,029
here and I think there's a couple really

00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:38,860
interesting things there so I think that

00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:41,259
you see women reporting feelings of

00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:43,720
inadequacy reporting feelings of feeling

00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:46,509
out of place reporting feelings of

00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,250
feeling like a fraud because it's a lot

00:09:46,509 --> 00:09:51,910
more acceptable for women to talk about

00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:56,050
feelings of any kind I think for men

00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:58,720
it's often aggressively actively or

00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:02,139
passive aggressively you're discouraged

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:06,959
from saying I feel anything let alone

00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:09,370
saying I feel this very vulnerable thing

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:12,699
and I think that's really unfair i think

00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:14,139
that's unfortunate i think that you see

00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:16,149
a discrepancy in reporting as well

00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:20,260
because of representation representation

00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:23,800
matters if i am a squishy orange emoji

00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:25,600
face i'm feeling like i don't quite

00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,329
belong here I don't know what I'm doing

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,690
everything is not okay I can look around

00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:34,990
me and if my peer group is also squishy

00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:39,149
orange emoji faces and they all seem to

00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:41,980
know what they're doing right I mean

00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:44,079
they look like me and they sound like me

00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:46,839
and they act like me and we share the

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:49,899
same values and they're all doing fine I

00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:52,660
can see myself in their success I can

00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:57,009
see myself in their confidence and maybe

00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:59,889
everything's okay but if I'm an awkward

00:10:57,009 --> 00:11:02,529
cat face and I'm looking around my peer

00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:03,300
group and the people i'm around the

00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:05,040
people who were

00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,649
doing well the people who are successful

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,050
the people who I can see as role models

00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:13,680
people modeling confidence if they don't

00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:17,310
look like me I'm not really able to take

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:19,950
as much out of that say well all of them

00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:23,850
look like they're doing great but we're

00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:27,810
very different that's okay it's not

00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:30,450
quite as reassuring I'd also internalize

00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:33,000
discrimination so we'd love to live in a

00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:35,730
bias-free world and potentially even in

00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,410
a cognitive bias free world but we're

00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:39,329
not quite there yet so if you've got

00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:40,920
people who are not well represented

00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:43,980
within a community and they're getting

00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,959
either overt or subtle messages about

00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,790
how they're not necessarily the people

00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:50,459
who belong they're not necessarily the

00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:52,260
people who carry skill it's really

00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:54,870
tempting to internalize those messages

00:11:52,260 --> 00:12:01,050
and let them back out as imposter

00:11:54,870 --> 00:12:03,750
syndrome creating this cycle of oh and I

00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:06,990
think increasingly technologies really

00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:11,339
impacted what impostor syndrome feels

00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:12,870
like so back in the day back not that

00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:15,180
long ago I think we've got a lot of

00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:18,390
young ends in the crowd so social media

00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:21,089
is you and before social media if you

00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:22,770
wanted to compare yourself to people you

00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:24,630
were comparing yourself to public

00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:26,970
figures celebrities politicians and

00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:29,520
you'd expect their lives to look very

00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:32,579
different than yours right now we've got

00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:35,610
almost real-time access to extremely

00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:37,320
curated feeds I can look at my peer

00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:39,390
group I can look at my role models and

00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,450
they're telling me in almost real time

00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:45,089
what's going on in their lives so I get

00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:48,360
the chance to compare my life to their

00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:51,870
lives with a massive mismatch I'm

00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:55,190
comparing the whole of my lived

00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:59,250
experience to very carefully to curated

00:12:55,190 --> 00:13:01,260
media feeds if I go out for a fabulously

00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:03,570
fancy dinner I'm going to take a picture

00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:06,560
of that I'm gonna probably put to social

00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:09,180
media and pretend I'm fancy all the time

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,850
but if I have a really hard day at work

00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:14,100
or if I give a talk that just doesn't do

00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:15,680
what it should do I'm not gonna go on

00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:20,480
social media and say like hi

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:22,310
feel like a failure I cry at night no so

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,920
the fancy dinners were comparing

00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:26,920
ourselves to everyone's fancy dinners

00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:33,980
okay if any of you read the abstract I

00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:35,990
made some really big claims I I claimed

00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:39,560
i would give you tools to help manage

00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:41,540
impostor syndrome which is great cuz

00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,820
that really causes some meta impostor

00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:45,380
syndrome I don't know what I'm doing I'm

00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,930
talking to you about not knowing why I'm

00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:52,010
doing I'm trying to tell you how to do

00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:55,600
ah but let's let's try and because

00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:55,600
you're all very very nice people yes

00:13:55,690 --> 00:14:02,480
modest too the first thing you clearly

00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:04,220
want to ask is Jess how can I help other

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:08,420
people who might be feeling this way say

00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:09,470
Oh guys you're lovely and you want to

00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,760
make it better for others you want to

00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:12,290
help other people who feel like they

00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,510
might not belong that they might be

00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:17,440
faking that things might suck and the

00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:21,529
first thing I'm gonna ask you to do is

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,060
use your slides correctly never tell

00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:25,070
someone else that they have impostor

00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,620
syndrome don't label that for someone

00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:29,240
else if someone comes to you and says

00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:30,500
you know at work I'm having the

00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,570
situation where I don't really have the

00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:35,150
skills to do this or I'm not really

00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:38,140
supported in doing that and you say oh

00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:42,410
that's just imposter syndrome it's fine

00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:44,209
that's a bit of just by like you people

00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:46,490
can be telling you about a wide range of

00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:49,040
experiences they can be telling you I

00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:51,260
don't have the skill set to do this task

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,060
they could be saying I want support they

00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,890
can be saying I'm not supported by my

00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:57,230
peer group or my community they could

00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:58,970
say I am in a bad situation and I'm not

00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,310
getting the feedback from peers that i

00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:03,620
need and his way that away with like all

00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:08,959
that's imposter syndrome is super not

00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:11,930
helpful and kind of a jerk move we live

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:15,079
in an amazing communication environment

00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:17,740
in seconds I can tell almost anybody

00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:22,250
what I think about something and I think

00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:24,020
do we use this mostly force mark social

00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,990
media mass communications you can reach

00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,790
out and tell some

00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,959
what'd you think of their project what

00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:30,420
you think of their work what you think

00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:33,029
of them as a person and I would love to

00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:36,270
see us doing that nicely so who here

00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:39,480
uses open source technologies this warms

00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:41,910
my cold little heart and who here has

00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,500
reported issues on them and who here

00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:46,700
keep your hands that has reported nice

00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:49,140
things that you like about them if

00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:51,120
you're using something every day it's

00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:53,250
really tempting to just get in touch

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,740
when something breaks if something

00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:57,570
breaks us really freshing but let people

00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,700
know let people in your communities know

00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:01,890
let people in your personal circles now

00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:04,110
let people at your jobs know when things

00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:05,850
are awesome say do you know what I use

00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:07,820
this feature every day I see you

00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:10,560
contributed to it thank you very much

00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:14,010
give people feedback that's content

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:16,890
heavy say I saw you did this this is

00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:20,310
pretty great thank you very much create

00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:24,810
sort of bubbles of positive niceness but

00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:27,390
keep sending issues in and talk about it

00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:29,029
talk about your own doubts if you're in

00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:31,920
a place where you feel confident to

00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:34,230
saying I feel like I'm thinking it all

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:39,240
the time and I'm scared he's a little

00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:42,270
bit of a big dumb and but almost

00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,829
everyone here because of the way our

00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:45,959
peer groups are saved and because of the

00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:47,430
way we work in technology almost all of

00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:50,760
you whether or not you think about it

00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:52,079
you're a role model for someone else one

00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,180
of your peers is looking at you and

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,640
saying oh wow this person is doing

00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:59,550
amazing work and they think you are

00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:02,100
doing everything right no one has any

00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:04,709
idea that you're terrified which is

00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,240
great but if you're willing to model a

00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:07,620
little bit of that vulnerability if

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,540
you're willing to model a little bit of

00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,370
those doubts you're giving people a

00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:15,420
script within which to view their own

00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:17,040
doubts other people are great yeah yeah

00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:21,329
other people you want to fix it for you

00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:24,270
yeah there's no way that you can

00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:26,850
permanently rewire your meat brain to

00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:28,650
not deal with cognitive biases your

00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:30,510
brain is great but your brain is not

00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:34,440
your friend here so we're going to look

00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:36,510
at really temporary fixes third-party

00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,310
assessment assessment that is not

00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:40,190
connected

00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:42,590
to your own image of your own skills is

00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:44,000
an amazing way to do this I know

00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:47,180
professional certifications are very

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,670
very boring but getting the test numbers

00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:52,460
back that say I am good at these things

00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:56,230
is a wonderful way to start building a

00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:58,190
wall of data against your meat brain

00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:00,350
contribute open source projects

00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:04,130
contribute with mentoring help other

00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:07,610
people build evidence of your own skill

00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:14,210
set around you build a wall of actually

00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:16,700
I'm quite good piss off doubts and more

00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:20,330
than the cognitive bias is happening day

00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:24,320
in day out I'm worried about the ahh

00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:27,260
effect if you get into a cycle of doubt

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,870
not the overarching cognitive biases but

00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:32,990
the feeling that sick wet sad cold

00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:36,770
feeling you want to be able to interrupt

00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:39,560
that if I'm caught in massive cycles of

00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:41,980
doubt I'm not getting a lot done I'm

00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:46,370
going to pace a bit i'm going to worry

00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:48,290
I'm not going to do an amazing job being

00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:50,000
able to recognize when you're being

00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:51,800
undermined by your own doubts when

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,080
imposter syndrome is really hamstringing

00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:57,020
you and being able to step in is an

00:18:54,080 --> 00:19:00,290
amazing way to get things done the last

00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:02,030
time I gave this talk I unwittingly sort

00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:05,600
of admitted something embarrassing I do

00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:07,550
for stress relief and my designer saw

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:11,780
that and decided to include it in the

00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:14,630
slides so find something that works for

00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:16,550
you if I am remarkably stressed out and

00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:18,500
I have no idea what I'm doing I will

00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:21,440
sometimes shamefully take cupcakes into

00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:23,660
the bath I would not necessarily

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,580
recommend doing this as your stress

00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:28,760
relief because it's weird and kind of

00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:32,120
gross but find something that works for

00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:34,670
you not just for impostor center but

00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,890
find something where you get stillness

00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:39,500
and value out of if you want to go play

00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:41,630
tabletop games and relax if you are one

00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,340
of those beautiful weirdos that I envy

00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:46,100
where exercise really gets you through a

00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:48,400
day come and tell me how you do that but

00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,700
do that when you find yourself

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,769
overloaded by a

00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,840
posture syndrome in doubt go do the

00:19:51,769 --> 00:20:00,110
things that let you debug those weird

00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:02,539
vil voices cognitive biases are horrible

00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:04,130
and great because your brain is horrible

00:20:02,539 --> 00:20:05,929
and great I'm going to take you on a

00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:08,179
quick detour we've been talking about

00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:09,649
impostor sent him the whole time and I

00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:13,549
want to talk about dunning-kruger really

00:20:09,649 --> 00:20:16,760
fast back to imposter syndrome we saw

00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:20,450
that two of these things sucked and two

00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:22,220
of these things are kind of okay I want

00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:26,480
to look at another cognitive bias in the

00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:31,370
context of impostor syndrome has anybody

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:34,370
ever used lemon juices invisible ink so

00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:37,580
back in the 90s a bank robber covered

00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:39,350
his face with lemon juice and robbed a

00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:42,049
bank during broad daylight later

00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:46,029
explaining to the police that he

00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:46,029
expected the CCTV not to pick him up

00:20:46,389 --> 00:20:54,529
bless to cornell researchers named

00:20:51,139 --> 00:20:57,139
Dunning and Kruger saw this and being

00:20:54,529 --> 00:20:58,549
researchers I would have said look at

00:20:57,139 --> 00:21:00,590
that that's quite funny i'll post that

00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:02,899
on the internet and they said let's get

00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:08,690
some grant money cuz i wonder if stupid

00:21:02,899 --> 00:21:10,760
people know they're stupid so they took

00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:13,039
about 2,500 people and gave them an

00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:17,299
aptitude test just a general like thick

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:19,700
or not thick and their test results look

00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:21,590
like this very very predictable what we

00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,149
expect from test results and i love

00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:27,169
talking about this cuz the word quartile

00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:29,690
is one of my favorite words and you get

00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:30,950
a very very predictable strip spread but

00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:33,169
before they gave people their test

00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:34,850
scores they gave him a test paper took

00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:36,320
the paper away and gave them a graph and

00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:39,049
said you know can you show me on this

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:44,870
graph how you think you did relative to

00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:48,049
your peer group and you'd be shocked but

00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:49,659
the lowest performing quartile predicted

00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:52,760
their scores relative their peers

00:21:49,659 --> 00:21:54,889
massively inflated and you get sort of

00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:57,440
an inverse X that third quartile they've

00:21:54,889 --> 00:21:59,559
got a decent idea but the more skilled

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,700
you are the more likely you are to

00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:06,430
underestimate

00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:09,160
your relative ability and they want to

00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:11,350
say the unskilled they have no idea that

00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,670
they're dumb well the odds they're quite

00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:14,470
a bit more generous than I am so let's

00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:17,350
say unskilled that's quite see the

00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:23,410
unskilled have no idea that they're

00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:26,620
unskilled the unskilled have no basis to

00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:29,290
value skill and other people and they

00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:31,270
can totally move past this but to move

00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:32,680
past us and develop skill they would

00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:39,190
have to recognize their own lack of

00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:42,460
skill which this is great cuz I've

00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:43,990
totally worked with this person I think

00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:47,140
as everybody here totally worked with

00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:55,510
this person and it's not frustrating at

00:22:47,140 --> 00:23:00,160
all it's amazing it's not great you

00:22:55,510 --> 00:23:01,810
can't do anything they have no idea what

00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:08,230
they're doing and they think you're

00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:10,390
brilliant and wait maybe imposter

00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:11,440
syndrome in telling us that we have no

00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:14,320
idea what we're doing there were

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,480
failures maybe this is the only way that

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:20,170
we can tell that we've got competency if

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:23,230
you were actually an unskilled you would

00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:27,430
have no idea who here did raise their

00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:30,160
hands we'll just assume you got was just

00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:32,200
a bit of a bluster and rub bravado so if

00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:35,710
I was gonna give you individual ways to

00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:38,410
sort of look at impostor syndrome I'd

00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:40,960
ask you to reframe it imposter syndrome

00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:43,360
is not your brain telling you you suck

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,210
it's your brain telling you that

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,730
actually you're probably above average

00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:50,890
but in a really unhelpful way instead of

00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:51,880
feeling like a fraud I'd like you to

00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:56,520
feel like you're pulling one over on

00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,520
somebody cool thank you very much

00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:00,210
