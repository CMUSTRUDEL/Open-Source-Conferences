Title: PHP UK Conference 2016 - Szymon Skórczyński - Docker & PHP development and deployment
Publication date: 2016-03-17
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2016
Description: 
	Docker has recently been one of the hottest words in the web technology world. But why is it so? Isn’t it just another “hyper tool” that will be forgotten in a year? I’ve been using Docker for one year to develop and deploy both professional and pet projects. During this year I worked out my very own set of best practices to deal with Docker, that I’d like to share with you. Why is Docker so popular? Is it hard to use it? How to use it to develop PHP applications and how to deploy them into the cloud? What are the main threats of Docker? Is it worth to use it? If you ever thought about any of these questions, this presentation should be interesting for you.
