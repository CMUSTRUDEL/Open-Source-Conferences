Description: 
	It's a tough world out there. There are so many new things to learn, and the list of need-to-know's changes every day. How do you keep up? How do you move ahead? Find a mentor - but wait! Isn't this a dog-eat-dog field where admitting you don't know something is the death of your career? Maybe back in 1995, but this is the new age of open source. Collaboration and sharing of information reigns. Find a mentor to help you excel, but more importantly, find someone to mentor. Being a mentor is challenging, rewarding, and keeps you on your toes. Learn what it takes to find a mentor, be a good mentor, and what tools can help you build your mentoring relationship.

	00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:10,380
so as you just heard I'm a PHP developer

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:13,230
I'm a user group leader I am both a

00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,520
mentor and an apprentice so I am working

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,610
on both sides of the mentoring

00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,170
relationship and i can't tell you which

00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,490
side i like better so that's why i'm

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,160
going to talk about both sides today

00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,320
during my talk I'm also a stay-at-home

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,480
mom and I run a consulting company I do

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,920
a lot of freelancing as you heard i do a

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:34,170
number of other things as well outside

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:35,879
of PHP I like to be busy so I am totally

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,409
happy with audience participation I

00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:41,190
apologize for the people in the other

00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:42,480
room who may have a harder time but if

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,769
you want to pop your head in here and

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,030
wave at me I'm happy to answer questions

00:00:43,769 --> 00:00:50,429
or I will try to keep it no okay good no

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,679
no I'm not disappointed I don't know if

00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:53,819
anyone else understands but I get super

00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:55,019
nervous knowing there's a bunch of

00:00:53,819 --> 00:00:58,559
people staring at me that I can't even

00:00:55,019 --> 00:01:00,510
tell are staring at me so that's totally

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,969
vine okay so I'm totally fine with

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:06,659
questions at any time so get my

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:07,890
attention if you have any questions so I

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,900
just want to start with a little bit

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,640
about what this talk is not this talk is

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,140
not a magic formula that will work for

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,090
everybody and make your mentoring

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,920
relationship perfect there is no such

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,840
thing as one perfect formula for

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,940
mentoring because every person is

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,920
different so every relationship is going

00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,570
to be different so you need to take a

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,580
look at the things that I am offering

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,810
here and I don't even do all of the

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,610
things that I'm offering here because

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,680
not all of them work for me or for the

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,150
people that I'm mentoring with so you

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,280
have to take a look at what's going to

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:38,340
work best for you and then judge which

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,900
ones will help the most so I'm going to

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,510
start from the side of the relationship

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,420
of the apprentices so when you're

00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:47,040
talking about being an apprentice the

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,990
very first thing you need to do before

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,630
you find a mentor before you take a look

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,910
at online resources you need to take a

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,770
look at what do you need out of this

00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,840
relationship why do you want to have a

00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,400
mentor it's going to be hard to find a

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,180
mentor to give you what you want if you

00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,980
don't know what you want so start by

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,350
sitting down and defining first of all

00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,659
why do you want a mentor do you want to

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:12,300
improve your coding skills do you want

00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:14,760
to learn a specific skill do you just

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,220
want to have someone to talk to to

00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,510
encourage you to keep learning what do

00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,510
you want from this mentor

00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:26,370
next up once you know what you want

00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:28,800
define your goals now these goals should

00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:31,050
be specific goals they should be

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,510
tangible things that you can actually

00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,540
measure success against so you don't

00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:38,100
want to say oh I just want to learn more

00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:40,710
because obviously you can always learn

00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,660
more you could never accomplish having

00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:44,400
learned more we need something that we

00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,710
know specifically okay yes I

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,240
accomplished this these are the kinds of

00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,130
things you want to be able to tell your

00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:54,510
mentor I want to be able to accomplish

00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:56,850
these steps next up your timeline is

00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,800
this something oh I need to learn this

00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,930
right now because next week I have to

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,130
use it is this something oh this is

00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,500
something I sort of want to learn

00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:06,780
sometime in the future anytime in the

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,340
next six months or the next year maybe

00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,050
your goal is that you want to speak at a

00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,750
conference so you have a specific

00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:18,030
conference in mind that's a deadline for

00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:19,440
your goal once you know what you want

00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,750
out of the relationship and you have

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,730
some idea of when you need it you need

00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:27,300
to know what kind of relationship you

00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:30,180
want to have so what do you expect from

00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,250
your mentor do you expect them to chat

00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,140
with you on the phone every week do you

00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,420
want someone in person who can meet with

00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,770
you for coffee every other week do you

00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,950
want someone who's going to skype with

00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:42,870
you once a month do you want someone who

00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,790
will just be around and available to

00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,460
answer questions via email if you have

00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:52,560
questions what kind of a mentor do you

00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:55,410
want to have and lastly you have to make

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,990
a commitment to the work mentoring is

00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:00,420
very hard being an apprentice is a lot

00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:02,160
of work you need to make sure that you

00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,810
are ready to do this work because you're

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,660
asking a mentor to take time out of

00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,850
their day or their month and give you

00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:10,350
knowledge in this relationship and you

00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,850
need to respect that time that they're

00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,720
giving you so you need to make sure that

00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:17,790
you are ready to put in the effort here

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,160
once you are now you need to find a

00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:23,040
mentor and there's a great website

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,570
called PHP mentoring org there are a lot

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,600
of mentoring websites out there this one

00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:29,520
is specifically PHP focused it's a free

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,590
service you can sign up to be either a

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,340
mentor or an apprentice on PHP mentoring

00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,440
gorg

00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,540
and I will say that right now there is

00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,880
an overabundance of mentors looking for

00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,620
apprentices so if you are thinking oh

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,930
it'll be too hard to find a mentor

00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,690
you're wrong there's tons of people out

00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:47,720
there looking for apprentices so if you

00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:51,780
are looking for a mentor please stop by

00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:54,360
other places you can look as well github

00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:58,979
has the PHP mentoring information as

00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:01,860
well and then you can also check in the

00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:03,750
PHP mentoring IRC chat there's an IRC

00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,630
channel on freenode if you aren't

00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:08,310
familiar with IRC there is a handy web

00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,840
interface so you don't have to install

00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,590
anything you can just pop on the web

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,210
interface and pop in the channel and ask

00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:17,669
you can also check for people who have

00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:20,250
spoken on the topic so you can check

00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:21,870
SlideShare joined in PHP not has a list

00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,400
of conferences you can check so if

00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,500
there's a specific topic you're looking

00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,970
for find someone who's spoken on that

00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,680
topic and see if they would be

00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,930
interested in mentoring you or if they

00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,310
may know someone else in that field who

00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,430
would be interested in mentoring you on

00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:38,100
that topic you can also check your local

00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:41,310
user group PHP ug has a list of user

00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:43,470
groups Nomad PHP also has videos on

00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,840
topics and speakers as well that you can

00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:48,599
get a list of and meetup com is another

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,130
place to find user groups or groups that

00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:54,090
meet to talk about the topic that you're

00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:55,979
interested in podcasts are another place

00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:57,450
to look for mentors if you can find a

00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:59,070
podcast on the topic that you're looking

00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:03,200
for see who was talking about it and

00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:03,200
here are some podcasts you can check out

00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:09,840
now from the mentoring Side mentors also

00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,460
need to define their needs and what

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,770
they're looking for out of the mentoring

00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,840
relationship believe or not a mentoring

00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:17,250
relationship being the mentor doesn't

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,320
just mean you are giving to the other

00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:22,229
person it is amazing how much you will

00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,030
get out of the relationship as well so

00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:25,560
define for yourself why do you want to

00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,570
be a mentor are you interested in

00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,490
helping someone do you like teaching on

00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:31,530
a certain topic what is it that you

00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,510
really want out of this do you want to

00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:35,039
be challenged to continue your learning

00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:37,680
because when you're teaching someone

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:41,760
else you have to learn at first what is

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,169
it that you want out of this as a mentor

00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,000
it's important to set your boundaries

00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:46,770
and it's important to set these

00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,780
advanced it's really hard once a

00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:52,800
relationship has started to go back and

00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:54,240
set boundaries retro actively so it's

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,030
good to think about what your boundaries

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,070
are in advance do you mind if someone

00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:01,380
stops by your house to say hello and ask

00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:03,360
you a question do you care if they call

00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,920
you on the phone are there certain hours

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,160
of the day you'd prefer they not call

00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,600
you on the phone those kinds of things

00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,770
let you know what you're going to be

00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,420
comfortable with in the mentoring

00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:15,080
relationship and what kind of mentoring

00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:18,180
relationship is going to work for you

00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:21,090
another important step is how will you

00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,400
react when a boundary is crossed will

00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:25,500
you feel comfortable emailing the person

00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,970
to talk about it will you feel

00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,930
comfortable talking to them about it in

00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:32,940
person if a boundary is crossed what do

00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:35,700
you want to happen at that point do you

00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,560
want to end the moon during relationship

00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,870
do you want to just talk about it and

00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,250
fix it and move on these kinds of things

00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,080
are important to think about in advance

00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,400
because it's difficult to think about

00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,169
them sort of in the heat of the moment

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,330
so if you can spend some time thinking

00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:49,740
about it before the relationship starts

00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:52,229
and before you're invested in this

00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:55,830
person it can be a lot easier to discuss

00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:57,960
it with them next up you'll need to

00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:00,900
define what do you know about what can

00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,940
you mentor on what are you willing to

00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,370
teach about what are you willing to talk

00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,169
about what are areas that maybe you're

00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:09,330
good at and this can be difficult for

00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:11,130
some people I know it was difficult for

00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:13,080
me to think about it first we all have a

00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,580
bit of imposter syndrome and we think oh

00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,650
I don't have anything to offer people

00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:18,390
but we all have something to offer and

00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:20,220
if you're not able to think of something

00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:22,050
that you'd be exceptionally good at for

00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,729
mentoring talk to the people who work

00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:25,560
with you or people who know you other

00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:27,960
people are a lot better at seeing what

00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,760
we're good at then we are necessarily so

00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,590
find out what you're good at and find

00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,180
out what level you're good at even if

00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:35,280
you're only at sort of an intermediary

00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,780
level on something you're still

00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,060
perfectly capable of helping out a

00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:41,099
beginner so you don't have to be the top

00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,560
expert in your field on a certain topic

00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:45,630
to be a good mentor you just need to be

00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:49,280
honest about the level you're at so that

00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:51,750
the apprentice knows what to expect and

00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,940
also mentors need to be able to commit

00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:56,040
to the work being a mentor is a lot of

00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,830
hard work and it's a lot more work than

00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,190
you may think at first I know going in

00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,340
when I

00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:03,990
first started mentoring I picked up for

00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,700
apprentices because there were so many

00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:07,020
apprentices available I thought oh I can

00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,030
help all of them this is going to be so

00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:11,550
great and then real life sinks in and

00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:14,180
you realize okay I really can't devote

00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:16,650
the time I need to all of these people

00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,450
so you have to be willing to commit and

00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:22,590
understand that it is a lot of work it's

00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:25,350
going to take a lot of time when you're

00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:27,300
looking for an apprentice once again PHP

00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:30,050
mentoring gorg I'll only mention at four

00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:33,660
or five more times during this talk so

00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:35,490
PHP mentoring org has a large list of

00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,140
mentors already there but feel free to

00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:40,530
make the list longer we're always still

00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:42,510
looking for new mentors but take a look

00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:44,160
at where people are asking questions a

00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:46,860
lot of people ask questions in IRC

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,840
channels Stack Overflow reddit not

00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,970
necessarily the greatest places to sift

00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:53,250
through but if you find someone who is

00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:54,780
asking a question they may be interested

00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,630
in being mentored on the topic if you

00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:59,580
have the answer you can check to at

00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:02,100
local universities at your user groups

00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,900
meetups things like that there's going

00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,210
to be people asking questions at all of

00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,830
those kind of gatherings and perhaps

00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:09,690
students at universities would be

00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:12,450
interested in a mentor as well a lot of

00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:14,100
them are new to the industry new to

00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:16,200
working at a job outside of the

00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,300
university and maybe really interested

00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:25,110
in hearing just what's it like to have a

00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:27,690
job in the real world yeah exactly yeah

00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:29,100
and then let the rest of us no fright so

00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:30,630
once you've found a mentor or an

00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,360
apprentice you need to build the

00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:35,250
relationship you want to make sure that

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,050
your needs a line if you've both sat

00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,090
down and sort of defined what you want

00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:41,640
out of the mentoring relationship that

00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:43,560
conversation can be really easy okay i

00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,660
want to have someone who meets once a

00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,790
month this person wants to have someone

00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:51,300
who meets every week probably not the

00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:52,800
greatest relationship but maybe you can

00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,020
make it work somehow and compromise on

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,240
twice a month so kind of talk through

00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:59,370
where your needs a line where they don't

00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,020
align what can you do about it again

00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:03,030
it's very easy to talk about these

00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:05,250
things upfront before you get into it

00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:07,470
before you start but it's very very

00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,450
difficult to sort of go back and try to

00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:12,089
force it in to something that's already

00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:12,630
evolved into something else so start

00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:15,090
these things

00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,800
up front very very important to make

00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:18,330
sure your boundaries align and to make

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,580
sure those boundaries are very clear

00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:22,590
from the beginning a lot of people don't

00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,030
mean to cross boundaries but if you

00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:25,320
don't know a boundary is there you don't

00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:27,630
necessarily know you're about to cross

00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,700
it so if somebody's not comfortable

00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:32,220
being called at home but they don't make

00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,930
that clear then their apprentice may

00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,580
start calling them at home completely

00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:37,830
unaware that they're making their mentor

00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:39,030
very uncomfortable so just putting those

00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,430
things out there right from the start

00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:45,930
can make things a lot easier and have

00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:47,760
things go a lot more smoothly beyond

00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:50,070
that a little bit of chemistry can go a

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,110
long way as well are you comfortable

00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:55,260
talking to each other do you trust each

00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:56,400
other having an apprentice means you

00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,200
need to trust them with the information

00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:01,200
you're giving you you need to trust them

00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:03,060
to respect your boundaries and you need

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,130
to trust them to put in the effort if

00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:07,410
you're going to put forth effort on your

00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,850
part you want to feel confident that

00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:11,340
they are going to put in the effort to

00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:13,440
and not let you down on an apprentice

00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,730
side you need to trust that your mentor

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,190
is not going to laugh at you when you

00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:19,860
ask a question this is a relationship of

00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:21,900
trust on your part as well it's not easy

00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,670
to say hey I don't know anything about

00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,320
this will you teach me that's not an

00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:26,880
easy thing to say so you need to find a

00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,520
mentor that you feel comfortable being

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,910
able to say that too because you want to

00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:34,170
be honest in the relationship if you

00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:35,640
pretend you know more than you do in the

00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,020
mentoring relationship you're not going

00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:41,550
to get out of it what you need to get

00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:43,560
out of it once you've sort of define the

00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:45,570
relationship and you know establish that

00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,150
it's going to work the next thing is to

00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:50,730
create deliverables now this sounds a

00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:52,800
little bit administrative but having

00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:54,930
tangible deliverables based on those

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,510
goals that you created earlier can

00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:59,940
really be helpful so when you have a

00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:02,250
goal I recommend about three tangible

00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,050
deliverables to get to that goal that

00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,940
way it's not like oh I want to speak at

00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,110
a conference it's like okay well let me

00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,970
know if you need any help and I'll see

00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:11,370
you at the conference that's probably

00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:13,290
not going to work very well set up okay

00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:16,410
well you need an abstract to submit to

00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:18,000
the CFP so March twelfth we're going to

00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:19,910
sit down and talk about the abstract so

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,200
make sure you have it written by then or

00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:23,970
maybe by march first you have to have a

00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,160
topic then we'll talk about how to write

00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:28,819
an abstract by March twelfth and by

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,949
April first you can submit it to the CFP

00:13:28,819 --> 00:13:34,230
having those kinds of stages defined

00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:36,269
helps not only the apprentice know what

00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,980
they have to get done but helps keep

00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:42,240
everything on track to achieving those

00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:44,459
goals successfully if you're going to be

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,769
meeting in person or on the phone or on

00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:49,170
video chat or even just in some sort of

00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:51,329
chat program make sure you set dates for

00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:52,860
multiple meetings it's really easy to

00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:54,930
set the date for the first meeting and

00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,209
then sort of forget to schedule any

00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:59,879
other ones so I recommend trying to set

00:13:57,209 --> 00:14:01,170
two or three of them in advance well

00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:02,610
you're very excited about the

00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:04,620
relationship and everything's new and

00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:06,870
you're looking at the calendar get a

00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,459
couple scheduled in advance once you can

00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:10,709
sort of get into the habit of meeting

00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:12,420
regularly it becomes easier and you

00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:14,160
start to expect that to be in your

00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,899
schedule but when you're first getting

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,019
started it could be very difficult to

00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:22,040
fit things in so setting multiple dates

00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:24,629
to meet in advance can be very helpful

00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,009
it's good to to keep an eye on the dates

00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:27,509
for those deliverables and try to

00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:29,790
schedule the meetings around those dates

00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:31,170
for the deliverables perhaps they're

00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,970
going to need to talk about it before

00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,860
they deliver whatever it is they're

00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:39,689
delivering so maybe set the meeting a

00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:41,550
week before the deliverable is due after

00:14:39,689 --> 00:14:43,430
the deliverable deadlines make sure you

00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:45,990
set a meeting for a relationship

00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:47,970
retrospective once you've achieved the

00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:51,750
goals they've set out it's time to

00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:53,970
evaluate the relationship evaluating the

00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:56,670
relationship is not a fun step but it's

00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:59,819
a really important one you want to

00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:03,360
evaluate okay we set these goals did we

00:14:59,819 --> 00:15:05,910
actually meet them yes or no are you

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,100
happy with how we met them are you happy

00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:09,720
with the result perhaps you met the

00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,309
deadlines but didn't get accepted to

00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,769
speak at the conference so you've

00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:15,899
partially met your goal what can we do

00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:17,880
next time to change this or is there

00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:19,529
another goal we can set for another

00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,529
conference that will work in the

00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:24,839
meantime talk about where you want to go

00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:27,509
from here do you want to set a new set

00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,819
of goals how have things been going with

00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:31,829
the relationship as far as our meetings

00:15:29,819 --> 00:15:34,889
do you feel comfortable talking to each

00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:36,240
other are you feeling comfortable in the

00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:38,610
knowledge that's being passed back and

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,660
forth have there been too many phone

00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,760
calls not enough

00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:44,610
phone calls our expectations on both

00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:50,250
sides being met these are the kinds of

00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:52,290
things that you want to talk about when

00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:54,380
you have your evaluation if things are

00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:57,360
working well and you want to continue

00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:59,880
you need to reset some new quantifiable

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,370
goals a new set of tangible deliverables

00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,170
and some new real deadlines that should

00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:08,010
say real deadlines those are the kinds

00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:11,760
of things spell check doesn't pick up so

00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:13,710
you want to have real deadlines again so

00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,630
you basically repeat that planning phase

00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:17,940
again and make sure to set another date

00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:20,760
for another evaluation to see if you

00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,980
want to keep going perhaps the

00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:26,580
relationship worked well but you don't

00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:28,380
need to continue well if you don't need

00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:30,480
to continue the relationship perhaps

00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:32,340
you've achieved your goal and now they

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,320
need a different kind of mentor perhaps

00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:36,210
they've exceeded your level perhaps

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,470
they've accomplished their goal and they

00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:40,140
just don't need a mentor right now

00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:43,230
that's okay that's good make sure you do

00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:45,240
a wrap up of some kind talk about still

00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:46,350
talk about how things went make sure

00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,700
that if you're going to be doing

00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:49,560
mentoring in the future if they're

00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:51,360
moving on to another mentor you talked

00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,010
about were there any things that we

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,980
could have done better on our sides of

00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:57,630
the relationship that way you can have

00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:00,750
some idea of what to improve on for next

00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:02,310
time if you're an apprentice and you're

00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:04,080
canceling on your mentor make sure they

00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:05,580
know the reason why don't leave them

00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,530
hanging thinking that something they

00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:09,900
said made you very upset let them know

00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:11,460
hey I've accomplished my goal I don't

00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,620
need to do this anymore but thank you so

00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:15,360
much for all your time and the thank you

00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:18,540
so much for all your time is very very

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,730
important even if things you know are

00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:22,530
not necessarily ending on the greatest

00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:25,650
of terms make sure you say thank you

00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:27,810
they've spent the time investing in you

00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:29,670
even if it wasn't necessarily ending up

00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:33,660
being what you wanted so make sure you

00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:36,440
say thank you sometimes the evaluations

00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:38,700
determined that things are not so great

00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,230
so if you have to end the mentoring

00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,030
relationship because because things

00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:44,250
aren't going well don't look at it as a

00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:47,030
failure sometimes things just don't work

00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:49,950
out and it's okay life gets in the way

00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:52,110
personalities don't mesh well there are

00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:53,520
just things that happen look at it as a

00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:56,100
chance to

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,840
do a wrap-up figure out what went wrong

00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,510
how you're going to change it for next

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,070
time make sure again you talk to your

00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,390
mentor and or apprentice about the

00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:05,340
reason that you're ending the

00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:06,750
relationship especially if it's

00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,550
something specific that they were doing

00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:12,060
this is something that they should be

00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:13,920
aware of and it's still important for an

00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:16,560
apprentice to show the mentor gratitude

00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:18,660
even if things didn't go well because

00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,340
they still made the effort to try maybe

00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:22,200
they didn't end up being able to come

00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:24,810
through in the long run but they still

00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,730
made that effort up front so it's really

00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:28,230
nice if you can still end things on a

00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:33,660
good note even if the relationship

00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:35,490
didn't necessarily go well there are a

00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:39,210
lot of tools that you can use to also

00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:40,950
help keep things going calendar

00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:42,300
reminders can be a great one whatever

00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:45,030
calendaring program you use that

00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:47,250
probably has reminders of some kind so

00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:49,290
make sure that you have reminders set

00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,540
for the meetings for the deliverables

00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:54,570
things like that if you don't have a

00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:57,090
specific to-do list I have a couple of

00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:59,070
to-do list there are a billion out there

00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:04,590
different tools whatever works best for

00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:07,440
you for the meetings you can use google

00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:09,090
hangouts Skype FaceTime even just slack

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,650
or IRC there's a lot of different ways

00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:12,900
you can do it if you're not able to meet

00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:14,190
in person which a lot of times you

00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:17,940
aren't since we're all scattered all

00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:19,620
over the world having scheduling tools

00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,570
for email can be very helpful especially

00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:23,940
if you're on the mentor side of things

00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:25,800
being able to say okay we're setting a

00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,330
delivery deadline of here I'm going to

00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,530
send you three reminder emails to make

00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,780
sure you get it done before then

00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:33,090
scheduling those in advance is very

00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:34,650
handy so you don't have to remember in

00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:37,200
the future oh I think I need to remind

00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:39,570
them today about this so scheduling

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,980
tools can be very handy MailChimp you

00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,750
can use for free I think if you're

00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,280
sending less than 10,000 emails a month

00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,690
which if you're sending that many

00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:50,820
reminders you probably have too many

00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:55,320
apprentices so so MailChimp is a free

00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:57,780
option also the ivory HQ blog post here

00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,490
has scheduling plug-ins for Gmail

00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:01,770
outlook and thunderbird so if you're

00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:04,980
using any of those email programs you

00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:06,400
can type up the emails in advance set a

00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:09,010
schedule date

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,840
then it will send approximately when

00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:13,540
your email is open during that time

00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,830
that's the only trick with those but if

00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:19,810
you're like me and your email is open

00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:20,710
all the time those work really well one

00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:22,720
thing that can be very helpful

00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:24,520
especially in a PHP type mentoring

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,670
relationship is being able to share and

00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:30,040
collaborate on code so Google Docs with

00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:32,440
track changes is a free option not a

00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,150
super great option but that is one

00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,730
option if you're working on something

00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:39,100
like talk abstracts or articles that

00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:40,570
someone wants to get published google

00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:44,410
docs will track changes can be very

00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:46,690
helpful otherwise collab edit and Cobra

00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:50,050
I owe our tools that both have a free

00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:52,390
tier and they are collaborative online

00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:54,640
tools they have code syntax highlighting

00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:58,360
their specifically designed for working

00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:01,030
on code simultaneously cobra dial also

00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:03,310
has a voice and video chat built into it

00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:05,650
as well so you can video chat or voice

00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:09,250
chat well York working on the code

00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:11,710
together so a really nice one and then I

00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:13,540
included an article that has 20 best

00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,670
code editors for real-time collaboration

00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:19,930
in case you want some more options I

00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:21,670
have not tried all of those so all right

00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:23,980
and I have a resources slide but my

00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:25,780
slides have already been posted so don't

00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:29,800
worry about the resources slide here you

00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:31,810
can look at those links later and a

00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:34,510
couple of thoughts just on mentoring in

00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:37,570
general so mentoring it's about sharing

00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:39,250
knowledge of course but the important

00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:41,680
thing about mentoring from both the

00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:44,980
apprentice side and the mentoring side

00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:47,290
is to stay active to be encouraged to

00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:49,690
stay active you want to actively learn

00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:52,420
participate in the community participate

00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:54,880
in the lives of other developers we all

00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:56,590
have our own experiences we all have our

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,260
own tools that we're using our own

00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:00,880
problems that we're accomplishing but we

00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:03,130
can learn so much from each other if we

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,870
can stay connected and that will help

00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:07,450
you to actively improve your coding

00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:09,490
skills which is vital valid A's to stay

00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:12,850
employed so something we're all pretty

00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:14,140
interested in and now I'd like to take a

00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:16,120
minute because I'm hoping you're all

00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:18,310
here because you're interested in either

00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,750
being a mentor or an apprentice and I

00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,290
just want to see if anyone has any

00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,150
question

00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:28,030
any specific situations they'd like to

00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:30,820
discuss about mentoring and there's no

00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:32,620
other room so you guys are it so Mike's

00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:36,010
as well oh and we're Mike right i forgot

00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:39,550
about the mics heaven I so I'm curious

00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:41,830
about and how much awareness there is in

00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:44,980
a mentorship community about you know

00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:47,350
the importance to listen and coaching

00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:49,000
and you know if they are awareness of

00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:51,610
the differences when do you have to step

00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,640
in and I step back and be a coach rather

00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:56,620
than be directive and guiding and you

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,020
know I'm not in that community so I

00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:02,230
wonder if there is their awareness and

00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:04,390
how's that and how is that going sure so

00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:06,850
the question is when to know to step

00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:08,530
back and when to push your apprentice a

00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:10,060
bit more from the better side yeah if

00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:12,130
there is an hour Enders of that in the

00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:14,530
mentorship you like it now it's time for

00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:17,260
me to listen nice time for me to guide

00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:18,880
and not give answers like now when they

00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,910
were to adopt a coaching style and not

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,170
giving answers if that's something that

00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:25,210
yeah it's really going to depend on the

00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:27,390
apprentice and also the mentor some

00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:30,100
mentors are very comfortable with

00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:31,810
listening and then doing gentle guiding

00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:35,020
some people's personalities just don't

00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:37,360
mesh well with that with apprentices to

00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,830
some apprentices like me as an

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,140
apprentice I need a lot of pushing

00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:43,900
because I tend to procrastinate things

00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:45,100
until the absolute last minute so I need

00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,870
a mentor who's going to be like hey you

00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,310
got it done yet how's it going you know

00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:49,900
checking in with me and making sure I'm

00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:52,390
not waiting until the last minute to get

00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:55,810
things done but other apprentices may

00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:58,000
want you know less pushing and they may

00:23:55,810 --> 00:24:00,460
feel very intimidated by the pushing and

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,320
may feel overwhelmed by it so it's

00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:04,060
that's really a sort of part of the

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,070
define your needs out of the

00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:08,890
relationship step you know if you're

00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:11,140
someone who really needs pushing that's

00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:13,240
great let them know if you're someone

00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:15,700
who is going to be like completely

00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:18,580
overwhelmed and get very frustrated with

00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:20,350
things if there's constant nagging then

00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,720
that's something you need to talk about

00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:24,700
up front because those kinds of things

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,210
really make a huge difference in a

00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:30,670
mentoring relationship is that kind of

00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:33,250
yeah I wouldn't say there's one good

00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:34,210
rule or you know rule of thumb for it

00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,740
because it's so diff

00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:38,050
depending on the people and what they

00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:39,850
need and what they're looking for but i

00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:41,670
will say that most mentors that I've

00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:46,320
talked to are very aware of that and

00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:48,250
sort of try to ask about that up front

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:55,120
there's a question of the front in the

00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:57,550
silent hi I am a mentor and I have a few

00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,130
mentees but I struggle sometimes to know

00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:01,770
when they go quiet how many times to

00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:05,440
ping them because to some extent

00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:07,870
mentoring as the mentor I'm not really

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,220
driving mi so what's appropriate there

00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:10,510
where you're not sure if they've lost

00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,520
interest or if you should be doing

00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:14,470
something mm-hmm that's a great question

00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,990
and that's another thing that is good to

00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:19,720
talk about up front like if you stop

00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:21,820
responding to me how much effort do you

00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:24,430
expect me to put into this to get you

00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:26,500
back because you know as a mentor

00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:28,690
especially if a mentor has multiple

00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,520
apprentices there's only so much time

00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:33,280
you can invest in someone who's not

00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,620
responding to you so I would say

00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:38,740
definitely you know two or three times

00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:40,720
is sort of my general go to rule because

00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:43,450
okay things get busy people are out of

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,130
town whatever you know so the first

00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:46,810
email is you know whatever the normal

00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:48,550
reminder is and then if you don't hear

00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:49,990
from them it's like hey did you get my

00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:52,330
email and if you still don't hear for

00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:54,670
them be like okay so my third reminder

00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:57,130
is sort of a if I don't hear from you by

00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:59,140
x date I'm just going to assume that you

00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:01,120
don't want to do this anymore so you

00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,980
know we'll just drop it if that you know

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,780
so let them know that you are going to

00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:07,270
be dropping them don't surprised them by

00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:10,750
not just suddenly dropping them and not

00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:13,930
responding again but so I try to make it

00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:15,850
clear in those emails where I am in the

00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:17,350
questioning process and what I'm

00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:19,480
expecting out of them if they don't

00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:26,130
respond so that would be my

00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:26,130
recommendation more questions

00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:32,779
I mean if I'm a team leader does it

00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:34,629
automatically make me a mentor or that

00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:37,909
does it have to be a former relationship

00:26:34,629 --> 00:26:41,239
as a team leader you're probably placed

00:26:37,909 --> 00:26:43,279
in a mentoring type role often but it

00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:46,279
doesn't automatically make you a mentor

00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:48,109
i would say at least in the team

00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:50,299
environments I've been in in companies

00:26:48,109 --> 00:26:52,489
the team leads are more of a manager and

00:26:50,299 --> 00:26:55,429
I view managers as very different than

00:26:52,489 --> 00:26:57,769
mentors because a manager has authority

00:26:55,429 --> 00:26:59,119
over you in a business setting they have

00:26:57,769 --> 00:27:00,859
a little bit more control over your

00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:03,259
career your projects you're working on

00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:06,049
and they also have their own job to do

00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:08,179
so part of their job yes is to make sure

00:27:06,049 --> 00:27:11,840
you're getting what you need but a

00:27:08,179 --> 00:27:13,549
mentor is more focused on okay let's sit

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,979
down what do you need to learn I'm here

00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:18,019
to support you and yes managers are

00:27:15,979 --> 00:27:20,509
there to support you too but it's in a

00:27:18,019 --> 00:27:22,279
very different role I guess so it's

00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:24,979
awesome if you can be a team leader and

00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:27,549
a mentor but I wouldn't expect that I

00:27:24,979 --> 00:27:30,440
guess you know because there are so many

00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:33,590
so many managerial responsibilities as

00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:35,330
well also in discussing sort of the

00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:37,580
trust that you need to build back and

00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:39,950
forth being able to go to your manager

00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:41,749
and say oh I have no idea about this I

00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:43,759
don't know anything about this would be

00:27:41,749 --> 00:27:45,889
great right but let's say you're not

00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:46,999
comfortable doing that whereas with a

00:27:45,889 --> 00:27:48,799
mentor you want to be comfortable

00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:50,269
admitting that you don't know something

00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,099
and that you need help with it or you're

00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:53,090
struggling with something and that's not

00:27:52,099 --> 00:27:56,570
always something you're comfortable

00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:58,070
doing with a superior at work so I would

00:27:56,570 --> 00:28:01,549
say as a team leader I would encourage

00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:02,629
you to of course mentor if someone asks

00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:04,639
you know if you're comfortable doing

00:28:02,629 --> 00:28:08,090
that and you have time to invest in it

00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:10,549
but really encourage your the people on

00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:12,889
your team to find mentors either outside

00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:16,340
of work or if it's more sensitive

00:28:12,889 --> 00:28:19,129
material within sort of their their team

00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:20,599
level I guess so that you know or

00:28:19,129 --> 00:28:22,220
someone from a different department

00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:23,779
who's not their direct supervisor kind

00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:31,759
of a thing so that they can sort of

00:28:23,779 --> 00:28:33,820
build up that trust um as a mentee is it

00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:36,950
expecting that you just have one mental

00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:40,039
no not at all um you can have multiple

00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:41,010
mentors as an apprentice what you do

00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:42,840
really

00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:44,280
pends on what you want to learn so if

00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,230
there are two different things you want

00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,970
to learn you may not be able to find a

00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:50,340
mentor who can mentor you on both of

00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:52,140
those topics I will say that if you have

00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,640
more than one mentor make sure you have

00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:56,100
the time for more than one mentor

00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,510
because you know the mentoring

00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:00,090
relationship can be very time consuming

00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:02,370
so make sure you have the time to devote

00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:05,040
to both of those topics effectively and

00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:06,390
to both of those mentors but there's

00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,220
nothing that says you can't have more

00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:09,960
than one mentor and I would be I would

00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,430
be honest with your mentor when you sign

00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,200
up a second one say hey I'm going to

00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:14,850
pick up a mentor on this topic just so

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,590
you know just because you don't want

00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:18,240
them to be surprised that oh you didn't

00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:20,100
think I knew that and I do or something

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,500
you know just to keep the communication

00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:24,360
lines open but I think it's I mean as a

00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,980
mentor I think it's great when my

00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:28,440
apprentices have more than one mentor

00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:29,730
because there is so much out there to

00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,860
learn they can't possibly learn

00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:38,250
everything from me so the more the

00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:41,100
merrier in my opinion have you ever been

00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:42,990
in the situation where your mentor and

00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:44,970
you have meant II but they have skills

00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:47,220
the you'd like to learn so you can get

00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:50,460
the two-way the mentor some days George

00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:52,890
mentor on other days yes absolutely um I

00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:54,270
had an apprentice who wanted to learn to

00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:56,760
speak at conferences which is something

00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:58,980
I'm very comfortable at and they were

00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:01,610
really good at regex which I was much

00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:04,650
less comfortable at let's just say and

00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:06,210
so some days I would help them with

00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:08,190
their writing and other days they would

00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:10,170
help me with my rent checks and it was

00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:11,970
just a good back and forth so it's

00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:14,490
absolutely fine to switch back and forth

00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:16,170
it's really just about who has the

00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:19,290
knowledge and who wants that knowledge

00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:21,540
there's no specific hierarchy I guess of

00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:23,010
no no I'm better than you so I'm the

00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:25,200
mentor kind of a thing you know it's

00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:27,270
absolutely we're all developers we're

00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,680
all working together let's share this

00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:30,680
knowledge that we all have accumulated

00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:39,390
any other questions actually have a

00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:41,610
question and I've been teaching a little

00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:43,140
bit last year and the section you talked

00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:44,910
about defining boundaries has been very

00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:47,730
important there although it's not so

00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:50,730
much a mentoring situation that is

00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:53,040
definitely a teaching position but it is

00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:54,220
so slightly audits on the classroom its

00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,510
vast sky

00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,669
it's with students who are on work

00:30:55,510 --> 00:31:00,669
placements throughout Europe for just

00:30:57,669 --> 00:31:04,059
ate 12 weeks so very small very focused

00:31:00,669 --> 00:31:05,409
but keeping the boundaries as to when

00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:07,480
they can expect and what they can expect

00:31:05,409 --> 00:31:09,370
from the skype conversation is quite

00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,980
important and so I think when you're

00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:13,179
talking about setting that up at the

00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,650
beginning of the process that's

00:31:13,179 --> 00:31:17,770
absolutely vital there is there is

00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:20,320
nothing worse than composing yourself

00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:21,610
1am in order to make a nice response to

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,620
a student rather than a rude and

00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:25,120
offensive a specific and it's much

00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,460
better to do that at the top it

00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,080
definitely as a team leader though on

00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,850
the engineering side it'd be quite hard

00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,230
to know when you could specify that you

00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:33,970
say that when you recruit someone's you

00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:35,620
say at the beginning of a project I mean

00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:38,200
how would you go about doing that on a

00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:40,780
practical sense and still be managerial

00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,760
irresponsible sure um yeah it definitely

00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:44,679
is a team leader you're already sort of

00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,909
in a relationship with that person I

00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:48,490
mean from the moment you start

00:31:45,909 --> 00:31:50,049
interviewing them some expectations have

00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:52,510
already been set for how you talk to

00:31:50,049 --> 00:31:53,919
each other and what's going on so it can

00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:56,770
be kind of hard because there's no

00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:59,350
definitive start time to that what you

00:31:56,770 --> 00:32:01,929
want to do in those kind of cases is as

00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:04,000
soon as you identify a need that you

00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:06,280
have that's when I would start talking

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,110
about it as soon as you realize okay I

00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:12,610
am NOT going to be comfortable with this

00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:14,289
kind of thing or I need someone to talk

00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:17,530
to me once a week or as soon as you

00:32:14,289 --> 00:32:19,630
identify that goal or that need or that

00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:21,970
boundary I would bring it up then

00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:24,970
because if you just realized it it

00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:26,530
probably hasn't if it's a boundary it

00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:29,080
hasn't been broken too many times if

00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:30,850
you're just realizing it bothers you if

00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,530
it's a need that you have you're

00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:34,030
probably just at the point where that

00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:36,820
need is going to start becoming more

00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:39,039
important so as soon as you realize that

00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:43,650
you need it or it needs to be in place

00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:48,640
that's when I would bring it up so yeah

00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:51,720
other questions and just a real quick

00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,980
thought too um when you're a mentor

00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,840
dealing with an apprentice and then your

00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:57,610
roles switch and they become the mentor

00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:00,130
and you become the apprentice it's good

00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:01,840
to sort of sit down and rediscoveries

00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:03,850
because as a mentor you may have

00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,730
different needs and boundaries than as

00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:08,049
an apprentice so it's kind of good

00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:09,850
but even though you're already in a

00:33:08,049 --> 00:33:12,100
mentoring relationship it's good to sort

00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:14,230
of sit down and talk about it like well

00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:17,500
okay now that I'm apprentice I might

00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:19,720
need to meet more often or you know

00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:21,250
maybe as an apprentice I need to talk on

00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,160
the phone but as a mentor I'm not very

00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:26,590
comfortable talking on the phone

00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:27,730
whatever the case may be it's a good

00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:30,820
time to sit down because your

00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:32,559
relationship is changing and so it's

00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:34,270
good to reevaluate those boundaries and

00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:39,730
those needs anytime the relationship

00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:41,890
changes so good time too if any big life

00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:44,049
changes happen like oh I just had a kid

00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:47,260
now we need to talk about things inna

00:33:44,049 --> 00:33:48,610
the calls at 3am not so great anymore or

00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:53,590
maybe now they're better because I'm up

00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:56,230
anyway so yeah so yeah anytime there's a

00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:58,210
big change in other person's life or in

00:33:56,230 --> 00:34:00,820
the role of the relationship or you know

00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:04,500
in in their job employment status or

00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:04,500
anything it's a good time to rediscover

00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:10,929
such a nick aunt quite talk about things

00:34:09,129 --> 00:34:13,980
anymore it's good to always bring those

00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:16,990
up anytime those kinds of changes happen

00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:18,879
full disclosure Beth mentor with me

00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:21,669
through my first being published in a

00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:24,149
PHP journal so I know that there is

00:34:21,669 --> 00:34:26,139
soaring it makes like my legs on the

00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:28,570
submitting your deadlines and things

00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:31,480
yeah it'd be very strict I can be very

00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:38,260
strict on deadlines so yes any more

00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:39,639
questions plenty of time yeah but that's

00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:41,379
not to mean that we haven't had plenty

00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:43,510
of information many ways some very

00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:47,800
useful stuff slides are up your slides

00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:49,960

00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,780

00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:59,650
also get the slides there I encourage

00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:01,600
everyone to leave feedback for the

00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:03,220
speakers because it is so important to

00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,900
be able to know what worked and what

00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:07,300
didn't and what to improve for next time

00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:09,100
so if we give the talk again we can know

00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,109
