Title: PHP UK Conference 2016 - Hamish Friedlander - SilverStripe the open source PHP CMS for Teams
Publication date: 2016-03-17
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2016
Description: 
	The PHP-based CMS space is a highly competitive one. Incumbents with large communities vie with new entrants to battle it out in this contested space. And yet despite this, most of them just aren’t very good. If you want to have a CMS that you actually enjoy using - no matter whether you’re a developer, a designer or a content administrator - you should probably be using SilverStripe. Join Hamish Friedlander, CTO of SilverStripe, as he explains why what you’re currently using is awful, and how we can make your life better again.

whoo

00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:14,490
Thanks so just to start off with um can

00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:18,570
I get a show of hands of who has heard

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:22,980
of silver stripe before there's a few

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:24,690
hands I I guess I know probably only

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,449
Joel put your hands up if you've

00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:30,000
actually used silver stripe before there

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:31,860
you go some people that's good if you've

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,970
used silver stripe before then the demo

00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:38,150
at the end of this maybe hopefully will

00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:42,629
be something that you've seen before or

00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:45,390
have done some more things but for the

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:47,010
vast majority it looks like I haven't

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,379
written a set of slides that's just

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:53,580
going to tell you what you already know

00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:56,070
so as was recently said my name is Homer

00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:58,199
Sri Linda as you can possibly tell from

00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,260
my ridiculous accent I am NOT from the

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:03,780
UK I am from New Zealand I flow over

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,270
here last week so you'd think I'd be

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,210
over my jet lag by now that hasn't

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:12,030
worked out so well and this is a silver

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:16,680
stripe the open-source PHP see Miss four

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:19,850
teams I had a nice little troll ish sort

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,380
of blurred before this but basically

00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:24,570
there's a separate title that I didn't

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,950
use and often come up with multiple

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,780
titles so I speeches are then pick the

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,350
one that I feel it's going to look based

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,510
on the website but the title i didn't

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,580
use is what you are using now is

00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:39,810
terrible why do you keep hitting

00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:41,550
yourself i was here at PHP you here last

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,140
year I didn't actually get to see any of

00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:46,590
the presentations last year I wasn't a

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:49,500
speaker I was helping men a booth up in

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:53,100
the hall where everyone's just hit some

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,409
morning tea and at the time we hadn't

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,790
quite opened our UK office we were just

00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:57,930
about to do that and we were over here

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,420
to sort of let people know that civil

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,010
strife exists and I had a lot of

00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,560
conversations and those conversations

00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:07,020
went along the lines of so what's

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,179
illustrate and then I would tell them

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,590
and they would say that sounds awesome

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,720
and I'd say what do you use at the

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,220
moment and they would name various

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,690
products I'm not going to name the

00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,819
terrible things that you were using at

00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:21,480
the moment that just seems mean but

00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:24,870
there's you know starts with W or D your

00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,430
other similar products they would say

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,190
we're using that and I would say do you

00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:31,530
like it and they would say no no it is

00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,840
terrible it drains our world every day

00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,340
we turn up to work and we have six

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,420
coffees just so we can stand to use the

00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:41,849
computer I said why do you use it then

00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:43,920
and sometimes they would say because

00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:48,209
their clients ask for it that's a

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,049
reasonable reason hopefully once you've

00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,970
got a good relationship with your

00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:52,799
clients you're in a be good enough to

00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,420
position to be able to say why did you

00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:55,590
choose this thing was it just because

00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,750
you'd heard of it because some

00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,879
consultant told you there r us and

00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,930
better things but also it was just well

00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,970
that's the thing we know that's the

00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:05,040
thing we use that doesn't seem a

00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:07,799
terribly good reason to keep using

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,569
something that's terrible so I'm hoping

00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,810
that I will convince at least some of

00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:15,239
you to try out silverstripe because it

00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:18,390
isn't terrible silverstripe is awesome

00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:20,120
now admittedly I am the CTO of the

00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:24,889
company the rights silverstripe I

00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:27,209
suspect that I would not be getting a

00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:29,819
salary next week if I was to come in

00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:32,880
here and say silver stripes awful you

00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:34,560
probably shouldn't use it but I really

00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,139
do think it is awesome I use it for my

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,940
personal projects I've been it saw

00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:40,440
stripe for seven years now which is a

00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,440
really long time to be at a company

00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:45,180
especially in IT that's partly because

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,829
the people are awesome and partly

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:51,630
because it's nice and safe and looking

00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:53,250
for other jobs are scary but mostly

00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,840
because i really like it i really like

00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,540
working with the tool i really like the

00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,579
projects we do and i'm happy to be

00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:02,220
working on it and i suspect that that

00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:04,440
doesn't go for everybody who works MIT

00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:07,709
and that's a bit said so I'm hoping that

00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:11,489
I can help fix that so here's a

00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:14,370
different title that I rejected web

00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:16,530
development better with friends computer

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,139
programmers are not particularly well

00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:21,720
renowned for their social skills but

00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:23,160
hopefully you have some friends and if

00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:27,389
you have friends probably some of them

00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:29,669
do development but I used to run a

00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:32,070
well-known web shop in I would lived in

00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:33,360
Bali for four years and the entire time

00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,470
I did everything I did all the design i

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,810
did all development i did

00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,370
Hosting that meant that when something

00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,530
went wrong it was definitely my fault

00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,210
that means that i couldn't learn

00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,920
anything new it means that i couldn't

00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:48,000
work with anybody else it made it really

00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:49,350
difficult to grow as a developer it did

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,760
mean i could do some things like i could

00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,100
randomly pick whichever technology i

00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,570
felt like using at the time that was

00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,930
nice at me and I could learn a lot of

00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:59,160
different frameworks but in general I

00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,320
wish I had been working with someone

00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,090
else and it's one of the things I enjoy

00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,590
most is that when i'm working at silver

00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:09,000
stripe I'm not working by myself i'm

00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:12,420
working with a great crunch of people so

00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,400
a very quick blurb about me you're not

00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:16,680
here to see me you hear hip here about

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,210
silver stripe but pretty much the only

00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,430
reason that any speaker is going to be

00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,930
speaking is to soothe their own ego so

00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:26,520
you get to hear me talk about me for 30

00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:27,930
seconds anyway I like I see that I'm CTO

00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,590
silver stripes all stripes based in New

00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:34,320
Zealand I joined as a junior developer

00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:36,960
and pretty quickly partly through

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,150
programming partly through a little bit

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,340
of flattery partly through a very small

00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:44,940
amount of blackmail and murder I became

00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:50,790
CEO howdy doesn't really count if no

00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:52,290
one's found out yet and but Ed's CTO I

00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:54,030
still mostly do development so that's

00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:55,350
who i am i'm a developer if you ask me

00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,460
what my job was i would say i do

00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:58,860
computer programming i do we have

00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,510
development i'm not i do do management

00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,940
these days but i don't really like it i

00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:04,860
do tell people that they should be

00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,330
coding to a particular standard but I

00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,160
avoid doing that as much as possible the

00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,990
thing I enjoy most is doing web

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,520
programming and that's one of the

00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:14,550
reasons why I like saw stripe and we'll

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:17,370
get into that in a little bit but I find

00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:21,510
that many see mrs. seem to try and avoid

00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:22,770
the things that I like the most they

00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,550
don't like you to be doing programming

00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,070
they're like you to be doing other

00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:28,260
things of course that's all well i'm not

00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:30,870
partying with all the other CEOs in our

00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:33,840
super-secret bleep patties and our space

00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:37,160
stations because i got joined the club I

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:41,130
totally know everyone in Seattle it's

00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:43,229
cool so what is silver stripe well for a

00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:46,300
start it's a company it's a company in

00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:49,030
New Zealand we hire about 80 people

00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:52,240
we have an office in the UK we hire Joel

00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:59,490
and Dan who isn't in the room and that

00:06:52,240 --> 00:07:01,449
has been noted but so it's a company

00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:04,120
that developed the silver stripe

00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:06,039
software but we also do a lot of other

00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,229
development and I'm going to tell you a

00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:10,900
little origin story about silver stripe

00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:13,449
every superhero has a good origin story

00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:16,650
I see us as superheroes we don't have

00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:20,560
any powers but we do dress up in spandex

00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:22,840
I apologize for the low quality of this

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,030
particular background image but it is

00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,349
Charles dance and once you find an image

00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:31,210
of child's dance and Google search you

00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:33,270
stop searching so about 12 years ago now

00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:36,849
there were three friends in New Zealand

00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:38,440
Sam in two min sig and they started a

00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:40,150
web development company some of you

00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:44,259
probably work for similar sort of

00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:45,789
companies now they found clients who

00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:49,090
needed a website and they made a website

00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:50,469
for them and it was pretty simple but

00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:52,090
they didn't really like any of the tools

00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:54,520
it was 12 years ago the tools were not

00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:56,759
as good as they are now and so they

00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:01,000
wrote the first version of silver stripe

00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:04,779
it was ie6 only which at the time was

00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,219
actually the best browser it was ie6

00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:07,569
only because netscape navigator for

00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:10,509
would randomly crash whenever it

00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:12,520
attempted to execute JavaScript it was

00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:14,590
also proprietary and it wasn't really

00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,330
used anywhere except in silver stripe

00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:18,099
that used this really interesting PHP

00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:20,080
plugin that would observe a Kate the pic

00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:22,509
the code so that you couldn't take a

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,139
copy of it and sell it anyway it worked

00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:28,409
but I wasn't at the company get in my

00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:32,190
head and told them how terrible this was

00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:36,250
so for a while they operated like that

00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:37,870
and that worked fine but then they

00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,820
really got a bit sick of the system that

00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:42,190
written it had bit not been really acted

00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:45,040
very well in the meantime rails had come

00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:47,620
out and they really wanted to be using

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,890
rails or something that wasn't the

00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:53,110
system they'd written so they wrote

00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:56,529
silverstripe 2 point 0 and as part of

00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:57,790
writing that they open sourced it that

00:08:56,529 --> 00:09:00,160
started them on the journey that they

00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:02,199
are today and the same system

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,829
the substrate 1 point 0 code is gone I'm

00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:07,660
glad it's gone I've seen some of it it

00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:10,120
was excellent code for a first web

00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:12,990
project but not the sort of thing you

00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,339
want to be sir a long-term strategy on

00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,899
the soft rope to code a lot of it is

00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:19,420
still around some of its really good

00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:22,209
some of it was written by someone who

00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:27,879
was now in sales so we don't let him

00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:30,300
code anymore but we for the most part

00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:34,149
it's still the same system as it was

00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:36,310
eight years ago and since then we just

00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:38,139
keep growing but mostly what we've been

00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,610
doing is we've still just been writing

00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:41,620
websites for customers the customers

00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:43,569
have gotten bigger when we started out

00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,040
with small shops who head you know a

00:09:43,569 --> 00:09:47,170
couple of thousand ten thousand dollars

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,189
to build on a website these days its

00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:53,889
banks and the New Zealand government and

00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:55,689
other fairly large corporations but we

00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:57,910
still do websites for customers and

00:09:55,689 --> 00:10:00,250
every improvement of that it goes into

00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:05,620
silver stripe is there because we needed

00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:07,360
it to do our job developing websites so

00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:09,670
we've defeated everyone in New Zealand

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,769
with crashed your competition or at

00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:15,279
least all the easy competition and all

00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:17,230
the had competitions had so we've also

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,600
started looking outwards as we've opened

00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:21,850
the UK office we've created a product

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,110
I'm not really here to push the product

00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,970
but i will tell you silver stripe

00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:26,620
platform it's awesome if you do decide

00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,240
that you like silver stripe and you need

00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:32,670
to host it then you should totally use

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:35,259
the right platform to do that plug over

00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:38,350
so if we get back to the question what

00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:41,170
is silver stripe well it's an

00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:45,490
open-source php-based MVC framework for

00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:48,579
web development so like I mentioned the

00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:51,449
founders really liked rails rails was

00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:53,439
open source but written in Ruby they

00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:55,779
know what would you say borrowed

00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:58,240
probably not stole that has some bad

00:10:55,779 --> 00:11:00,699
connotations there there were there were

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,959
inspirations from the rails API in the

00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:03,730
silver stripe framework let's say

00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:06,189
modified a little bit because of the

00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:09,040
requirements of PHP haired PHP's not

00:11:06,189 --> 00:11:11,709
quite as good for writing dsl's is ruby

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,230
was but a lot of inspiration from quite

00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:14,720
modern frame

00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:19,100
except we're coming out at the time it's

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:21,530
also a there we go the framework has an

00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,150
activerecord style model interface it's

00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:27,410
got some routing stuff it's got a form

00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:28,880
builder it's got a template language but

00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:30,680
so it's got a lot of the things you'd

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,330
expect from a framework I mean even if

00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,160
you don't use the CMS we do do projects

00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:36,680
where we just use the framework I'm not

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,180
really gonna go be a code demo later

00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:43,310
don't worry it's not just me talking at

00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:45,110
you but we do use projects that just use

00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:48,200
the framework that's not really the

00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:50,390
focus of this talk it's also an open

00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,940
source php-based seam is built on that

00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:54,830
framework and the CMS layer is actually

00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,300
really thin we will get into that in the

00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:58,190
demo a little but it's about health in

00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,240
that cmas layer is and how powerful the

00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:02,780
frame workers to let you build a

00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,760
seamless with not that much code it has

00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:08,060
a WYSIWYG content editor has versioning

00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:09,830
and workflow drag-and-drop information

00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,110
architecture editor and again we'll demo

00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:14,450
this a bit asset management and all the

00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:16,850
other stuff you'd expect so what is

00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:20,860
silver stripe it's born from the fires

00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:24,080
of battle it's a CMS that wasn't written

00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:26,330
by design or by committee it was the CMS

00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,010
that's written by a development shop

00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:30,050
doing development to let us do that

00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:31,700
development better and so a lot of the

00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:33,770
influence in the design comes from the

00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,090
way that we develop websites and as

00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:38,090
we've changed the way that we develop

00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:39,500
websites as we've grown the API and the

00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:42,440
systems that we use with silver stripe

00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:44,920
of grown to now if you don't develop

00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,580
websites exactly the same way as we do

00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,020
silverstripe may well still be

00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:50,420
applicable but you should do it the same

00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:52,100
way as we do we're best so if you're

00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:56,450
doing some stuff different to us than

00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:58,070
you're wrong it's also a community it's

00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:59,120
great that's all open source I love open

00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,400
source it was one of the main reasons I

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,170
took the job in the first place again

00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,390
because then I get to put code on github

00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:09,230
and get a little ego boost when people

00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:10,880
 my repositories or whatever also

00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:14,210
I'm sure for altruistic reasons that I

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:16,040
can't think of at the moment but yeah I

00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,750
really like that it's open source and

00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,310
that gives us a great community we've

00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:21,950
got heaps of add-ons we don't have as

00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:24,290
big a community as some of those CMS's

00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:26,240
that people don't like I don't really

00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:27,980
understand why you

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,720
join a community for a product you hate

00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:31,100
I guess just to stand around with

00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:37,510
everyone else saying how much you hate

00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:40,310
it but yeah it's it's really good so

00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:42,230
that's fine silver stripes the air to

00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:44,209
work the same way as we develop websites

00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:47,899
what does it actually mean I mean how do

00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:49,700
you develop websites we do it as a group

00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:54,260
like I said web development is better

00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:56,360
with friends a lot of development and a

00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,860
lot of CMS's say well you don't need

00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,330
this group or here's how you can do it

00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,709
without these people because these

00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:02,899
people are hard to find or they're

00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:06,050
expensive or you don't really like them

00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:07,339
feel weird or techie or for us you know

00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:09,490
they draw pretty pictures and tell you

00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:12,410
it's more important than performance or

00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:14,570
you know you end up with all of the

00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:20,810
little cliques in your developments in

00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:22,220
your web pantheon saying well our we

00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:24,200
only need us we don't need these other

00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,520
people we think that's wrong we think

00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,709
that you do need everyone in the group

00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:30,730
you work better as a group you need to

00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:32,570
have product managers project managers

00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:34,399
they need to tell you how far over

00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:36,079
budget you are they need to tell you how

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,279
late you are don't incentive to listen

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,279
to them but you need that information

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,720
there you need to have architects

00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,700
various kinds developers of various

00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,040
kinds designers content creators

00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,540
marketing customer relation managers if

00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,560
you don't have those people involved in

00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,329
your team you're not going to have as

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,029
good a website as if you do you can

00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:56,270
manage people manage all the time you

00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:57,529
know people can manage are running a

00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,300
whole website and running all those jobs

00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:00,890
by themselves but if you've only got one

00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,000
person or if you've got a person trying

00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:04,610
to do multiple jobs and they're not

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,829
specializing in things you'll manage but

00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:08,300
the outcome won't be as good as if you

00:15:06,829 --> 00:15:11,870
had experts in all of these areas of

00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:13,870
your head a team working together and

00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:15,980
you want to have t-shaped people

00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:18,649
t-shaped means that you're really good

00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:20,450
at one thing that's the stalker I don't

00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:22,820
know it should actually be upside down T

00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:25,820
I guess but there's no such letter in

00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,870
the alphabet so T will do you know you

00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,130
want to have one skill that you're

00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:29,810
really good at but a bunch of other

00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:31,730
skills that you are you know at least

00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:33,290
knowledgeable about and actually working

00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,730
in a team helps make sure that your team

00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,779
shaped because when you're working with

00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:37,550
these other people who have these other

00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:38,839
skills some of that's going to rub off

00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,350
on you at least you're deliberately

00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,860
ignore

00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:44,000
bring them or don't want to learn you're

00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:47,900
going to learn some of those skills from

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,180
those people and development it's an

00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:53,360
interesting it's different on my screen

00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:54,710
type on that screen that's fine so and

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,730
when you're when we're working on the

00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:58,820
feature if we're working on a website

00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:00,920
this is the basic cycle it follows if

00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:02,300
any of you run in scrum teams this

00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:05,990
should look fairly familiar because it

00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:09,650
follows a standard scrum a cycle you end

00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:12,500
up with oh that definitely is wrong

00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:14,870
that's right end up with a need the

00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,160
client the customer the site finds a

00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:18,890
need they find something that they want

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,080
to do with the website they can't you

00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:22,580
shouldn't be coming up with us because

00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,900
you don't know what they need if you're

00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,270
a developer if your designer working on

00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:28,130
the website don't try and pick a need

00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:30,590
listen to the customer they'll tell you

00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:33,080
what they want then you write some scope

00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:35,300
then you code it then you put it in a

00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:37,370
version control system you demo it to

00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:40,040
the client you upload it to your uot

00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:42,140
server you test it you put it on your

00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:46,460
live server now none of that should be

00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:48,940
terribly confrontational or surprising

00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:51,680
or new pretty much everyone knows that

00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:53,480
if you're developing complex features

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,100
you should be putting it in version

00:16:53,480 --> 00:17:00,080
control you're not using version control

00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:02,450
I I can't help you I'm sorry you should

00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,220
ideally be putting it on uat and demoing

00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:05,720
it to the client prior to it going to

00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:09,350
production for going into production

00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:13,420
before the client to see in it ah good

00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:15,650
luck so people work best when they care

00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:17,540
most successful projects are the ones

00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:20,240
with a whole team is engaged in fields

00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:22,460
ownership and again this is why we want

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,220
to work with teams so how the silver

00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:27,830
stripe CMS help for a start there's no

00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:30,350
duck programs in the database what do we

00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:31,910
mean by that well everyone knows what

00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:34,040
duck typing is if it looks like a duck

00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:35,450
and walks like a duck it's a duck duck

00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,490
programming is the same thing but for

00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,900
code if you're in a web interface and

00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,340
you are connecting if statements

00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,260
together it doesn't matter if you're

00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,610
doing that in a text editor or a little

00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:46,010
gooey drag-and-drop interface in the

00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:48,020
website it's still programming it

00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:50,960
doesn't matter if you've been told its

00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:53,000
programming or you've learnt it through

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,970
see Miss tutorial it's still programming

00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,980
and if you're storing it in the database

00:17:54,970 --> 00:18:02,510
you can't deploy it it's not really

00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:03,770
versioned it's not reversible if you

00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:06,190
deploy something and then you don't like

00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:08,480
it how do you deal with that later so

00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:09,860
developers already have great tools for

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,240
dealing with us we already have get we

00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,710
already have continuous deployment we

00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,860
already have continuous integration to

00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:18,500
test the stuff running into the database

00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:21,200
destroys all of that value we have a

00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:24,890
separation of church and state by which

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,120
I mean developers and designers we have

00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:28,309
template languages we keep the code

00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:31,399
where it needs to be we don't have just

00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:32,750
PHP to be a template language and we

00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:36,110
have a focused content editing

00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:37,820
experience when you give a Content data

00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:39,110
to the CMS there shouldn't be a button

00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:43,130
in there that they can click that says

00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:45,020
ruin their website it doesn't probably

00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:47,000
doesn't say ruin their website but

00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:48,500
that's even worse if there's a button

00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,440
that doesn't say ruin your website that

00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:54,080
does that that's a pretty bad experience

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,399
for the cast the funding deter and a lot

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,049
of seeing mrs. do there's a lot of CMS's

00:18:55,399 --> 00:18:58,580
have hey here's all the programming

00:18:57,049 --> 00:19:00,260
stuff just click here and aids and more

00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:03,669
stuff it'll be fine I mean you're in

00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:06,649
production but don't worry about it oh

00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:09,169
no sorry something went wrong your whole

00:19:06,649 --> 00:19:10,580
site's down I guess call the developer

00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:12,950
you haven't called in six months he'll

00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:15,350
sort it out for you 24 7 i'm sure it'll

00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:18,760
be fine it shouldn't be scary you should

00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:20,960
be providing just the fields they need

00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:24,260
and you should separate templates in

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,909
code so with all that said i wanted to

00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,740
get to an actual demo of silver stripe

00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:31,010
so that you can see all of that in

00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:35,179
action and i'm not going to switch to

00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:36,820
PHP storm and then try and twist the

00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:44,090
slip turn around and see here we go

00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:45,590
might just move this over here there we

00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:54,380
go

00:19:45,590 --> 00:20:02,510
safe thanks hello everyone can still see

00:19:54,380 --> 00:20:04,520
me good so the first thing that we'll

00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:08,600
have a look at is just a default install

00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:09,799
of source stripe I'm get it so you'll

00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:19,520
have to bear with me a second while I

00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:21,320
mess around with sir I'm just going to

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,640
clone the displays and then I can see

00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:30,230
what you're seeing without craning my

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:31,789
neck perfect cool so we've got a default

00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:34,820
installation of silver stripe silver

00:20:31,789 --> 00:20:37,039
stripe is adopting modern PSRs and

00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:39,200
technologies as they come around so to

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:43,279
get a copy of silver stripe I've run

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:45,529
composer and I've just run composer

00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:49,850
create project silverstripe to get the

00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:51,559
default code base and the interface you

00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:55,010
get here's the front end it's got some

00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:56,690
you know default to default content it's

00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:59,090
not very exciting it's a default

00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:00,460
template again not very exciting and but

00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:03,399
it also gives you a full admin interface

00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:06,140
and here's the admin interface you get

00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:07,399
straight out of the box we've got a tree

00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:10,370
that you can see that you can browse

00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:13,130
around we've got a WYSIWYG editor we've

00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:15,830
got the information about the page the

00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:19,250
navigation title there is some metadata

00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:21,140
stuff that's hidden away and again you

00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,340
know hide things from the editor unless

00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:25,399
they need then we've got some settings

00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:30,020
some history if we come into contact us

00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:32,720
there's another page and some fairly

00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:36,559
standard see me sitting features you

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:38,690
know if we add some more content we can

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:41,360
save the draft of that we can share that

00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:43,580
draft around but it's not visible on the

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:50,779
live site yet at any point we can decide

00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:54,500
to publish it and now it's shown up in

00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:55,669
the main site now I'm not going to take

00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,960
you through too many features of the

00:21:55,669 --> 00:21:58,410
cmas because we've got some really good

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,780
demos systems that you can all

00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:02,880
ready try out if you just go to silver

00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:05,160
stripe dog there's a demo that you can

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,260
get into to explore these basic features

00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,790
and what I wanted to show you is

00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,410
developing a new feature in silver

00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:14,430
stripe because that's what's different

00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:16,710
to other CMS's and this is going to be a

00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:18,240
little bit of live coding except that

00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,380
I've already pre-prepared a bunch just

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,920
in case I get it wrong because I

00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,920
probably will

00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:36,960
and so I'm sorry that you can't see the

00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:40,260
structure of the code very well in

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,880
phpstorm phpstorm is not terribly

00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:44,010
presenter friendly but i need the

00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,299
autocomplete stuff if i tried doing this

00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:52,100
an atom it would take three times as

00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:57,270
long yeah someone was telling me that i

00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:58,289
haven't used it enough to know so but

00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,779
primarily we're going to be working

00:22:58,289 --> 00:23:01,890
inside the my site directory

00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:05,370
silverstripe is a collection of modules

00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:07,620
your even your site specific code is

00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:10,289
just a module you've got the framework

00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:11,970
module and the CMS module so we're just

00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:15,179
going to be adding code into the my site

00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:18,270
module and the first thing I'm going to

00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:20,399
do is a new and exciting example I

00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:21,450
thought really had about that you won't

00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:25,940
have seen before I'm going to be working

00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:25,940
on a basic to-do list

00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:39,130
so here's the version i preferred

00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:41,410
earlier that i'm just going to cheat and

00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:42,940
reference right so the first thing I'm

00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:44,950
going to do is I'm going to create a new

00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,090
model so I've already gone and talked to

00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:47,530
the customer I figured out their

00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:50,020
requirements i haven't just come out

00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:51,610
with them out of my head and i'm going

00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,720
to create some code because i'm thinking

00:23:51,610 --> 00:24:01,840
ahead i'm going to create a new

00:23:52,720 --> 00:24:03,310
directory for it call it models then

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:09,730
inside there i'm going to create it to

00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:18,700
do model so the file is called to do not

00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:21,430
p PHP i'm going to extend off data

00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:24,400
object data object is the base class for

00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:27,040
all serializable objects that live in

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:35,800
the database and then i'm going to give

00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:38,070
it a couple of fields title and I just

00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:41,070
call it just call it voucher and

00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:41,070
completed

00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:57,490
and we're going to have a has 12 a

00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:59,080
member now silverstripe comes with the

00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:00,549
concept of members and groups and

00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,139
permissions and security already baked

00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:04,750
in so we don't have to go and define

00:25:02,139 --> 00:25:07,630
member it already exists and what we've

00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:12,370
created here is a model has two fields

00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:14,470
and a reference to the owner now I don't

00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:17,110
have to do anything in the database to

00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:18,760
get that to exist silverstripe has a

00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:21,340
schema management system so by just

00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:26,260
declaring that new model I could run dev

00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:28,029
build and it will see that there is a

00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:30,700
new model and it will create all of the

00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:33,130
tables in my database for me it does

00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:35,320
this in a safe way so that if you do

00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:36,730
need to revert back to old code as long

00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:40,480
as you haven't change the type of a

00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:41,769
field you can revert back I would still

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,120
recommend backing your databases up

00:25:41,769 --> 00:25:44,919
during deployment anyway but it's

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,750
designed so that as a developer you can

00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:47,679
add fields and remove fields it's not

00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:50,889
going to damage the data in your

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:52,360
database so that's fine but we haven't

00:25:50,889 --> 00:25:53,980
done anything with the model it exists

00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,630
we could write it into the database but

00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,889
we can't see it so the next thing we're

00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:58,870
going to do is we're going to create an

00:25:56,889 --> 00:26:04,600
admin interface that we can create and

00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:07,240
edit those to-do items and I'm going to

00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:13,990
create another directory we're going to

00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:16,570
call it Edmund and I'm going to create

00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:19,330
another file in that directory you'll

00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:21,700
notice that I'm not registering these

00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:23,320
files anywhere they're not I'm not

00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:25,380
having to go and say this is a new admin

00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:29,200
area roar this is a new model

00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:30,940
silverstripe has a manifest that knows

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,639
where all the classes are inside your

00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:35,830
code base will auto-detect all of these

00:26:33,639 --> 00:26:38,850
things for you as you create them so

00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,850
we're creating to do admin

00:26:43,489 --> 00:26:48,869
and there's a base class for creating

00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:50,909
administrator interfaces called model

00:26:48,869 --> 00:26:52,200
Edmund I'm just going to cheat and look

00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:56,720
up the three statics they have to be

00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,720
declared bless you

00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:11,240
so we've said the models that this admin

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,520
area are going to manage Arthur to do

00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:16,760
model and the URL segment is going to be

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,350
to do's and the menu title is to do now

00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:21,380
if we come back into the admin area and

00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:23,770
reload the segment area you'll notice

00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:26,630
that I'm saying I'm putting the flush

00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:28,400
get parameter on the URL a lot that

00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:30,230
basically says update the manifest find

00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,460
the new files that exist and you

00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:34,010
wouldn't do that all the time on life

00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:37,370
because it's a little bit slow and now

00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:39,410
there's a new to do area and we've

00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:41,510
already got our admin interface now I

00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:43,250
haven't scaffold that this in there I

00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:45,170
haven't gotten created a bunch of files

00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:47,510
that I'll then have to manage later and

00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:50,120
all of this admin interface is being

00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:52,490
generated by code on the fly when you

00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:54,920
hit this interface and you can modify

00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:56,390
the fields that are being generated to

00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,650
adjust the interfaces you'd like to and

00:27:56,390 --> 00:28:00,080
i'll show you how to do some of that in

00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:05,150
a bit but we've already got I'm the

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:09,040
ability to edit to do we'll call it I'd

00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:11,120
like to learn how to bake a sponge cake

00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:14,080
and I'm just going to make this only one

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:19,070
user in the system and it's owned by me

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:25,610
and I'd also like to know how to cook

00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:29,710
brownies apparently I'm going to be

00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:31,970
putting on quite a lot of weight so and

00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:33,440
this is already you know a perfectly

00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:34,730
functional interface we're not really

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,830
doing anything with these two dues but

00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:38,900
you know within about five minutes we've

00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:41,150
got the ability to admin them within the

00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:43,670
admin area so the next thing I'm going

00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:48,140
to want to do is actually that's okay

00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:50,420
but a big list of students for I want to

00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:52,100
be able to put them in sets not just

00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:53,690
because for a synthetic example it makes

00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:58,790
a nice piece of code but also because it

00:28:53,690 --> 00:29:00,710
would actually be useful I'm sure so and

00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:03,100
again I'm just going to cheat and look

00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:03,100
at my

00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:21,820
right so I'm going to create another

00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:26,230
model will call it to do set and it will

00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:27,670
extend data object again now I'll show

00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:31,420
you this a bit later but silverstripe

00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:33,010
handles deep class hierarchies fine at

00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:34,600
the moment I'm inheriting straight off

00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:36,520
data object but you can hear it off

00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,230
other things and hear it off data object

00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,310
no problem it'll handle it all with

00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:42,130
multi table and he returns in the

00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:48,580
background now we're wearing they have

00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:50,940
one field which is just going to be the

00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,940
title

00:29:56,019 --> 00:30:05,649
we're going to have a has mini because

00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:07,580
this set is going to have many to do's

00:30:05,649 --> 00:30:17,239
and then again we're going to have an

00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:18,229
owner and it goes to member and then the

00:30:17,239 --> 00:30:21,950
other thing that we're going to need to

00:30:18,229 --> 00:30:25,879
do is provide the other side of that has

00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:36,879
many so in to do I'm going to say it has

00:30:25,879 --> 00:30:36,879
one set no so if i go and run dev build

00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:44,179
again it will have created the table

00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:45,529
that we need it will have updated the to

00:30:44,179 --> 00:30:48,440
do table and we've created than you to

00:30:45,529 --> 00:30:49,700
do set table again i've created the

00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,049
model but I don't have an interface for

00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,059
it yet so we're now going to add that to

00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:54,679
the admin interface this is even easier

00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:59,710
than the last time we did this I'm just

00:30:54,679 --> 00:31:03,129
going to add to do sit in here and now

00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:03,129
if we flush

00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:15,309
so now we have two tabs to do's and to

00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:24,159
do sets we can come into it to do set

00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:28,179
will call it recipes I'd like to learn

00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:31,850
give it the owner of me create it and

00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:34,820
now we have our system we can find all

00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:37,580
of thee to do is I've already created

00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:46,039
link them into this to do set so I both

00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:52,940
those and maybe I want to cook gem

00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:56,030
Donuts yeah different theater yeah again

00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:57,799
create the default admin but there is at

00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:59,720
least one problem with the system so far

00:31:57,799 --> 00:32:03,049
in order to show it to you I have to

00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:06,770
create a second member so it's called

00:32:03,049 --> 00:32:11,480
John Smith and he doesn't really need an

00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:13,880
email address but John example.com super

00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:17,179
complex definitely unhackable password

00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:19,070
of password you can disable being able

00:32:17,179 --> 00:32:20,780
to set things like password and silver

00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:22,580
sin in the password field but I've

00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:25,970
turned that off for now because I can

00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:30,350
remember password so now if we add

00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:33,950
another to do and we call it ride a

00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:37,429
bicycle which I will have to remember to

00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:43,720
spell and we set it to be owned by John

00:32:37,429 --> 00:32:48,380
Smith we can come into the to do set of

00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:52,490
the default admin and if we try and find

00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:53,960
that it still shows up so the problem is

00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:56,539
that the grid fields don't know what

00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:59,179
owner means so you're able to link to

00:32:56,539 --> 00:33:01,400
dues that aunt owned by the same person

00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:03,530
is the deduce it we need to fix that in

00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:07,250
an order to fix that conveniently we

00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:11,620
have to tweak the admin interface that's

00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:11,620
being generated for us so let's do that

00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:25,990
right so the system that silverstripe

00:33:22,659 --> 00:33:28,090
uses to build the CMS fields is that it

00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:29,950
calls a method called get CMS fields on

00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:31,299
your model now if you don't override

00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:33,100
that it will fall down to the one that

00:33:31,299 --> 00:33:36,309
data object provides and data object

00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:39,130
will scaffold something up for you but

00:33:36,309 --> 00:33:41,140
that makes it fairly easy to override as

00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:44,980
well because you can just come into your

00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:58,179
model you can provide your own version

00:33:44,980 --> 00:34:00,669
of that function oops sorry i'm just

00:33:58,179 --> 00:34:03,340
going to retype it in so the first thing

00:34:00,669 --> 00:34:09,669
that we do is we we still want to use

00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:12,460
the the scaffolded fields we just want

00:34:09,669 --> 00:34:14,889
to adjust them now in this case what

00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:17,580
we're going to be editing is the and I'm

00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:17,580
going to need to

00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:32,980
in this case what we're going to be

00:34:27,619 --> 00:34:37,330
changing is that oops yeah broken there

00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:37,330
uh-huh there's an extra plus there

00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:49,310
so in this case I'm going to be changing

00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:50,660
the drop-down here to only show sets

00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:54,020
that are owned by the same person is

00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:56,030
that to do as that only show to do sets

00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:59,690
that are owned by the same owner as this

00:34:56,030 --> 00:35:01,880
to do is owned by so we've already got

00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:04,580
the scaffolded fields what we need to do

00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:07,640
is we need to change the set of data

00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:09,020
that this drop-down is using so we're

00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:11,660
going to go and get that individual

00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:20,330
filled out of the already scaffolded

00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:21,710
fields that looks a bit magic but you

00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:23,510
can actually the easiest way to find

00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:26,510
that is just to inspect the form and the

00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:28,790
ideas in that form filled already or

00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:30,380
it's all if there's a specific algorithm

00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:32,060
that generates those field names so you

00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:35,210
can always guess them a few once you've

00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:40,730
gotten used to it then we're going to

00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:48,080
set the source on that field when now if

00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:49,490
we just did that then that's going to be

00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,380
doing exactly the same thing as the

00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:52,910
default scaffold woodfield does it just

00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:55,010
goes and gets all of the to do sets

00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:57,020
turns them into the map of ID's two

00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:58,430
titles and sits them as the source but

00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:03,190
we need to filter them to be owned by

00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:03,190
the same owner as this model so

00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:14,030
and it's the same as that

00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:22,310
and now when we come and see when we

00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:24,440
look at the two sponge cake to do

00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:27,410
because it's owned by default admin we

00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:29,360
can see the recipes I'd like to learn to

00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:31,990
do sit if we come in to ride a bicycle

00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:34,100
there's nothing in available because

00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:36,080
John Smith's doesn't have it to do see

00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:39,080
it yet so that's one side but we need to

00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:40,250
do the other side and this one is a

00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:44,600
little bit more complicated because

00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:45,980
we're editing the grid field but again

00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,460
it's the same basic principle we're

00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:48,460
going to take

00:36:56,689 --> 00:37:07,319
the fields are scaffolded in this case

00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:09,509
we're just going to remove that to do's

00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:11,939
grid field that scaffold because we want

00:37:09,509 --> 00:37:13,890
to change it completely now we're going

00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:17,219
to create a new configuration for the

00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:19,939
grid field the grid field is that table

00:37:17,219 --> 00:37:22,920
that's being used to edit a relationship

00:37:19,939 --> 00:37:26,359
I wonder if I've got one I can show you

00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:28,349
without reloading no I have to reload it

00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:37,619
maybe I'll do that anyway just so you

00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:39,269
can see so this is a grid field here if

00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:41,699
we come introduce to do set this is a

00:37:39,269 --> 00:37:44,309
grid field if we come in so I've broken

00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:45,660
that it is anyway but so that when

00:37:44,309 --> 00:37:49,410
you're editing a relationship that field

00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:50,939
as the grid field so we're creating a

00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:52,619
new configuration we're using the

00:37:50,939 --> 00:37:54,630
relation editor configuration which is a

00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:59,219
preset Confederation and we're just

00:37:54,630 --> 00:38:02,249
going to adjust it a little bit we are

00:37:59,219 --> 00:38:05,249
going to find the part of the

00:38:02,249 --> 00:38:09,059
configuration which is the link to

00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:14,759
existing one and we're going to change

00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:16,559
the search list and again the only thing

00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:20,160
we're changing is that we're filtering

00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:28,079
it to have the same owner ID as the

00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:30,900
owner ID of this to do sit then we

00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:34,279
create a grid we add that to the set of

00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:34,279
fields and we return the fields

00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:45,470
then we remove all the stuff I copy

00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:47,930
paste it in so now when we come into the

00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:50,050
to do set we come in here we go to add

00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:52,640
existing it's not going to find that

00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:57,320
ride a bicycle because it's now outside

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:58,670
of that search list so again that's a

00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,320
Philly synthetic example but wanted to

00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:02,690
want to show is how quickly you can

00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:06,890
build up really complex user interfaces

00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:08,600
for your clients in code now there is a

00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:10,280
form builder that you can install into

00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,440
silver stripe but it's for reasonably

00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:14,300
basic forms and it doesn't have the

00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,680
advantage of storing things in code like

00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:17,420
you can commit it to your version

00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,770
control history you can run it tests

00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:20,030
through anytime you're doing duck

00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:21,800
programming inside the database you're

00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:24,020
losing all of that stuff that as

00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,190
programmers we've sort of built up as

00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:28,030
techniques to make sure your site's

00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:28,030
operating

00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:41,500
so the last thing that will do is okay

00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:44,050
that's five minutes all in the Edna

00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:46,690
interface I want to build a actually see

00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:47,950
these two dues inside the front end

00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:49,480
interface because there's no point of

00:39:47,950 --> 00:40:05,050
the only people that can edit it are the

00:39:49,480 --> 00:40:07,930
people in the edmund so i'm going to

00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:10,270
open up the page PHP class now when

00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:12,970
you're that this is getting into the CMS

00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:14,590
so you saw that i was creating a to do

00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:16,330
model and a to do sit model and they

00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:18,670
were inheriting directly off data object

00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:20,710
the CMS uses exactly the same method

00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:23,800
when you've got a page in this in the

00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:25,600
tree in your site it's there is a class

00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,990
called site tree it inherits off data

00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:31,330
object it sets some default fields that

00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:34,600
exist on a page like content and a title

00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:35,980
and a URL but all of the interfaces

00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,390
built the same way as I just showed you

00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,800
it's going to scare fold up the base

00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:40,180
fields and it's going to adjust some of

00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:44,200
them it's going to present you with that

00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:46,480
CMS interface and in order to add new

00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:50,560
page types all you do is you and hear it

00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:52,300
from the site tree model and you add

00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,310
your own fields and because all of those

00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:56,500
scaffolding techniques are still there

00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:58,600
you can just use get cme's fields to

00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:02,650
adjust the interface you're presented

00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:05,020
with on the page for your new fields by

00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:07,090
default you'll always have one page site

00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:09,010
which is page and you'll have a

00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:11,440
controller which handles any requests

00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:13,900
that land on that page you don't have to

00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,720
have anything in it buy it there's an

00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:20,500
index action that will render your page

00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:22,540
with a template for you I don't think

00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,880
we're going to have time to show you

00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:28,090
that but if we do that would be awesome

00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:33,250
but what I am going to do we've got

00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:34,270
about 20 minutes left yeah cool so what

00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:38,020
I am going to do is I'm going to just

00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:41,230
quickly run through adding listen to the

00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:43,510
front end so I've added a function

00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:45,430
called to do sits now because this is

00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:47,890
not in allowed actions it's not directly

00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:49,269
callable from the web so

00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:50,680
we're doing here is adding a method that

00:41:49,269 --> 00:41:52,470
would be called in a template and I'm

00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,789
going to adjust the template in a second

00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:56,680
the first thing that we're doing is

00:41:54,789 --> 00:41:59,980
we're just using the RM to go and get

00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:04,329
all of the to do's that are owned by the

00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:06,010
current user now actually in a proper

00:42:04,329 --> 00:42:08,200
code maybe I would move that to an

00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:11,170
accessor on the to-do set model itself

00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:14,650
I'm going to I'm going to change the

00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:19,260
example that I've carefully scripted to

00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:19,260
do that because I'm sure that's safe

00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:50,210
cool so I've added a static function to

00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:51,740
the to do set model called get all four

00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:54,230
men but you can either pass the member

00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:55,280
in or you can just leave them in the

00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:57,950
blank in which case it'll use the

00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:01,780
whoever's currently logged in so we're

00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:01,780
now going to come into page and core

00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:12,320
great and now I don't feel so bad about

00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:16,640
the kind of right then we're going to

00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:22,970
build so by default we could I'm just

00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:25,370
going to show you that so great I've

00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:27,650
added an accessor what's what's going to

00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:31,790
call that function so we need to go into

00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:33,800
the template to do that in silver stripe

00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:36,050
because you've got that class hierarchy

00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,880
you can have a template specific to your

00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:39,290
class if you don't define one specific

00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,600
to your class it'll just fall down the

00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:43,220
clients are at class hierarchy so if you

00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,720
head home page which in here it's off

00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:46,580
page you can either define the home page

00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,680
template or you can just use the page

00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:50,870
template in this case we're just going

00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:53,120
to use the page template I'm just going

00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:58,970
to come in here and I'm going to say if

00:43:53,120 --> 00:44:02,480
there are two do sits then I'm going to

00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:08,900
add a unsorted list and then loop

00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:11,690
through those to do seats and have a

00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:15,920
list item that shows the title of fit to

00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:17,750
do see it and now if we really load home

00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,970
any page because I've just added that to

00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:22,970
the home page it's just going to show

00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:25,750
the title of the to do see it we could

00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:25,750
loop through

00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:40,010
the dues oops

00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:46,930
and there you go so you've pulled it all

00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:48,760
into the front end but that's just

00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:50,560
showing us the do's we actually want to

00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:53,860
form in there that we can check to say

00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:56,680
I've done this to do so in order to do

00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:58,240
that we can't just return the models we

00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:59,950
need to augment the models with some

00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,960
additional information which is the form

00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:03,730
so that when that we pass them into the

00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,590
template the template can actually ask

00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:09,720
for the form instead of just the things

00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:13,200
that exist in the model and to do that

00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:17,080
we're going to build a separate list

00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:21,460
we're going to I'm going to speed up a

00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:24,340
little bit for each set that this owner

00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:27,580
that this user owns we're going to add

00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:31,030
something add an item to a list and

00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:32,830
we're going to customize that item to an

00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:34,330
in addition to all of the properties

00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:35,800
that are available on the model we're

00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:38,620
going to add an additional property to

00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:40,600
that model which is the to do for this

00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:42,160
calls a method on this object called to

00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:45,760
do form that doesn't exist so we'll have

00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:50,230
to add that and this is quite a long

00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:51,430
model they're quite a long things so

00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:54,480
what I'm going to do I'm just going to

00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:54,480
check this commit out

00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:17,950
okay and all medically appeared so the

00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:22,130
to do form I'll run through very quickly

00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:23,539
it's called twice it's called once from

00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:26,059
this model when we're calling through

00:46:23,539 --> 00:46:28,670
the template it's also called when you

00:46:26,059 --> 00:46:30,920
submit the form through the URL so you

00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:32,869
can't we're passing in an argument here

00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:35,150
which is the to do sit we want to build

00:46:32,869 --> 00:46:38,990
a form for but their argument won't come

00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:40,099
back through the query when it's come

00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:42,289
from the browser the browser doesn't

00:46:40,099 --> 00:46:44,900
have all the information instead we're

00:46:42,289 --> 00:46:46,880
going to set a hidden variable called

00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:48,980
set ID you should be checking to make

00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,079
sure that the set ID is owned by the

00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:53,059
user so you can just pass in any state

00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:54,940
ID and hack into someone else's to do is

00:46:53,059 --> 00:46:58,309
it but I'm not doing that in this code

00:46:54,940 --> 00:47:00,529
we create a field list we add two fields

00:46:58,309 --> 00:47:02,480
to it the first is a check box it filled

00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:06,309
the second is that hidden field that

00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:09,619
track set ID we also create a new action

00:47:06,309 --> 00:47:12,200
called update when you click the update

00:47:09,619 --> 00:47:15,109
button it will call the save to do

00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:17,059
method on this controller so that's what

00:47:15,109 --> 00:47:18,950
these two lines say that says there is

00:47:17,059 --> 00:47:20,690
an action the button label on the button

00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:23,420
should be update the method to call

00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:25,579
should be saved to do and the controller

00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:29,119
that that method lives on is this

00:47:25,579 --> 00:47:30,890
controller there is a little bit of

00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:33,440
interesting stuff in the query here but

00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:34,789
it's otherwise it's just you're passing

00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,680
in some arguments to the check box it

00:47:34,789 --> 00:47:40,339
feel to see here's how you get the ideas

00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:42,230
and titles for the various to do's and

00:47:40,339 --> 00:47:44,359
then the last thing we're doing is once

00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:45,890
you actually submit that form you have a

00:47:44,359 --> 00:47:47,150
this method and this is the method that

00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:48,819
will be called when the form is

00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:51,319
submitted with the data that's submitted

00:47:48,819 --> 00:47:54,529
so again we need to go and get the set

00:47:51,319 --> 00:47:57,289
using that hidden cid we need to get

00:47:54,529 --> 00:47:58,940
that all of the checkbox information it

00:47:57,289 --> 00:48:00,799
might not exist if you don't check any

00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:02,630
of the check boxes then browsers don't

00:48:00,799 --> 00:48:03,680
bother to pass anything through which is

00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:04,849
a little bit irritating because your

00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,069
code will crash if you just assume it's

00:48:04,849 --> 00:48:09,140
there but we're just giving that we're

00:48:07,069 --> 00:48:11,720
checking to see if there then for all of

00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:14,119
the to do's and the set if it's in if it

00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:15,950
was checked then sit completed if it

00:48:14,119 --> 00:48:17,900
wasn't checked then clear completed and

00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:20,029
then right there to do and then finally

00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:21,710
at the end of the submission redirect

00:48:20,029 --> 00:48:23,240
back to the page you came from

00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:29,240
so i'm going to show you what that looks

00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:31,280
like in the page and i'm going to need

00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:34,180
to also check out my I've got to super

00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,180
git repositories

00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:54,590
so if we look in that template which

00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:56,780
I've just adjusted now we're saying if

00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:59,360
there are any to do sets let's put a

00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:01,610
nice motivating title in there to get

00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:04,100
people to get some stuff done and then

00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:06,560
loop through all of those to do sets but

00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:07,850
now call that new parameter that we've

00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:11,930
augmented that model within our

00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:14,780
controller and the result is that we

00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:24,410
will get a nice form if we look at that

00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:28,280
form you can see that it's created the

00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:30,650
form for us it's created the the action

00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:32,870
for us which is the title of that to do

00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:33,920
form there is a bunch of stuff and

00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:35,210
silver strike to make sure you're

00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:39,080
submitting to a form correctly and

00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:41,870
securely there's a csr of protection

00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:47,800
automatically get got created for us and

00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:49,730
if we check to those checkboxes huh I

00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:52,430
wonder if I just hit either I haven't

00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:55,180
flashed or it's not in there but is in

00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:55,180
there so I haven't flashed

00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:04,150
it's closed off the inspector

00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:14,800
so that's not super exciting it's just

00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:16,150
persisting the check box but we now have

00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:20,770
a form by which you can check off your

00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:24,730
to do's in your interface if we don't

00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:26,680
have this redirect back and instead we

00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:32,770
just print out the data you can see

00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:35,050
what's happening so now where we submit

00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:37,300
it's going to submit it to the form it's

00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:38,920
going to call that method the method is

00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:42,190
showing you the data that's being passed

00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:46,960
through into that method and then we

00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:48,430
just did dump the data out and exit so

00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,410
you can see that what happens is when

00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:52,240
you submit the form it calls this method

00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:54,220
we process it and then we redirect back

00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,630
to the page we were on you don't have to

00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:57,280
redirect back you can redirect we really

00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:59,290
like to you could also render a

00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:07,750
different response but redirect backers

00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:09,940
by far the worse common yeah this from

00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:12,370
the room are assembling emerging

00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:15,060
something that's need to check that he's

00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:17,110
done in the last 10-15 minutes here

00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:19,630
shall hand all the way around with a

00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:21,670
microphone otherwise there we go so this

00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:24,130
next feature a measure sorry what was

00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:26,740
next feature so the next thing that I

00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:28,090
have in the code I wasn't sure if we get

00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:30,490
to because we I didn't get to it in the

00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:32,020
run-through is that I add a carousel

00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:33,400
into the home page that you can eat it

00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:35,530
through the admin interface and again

00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:38,440
we're just adding a couple of fields to

00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:40,000
the page model we are adjusting a grid

00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:42,370
field to let you select images there is

00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,780
already image management and the CMS and

00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:46,480
then renewing it into the homepage as a

00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:48,730
carousel and I can show you that code

00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:51,760
but I can't really run through it yeah

00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:55,630
can I just ask a question about what the

00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:59,200
database looks like sure over here by

00:51:55,630 --> 00:52:00,460
the way hi hi so I see you kind of doing

00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,260
all the days or object stuff which is

00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:04,240
interesting you've created a new to do

00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:06,340
etc etc is but what does that actually

00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:09,280
look like and get stored in the data

00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:12,030
structure in the back end so I'll pull

00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:15,720
up sequel pro and we can have a look I

00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:15,720
don't normally use this

00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:25,890
so you can see I haven't bothered to

00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:25,890
clear out my old databases for a while

00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:34,450
what was the name of this this was what

00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:36,190
was the name of the project by default

00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:37,870
it will name your database the same as

00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:44,460
the name of the directory it's in silver

00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:47,500
stripe for teams example there we go so

00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:49,000
the to do will be nice and clean because

00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:52,120
there's no inheritance and there's no

00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:56,050
versioning so in that case if you look

00:52:52,120 --> 00:53:06,930
at the to do wonder if we can increase

00:52:56,050 --> 00:53:06,930
the size of that somehow sorry

00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:15,880
i wonder if i can just hold in I'd

00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:18,190
lesson I couldn't see was he something

00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:20,520
in there and I was missing it I can look

00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:20,520
down here

00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:29,400
uh-huh

00:53:27,099 --> 00:53:31,210
now that's just going to pick the

00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:35,650
monospaced font that's not going to help

00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:44,829
me I'm going to give the AV guys

00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:49,630
connections and try and change the very

00:53:44,829 --> 00:53:54,960
good can people read that now cool so

00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:54,960
basically there is a where's the schema

00:53:56,279 --> 00:54:04,210
so there are 1 2 3 4 48 fields we always

00:54:02,019 --> 00:54:09,819
set ID and it's always an audit if we

00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:12,220
don't try and use a sort of an ID that's

00:54:09,819 --> 00:54:15,970
our natural to the data we always create

00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:18,309
an order generated numeric ID we have

00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:21,369
the class name that's used for

00:54:18,309 --> 00:54:24,249
inheritance we need to know for each row

00:54:21,369 --> 00:54:25,210
what the class because we do multi table

00:54:24,249 --> 00:54:28,089
inheritance will take you through a

00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:30,759
second we always have last edited and

00:54:28,089 --> 00:54:33,130
created those are rated by the RM and

00:54:30,759 --> 00:54:36,700
then we have the four fields that we

00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:38,019
defined in our model now when we do have

00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:39,999
inheritance we use multi table

00:54:38,019 --> 00:54:43,960
inheritance so you can see for instance

00:54:39,999 --> 00:54:46,630
with site tree and page site tree is the

00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:48,880
base class and we have all of the fields

00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:51,339
that site redefines the URL the title

00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:54,640
the content the things like that but we

00:54:51,339 --> 00:54:56,559
also have the page so we're not actually

00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:58,150
defining any fields on page so it

00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:00,190
doesn't bother to create a table for us

00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:02,109
there is a different page called virtual

00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:03,729
page which inherits and that just has

00:55:02,109 --> 00:55:06,069
the three fields that are specific to

00:55:03,729 --> 00:55:08,229
that class so straight within to adjoin

00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:10,569
across the ID so the ID will be the same

00:55:08,229 --> 00:55:13,739
for any particular object within virtual

00:55:10,569 --> 00:55:13,739
page inside tree

00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:26,390
yes as long as it actually has fields so

00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:30,140
you can create classes that have methods

00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:31,670
so you know excesses or things to be

00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:33,829
called by the template or whatever but

00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:35,960
if you don't define any database fields

00:55:33,829 --> 00:55:37,130
or any heads one relationships and so it

00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:39,619
doesn't need he feels it won't create a

00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:41,599
table at that okay so for example sorry

00:55:39,619 --> 00:55:43,160
the answer specific if I'm interrupting

00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:45,829
anyone else just tell me to shut up and

00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:47,599
you know the microphone and so if you

00:55:45,829 --> 00:55:51,260
were to create a person for example and

00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:52,609
you would create a person data object to

00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:54,170
extend the day or up to apply you then

00:55:52,609 --> 00:55:56,030
get a person yeah if you wanted to have

00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:57,980
an actor which is a person that has

00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:59,839
appeared in a film if you would create

00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:03,020
an actor which would extend a person if

00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:04,250
you were to have a waiter for example

00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:06,650
they would have had to work in a

00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:09,410
restaurant you would have then three

00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:13,339
tables creative I silverstripe yes and

00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:14,900
so you might want to consider whether

00:56:13,339 --> 00:56:17,780
you're going to create I mean first at

00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:18,950
someone can be a way to end an actor so

00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:21,079
you might wait you want to look in both

00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:23,270
of those tables to find out yeah well

00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:26,000
kind of maybe well yeah you might want

00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:27,770
to have like a job object thats related

00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,819
but yet in that specific example yes you

00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:33,200
would have some tables and so if you you

00:56:31,819 --> 00:56:34,430
can end up with situations where you end

00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:36,140
up with a lot of tables if you're

00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:39,500
creating your object model without

00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:41,720
thought about how so is object mold the

00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:42,740
database it's actually okay that's

00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,839
probably what I should have asked in the

00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:51,920
first place yeah we always get there in

00:56:44,839 --> 00:56:54,380
the air other questions yeah you are

00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:56,960
showing that you don't have to register

00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:58,609
your modules anywhere let's say

00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:01,400
something goes wrong is there a way to

00:56:58,609 --> 00:57:03,530
disable a module oh that's either to do

00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:08,990
list without actually removing it from

00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:11,089
the code like some so you don't want the

00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:14,799
controller so you don't want the model

00:57:11,089 --> 00:57:18,650
to exist or you just want to turn it off

00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:20,900
so you could either remove all of the

00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:22,549
actions from allowed actions that would

00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:25,849
prevent it from being accessed over the

00:57:22,549 --> 00:57:27,619
web but it would still exist you could

00:57:25,849 --> 00:57:29,119
just not have it inherit from data

00:57:27,619 --> 00:57:29,730
object in which case it won't be

00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:31,440
discovered

00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:32,550
the data object you would have to be a

00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:35,070
little bit careful if you did that

00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:36,990
because if you Randhir build it's not

00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:39,180
there anymore so it's going to rename

00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:40,980
that table and call it obsolete it won't

00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:42,890
delete the data but it's also not going

00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:45,240
to get it back for you if you then

00:57:42,890 --> 00:57:46,910
recreate the model again and so it

00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:49,530
depends a little bit on what you mean by

00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:51,000
turn it off you certainly can there's

00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:52,230
multiple ways I can think of to solve

00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,580
that problem but it depends a little bit

00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:55,710
by what effect you're trying to achieve

00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:56,820
whether it's for security reasons or you

00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:57,990
know what the users to be able to see

00:57:56,820 --> 00:58:00,210
you know what the admin to be able to

00:57:57,990 --> 00:58:03,570
see it or you actually wanted to go away

00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:08,400
from the database for a while one more

00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:09,930
back there yeah in your in your models

00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,940
when you're obviously you can add fields

00:58:09,930 --> 00:58:14,730
and flush and it allowed them to the

00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:16,140
databases and I think you may mention

00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:18,570
this but acting quite catch what you

00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:20,609
said does it drop the fields well if you

00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:22,500
take them out of your model and then run

00:58:20,609 --> 00:58:25,440
flush so if you take them out of your

00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:27,359
model and then Randhir build it will

00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:29,160
rename the column to be obsolete

00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:31,700
underscore and then the name of the

00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:34,350
field it doesn't want to remove the data

00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:35,880
just in case you like especially during

00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:37,200
development you might be changing you

00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:39,630
know adding and removing the field quite

00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,920
a lot and if you've got a whole bunch of

00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:43,050
data and there it doesn't want to drop

00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:45,930
that column there is then a task you can

00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:48,300
run which is look through the database

00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:50,250
to find things called obsolete and drop

00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:52,350
them but you want to be a bit careful

00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:54,510
about doing that and subsequently she

00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:55,890
bring it back into the model will it

00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:57,300
just rename the obsolete or your own

00:58:55,890 --> 00:58:59,850
will you get an obsolete underscore

00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:05,130
obsolete so so no no me ya know so it

00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:07,290
should but I have been surprised before

00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:09,540
so that's something that I should pull

00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:11,250
them back in again but I would test that

00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:13,140
before relying on that especially for

00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:16,460
production data I just finally one thing

00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:19,200
your deployment method would be them to

00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:22,380
once you've finished developing yeah you

00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:27,000
would then run the flush on their own

00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:29,340
yeah so we deploy into uat with the code

00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,710
then you run dear builds flash on the

00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:33,510
uat side you make sure everything's good

00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:34,950
then you take that same code deploy to

00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:36,420
production and then you run dev build

00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:38,280
now because you've already done that on

00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:39,540
uat and your database should have been

00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:40,030
the same as on live you already know

00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:41,590
this

00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:43,330
change its going to make so you already

00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:45,130
know it's going to be fairly safe there

00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:47,140
are methods you can hook it into to

00:59:45,130 --> 00:59:48,640
create new records when that dev build

00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:51,220
happens so if you need to create new

00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:52,540
default data or modify your scheme but

00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:54,010
you know like if you're changing the

00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:56,020
schema in such a way that you need your

00:59:54,010 --> 00:59:58,210
data to be updated you can hook into

00:59:56,020 --> 01:00:00,640
that schema regeneration process to

00:59:58,210 --> 01:00:04,090
adjust your data during that process but

01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:06,280
also at in most cases we try and back up

01:00:04,090 --> 01:00:07,870
the database prior to running their dev

01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:10,810
build even when we know it's going to

01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:12,730
work just for those times that databases

01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:13,870
decide they don't like what you know

01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:16,300
what should work like for instance

01:00:13,870 --> 01:00:18,370
although uat and life should be exactly

01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:20,500
the same and we try and enforce that

01:00:18,370 --> 01:00:22,060
there are situations where like if air

01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:23,950
ops guys have gone in and loaded a

01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:25,540
database on client requests it might no

01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:26,800
longer be the same as the live database

01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:29,260
well here there's some great

01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:31,410
documentation online and three offices

01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:34,450
so there's a UK office now yep so

01:00:31,410 --> 01:00:35,650
there's a UK office I just saw Dan

01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:37,420
standing at the door before but he

01:00:35,650 --> 01:00:39,820
disappeared again he's our solution

01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:44,050
architect we've got over here and Joel

01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:45,130
who was there is he's there so Trek

01:00:44,050 --> 01:00:47,680
either of them down will track me down

01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:49,570
during the conference or you're in the

01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:51,130
rainmaking loft but you can't get in the

01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:53,140
UF to organize an appointment or

01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:55,120
something but they're around and happy

01:00:53,140 --> 01:01:01,660
to talk to people more about silver

01:00:55,120 --> 01:01:04,360
stripe I'm a che Friedlander on Twitter

01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:05,920
and there's eight silver stripe H a free

lenders also my github handle I have a

01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:11,110
am a on github so if you want to ask me

01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:12,460
source for questions or non silver

01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:13,540
straight questions so far all of the

01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:16,990
questions all that have been about

01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:19,630
whether I would fight 100 duck-sized

01:01:16,990 --> 01:01:22,050
horses or one horse-sized duck which is

01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:24,310
done terribly source type specific but

01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:26,560
again a free to contact me on there or

01:01:24,310 --> 01:01:29,140

you very much I please remember have a

01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:34,150
look at the feedback online as well and
