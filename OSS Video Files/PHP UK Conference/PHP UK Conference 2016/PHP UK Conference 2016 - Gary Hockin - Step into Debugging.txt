Publication date: 2016-03-16
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2016
Description: 
	While var_dump driven development is great when you're starting, at some point every developer wants more. Step debugging is the answer.

In this session we'll cover the fundamentals of installing and configuring Xdebug, configuring PhpStorm to listen to Xdebug, and then actually step debugging some scripts to find our problems. Step debugging PHP is an incredibly easy and powerful tool when you know how!"
