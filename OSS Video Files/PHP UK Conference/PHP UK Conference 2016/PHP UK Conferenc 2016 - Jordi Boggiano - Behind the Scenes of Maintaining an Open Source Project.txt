Title: PHP UK Conferenc 2016 - Jordi Boggiano - Behind the Scenes of Maintaining an Open Source Project
Publication date: 2016-03-16
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2016
Description: 
	The open source world is made out of human interactions as much as it is made of code. During this session, Jordi will be sharing his experiences as the Composer Project lead. He will show you glimpses into what it means and feels like to be the maintainer of a popular open source project. By sharing his experiences, Jordi hopes that you will gain a better understanding of the human factor in the open source community.

my name is Jody Bujji no that's how you

00:00:08,149 --> 00:00:13,910
pronounce it she saw Michael making fool

00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:18,410
of himself that's in case you heard I'm

00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:23,090
French I'm not French I sound French I'm

00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:28,040
from Belgium um yes that's that for me I

00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:31,820
guess okay so what I wanted to today is

00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:34,160
kind of show you like my experience

00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:37,130
about the whole open source ecosystem

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,620
and my spirit my experience maintaining

00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:43,130
projects and kind of share my view so

00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:46,700
that you get may be more understanding

00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:49,430
for what it's like because I I assume

00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:53,450
that most of you don't have like big

00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:54,980
projects you're maintaining because just

00:00:53,450 --> 00:01:00,050
generally there are not so many big

00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:02,630
projects and and yeah I think it's very

00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:04,820
important to kind of know what you know

00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:07,250
what the other person is thinking when

00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:09,770
you interact online so showing you my

00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,270
perspective might might lead you to to

00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:16,609
interact with better with open source

00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:19,819
project so I'm maintaining composure and

00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:22,670
packages and also monologue and a bunch

00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:26,060
of other stuff and like smaller scale

00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:27,530
projects most of this like most of the

00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:31,310
slides most of the experience obviously

00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:38,359
came from composer which is like fairly

00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:41,569
large project this point and it's gonna

00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:44,479
be five years old soon so it's also been

00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:48,349
a while so I had some time together

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:50,810
experience there and that's that so

00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:54,380
let's let's take a look I can't collect

00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:57,829
it a few sort of facets of these aspects

00:01:54,380 --> 00:02:06,169
of of maintenance and we'll go through

00:01:57,829 --> 00:02:10,610
them so first one is time this sometimes

00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:13,519
more so i guess most of your developers

00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:15,640
yes probably a bunch of UN agencies or

00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:19,350
even like walking on products

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,490
I guess you maybe had some sort of

00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:24,010
compromising situations where you have a

00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:26,260
deadline coming up and like you know the

00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:32,050
budget is running out and like okay

00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:33,790
let's cut corners here just just have to

00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:36,490
make do with the money you have right

00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:38,980
because usually like clients want a

00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:41,590
bunch of stuff and they only have so

00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:44,800
much money and like quite often this

00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:47,200
does not match so you have you have to

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:52,360
do just have to make do with what you

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:54,400
have fair enough um the problem is like

00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:58,390
with open source typically you have no

00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,489
budget so as you may know almost open

00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:03,310
source projects are free as in like

00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:06,209
freedom but also as India and that's

00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:10,360
probably a problem in some ways but

00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:14,350
anyway this is the state of the state of

00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:16,930
the metal so I think it's really

00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:19,870
important to consider this tastes like

00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,690
often people come and they want like all

00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:24,579
the features you know they really just

00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,110
want oh just one more feature in this

00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:28,570
project one more feature in this project

00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:31,989
but there is no budget still so we just

00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:34,570
you're piling up and like the amount of

00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:38,140
work is just piling up and it's not very

00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:40,989
sustainable the other thing really is to

00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:43,090
say like if you have to cut corners even

00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:45,760
when you have a budget like don't

00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:49,299
criticize people for you know having not

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,370
enough tests or or like the code is not

00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:53,860
perfectly up to your standards or

00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,360
whatever like there's no budget people

00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,700
do this for fun so they can do it

00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:03,549
however they want or how will they are

00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:07,450
able to this leads to work life balance

00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:11,380
issues as well obviously like the lack

00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:14,140
of time so we have like if you look on

00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:16,120
github in this contribution graph you

00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:20,140
know you see like people are like fairly

00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:23,260
weekday weekday patterns I guess value

00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:25,090
here you don't see the Sundays in the

00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:28,440
saturdays right because they are mostly

00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,440
blank um

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:33,400
but so that's that someone walking for

00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:36,280
Mozilla that that she's contributing to

00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:40,060
open source modular food products like

00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:42,760
as a day job so it's like weekdays and

00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:47,380
then and the weekend lasting that's fine

00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:50,560
it's fairly healthy and then we have

00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:53,260
like this this burnout pattern which is

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,030
not great like this is hockey I'm just

00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:59,460
walking non-stop non-stop until at some

00:04:55,030 --> 00:05:03,670
points like just calm down and not

00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:05,650
really healthy i would say i mean you

00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:08,340
clearly see that this is not looking

00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:12,280
sustainable compared to the previous one

00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:14,200
I had a bit the same experience where I

00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:19,510
was walking like kind of all over the

00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:21,940
place and then like that's a year later

00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:24,760
you see this big gap in the middle there

00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:27,310
because I just I got sick of it and I

00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:30,640
just bailed on holidays and stopped

00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:32,740
reading emails for month it felt kind of

00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:37,270
good until I came back and you know had

00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:40,690
a thousand emails from github so i

00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:44,290
wouldn't recommend it it's definitely

00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:46,210
not a good way to solve this what i

00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:49,090
would recommend why i was just like

00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:53,320
don't you to see this and to spot this

00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:56,410
burnout and i don't think this really

00:05:53,320 --> 00:06:00,150
like magical you know a three-step

00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:02,650
process to follow to avoid burnout but

00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:06,090
it's about knowing yourself and seen

00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:08,530
like if you feel always a know it all

00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:11,320
grumpy oh i don't know i mean maybe

00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:13,960
that's just your natural state but hey

00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,760
if you feel like does it change maybe

00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:19,360
you should consider that it might be

00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:23,230
closed by a sort of burnout happening to

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,940
you and then like once you identify this

00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:27,780
you can you know like talk to you both

00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:30,040
so talk to whoever you need to

00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,800
understand try and figure out a way to

00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:36,370
get out of this because quite often it's

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,080
like mostly self-inflicted and like for

00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:40,800
more from what I write about about the

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:46,480
topic it seems to be really

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:48,790
the main cause for for like walking

00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,950
non-stop is just that in your head you

00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:54,850
feel like you have to you know like you

00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:57,280
just have this self-inflicted like sense

00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:59,470
of responsibility that you have to do

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,950
everything and that's usually not all

00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:05,890
right it's just a feeling you have and

00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:07,960
that's something you can fix I think so

00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:11,280
just learning to delegate more just

00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,280
taking it easy oh i don't know like

00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:17,290
something else you can do on the other

00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,720
side like if you're using projects is to

00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:27,990
kind of avoid wasting people's time

00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:31,090
right um so this is an example i like

00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:34,060
because its true like it's yes it's

00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:39,790
indeed a conductor and not a composer

00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:42,820
and we up yeah it is factually

00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:45,810
accurate it's also a waste of time right

00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:48,900
like it's it's a funny issue and I I

00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:51,850
don't hold grudge against the guy but

00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:54,310
it's just down the line this is not

00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:56,530
really worth discussing and we are not

00:07:54,310 --> 00:08:00,670
gonna change it just because like it or

00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:05,700
not gonna change the name and like yeah

00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:05,700
nobody else wants to do a logo so don't

00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:12,820
this one disturbs me a little bit more

00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:14,470
this plus one pattern like you know plus

00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,390
one plus one plus one I guess you all

00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:20,530
saw this on some issues maybe you also

00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:24,150
contributed and plus one of your own um

00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:27,940
yeah I am myself tempted sometimes play

00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:30,700
that's really it's quite a pain and I

00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:32,169
did this this guy put it very well I

00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,880
think saying how many programmers does

00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:36,099
it take to post wanna get some issue

00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:41,650
asking for someone else to screw in a

00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:45,370
light bulb and its really describes the

00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:48,010
problem right it's saying hey like if

00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:49,360
ten people 15 people ask like hey can

00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,590
someone please do that can someone

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,330
please do that it's really important

00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,850
widen it down yes we can someone please

00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:56,130
do that sick

00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:59,009
teen of you that lady sound like you

00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:02,610
should have done it already like like

00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:06,089
yeah why isn't it done it's it's open

00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:09,690
source right and I think that's like

00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:13,230
sometimes people forget that like you

00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:14,970
can ask for things to get done but down

00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:24,990
the line most projects don't really owe

00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:30,750
you anything so yeah bit more positive

00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:34,199
topic is pride so last year things but

00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:37,649
if I tweeted this it's about a year ago

00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:40,079
because after they tweeted this the like

00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:42,209
some people started pestering them about

00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,769
giving you a free account and it's they

00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:45,600
gave me free account for one year but

00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:50,220
it's about to run out so this must be

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:52,259
able to you know if someone wants to

00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:57,899
stop pestering them again I don't feel

00:09:52,259 --> 00:10:00,110
like it don't feel like you should but

00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:03,180
anyway like it's nice to see that you

00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:05,730
you know what you produced like your

00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:07,649
code is used out there to build other

00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,959
things and it's it's a good feeling to

00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:11,490
see that you know a bunch of people are

00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:14,339
doing cool things with what you built

00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:16,620
and it does I mean it's it's not on it

00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:19,019
all fits your project right like people

00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:21,959
contributing to to a random project they

00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:24,509
also made it better and so on so I think

00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:27,990
that's quite nice and on the other

00:10:24,509 --> 00:10:31,230
aspect you also have like just the the

00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:36,360
pint of while giving other people play

00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:38,610
right so like this gentleman that was

00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:42,149
well chuffed about his first request

00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:45,000
being lobster yeah I usually make a joke

00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:46,860
about when chopped because it sounds

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:54,860
funny if you're not in the UK but i

00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:57,329
think is here just sounds normal so um

00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:59,310
pierre nights is definitely nice like

00:10:57,329 --> 00:11:00,959
i've had that a few times where you just

00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:02,309
melt someone's put a question they're

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,949
really happy because their first

00:11:02,309 --> 00:11:06,570
contribution is your project or just

00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:09,510
overall first

00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:11,660
you never and so having this chance to

00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:14,130
give that to someone is really nice and

00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:18,840
it doesn't cost me much down the line no

00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:26,430
it's just not boom then I can take all

00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:30,300
the credit so angers bit more

00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:37,890
problematic we have people like this

00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:39,630
very angry mr. slab who deleted

00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:41,700
his account at some point I don't know

00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:47,280
we named it it it's not there anymore

00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:49,380
she can't go insult him but yeah this

00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,960
was just really angry tweets like the

00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:56,340
awesome north and I did not fit on the

00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:58,440
slides but although all just angry about

00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:00,630
elasticsearch and solar and whatever

00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:04,230
like just absolutely no relevance

00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:08,640
whatsoever is I like this like wow and

00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:12,060
okay so you know it's just it goes so

00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:15,990
far it's kind of funny again it is not

00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:19,020
video offensive and on the other hand

00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:21,990
this one I felt a bit more personal

00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:24,540
because I felt like the whole process

00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:26,730
involved was was quite extensive that

00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:28,980
they you know they photoshopped images

00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:31,320
and so on but then like painted them and

00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:35,490
put them on the wall and took a photo

00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:39,210
and then tweeted that photo I guess it's

00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:45,300
just they were really pissed at the

00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:47,550
software directly and I mean yeah that's

00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:52,500
that's a little Hank man composure on

00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:54,990
the left just in case you do notice so

00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,820
there I like when I see this even though

00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:58,860
you know it wasn't directed at me I

00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,810
think they just tweeted it and I saw it

00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:04,080
because i have searches on twitter and

00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:06,840
so on and so this just feels a bit more

00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:09,740
personal and like you do this kind of

00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,740
you know and just

00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:18,189
just I mean really because like there's

00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:20,290
nothing you can do like down the line it

00:13:18,189 --> 00:13:22,689
still it's your project is your baby and

00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:25,209
you spend so much time like you know you

00:13:22,689 --> 00:13:27,970
cannot dissociate yourself completely so

00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:30,939
when people are really mad it's it just

00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:37,179
yeah it hurts a little bit like I wasn't

00:13:30,939 --> 00:13:39,369
really crying it's okay but yeah all in

00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:41,739
all is like what I what I see the amount

00:13:39,369 --> 00:13:45,100
of anger i see is nothing compared to

00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:48,639
other stuff so this is a post by Leonard

00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:52,569
tutoring that maintains systemd and it

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:54,819
contains things like death threats or 10

00:13:52,569 --> 00:13:59,079
they actually wanted to hire a hitman so

00:13:54,819 --> 00:14:01,809
they were collecting bitcoins I didn't

00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:04,449
like posting songs about how how much of

00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:06,249
an idiot he is on Twitter on YouTube and

00:14:04,449 --> 00:14:08,920
so on like this is just really sick

00:14:06,249 --> 00:14:13,629
stuff like just it's horrible sick

00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:16,689
things that people do and like this this

00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:18,910
I find is extremely messed up like if it

00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:25,869
goes to this extent if you like we

00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:28,990
really have a problem I mean especially

00:14:25,869 --> 00:14:30,999
in this case I find it particularly bad

00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:33,309
since like the if you follow the whole

00:14:30,999 --> 00:14:36,850
system d polemic I mean I didn't

00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:39,519
following details but like the arguments

00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:43,689
is about linux distros adopting this

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:45,970
software or not all right and like the

00:14:43,689 --> 00:14:47,920
guys contributing to the project down

00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,420
the line has no impact on that so not

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,189
much like they'll just keep putting it

00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:53,049
out there and say hey it's there if you

00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:54,970
want to use it then this was our

00:14:53,049 --> 00:14:57,660
adopting it and everyone gets mad at the

00:14:54,970 --> 00:15:04,509
original although it's like it's crazy

00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:08,529
but it's just it's just life now um if

00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:10,480
you look at this very small squad saying

00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:12,279
the culture of any organization is

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:16,869
shaped by the walls behavior the leaders

00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:19,629
is willing to tolerate um like if you

00:15:16,869 --> 00:15:21,030
take that and apply this view to the

00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:24,200
Linux community

00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:29,190
I think it makes sense why we see like

00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:31,350
bitcoins and hit man because like you

00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:35,310
have Linus on top that's kind of being a

00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:37,290
dick all the time to everyone and like

00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:39,810
the problem is it trickles down from the

00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:42,390
right it's everyone looks up to him and

00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:46,890
see our case it's completely fine to

00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:49,680
just insult people and like you know you

00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:53,580
your patch was bad like you're the worst

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:58,770
person why why do you not to say that

00:15:53,580 --> 00:16:01,020
like this is completely useless and so I

00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:03,150
think it's important like if if you're a

00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:07,890
leader like any kind of community leader

00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:11,010
and i would say that every project in a

00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:13,650
way it's it's own community right you

00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:15,990
have to show an example and like I think

00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:18,180
one way to do that is maybe use as an

00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:20,310
open source code of conduct I'm not

00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:25,080
going into this debate in depth right

00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:28,080
now but but I think it's a good thing

00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:31,790
like it's showing that you have good

00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:34,080
intent and that you are open to everyone

00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:38,220
you know and that you won't tolerate

00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:41,570
like just harassment or otherwise like

00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:44,250
negativity in general if you know this

00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:46,710
is cold and none of these people and

00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:48,330
it's those things shouldn't mix like

00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:51,120
it's just people looking at code and

00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:52,500
commenting about God if people start

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,340
insulting each other than it's just

00:16:52,500 --> 00:17:00,600
there's no point anymore so just

00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:02,370
consider that hopefully like this hold I

00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,990
mean in case you're not aware is this

00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:09,030
whole debate right now going on as the

00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:10,500
PHP internals may be adapting one and so

00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:13,370
I hope that this will go well and

00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:16,290
eventually we have like a good sort of

00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:18,030
PHP example of how to have a good code

00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:24,090
of conduct and then maybe some projects

00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:26,580
thing out of that we'll see um another

00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:30,030
thing to consider is like angry people

00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:32,650
in general are just not really worth it

00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:36,190
and especially like

00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:39,670
replying you know bringing yourself down

00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:41,080
to the level just doesn't bring much and

00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:43,930
kayla mentioned this as well this

00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,460
morning right well if someone attacks

00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:49,300
you or was something like just attacking

00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:51,310
back all like otherwise tweeting people

00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:53,710
that disagree with you like shaped it

00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:57,510
does not lead to any good discussion

00:17:53,710 --> 00:18:01,300
it's just it's not how you do it and

00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:05,440
like simple example this wasn't really

00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:07,510
bad like this wasn't like an attack or

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,310
anything i was just like saying okay

00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:12,370
composer makes me sad in so many ways

00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:15,880
it's just not positive either like it's

00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:19,510
completely not constructive and i just

00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:24,780
also k like you care to explain know and

00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:28,120
I mean I just stay staying you know

00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:32,470
factual and saying okay look like okay

00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:35,650
you're sad good whatever can we move on

00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:38,650
and just explain a bit more what what

00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:41,020
the actual problem is then we just go

00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:43,540
back to the same discussion where we can

00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:46,660
actually like communicate facts and not

00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:51,940
just like angry insults and death

00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:53,650
threats so like obviously the problem is

00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:55,180
like the first reaction you get when you

00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:57,000
read something like that is you just

00:18:55,180 --> 00:19:00,160
want to punch them in the face like that

00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:05,200
you know that's just human I mean I

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:08,710
think it's not just me maybe it's just

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:13,660
me but i think you know no matter how

00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:16,750
you like visualize it um it's just i get

00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:20,290
negative feelings and you have to be

00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:22,420
able to step back and just like take

00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:24,280
five minutes and then go answer it

00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:29,110
saintly and then you bring the whole

00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:31,330
discussion down to 20 same level yeah

00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:33,970
that's a similar example of someone like

00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:35,770
saying obviously this obvious point and

00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:38,350
I love the English there

00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:41,470
um this is not Olivia blah blah blah

00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:43,150
gives because of my stupid opinions so

00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:47,110
that's already like okay no it's because

00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:51,510
of my opinions no just might not agree

00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:55,170
with them but not necessary stupid um

00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:58,360
and then yet the ending that I was

00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:59,800
saying just because you wrote it in your

00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,900
free time doesn't mean you escape the

00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:05,140
criticism I think it was very

00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:07,450
interesting because I agree with that my

00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:10,390
case I think yeah it's fair I put it out

00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:12,480
there it's phil game that i will get

00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:15,310
feedback on it i know it's gonna happen

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,260
but that's not really criticism I like

00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:19,450
calling me an idiot and having stupid

00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:23,910
opinions that to me this abuse it's not

00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:29,800
criticism so like okay but nope not

00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:32,230
interested so these days are just like

00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,480
at some point when I see the discussion

00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:37,180
is not going anywhere and we tried to be

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,790
adults a few times and it still doesn't

00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:42,640
help you just don't have a choice you

00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:44,950
lock the issue and that's it just lock

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,920
it and walk away because if you think I

00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:50,710
can how there's no nothing left other

00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:55,000
than insulting back again this brings

00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:56,770
nothing so yellow kitten then go have a

00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,700
nice day and do and probably still be

00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:12,210
raging behind a keyboard but he can't do

00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:14,740
anything about it then no more anger um

00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:18,480
misunderstandings I think yeah they

00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:21,640
apply to a few she respects but like

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:25,720
coding style coding standards and so on

00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:28,450
i think is quite important just to

00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,490
respect it like of course we're gonna

00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:33,010
make mistakes sometimes because you

00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:36,190
don't realize that you you know but if

00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:40,270
you see a file is like fully done in a

00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:42,760
way like try and respected I do kind of

00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:46,290
extreme opposite of that this is this

00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:48,490
pull request tiger just changing the

00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:50,740
reformatted all the JavaScript

00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:53,590
they'll be indecent acts specification

00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:57,070
like what the hell is going on here like

00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:58,960
is like first of all what is this Airbnb

00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:01,540
syntax specification I never heard of

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:05,950
and second like why are you doing this

00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:08,980
like this completely uncalled for and a

00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:14,460
complete waste of time really like just

00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:19,929
yeah I i don't know i just closed it

00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:21,580
because not interested but what this is

00:22:19,929 --> 00:22:24,010
really is like it's a communication

00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:25,630
issue it's just someone not not asking

00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:27,820
beforehand or something and just

00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:36,070
thinking they're doing the right way but

00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:39,130
is totally misplaced similarly like this

00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:42,309
example I hold Marco is not in the woman

00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:46,800
because he's Hindu I don't know I'm

00:22:42,309 --> 00:22:46,800
blinded so I won't see him cringe anyway

00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:54,100
so yeah moccasin this probably quest a

00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:56,470
while back and as you see it had 57

00:22:54,100 --> 00:23:01,000
comments in eight hundred lines added so

00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:04,270
it's quite extensive and then I looked

00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:08,080
at it and I was like don't really wanna

00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:11,020
know that just because it had some

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,750
impact and like doesn't know the details

00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:16,120
on my but the point is like after

00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:18,580
discussion of 10 minutes we've figured

00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:21,490
out an alternative way to do what he

00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:25,150
wanted to do and so he could move along

00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:28,179
happy but then I'm like okay now I still

00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:30,190
have to close this request right I still

00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:33,400
feel really bad because I know someone

00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:35,800
wasted a lot of time on this and so it's

00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:39,910
not really good for anyone in this

00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:42,429
situation I think because like if they

00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:45,640
actually came to us beforehand we could

00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:49,039
have had the 10 minutes discussion yeah

00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:51,210
saved a bunch of time

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:57,149
someone who's related to that we have

00:23:51,210 --> 00:24:01,139
guilt yeah I don't know if you remember

00:23:57,149 --> 00:24:05,600
this bumblebee project I think some some

00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:10,350
Ruby project that had an issue already

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:13,889
they had a RM minus RF and then some /

00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:15,419
and then a valuable and the someone

00:24:13,889 --> 00:24:18,210
messed up and I did the space between

00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:20,820
the slash in the very well so when it

00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:23,940
finally was just doing LM alive / and

00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:27,169
end the viable but not them together so

00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:30,059
that was not good outcomes of you see

00:24:27,169 --> 00:24:32,039
and I keeper made a bunch of fun with

00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:35,070
them and you know on top of hacker news

00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:36,720
and so on everyone laughing and you see

00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:39,029
it in you laughs of course right and

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:45,330
because it's funny because someone lost

00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:48,289
a lot of data yay but then yeah one day

00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:54,090
I woke up and saw this email in my inbox

00:24:48,289 --> 00:25:01,639
saying composer it is my hot dog and you

00:24:54,090 --> 00:25:01,639
read that like this is not good at all

00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:11,809
yeah it was okay like it nobody really

00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:14,340
noticed so so it will not find that

00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:16,740
still like you do feel some

00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:18,899
responsibility things like you know even

00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:21,090
though people don't pay for the software

00:25:18,899 --> 00:25:26,580
or anything it's still your code that

00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:28,740
messed up in a way so it's so yeah you

00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,999
take that into consideration I guess if

00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:34,679
you want to go in the open source world

00:25:29,999 --> 00:25:41,369
and every time you type a link or I'll

00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:47,190
then like be careful communication a few

00:25:41,369 --> 00:25:50,519
tips there now one thing I really try to

00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:54,210
do is did you say thank you when I merge

00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:56,200
something on github because I find it

00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:58,029
very impersonal like these

00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:01,120
you know like it used to be like you

00:25:58,029 --> 00:26:03,220
just write a patch and you do a diff and

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,200
you send that thief by emailed someone

00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:08,080
and learn they will review it and apply

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:15,070
to the lesbian three years even see CBS

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:18,340
is V CBS that's all I don't remember and

00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:20,470
then like github came and made the whole

00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:22,120
process really a lot smoother now you

00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:26,230
just get this pull request in New York

00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:28,389
Oh looks good green button nose done and

00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:29,889
like you know no human interaction we

00:26:28,389 --> 00:26:33,940
didn't have to talk to anyone it's

00:26:29,889 --> 00:26:36,399
amazing but I think it's still canonized

00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:38,980
to have some sort of humanity in the

00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:40,840
process so just writing thank you when

00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:43,059
it specially if it's a new contributor

00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:50,649
and so on I think it doesn't hurt and

00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:52,590
it's like probably appreciated um yeah

00:26:50,649 --> 00:26:54,880
that's just a quick note about

00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:58,149
communication and like when I reporting

00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:01,929
issues trying to give a bit more details

00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:11,679
than that and because otherwise I just

00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:14,470
make fun of people but you know like we

00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:17,470
see like the this is clear night but at

00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:19,539
that point they already solved it and if

00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:23,289
they actually had a message or something

00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:26,500
like we could have helped him I actually

00:27:23,289 --> 00:27:31,240
helped introduced and so the funny

00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:33,809
comment but yeah like what's what's

00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:36,389
interesting there is only and i think is

00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:39,279
like probably the the error message

00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:41,980
wouldn't even fit in tweet right so

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:44,649
maybe not using twitter for reporting

00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:48,789
our messages is all like reporting bugs

00:27:44,649 --> 00:27:51,610
is a good idea um also just because even

00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:55,299
if if it's a valid bug report or feature

00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:57,639
requests or anything like it's just in

00:27:55,299 --> 00:28:00,190
my 12 healed right I see it I'm like oh

00:27:57,639 --> 00:28:02,019
yeah that's totally like we should do

00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:07,120
that and then five minutes later is gone

00:28:02,019 --> 00:28:09,700
if that's it so like we have an issue

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:15,809
tracker and I think it's important to

00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:19,659
keep using that for shoes um yeah just

00:28:15,809 --> 00:28:24,659
really explain what is going on why is

00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:24,659
not working and so on bit more details

00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:34,690
this point is more about communication

00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:38,980
in public and I mean this has nothing to

00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:41,529
do with PHP but it's just it was just a

00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:45,940
good highlight I think of this fact that

00:28:41,529 --> 00:28:47,830
Twitter is very public and like it's

00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:50,169
easy to forget sometimes that you know

00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:52,720
even if you if you send it to it to

00:28:50,169 --> 00:28:54,490
someone like mentioning them if both of

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,250
you have a lot of followers in common

00:28:54,490 --> 00:29:01,539
had all these people see that is why

00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:04,299
tonight and so when you have like any

00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:06,490
kind of public figure which is I don't

00:29:04,299 --> 00:29:08,789
know what the description is of a public

00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:12,039
figure exactly in terms of followers but

00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:14,889
if you have any few hundreds of a few

00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:16,990
thousands of followers for sure like you

00:29:14,889 --> 00:29:19,210
know on twitter is kind of this micro

00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:22,570
bubbles and i know like if i look at the

00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:25,570
other stats like maybe my fellowship is

00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:28,990
like ninety-eight percent top

00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:30,850
interesting tech looks like oh really i

00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:37,090
mean obviously that's all I tweet about

00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:39,159
right almost so so like these are like

00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:40,500
small groups of people and it feels like

00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:43,510
you're just throwing stuff out in

00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:46,000
internet and it's not like it's a small

00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:47,830
community looking at each other and and

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,429
again if we think back to this to this

00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:54,760
this group thing of like he tells

00:29:50,429 --> 00:29:56,710
tolerating you know bad behavior if you

00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:59,019
see leaders fighting against each other

00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:00,610
on Twitter like young and I start

00:29:59,019 --> 00:30:02,440
thinking I that's cool that's that's how

00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:04,990
we do it here and then you start also

00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:07,080
just insulting other people because they

00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:10,299
use disorder framework or whatever like

00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:11,919
this is not good to just keep this in

00:30:10,299 --> 00:30:13,899
mind like if you want to insert some

00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,809
lunch don't do it on Twitter don't do it

00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:17,980
publicly I will just don't do it also

00:30:16,809 --> 00:30:21,680
but

00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:28,460
if you really must like at least go back

00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:32,150
channels by email or something community

00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:33,740
is well my conference season song you

00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:35,570
know like that's definitely one of the

00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:40,580
good sides open source I think like to

00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:44,210
me like mostly I mean since I started

00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:46,220
contributing with composer and so on or

00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:48,110
like symphony before that I got a lot

00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:51,320
more involved in the community I got a

00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:52,910
lot more involved in conferences that

00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:55,670
got me to travel to a bunch of places

00:30:52,910 --> 00:31:01,130
and so on makes really good fun you meet

00:30:55,670 --> 00:31:04,880
a lot of people the most analyze know

00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:10,130
it's really was it and you also get cake

00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:12,590
sometimes so I got this in the mail like

00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:14,540
three years ago I know yeah this was

00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:17,150
further with this a birthday of

00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:23,450
composure just got a cake in the mail

00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:27,980
didn't know this was possible it's

00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:30,110
pretty cool adult random community

00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:33,050
things it's like someone's halloween

00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:36,350
contest costume costume contest thing

00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:37,790
like he showed me and a few months ago

00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:41,360
and I was like okay that is really

00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:42,860
awesome like I need that photo because

00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,640
it's good like it's just it's kinda

00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:48,679
crazy but it's someone that is also like

00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:52,670
such a fair enough of this thing and

00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:55,360
just decided okay let's go nuts I don't

00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:57,559
think anyone got it though I'm not sure

00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,420
but I think he did a pretty good job

00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:02,330
like if you compare there and on the

00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:08,330
hands and everything like the book it's

00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:10,400
pretty spot-on um yeah that's another

00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:12,920
thing I don't know if you have seen that

00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:17,809
it was just a little comet it made

00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:20,750
composer twice as fast don't disable

00:32:17,809 --> 00:32:24,770
Jeezy doe this only applies to composers

00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:27,360
just twice as fast magic for composing

00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:30,740
most little projects it will make them

00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:33,300
slower don't don't try this at home but

00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:37,650
like yeah we just you know we committed

00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:40,680
that and then I created gift portals as

00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:44,040
he called it where we had like 500

00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:47,490
comments I think most of them with gifts

00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:53,550
which at this point crashes most puzzles

00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:59,460
anything then finally we have

00:32:53,550 --> 00:33:01,260
contribution and then I think small pull

00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:03,360
requests I'm really nice like you know

00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:07,680
small documentation fixes and so on we

00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:10,550
really try to encourage that icon on the

00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:13,260
in the docs now if you've seen it but

00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:15,420
the at the bottom of each page we have

00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:16,800
an edit link so you can just like Press

00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:19,620
that and if you are logged into github

00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:22,440
you just directly go to the to the right

00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:24,600
page in edit mode so get like the same

00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,220
same document but in edit mode and you

00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,650
can change something submit a pull

00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:32,430
request lights like to fix so it's

00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:34,860
really easy I think it's a good way to

00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:36,660
get people to be involved right if you

00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:38,840
never contributed something and you may

00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:41,370
be a bit scared to to get bad feedback

00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:44,550
especially in the UK I think this

00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:46,230
applies because like most of you against

00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:48,960
your native language is English so you

00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:52,800
can prolly you know if only fixing typos

00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:55,530
in documentation from all the poly like

00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:59,790
for English speakers out there in the

00:33:55,530 --> 00:34:01,410
open source community that's a good way

00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:04,380
to get started writing it's not too

00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:05,970
scary because I mean what could go on

00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:08,610
like if you fix the typo it's fairly

00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:13,350
unambiguous that it it's gonna be a good

00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:16,590
pull request I'm on the other hand like

00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:20,490
it's more pull requests sometimes a bit

00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:23,040
nasty because you can hear those

00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:25,140
one-liner changes it seemed really like

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:28,440
simple and obvious anything okay yeah

00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:30,720
that's fine I just nudge it and they

00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:35,010
just happen to break everything like

00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:37,389
this happened to me quite a few times so

00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:41,019
with the years you just get wiser and

00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:43,119
pano it and just stop merging anything

00:34:41,019 --> 00:34:45,579
is that we reviewing it and trying it

00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:48,519
out and so on and so that means like the

00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:50,710
process takes time and you have to be

00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:54,369
patient and sometimes it takes too long

00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:56,500
I agree like something like West helping

00:34:54,369 --> 00:35:00,010
out there for ages which I'm not proud

00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:02,279
of but I'd rather wait and just like

00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:08,170
merging it and everything blows up so

00:35:02,279 --> 00:35:10,569
just keep that in mind finally the

00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:13,059
contributing is is about much more than

00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:15,730
just gold I thing is it's also like the

00:35:13,059 --> 00:35:18,010
whole issue process and like as i

00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:19,809
mentioned documentation or helping

00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:22,569
people in Stack Overflow and so on like

00:35:19,809 --> 00:35:25,779
that that's all part of contributing I

00:35:22,569 --> 00:35:30,279
think and that's all stuff that you can

00:35:25,779 --> 00:35:33,339
really help with then finally like if

00:35:30,279 --> 00:35:35,769
you really wanna know send code but you

00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:37,539
don't know what to do like this happens

00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:40,710
people are like oh I have a free

00:35:37,539 --> 00:35:42,849
afternoon but I don't know what to do

00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:47,740
can't remember last time that happened

00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:49,480
to me but if it happens to you I would

00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:52,450
say I just look at the projects you use

00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:55,089
right and most likely there's something

00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:56,769
that just you feel is not really ideal

00:35:55,089 --> 00:35:59,470
or that you you have to walk around

00:35:56,769 --> 00:36:02,859
sometimes you can maybe just you know

00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:05,109
send it to my question and fix it at

00:36:02,859 --> 00:36:15,549
like improve something that you use on a

00:36:05,109 --> 00:36:19,539
daily basis okay so let's recap um open

00:36:15,549 --> 00:36:22,690
source like I think some companies like

00:36:19,539 --> 00:36:25,660
mostly companies doing that tend to just

00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:27,819
like dump code on people like like going

00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:29,980
ok now this despite with people we've

00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:33,880
been working on it's just it's now open

00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:37,420
so open source da and self pat on the

00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:40,900
back and walk away and that's not cool

00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:43,930
like that's really this not open source

00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:46,960
is much more than that I think and on

00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:49,630
the on the user point of view it's also

00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:53,049
not just getting free stuff

00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:55,299
right like which it's easy to consume

00:36:53,049 --> 00:36:57,880
all this all this code for free but I

00:36:55,299 --> 00:37:00,880
think it's also a lot more than that and

00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:04,359
to me it's about all all this it's like

00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:07,119
just reviewing pune question and like

00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:08,950
getting more people to contribute maybe

00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:12,130
going to conference is helping others

00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:19,029
whatever just a lot of work that goes

00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:22,539
around it just not just the code what i

00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:25,059
like about this list is that it's

00:37:22,539 --> 00:37:29,769
actually that is possible for anyone to

00:37:25,059 --> 00:37:32,200
do all this stuff on any project like

00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:36,329
literally any project it's open source

00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:39,039
on github you can do any of this because

00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:41,529
like you cannot merge things because

00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:44,410
really all that's the only privilege

00:37:41,529 --> 00:37:47,440
that maintain will have right like over

00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:49,390
any other user or something the rest is

00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,759
just it's it's free for all like you

00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:53,859
can't go on an issue and you know add a

00:37:51,759 --> 00:37:55,960
comment and say hey yeah I tried it and

00:37:53,859 --> 00:37:58,029
it also you know what for me I couldn't

00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:00,759
people use can you add more like give us

00:37:58,029 --> 00:38:02,289
more info like a lot of people do this

00:38:00,759 --> 00:38:06,099
and that's really good like you don't

00:38:02,289 --> 00:38:07,839
have to be a maintainer officially and

00:38:06,099 --> 00:38:11,589
there's no ceremony with this world or

00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:15,130
anything we just get like Christ unless

00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:22,420
new maintainer you just get there and do

00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:25,390
it and that's it so yeah you might have

00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:30,369
seen it's not always easy like you do

00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:33,039
get some bad actors out there but like

00:38:30,369 --> 00:38:35,559
sometimes it puts you down to the point

00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:39,039
where like not very happy with the

00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:40,599
Walden info and but i think it's it's

00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:42,880
really important to just watch out for

00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:45,910
that like again like gone out and so on

00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:48,609
if if you feel like like you just have

00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:52,269
ungrateful users and people asking like

00:38:48,609 --> 00:38:56,410
many more features and this may be just

00:38:52,269 --> 00:39:00,140
time to step back and then when you come

00:38:56,410 --> 00:39:08,570
back you might have cake as well so plus

00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:12,000
um like this this Jas deaf person I've

00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:13,470
said this like people who consume open

00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,200
source software need to be nicer to

00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:17,700
those who build it and I think that's

00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:21,650
very true and it's very true for

00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:24,960
everyone right it's I mean me as we

00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:26,700
produce oh I also use a bunch of stuff I

00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,130
composer for example has a few

00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,900
dependencies so if only with that i'm

00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:34,140
already using a bunch of other open

00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:36,660
source project so i i'm also user like

00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:41,310
everyone is user and maintainer in a way

00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:43,710
I guess it's it's really it's just this

00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:46,530
big processor in my head it's you have

00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:49,170
this all these cogs that go together and

00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:51,450
and we're all part of this and I think

00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:54,750
it's really important to realize that if

00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:56,070
you if you want to take part in like you

00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:58,890
know if you if you want to use something

00:39:56,070 --> 00:40:01,260
okay but then you just enter the whole

00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:03,750
process and then you should on that and

00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:06,800
like you should also contribute and not

00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:10,740
be afraid of it and just like go for on

00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:13,380
like join the party so that's that for

00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:16,860
me thank you very much and I hope you

00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:21,980
have a good evening oh good good beer

00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:21,980
