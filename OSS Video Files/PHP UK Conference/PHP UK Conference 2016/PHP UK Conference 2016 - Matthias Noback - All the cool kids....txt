Description: 
	The PHP world is spinning quite fast these days. There’s a lot to keep up with. You can’t be an expert in all subjects, so you need a way to find out what’s relevant for you and your team. Which approaches to software development would be useful? Which programming paradigms could help you write better code? And which architectural styles will help your application to survive in this quickly changing world? In this talk I’ll help you answer these questions by taking a bird’s-eye view. I will quickly guide you along some of the most fascinating topics in modern PHP development: DDD, BDD, TDD, hexagonal architecture, CQRS, event sourcing and micro-services. We’ll see how these things are related to each other, and how understanding and applying them can help you improve your software projects in many ways.
