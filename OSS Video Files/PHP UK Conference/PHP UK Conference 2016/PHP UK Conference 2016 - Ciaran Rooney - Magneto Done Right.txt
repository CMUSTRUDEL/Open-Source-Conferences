Thanks and so I'm going to talk about

00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:26,290
magento done rice whoo or can it ever be

00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:28,180
done right hopefully and I said I'm

00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:34,420
Karen Rooney I workout spoon additions

00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:36,610
we sell furniture online we've been

00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:40,269
doing that for quite a while and as he's

00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:42,309
already mentioned I used to work skim

links which is a big ad tech company

00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:45,760
based here some of you my food I worked

00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:49,390
with them from the very beginning up

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,710
until they got really big and recently

00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,690
was that which is the language

00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:55,329
learning up kind of help them turn

00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:58,149
around all their apps and stuff there

00:00:55,329 --> 00:01:00,489
and I also work with C camp as a mentor

00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:03,339
I'm really great accelerator based here

00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:05,140
in London and all across Europe and I

00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:08,650
help mentor their their early stage

00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:11,620
companies and I've run PHP UK for quite

00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:15,880
a few years before a year ago two years

00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:17,980
ago I stopped doing and that's my things

00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:25,579
you can contact me you can tweet me

00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:30,780
email me whatever hmm

00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:32,369
hi yeah and so I could talk a little bit

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:38,000
about magento pass what we did wrong

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:38,000
what one its that's the biggest section

00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:44,369
present so kind of how we fixed all of

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:46,740
that and what what the state of magenta

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:48,329
looks like right now and a little bit

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,479
about the future so where where is

00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:56,270
magenta going and a little bit about

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:59,490
magento to so magento past so magento

00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:03,990
came out of an agency called Varian

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:07,200
varying was founded in 2001 and they

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:09,030
were mostly using iOS commerce and they

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,709
found ours commerce really restrictive

00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,390
and so that we're going to fork it and

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:15,900
we're going to make something new that's

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:18,000
going to called bento and then they

00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,549
really looked into ours commerce and

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,620
found it was really bad so they said no

00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:26,310
it's just right it from scratch so they

00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:30,630
they they wrote a new e-commerce system

00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:33,480
from scratch and in august 31st 2007

00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:35,760
they they released a beta to the public

00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,709
and then they found out there was

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,230
something else called bento so they

00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:42,840
renamed it and they named it magento and

00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:46,290
the term mage apparently comes from

00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,470
Dungeons and Dragons a wood means a

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,660
wizard and if you ever wondered why

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:54,829
magento sometimes seems a bit magic I

00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,829
think this explains it

00:02:55,189 --> 00:03:00,540
and also the reason for the weird logo

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,170
there the Magento logo was supposed to

00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:06,420
be inspired from the dragon lace logo I

00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,950
guess it explains the colors but I don't

00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,980
know where else that's going from that

00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:14,970
is the lower and so magenta one point Oh

00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:21,540
came out March 31st 2008 if we look at

00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:24,769
our past so we found it in 2012 we had

00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:27,659
just one product it was just a chair and

00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:31,049
we sell it online and we use the

00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:36,709
community edition of Magento and we had

00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:40,049
an agency build it I'm not sure who a

00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:41,340
couple over the years and they did in

00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:43,889
about two weeks and it was really quick

00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:48,379
and that looked like this and it worked

00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:48,379
and people could buy by the chair and

00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:53,310
Debbie and Brian who founded the company

00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:55,170
they didn't really know any that much

00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,609
about e-commerce or development they

00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,590
weren't developers they develop a

00:03:56,609 --> 00:04:00,480
background so the agency built on the

00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:04,709
site they give them a zip file and said

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,449
good luck off you go and have fun with

00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:08,790
your website so they first thing they

00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:11,639
had to do is find a hosting company to

00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:13,500
put it on so they googled magento

00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:17,400
hosting and they found someone that

00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,859
looked a bit like this and this it

00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:23,490
seemed like a good deal so they said two

00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:25,229
darlings like how can you go wrong and

00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,760
there they are CADC what what do we do

00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:30,680
they're like you just take the zip file

00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:33,270
put it on the host and are you done and

00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,550
you know if you need to change anything

00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:38,580
we'll just ftp into the box and we'll

00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:41,610
edit the files and then we'll update it

00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:45,240
and everything will be fine and that

00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:49,110
seemed yeah ok we'll do that and then

00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,030
one day this happened the hard drive

00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:55,229
from this little hosting company in the

00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:56,400
middle of nowhere just failed and they

00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:59,909
didn't think they could recover the hard

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:03,760
drive the person who was in charge of

00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:06,530
the website at that time did this

00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:09,070
if you could see their sleeping under a

00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:11,660
desk in the back of the office and they

00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:18,440
just kind of hoped it would all go away

00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:20,900
and get better it did eventually it took

00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:24,430
a day and a half but we did come back

00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:27,740
online but if any of you were still just

00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:29,900
creating a zip of Magento of your code

00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,660
Valley code just putting on a server

00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:35,210
you're basically just sleeping under a

00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:40,760
table and closing your ears and hoping

00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:42,200
it'll all get better so weird to do

00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:49,100
something better so we'll come to the

00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:50,720
present 2010 ebay bought magento and

00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,060
while they bought forty-nine percent of

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,360
it and then later on that year they

00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:58,610
bought the rest of it and the founders

00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:02,240
left and everything kind of stalled for

00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:04,070
a little bit so there people at ebay

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,870
were like this this can't go along and

00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:09,920
they broke up ebay broke it up into Los

00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:13,580
a little bit and eventually they sold it

00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:16,010
so primero bought it and technically um

00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:19,640
the third of November next year last

00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:21,770
year 2015 and they rebranded from it was

00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:26,300
still called barian and they rebranded

00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:28,430
it to magenta ink and it's doing okay

00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:31,940
now they've they've launched magento to

00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:33,740
just about 23 weeks after that and it's

00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,250
now the number one ecommerce platform

00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,840
for the Alexa top 100 they've got about

00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:41,720
250,000 people using it around the world

00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:46,400
there's over 70,000 certified magento

00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:48,470
developers and they estimate that 50

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,200
billion dollars was done last year

00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:53,720
through the Magento platform so it's not

00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:57,490
it's not kind of the small little

00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,490
platform built people still think of it

00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:07,340
what do we look like now so we still

00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:10,259
sell furniture / we more like 4,000

00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:12,759
products now instead of one and

00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:18,190
we're running gentle Enterprise Edition

00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:19,840
and we do things a little bit better so

00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:24,940
we rebranded the site in about three

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:26,530
weeks early this year and we were able

00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:30,550
to do that because of some of the

00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:34,660
changes we've made over the past 23

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:36,220
years we have kind of lots of

00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:38,819
complicated products made to order

00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:43,500
products we do partnerships with

00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:45,759
designers launching products every day

00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,289
we've got lots of separate business

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,919
units that we need to report on we've

00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:55,560
got like a mattress business unit and we

00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:57,940
we don't ftp to our servers anymore so

00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,819
how does our development look like to

00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:02,289
get here and so if you take development

00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:04,690
you break it down you've basically got

00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:06,150
four things to it you've got code which

00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:09,159
is like your modules your themes

00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:13,360
everything you do it you have how you

00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:15,699
build that code and you make it ready to

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,729
go and when I was looking for this icon

00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:22,210
it really reminded me of something it

00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:25,259
reminded me of that does it deserve even

00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:29,320
know what that is it's a double-ended

00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:32,440
hammer and it comes from a blog post

00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:34,510
called PHP a fractal of bad design but

00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,570
what what it what that blog post

00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:39,430
essentially gets to is that yes PHP is

00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:42,159
maybe a little bit badly designed but

00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:46,329
most of the problems people have with it

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:48,579
is tooling and they use bad tools too

00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:51,339
bad too and so we're going to try and

00:08:48,579 --> 00:08:54,250
talk about some good tools as we as we

00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:56,620
go through it so we've code we've build

00:08:54,250 --> 00:09:00,490
we text that code and then we deploy it

00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:01,959
and deploying is is really getting it on

00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:04,089
the server it doesn't necessarily mean

00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,930
going live you can use feature switches

00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:08,950
and you can use a lot of different

00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:12,790
things for that so it's primarily

00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:16,589
getting it on the server and that's a

00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,589
really helpful calendar notification

00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:23,600
I'm so getting there it's not easy it

00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:26,000
looks a little bit like this so at the

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,250
beginning we ftp to the server so

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,670
complexity was pretty low didn't take

00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:33,830
very much time as we were moving through

00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:35,270
it when we got to about here everyone

00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:39,470
was like this is a huge pain I could

00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:42,770
deal with it but it's really annoying as

00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:45,050
it got even more complex everyone's like

00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:47,810
 this I just want to go back like

00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:49,490
this is this difficult it takes way too

00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:52,670
much time can't we just do it can we

00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:57,560
just put files on the server again but

00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:59,240
after that it becomes amazing so it'll

00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,670
take awhile to change your development

00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:05,510
methodologies to to make them better but

00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:09,020
it's definitely worth it so we start

00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:13,970
with the code and the first thing we

00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:16,750
changed was using composer so hopefully

00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:19,730
everybody knows what composer is if not

00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:22,040
Jordi is doing amazing keynote this

00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,300
afternoon you he'll be talking a little

00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,970
bit about it and there's a bunch of

00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:29,230
other talks I imagined covering it as

00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:31,700
well Jordie's guy who wrote composer and

00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:34,820
so the first library we took was

00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:38,510
composer installer and that enables you

00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:41,990
to install magenta modules in with

00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:46,820
composer and automatically integrate

00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:53,000
them into the installation the next one

00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:56,870
you need is composer autoloader and what

00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,940
that does is it hijacks your Magento oxa

00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:01,400
loaders your Magento roller load the

00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:03,440
whole magento application you can hijack

00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:06,170
that i put the composer autoloader into

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,260
it so then all your composure libraries

00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:11,000
get loaded in as well and then once

00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,260
you've got all your modules loading in

00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,590
through composer you're probably going

00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:18,500
to want to load magento core as well so

00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:22,220
there's a core installer for Magento and

00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:24,650
it's billed by guy called alien jh and I

00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:26,930
think I see some JH people in the back

00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:29,480
of the room

00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:31,740
what this does is just kind of really

00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,890
streamlines your way it lets you work

00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:37,020
with a bunch of other libraries that you

00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:39,090
can load in from packages and from from

00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:41,720
github and use them as part of your

00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:47,850
Magento install and have a really slick

00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:50,250
deployment or process on the theme we

00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:53,190
use a bunch of other stuff as well so we

00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:58,380
use grunt to build on our front-end

00:11:53,190 --> 00:12:00,900
assets just choose if you have a news

00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:03,030
grunt before just install grunt yeah we

00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:06,350
keep our theme completely separate so it

00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:10,350
runs in its own repub and we use react

00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:11,490
to build components on our theme so

00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,900
react components are really

00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:16,500
self-contained it lets you create a

00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:18,210
little reusable components and that you

00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:21,150
can reuse you can combine the components

00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:24,450
and you can less them all sorts of stuff

00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:26,760
like that and then we also use something

00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:30,180
called Babel which lets you write in es6

00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:33,030
mix akin the script 6 which is the

00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:38,430
latest version of java script and use

00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:41,610
that together it reacts jsx to being

00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:43,770
able to mix in es6 and HTML in the same

00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:46,500
files so it's a special file format for

00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:49,860
react you can still use regular

00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,780
JavaScript and but you can kind of try

00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:55,260
out this syntax and it lets you write a

00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:58,920
lot quicker and on what you wanted to

00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:00,510
and if you're going to use reactors a

00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,430
Chrome extension for it that is really

00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:03,930
useful and it makes debugging up much

00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:05,250
easier because reactors a lot of magic

00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:07,590
behind the scenes and you can really see

00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:10,110
what's going on the Dom their Chrome

00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:11,370
extension lets you browse the tree see

00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:14,730
exactly what the DOM is being

00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:22,320
manipulated so you should try that as

00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:25,830
well and weezer Roku so when we build

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:28,890
all our asset side so all our CSS all

00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:34,020
our JavaScript we stub the magento theme

00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:36,420
in PHP files and then we mark the the

00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:39,620
JavaScript endpoints in JSON

00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:42,060
and we we create that as its own package

00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:43,589
as with you know so it becomes a

00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:47,120
composer dependency of our overall

00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:49,829
magento installed by itself it's also

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,230
deployable so we deploy that thing to a

00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:57,300
Roku and it lets us get feedback real

00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:59,310
quickly from all of our stakeholders

00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:01,980
whether the internal stakeholders that

00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:03,930
called external if we're doing stuff

00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,000
with third parties if we're doing

00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:09,600
partnerships we can deploy it on there

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,779
or when you're doing a rebrand in three

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,980
weeks you can build it all there and go

00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:18,510
through some really fast iteration

00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:22,459
styles so this is kind of our mocked-up

00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:26,220
version looks like it lets us and also

00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:27,389
mark up everything in all states kind

00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,040
when you're doing any kind of web

00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:32,899
application it becomes very easy to

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,899
forget about your edge cases and your

00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:41,579
you know on error states or what happens

00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:43,920
when when do people put words into phone

00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:47,970
number boxes and stuff like that so lets

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,380
you stub all those unusual states and

00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:52,940
then just make sure that you've got them

00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:59,610
covered I'm stuff to be really helpful

00:14:52,940 --> 00:15:01,410
we and come on to the build and so we've

00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:04,500
used a really amazing bill tool called

00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:06,630
circle CI it's basically a continuous

00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:10,560
integration and deployment tool it's

00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:14,579
it's quite similar to Jenkins or Hudson

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:19,500
or any of those kind of tools but it's

00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:22,140
completely SAS provider it's used by

00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:24,690
shopify which is probably one of the

00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:27,269
biggest e-commerce platforms out there

00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:30,990
as well and so it connects you get up

00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:34,110
and it completely automates your bills

00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:37,889
for you you define what your build is in

00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:39,959
a yamel file and in that you're

00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:42,250
basically putting in simple bash canals

00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:45,440
I mean you could you can use

00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:46,940
share for you can use other recipes or

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,230
you can just write simple bash commands

00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:59,480
in there and it will excuse me build for

00:15:51,230 --> 00:16:02,000
you I'm run new tests which will come to

00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:05,000
you in a second and there's a really

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,460
great integration guide on there and so

00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,580
what that does it builds a zip and it

00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:11,600
will put it where you need to and

00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:14,360
probably the zipping process you can

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,710
also collapse all your symlink so if

00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,120
you've been putting your theme files and

00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:19,310
separate directories and stuff if you've

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,900
got your vendor directory with a bunch

00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:24,230
of modules in it you zip process can

00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:26,240
collapse all of that and put all your

00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:29,900
files where they need to be for Magento

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:33,050
to find them also integrates really

00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:34,250
nicely with SWAT and lets us know when

00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:36,830
our builds are failing when they're

00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:38,570
passing let's know we've got too many

00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:42,400
running people cancel them all the time

00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:44,480
as free as well which is really good for

00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:49,730
if you're just running one job at a time

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:53,360
just why we get a lot of councils so

00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:55,430
testing testing is important you should

00:16:53,360 --> 00:17:00,440
test your stuff we use conception to run

00:16:55,430 --> 00:17:02,180
all our tests circle runs the conception

00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,459
tests also because we're using

00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:06,829
enterprise magenta we've got some unit

00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:10,760
tests supplied by magenta or not very

00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:13,790
many but we do all our acceptance in

00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,560
unit tests through Code section they're

00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:18,560
accepting tests we can mock them with

00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:21,079
phantom jas and we run actually our

00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,730
acceptance tests on the the mocked

00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:27,230
version that Heroku version of the app

00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:31,750
rather than the full magento one we also

00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:34,400
download the guides and bullet points

00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:36,260
fresh copy the database each time that

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,610
is kind of specially set up with all the

00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:39,800
different edge cases as well that we

00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:42,110
need to test for and you get fresh

00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:45,650
environment each time on circle so it

00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:51,830
brings up a new instance run installs

00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:53,830
your code runs your unit tests and then

00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:56,539
packaged it up for you

00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:59,059
why have i got that there oh he comes

00:17:56,539 --> 00:18:02,210
out is a collection of unit tests

00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:03,799
specifically for e-commerce and that is

00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:07,700
really helpful as well so if you're

00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:13,869
running ecommerce or a magenta and stomp

00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:16,070
take a look at them and let me deploy it

00:18:13,869 --> 00:18:19,159
so we've got a new hugging company the

00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:21,679
last one with the gif we didn't think

00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:23,269
was was up to anymore so he's a company

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,210
called the last era they're based here

00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:29,779
in London and the specialized magento

00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:34,190
hosting company they do a bunch of stuff

00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:37,369
out of the box for you so they want to

00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:43,309
they run on AWS and they do all your

00:18:37,369 --> 00:18:45,499
auto scaling for you so they sell your

00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:48,769
cloud front set up pushing your static

00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:54,859
assets to f3 they do load balancing

00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:57,499
they'll do multi region or multi AZ the

00:18:54,859 --> 00:19:01,849
manager database for you it's all quite

00:18:57,499 --> 00:19:04,340
nice it's a lot of things that it takes

00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:06,619
a lot of time to do I've done it a lot

00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:09,889
before and having someone who can just

00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:12,440
come in and do it for you for little

00:19:09,889 --> 00:19:14,769
more than the cost of AWS natively is

00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:17,389
really good they also provide 24 7

00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:20,389
monitoring support alerting they have

00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:22,190
people on call and it's probably the

00:19:20,389 --> 00:19:26,659
number one thing that allows me to sleep

00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:35,059
at like now knowing that someone else's

00:19:26,659 --> 00:19:38,899
has to wake up yeah so last era also

00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:44,149
integrate with slack and who Bob to do

00:19:38,899 --> 00:19:47,119
our deploys and they also had varnish

00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:49,220
and some gentle one does natively

00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:53,419
support varnish but you can use

00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:56,539
turpentine to to integrate and furnish

00:19:53,419 --> 00:19:59,299
and a chair proxy there and they also

00:19:56,539 --> 00:20:01,129
enable full page caching for community

00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:03,230
edition of enterprise full page caching

00:20:01,129 --> 00:20:04,630
is an enterprise only feature but they

00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:09,120
have a module

00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:12,940
that can able that for you as well and

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:16,030
yeah was that black again this is so

00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:18,190
this is our deploys going out and a last

00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:20,140
area giving us notification so two

00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:22,240
different channels one of them was the

00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:25,030
Magento dev where we see our tests

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:28,210
passing and building and then this is

00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:29,860
our deployment channel where we can see

00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:33,460
the deployments actually successfully

00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:38,190
happened and for our production deploys

00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:41,380
we've put one manual step in so for our

00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:44,410
staging environments every passing build

00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:46,960
immediately gets pushed to a staging

00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:48,220
environment and which is really really

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,530
helpful because you can you can

00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:53,590
literally deploy Kirk just by creating a

00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:55,480
pull request for production we have we

00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:58,390
have one little step in where we ask you

00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,670
about to deploy to live because it's

00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:02,950
really nice idea to have all passing

00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:06,340
green bill Vaughn master go directly to

00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:08,320
live but sometimes maybe you're not

00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:10,840
ready for that code to go to production

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,910
maybe there's an event or there's a

00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,890
reason it's a time when it needs to go

00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:16,510
live so we have to have Cuba who are

00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:17,950
just deploy to production see just to go

00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:20,410
who but can you deploy master into

00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:23,740
production and it says yes and then you

00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:26,590
get your deployment message or if you

00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:33,760
ask it to do something else it will say

00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:35,860
no I'm sorry I can't do that Dave and

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,780
that's kind of how our present looks

00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:40,200
that's how our deployment process works

00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:45,270
that's how I build process works and

00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:47,860
we're here now so we're pretty happy so

00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:51,940
going to look a little bit into the

00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:53,860
future magento to when the guys that had

00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,600
to build magenta to they wanted to do

00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:58,270
all these things so they wanted a modern

00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,940
tech stack they wanted improve

00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:03,640
performance they wanted better

00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:06,810
communications our customizations they

00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:09,550
wanted high quality code they wanted

00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:11,000
much easier instance tall and upgrade

00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:14,510
parts and

00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,090
they wanted a much easier way to get

00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:21,350
external integrations but we can't have

00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:26,290
all of that already but they've gone and

00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:28,670
done it so now composer is native to

00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:31,730
magento so you can install me gentle

00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:34,670
through composer all the modules are

00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:38,720
composer modules so they encourage one

00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:41,750
repo per module and you can also pull in

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,490
any other dependencies that you need

00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:48,170
through composer as well so simply

00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:54,080
components then components things like

00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:56,000
that um they also have native varnish

00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:00,950
support now I'm so you don't need to use

00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:03,590
turpentine anymore they also have

00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:06,710
apparently some unit tests now which is

00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:07,820
good so this car like checks off a lot

00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:10,130
of the stuff that we spent the past

00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:12,530
couple years doing so so if you're doing

00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:13,960
a fresh project use magento to you're

00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:17,300
going to get a much better experience

00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:19,250
but they've done more than that so

00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:21,770
there's a new architecture it's split

00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:25,820
magento into basically for apps rather

00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:28,450
than one so they have one after catalog

00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:30,770
management one for product management

00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:32,420
which may seem like the same thing

00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:34,310
catalog is kind of how the categories

00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:36,920
are organized and display the product of

00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:40,570
the products themselves they've got an

00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:42,710
order management one and a checkup and

00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:44,660
if you're coming from a gentle one this

00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:47,300
is really quite breaking and it's going

00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:49,040
to break most of your modules and is

00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:52,730
going to break quite a lot of what you

00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:55,580
already done and but you don't need to

00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:57,320
use this layout from the get-go so you

00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:59,510
could just choose to replace part of

00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,010
your Magento with one of them you could

00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:03,170
just choose to use the order management

00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:06,740
which use the product management parts

00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:08,600
of it or you can actually sense which to

00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:10,220
not use this architecture at all and

00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:14,600
continue using a magenta one like

00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:16,550
architecture but if you are going to

00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,350
migrate from magenta 10 yet to you're

00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:20,540
probably better off going for it from

00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:23,200
the get-go it's going to let you scale

00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:24,340
your Magento a lot easier

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,799
because you can scale each of these

00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:30,669
components separately so if you're

00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:32,110
running a really high volume site you

00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:34,870
can give your check out a lot more

00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:36,519
resources and you can cash the hell out

00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:40,419
of your catalog on your product

00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:41,860
management areas and you can do that way

00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:44,289
easier than you ever could in magento

00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:45,909
one so it's still worth we're looking at

00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:48,250
it if you're doing a migration process

00:24:45,909 --> 00:24:53,139
and you should probably treat it more

00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:54,820
like a fresh build so rather than

00:24:53,139 --> 00:24:58,120
treating it and we're modernizing a

00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:59,950
legacy out if you think I'm building an

00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:02,130
app that looks very similar to the one I

00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:05,649
have when I'm building it from scratch

00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:07,600
and then you're going to find as we did

00:25:05,649 --> 00:25:09,220
that most of the work you've already

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,100
done in the past you don't need socks

00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:13,510
reported they've improved it in such

00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:17,169
ways that you can leave a lot of that

00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:24,399
behind you and use what's native in

00:25:17,169 --> 00:25:27,610
magento now they've also got Magento you

00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:29,980
I so it's a new kind of framework for

00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:32,679
building the UI of Magento it's built on

00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:34,840
less instead of sauce which is a little

00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:36,010
bit annoying that they've decided to

00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:39,399
change when there's not a huge

00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:41,429
difference but it's built unless it's

00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:43,539
focused on web standards it is

00:25:41,429 --> 00:25:46,750
customizable and really easy to maintain

00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:50,019
this quite nice actually and it's fully

00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:51,970
responsive which is good because magenta

00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:55,740
one was not responsive as a lot of

00:25:51,970 --> 00:26:00,549
people spend a lot of time making it so

00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:03,130
hmmm and the thing that people don't

00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:05,799
really think about is and it's

00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:07,929
accessible so I think it's double a

00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:12,309
compliant accessibility if you're

00:26:07,929 --> 00:26:15,159
familiar with the WAG compliance and so

00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:17,350
it puts in all the right markup for

00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:19,990
screen readers and for various different

00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:22,360
things as well and what's really

00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:24,010
exciting about Magento you are if you've

00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:27,539
ever worked with Magento front end is it

00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:27,539
it doesn't use prototype

00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:40,000
whoo yeah so things will start breaking

00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:41,950
it comes with a blank theme this is not

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,529
very good screenshot of it which is

00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:47,350
really useful resource if you've ever

00:26:44,529 --> 00:26:48,789
had to build a magento theme before so

00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:51,100
it kind of gives you all the right ways

00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:53,710
to let everything out gives you a lot of

00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:56,799
base code there to start from and is

00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:58,659
fairly blank so it's quite easy

00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:01,809
jumping-off point if you've never done

00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:05,860
one before they've also hugely improved

00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:08,200
the admin and they've reorganized the

00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:10,690
menus around functions things are a lot

00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:16,120
easier to find there's only five tabs

00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:17,710
now it's a 56 the much more clearly

00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:20,139
organized around function the reporting

00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:21,820
is much better so you can add columns

00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:23,769
remove columns you can drag and drop you

00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:26,230
can sort you can do all these things you

00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:29,470
can take for granted in a modern web up

00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:32,470
and that wife there a magenta one and

00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:35,110
for the first time it that admin is also

00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:37,120
responsive so you can edit products you

00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:39,159
can publish things you can manage orders

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,200
on your phone which is really amazing if

00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:44,460
you've been using magenta one for a long

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:51,450
time you'll know the pain of that a

00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:55,029
couple of resources so dev docs is a

00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:56,889
community project actually and it's a

00:27:55,029 --> 00:27:59,830
bunch of documentation from agenda two

00:27:56,889 --> 00:28:01,240
written by technical writers so it's not

00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:03,990
necessarily written by the developers

00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:06,250
its technical writers reviewing the

00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:08,500
functionalities reviewing how the

00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:10,929
modules work and it's really excellent

00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,669
actually compared to the almost zero

00:28:10,929 --> 00:28:16,779
documentation that was from a gentle one

00:28:12,669 --> 00:28:20,320
it's quite complete there's an agency

00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:22,419
here in Dublin Dublin London called

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,730
session digital and they have a bunch of

00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:26,830
great tutorials for getting started if

00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:28,899
you magento to if you're completely new

00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:31,269
to it and you should definitely check

00:28:28,899 --> 00:28:33,159
them out and there is the ultimate guide

00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:35,740
to magenta to developer resources and

00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:38,720
list the books & tutorials

00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:41,920
this is amazing blog post and I got lots

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:44,510
of help from it um while doing this talk

00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:48,500
it's got all sorts of links and

00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:54,890
resources in different things on so what

00:28:48,500 --> 00:29:00,470
does our magento future look like look

00:28:54,890 --> 00:29:02,570
like you we're hiring so hiring for

00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:05,930
front-end magenta developers engineers

00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:07,670
and PHP and Python engineers we do a

00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:10,640
bunch of stuff outside of magenta we

00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:13,010
manage your pee we do demand prediction

00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,150
we do marketing analysis cohort analysis

00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:16,550
and a bunch of other stuff and we're

00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:18,820
hiring for a bunch of stuff so if you're

00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:22,520
interested in an environment like this

00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:25,090
come and come and see me I questions

00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:30,560
it's a bit quick it's only half an hour

00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:32,120
but I questions questions magento users

00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:37,820
in the audience questions for two

00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:39,620
sections for that I have you because

00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:41,990
when you talked about at the beginning

00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:44,210
about the fact that the hard drive

00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:47,360
filled up at the old host in the old

00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:49,640
scenario was there anything done

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:52,160
specifically to stop magento filling

00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:55,370
your hard drive for example in our

00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:58,190
installs we have to run cron to clear

00:29:55,370 --> 00:30:01,040
the logs and because magento logs so

00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:03,170
much rubbish that it does feel your hard

00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,730
drive is it something there's the

00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:05,930
solution that you now just have scalable

00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:08,000
hard drives and it's not a problem or

00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:10,040
has something been done to round logs

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,510
yeah so we've done a bunch of stuff that

00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:14,420
hard drive actually failed it didn't

00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:17,000
fill up which much worse they filled up

00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:19,880
we can just delete things failed we

00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,440
didn't know if we get back but we do do

00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:26,120
a bunch of stuff to maintain our logs

00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:30,410
and to use madron and 98 is a command

00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:31,790
line tool for Magento and does lots of

00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:33,840
things like rotating your logs for you

00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:36,299
and stuff like that and

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:40,620
and our hosting provider last era

00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:43,110
actually push it all into logstash

00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:45,059
huggly so we can we can we can to get

00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:49,260
all remotely and search it do a lot of

00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:59,940
really cool stuff like that so question

00:30:49,260 --> 00:31:01,710
the back legs yep charging hey since you

00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:03,840
mentioned the magenta tues effectively

00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:10,429
rewrite how are you selling that to the

00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:12,690
business ah good good question so

00:31:10,429 --> 00:31:16,620
there's a number of different ways to

00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:23,370
sell a rewrite in so we've got reduced

00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:24,809
complexity we have got a lot of features

00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:28,980
that are going to be improved that we

00:31:24,809 --> 00:31:31,200
can sell in we have lower cost of

00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:35,429
maintaining it going forward and lower

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:37,140
cost of of developing for it a couple

00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:40,710
like the ability to actually attract

00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:42,870
more talent in the business it's not

00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:45,960
kind of one thing where you go it's a

00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:50,760
magenta to we just have to do it it's

00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:51,779
like a lot of little reasons that for

00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,490
all the different benefits you'll get

00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:58,140
it's very similar to kind of selling in

00:31:53,490 --> 00:32:00,090
any rewrite and then the developers are

00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:02,970
always really keen to do it so that

00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:07,590
that's never never difficult points

00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:09,240
anyway she like make him and I had a

00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:11,490
question on that lies you seem to

00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:14,130
suggest kieran at one point some kind of

00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:16,409
hybrid magento to magento one and I did

00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:18,179
have a client last year asked questions

00:32:16,409 --> 00:32:21,210
on that line of early I think in the

00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:24,120
duties that it could be one all or none

00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:26,429
of the new magento core module you

00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,990
implemented and yet it's still a Magento

00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:30,210
to in some way do you mind expanding on

00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:33,299
that little um so if you were to

00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:34,950
actually do that what what you do is is

00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:36,929
probably run them separately and you'd

00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:39,740
run varnish Andrew different parts

00:32:36,929 --> 00:32:42,230
through two different things

00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:44,660
but the magento to has a migration to

00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:47,240
help you migrate your stuff into magento

00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:50,090
too and then you can also manage your

00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:52,130
sessions in basically one reticence to

00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:54,140
also sessions are shared across between

00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:56,300
the two platforms so you could take many

00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:58,550
months over the migration process with

00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:00,650
the two pretty much side by side if you

00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:07,480
wanted to you could interest not sure I

00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:13,030
would recommend it but you could no more

00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:13,030
