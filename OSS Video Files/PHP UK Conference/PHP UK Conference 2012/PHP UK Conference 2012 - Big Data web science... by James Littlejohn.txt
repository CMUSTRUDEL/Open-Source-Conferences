Big Data web - Big Data science - Big Data mining

The role of data science is becoming more prominent as the big data web emerges. This talk introduces the role of the data scientist and how data mining techniques are being applied, some using PHP. We are not talking application data but about creating new "... value from the data itself, ... it's a data product." to quote the, O'Reilly Radar Report: What is Data Science?

Data touches everything. Understanding it all is the biggest problem out there to solve. Data crosses all industries, all parts of a business and all that makes up life. The future web is about finding answers, discoveries, stitching together sources, busting data silos to release the next level of collective wisdom for society.

This talk will set the scene of the big data web, share Data Scientist case studies and take a hands on look at text data mining code.

 
I'm James Littlejohn, the lead developer on the LifestyleLinking.net open source project. This involves combining ideas, curiosity and plain hard slog in aggregating data so that it may reveal its collective intelligence. I've also learnt to write PHP code over the last 4 years while experimenting with data mining techniques.

Before that, my entrepreneurial activities have including starting a web software company in Edinburgh during the .com era and a local food e-commerce and home delivery service in Aberdeen, Scotland. I spent a few years in Mountain View, CA during the early web2.0 years where I began my conversion to become a software data engineer.
