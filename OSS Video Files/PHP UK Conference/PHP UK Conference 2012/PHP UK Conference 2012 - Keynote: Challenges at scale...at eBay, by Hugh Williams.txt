	00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:19,480
well good morning it's really

00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,890
to to be to be speaking to you I'm going

00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,230
to a few things this morning I thought

00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:26,230
it might be in the right place to start

00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:29,980
might be to just tell you who I am and

00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:31,630
why I'm here my involvement with PHP

00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,360
dates back to nineteen ninety seven

00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,710
actually so at that point in time I was

00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,090
working as a professor in a university

00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:41,290
in australia that's where the accents

00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:43,269
from right within california and i was

00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,760
teaching a graduate program all about

00:00:43,269 --> 00:00:47,559
the web and I thought we need a teaching

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,360
language and this new thing PHP had

00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:51,159
appeared I thought this was kind of

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,049
interesting and so I kind of adopted it

00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:56,199
as as a teaching language you know in a

00:00:53,049 --> 00:01:00,640
graduate course that caused me rather

00:00:56,199 --> 00:01:04,059
foolishly to write a book I would not

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,490
recommend writing a book it's about 1%

00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:09,430
inspiration about 99% perspiration it's

00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:10,600
very very lonely I was very surprised

00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:13,420
though when I wrote this book that it

00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,939
sold so lots of people bought it that

00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:17,200
was kind of surprising I was also very

00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:18,369
pleased with the book because he had a

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,660
platypus on the cover and being

00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:21,430
australian i was i was quite thrilled

00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:23,560
with that aunty the back story behind

00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:26,110
that I lobbied I lobbied O'Reilly very

00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,760
very hard that I wanted a platypus on

00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,320
the cover I tried to make arguments

00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,610
about sort of a lamp stack and said well

00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,470
it's kind of like a platypus it's a

00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:34,810
duck's bill glued onto a Beaver's body

00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:36,360
with this strange tale come on you know

00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:38,650
let me put the platypus on there and

00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,730
O'Reilly only has one principle really

00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,350
when they work with authors which is

00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:44,680
don't put pressure on us to choose the

00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:46,630
cover so I was a tense negotiation I

00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,580
kind of won the negotiation the platypus

00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:50,920
ended up on the cover the book sold a

00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,120
few copies I then made another crucial

00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,180
mistake which was helped out with

00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,560
another book this particular book I just

00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:00,159
contributed a couple of chapters again

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:03,670
on PHP I then got really really

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,630
overexcited and wrote another book at

00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,850
this point in time I was really

00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,440
regretting it had two young children i

00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,569
was writing it in my parents Winnebago

00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,220
sending out in the yard trying to avoid

00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:14,260
the children write the book it's not a

00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:17,200
lot of fun didn't sell particularly well

00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:20,519
maybe it was the kids and the time not

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,650
really sure and then I came back in

00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:25,600
improved the first book I wrote and

00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:27,710
you'll notice here that this this second

00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,580
edition of my first

00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:33,110
has a very angry platypus on the cover i

00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,670
think this is o'reilly way of telling me

00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:38,570
don't put pressure on us about the

00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:41,030
covers so that's me that's my history in

00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:42,410
PHP much of the rest of time today that

00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:45,140
I'm going to spend telling you about

00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:46,670
ebay and what we do at ebay you know

00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,740
touching them in the middle on something

00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:51,620
that may be of specific interest to you

00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:54,740
as PHP developers but but by and large

00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:58,310
it's it's a broad tour of ebay um so I

00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:01,460
wanted to start really just by telling

00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:06,470
you a little bit about the history of

00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:08,450
the company so like many startups ebay

00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:11,510
got kind of started by by a couple of

00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:13,970
guys pierre media is our founder he

00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:17,240
built this page in 1995 this is the very

00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:19,280
original homepage of ebay i was at that

00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:22,460
point in time called auction web is a

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,930
very very small circle piece of text

00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,090
there in the middle it's hard to read up

00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:28,300
the back perhaps but it says there are

00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,930
always several hundred auctions underway

00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,640
see you're bound to find something

00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:35,060
interesting so very very humble

00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,710
beginnings for what's now a a very very

00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:41,960
large company but one that still

00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:44,900
connects buyers with sellers these days

00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:48,200
as I said it's a very large enterprise

00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:53,840
we sell a car around every one point six

00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:56,210
minutes we sell a GPS device every

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,070
minute and my favorite statistic because

00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:59,720
I sold some shoes on ebay last week as

00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:02,840
we sell a pair of shoes every seven

00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:05,240
seconds somebody brought my old my old

00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,140
boots so I was thrilled too thrilled to

00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:11,930
package them up and send them to

00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:15,020
somebody we we sell a lot of stuff in

00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:17,660
2010 we sold 60 2 billion dollars of

00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:20,270
merchandise through ebay com and that's

00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:22,700
that's all the all the family of sites

00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:24,740
across the world including the the UK

00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:28,400
site the German site Australian site and

00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:29,900
so on last year that rose the sixty

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,850
eight point six billion dollars in

00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:35,660
merchandise so it's a very very large

00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:37,250
website indeed let me tell you about the

00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,810
data that that generates this is really

00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,520
instead of getting into the into the

00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,070
core of what I what I wanted to talk to

00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,600
you about

00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,130
today so first let me take a little bit

00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,060
about the data and what we what we do

00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,320
with that data and then I'm going to

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,180
move on and tell you a little bit about

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,980
some of our some of our key platforms

00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,710
and then at the end forgot a little bit

00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:55,590
of time I'll speculate about the future

00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,550
of Commerce online and then we'll

00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,620
hopefully have a little bit of time for

00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:00,990
some for some questions before I race

00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:05,640
out the door and jump on aircraft back

00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:07,380
to California so here's some amazing

00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,720
statistics this is this is the kind of

00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:13,170
thing that keeps a vice president of

00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:16,470
engineering on his toes and with the

00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:19,070
phone by the bed at night we have 100

00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:22,920
more than a hundred million active users

00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:25,550
using the eBay marketplace our search

00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,690
engine gets around 250 million queries

00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:29,580
per day it depends on the day of the

00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:32,070
week it pent ends on the seasonality of

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:35,160
the year but but it's always a very very

00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:37,800
large number and at any at any point in

00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,640
time we have over 300 million listings

00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:44,730
active listings on the site of sellers

00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:47,460
making offers to buyers we also have an

00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:48,900
enormous archive of data so we keep we

00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,940
keep listings that have sold and we make

00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,890
those available to search so typically

00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,200
we're serving through our search engine

00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:57,900
over a billion listings at any at any

00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,570
point in time so there's some statistics

00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,160
these ones amaze me even more we are

00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,690
sitting on top of nine petabytes of data

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,570
it's a little over nine petabytes of

00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:08,820
data now in two large sort of data

00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:11,910
management installations we have a

00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:13,680
teradata installation commercial system

00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,840
sort of data warehousing system that we

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,910
use primarily for financial applications

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,010
and then we have a very large Hadoop

00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:22,380
installation that all of our engineers

00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:24,150
used to understand the customer's

00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,070
understand behaviors of those customers

00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,210
and used to to build features on the

00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:29,520
site and I'm going to tell you in a

00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:31,620
moment a little bit about some of the

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,420
things we use Hadoop for you know in our

00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,580
engineering team but it but an enormous

00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:37,980
amount of data I mentioned this

00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,810
statistic yesterday on the panel every

00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,880
every day we serve around two billion

00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:45,870
page requests for out for our view item

00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:49,169
pages so very very high performance web

00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:52,230
serving system and all that put together

00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:55,050
makes around 75 billion database calls

00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:57,270
per day I hinted yesterday on the pan

00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,379
if you were here that you know there's

00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:00,419
there's interesting trade-offs between

00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:02,039
having a highly normalized database and

00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:03,870
doing lots of joins and having a very

00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:06,150
flat database where the joins our pre

00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:07,740
computed we're certainly it be at the

00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,389
joins our pre computed very flat

00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,120
database end and so we make an enormous

00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:16,259
amount of data based calls to to satisfy

00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:19,860
our customers so very very big big

00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:21,449
operation indeed so let me now so turn

00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,090
to the the kind of the meet at the talk

00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:27,300
and talk a little bit about how do we

00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:31,949
use this data to build better products

00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:37,770
at eBay I'll tell you three stories so

00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:39,240
story number one let me tell you a

00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:42,000
little bit about what we call query

00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,560
rewrites so if i look back in the

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,069
history of ebay and i look at the search

00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:49,289
engine that we have it was a very very

00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:51,930
literal search engine so and what i mean

00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:53,819
by that is that our search engine took

00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,889
the keywords that you provided as a

00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:58,469
customer of search terms and very

00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:02,000
literally match those exactly to the

00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:05,669
titles of the items that were on ebay

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,279
that you know that sort of precision is

00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:11,219
is is is good in some sense but it's

00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:14,669
also problematic in other senses so for

00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:17,159
example if a seller makes a small

00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:19,650
mistake in their title they are they

00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:21,300
misspell a word for example in a perhaps

00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:23,219
they're listing their old palm pilot

00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,719
they pull it out of the drawer take a

00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:27,599
photo of it and accidentally list it as

00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:29,099
a plan pilot then you know those buyers

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,599
who are searching for Palm Pilots and

00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:32,610
not going to match against that item

00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:33,860
that's a plan pilot and that cell is

00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:36,089
probably going to be disappointed

00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,740
they're not going to they're not their

00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:39,360
items not going to be shown to the users

00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,649
who are who are demanding that product

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,060
and they're probably not going to

00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:44,579
achieve the price that they were hoping

00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:46,170
to achieve there's also all sorts of

00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:48,720
other more obvious problems so problems

00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:50,730
with plurals for example you know if you

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,380
if you add or a mitt and s in English

00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,640
you know it could make it can make a

00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,930
huge difference as to how many results

00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,709
are returned and whether all the

00:08:54,930 --> 00:09:00,810
relevant results are returned so now on

00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:05,100
a journey to make our search engine much

00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:07,350
more intuitive and what we're really

00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,460
trying to do is to is to do a good job

00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:10,620
of understanding

00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,630
tenth of the user's query and not be so

00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:16,590
literal about matching the user's query

00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:19,730
to the title of the items so here's the

00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:22,110
idea we have an extreme amount of data

00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:24,390
you know when you're getting 250 million

00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:26,490
queries per day when you're serving up

00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:28,290
two billion pages per day and you're

00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:32,370
logging all that information you have an

00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:36,150
extreme amount of data the idea is to

00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:37,860
take that data mine that data look for

00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:41,730
patterns you know create understanding

00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:44,550
from that data and then and then use

00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:47,700
that to better map users literal queries

00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:49,890
to the real intent that the users have

00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,420
also drawn that pictorial I'll give you

00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:53,400
I'll give you an example in a moment but

00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:56,400
but the idea is this this user here

00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:58,680
poses a query we take that query we kind

00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,710
of pre process to that query we rewrite

00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,480
the query we perhaps add words to the

00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:05,610
query perhaps and remove words from the

00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,470
query and then we run that query behind

00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:09,840
the scenes on our search engine and show

00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:12,210
the user what are hopefully more

00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,130
relevant results than those that were

00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:17,070
literally expressed by the users

00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:18,360
original query and we do it in a couple

00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,770
of different ways i'll give you examples

00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,410
in a moment you know one way is sort of

00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:24,630
taking words and and creating synonyms

00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:27,660
for those words now you send an imminent

00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:30,510
in a very loose sense the other way is

00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:32,190
is using the structure of ebay in a more

00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:34,860
intuitive way and i'll give you an

00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:37,800
example of that again in a moment so

00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:41,850
here's the here's the first example you

00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:44,010
might wonder what is this thing I can

00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:49,050
tell you this is a and I and my German

00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:51,290
is terrible this is a pues lamp which in

00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:53,940
English apparently means mushroom lamp

00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:55,920
they're quite popular on eBay and maybe

00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,390
maybe surprising to you now particular

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,120
on the German site so if you're at ebay

00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:02,910
de and you search for pills lamp you

00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:10,320
will find lots of these lots of these

00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:13,890
mushroom lamps so what happens if a if a

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,210
user types pills lamp as a single term

00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:18,240
while they'll get a they'll get a set of

00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:20,010
results that literally match that but

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,410
behind the scenes from from

00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:24,990
understanding our extreme data

00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:26,639
we can we can deduce a number of facts

00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:29,430
that can help the user retrieve more

00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:31,220
relevant results so for example we can

00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:34,769
learn that pills lamp as a sort of

00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:38,029
conflated term is actually equivalent to

00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:40,529
pills and lamp with a space between them

00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:43,050
how might we how might we learn that

00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:45,449
from our extreme data it's pretty simple

00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:48,240
really lots of users are out there

00:11:45,449 --> 00:11:49,860
typing the conflated term getting a set

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,379
of results and interacting with those

00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,810
results and then very soon after typing

00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:56,009
pills space lamp getting a set of

00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:58,019
results and interacting with those

00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:59,459
results when you're logging all of that

00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:02,250
and when you're seeing that pattern at a

00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:03,720
very large scale you can deduce that the

00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:06,839
conflated term and the term with the

00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,970
space are probably equivalent doesn't

00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:11,670
always work while that while that sounds

00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:13,949
like a pretty intuitive sensible kind of

00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:15,149
naive idea it doesn't always work I'll

00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:19,110
give you I'll give you an American

00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:21,089
centric example so users come along

00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:23,670
looking for memorabilia related to

00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:26,939
colleges or universities in the United

00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:31,319
States a very famous college in the in

00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:32,970
the states is CMU which to most

00:12:31,319 --> 00:12:34,380
Americans you know 99 percent of

00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:37,980
Americans means Carnegie Mellon

00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:40,199
University but let's imagine I went to

00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,699
Central Michigan University a much much

00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:43,769
smaller University a much less

00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:44,880
lesser-known University what I'm

00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:47,250
probably going to do is I'm going to

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,019
come to ebay I'm going to type CMU I'm

00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,519
going to say oh this isn't at all what I

00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:53,490
wanted I'm being flooded with Carnegie

00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:55,529
Mellon results let me try typing another

00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:57,660
query central space Michigan space

00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:59,970
University oh I'm much happier now and

00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:01,860
I'm interacting with the results lots of

00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:04,649
users do that you might form the wrong

00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:07,050
conclusion that CMU and Carnegie mount

00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:10,259
and Central Michigan University excuse

00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:12,569
me are the same which then not to 99

00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:14,160
percent of the users so there's lots of

00:13:12,569 --> 00:13:16,309
little subtle edge cases that make this

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,230
make this a very very complex problem

00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:21,389
but nonetheless there that the idea is

00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:23,579
the idea is simple and right you can

00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:25,170
also learn that that pills and pilzer

00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:28,050
are the same you can also learn that

00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:30,269
that lumper and lampen are the same and

00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:32,910
if you know all of that when a user

00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:34,769
comes along and types pills lamp you can

00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,510
run a much more complex query behind the

00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:37,280
scenes

00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:38,810
and hopefully deliver more relevant

00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,310
results it's a little hard to see

00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:43,040
probably up the back here but you can

00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:44,630
see a a very long query that that our

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,970
search engine would actually run and

00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:50,060
it's a it's an all query between the

00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:51,680
original user's query the pills lamp and

00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:55,850
a long expression that's a phrasal

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:59,210
expression which says pills or pilzer or

00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:00,560
lamp or lampen so that deals with with

00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:03,410
the space between them and all the

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:07,280
alternative expressions of the same

00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:08,720
meaning so it's a pretty intuitive idea

00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,670
we do this at a very large scale and we

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,830
do this based on the extreme data that

00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:16,130
we have in our Hadoop cluster let me

00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:18,430
give you one more example if you if you

00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:22,130
came to ebay historically and you typed

00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:24,110
Bermuda stamps you'd probably be

00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:26,960
disappointed because you only found as

00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:32,840
shown on the left here around 300

00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:34,550
results what's happened here is that the

00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,890
search engine is very literally matched

00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:39,170
the word bermuda against seller titles

00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:41,180
and the word stamps against seller

00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:42,890
titles and so the only results that are

00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:47,720
returned are those that contain bermuda

00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:49,550
and stamps in the title but if we again

00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,980
if we've mined our data will very

00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:54,680
quickly learn that there are great

00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:57,050
results for bermuda stamps if you simply

00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:59,000
type bermuda and then navigate to the

00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:01,280
stamps category so rather than doing a

00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,410
literal match of the text stamps against

00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,790
the title just do a literal match of

00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:07,580
bermuda against the title and then

00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:09,380
restrict to the stamps category again

00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:11,210
you can learn this from from our extreme

00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,680
data you're see customers doing it

00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:15,530
you'll see customers typing bermuda

00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,360
stamps being disappointed not

00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:19,040
interacting with the engine typing

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,140
bermuda and refining to the stamps

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,480
category and you can derive that those

00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:25,040
things are are similar again lots of

00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,900
nuances lots of little subtleties of

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,340
getting that right but the idea is

00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,200
pretty intuitive and it turns out to

00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:32,570
work really well i'm in this particular

00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:35,060
case the user would get over 3,000

00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:37,910
results instead of the 300 results if we

00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:41,720
were much more literal in our matches so

00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:43,630
it works really well let me tell you

00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:48,690
another story so three stories about

00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:51,750
about data so search

00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:55,410
at the at the ebay scale is a very

00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:57,360
challenging problem I think of it in a

00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:00,030
number of ways from me from the applied

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,050
science side but but but let me let me

00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:03,570
walk you through a simple way of

00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:05,490
thinking about it what we have in our

00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:08,160
extreme data is all sorts of information

00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:10,200
that could help us deliver great results

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,450
for customers and I like to think of

00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:16,410
those that information in kind of five

00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:19,620
buckets so first of all there's textual

00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:21,450
information there's words in titles

00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,740
there's words in descriptions there's

00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:24,360
information that might be associated

00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:26,790
with an item that tells you what

00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,860
category that that items in there might

00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:30,180
be tags that the cell is provided but

00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:33,840
all sorts of useful textual information

00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:38,130
that you can match from the users item

00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:40,190
to the user to another user's query so

00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:42,690
lots of lots of useful information there

00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:45,840
there's also great great information you

00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:48,660
can learn from the images it turns out

00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:51,060
that users love to to click on items

00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:53,070
that have a pleasing aspect ratio so

00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:55,050
users like that that for three

00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:58,110
television ratio they like that 69

00:16:55,050 --> 00:17:00,060
television ratio they like images with a

00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:02,100
clean background they like high quality

00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,470
photography they're more likely in

00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:07,170
general to click on images that that

00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:08,790
have those characteristics so again you

00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,959
can use those factors in making sure

00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:13,439
you're delivering the best possible

00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,670
results to two customers there's a third

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,439
bucket and that's knowledge of the

00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:18,180
seller so if you know something about

00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:20,130
where the cell is located if the seller

00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:22,010
is located near the buyer you know

00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:25,470
perhaps that's useful in ranking results

00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:27,150
for that buyer if you know that the the

00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:28,920
seller has an impeccable record with

00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:31,260
shipping they're very responsive with

00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:34,470
their email lots of other factors again

00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:36,750
very useful in ranking results for for

00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:39,120
buyers there's also lots of information

00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:40,590
you can learn about the buyer you can

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,150
learn whether the buyer likes auctions

00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,890
whether the buyer likes fixed price

00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:47,400
whether the buyer likes free shipping

00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:49,440
now all sorts of preferences that around

00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,990
categories all kinds of information that

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,550
you can learn and then most importantly

00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,620
in this sort of getting to the point of

00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:58,170
the next couple of slides there's also

00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:01,170
lots of behavioral information generated

00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:02,580
by customers using the site so for

00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:04,950
example you might speculate

00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:07,620
than an item that's that's been watched

00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:10,010
by many users is perhaps more relevant

00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:12,390
than one that's been watched less if

00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:14,250
users are making an offer to buy an item

00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:16,620
perhaps it's more relevant than an item

00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,029
with no offers perhaps an item that's

00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,590
clicked on frequently in the search

00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:21,330
results is more relevant than an item

00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:23,519
that isn't there's all sorts of

00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:25,710
behavioral information generated that

00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:28,169
could be useful in search ranking at

00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:32,010
ebay so I think a lot about these kind

00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:33,480
of five buckets of factors a problem

00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,490
though emerges when you get so excited

00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,049
about five buckets of factors and all

00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,820
sorts of different different sort of

00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:40,649
your pieces of information that you

00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,750
could derive to work on the ranking

00:18:40,649 --> 00:18:45,840
problem and that is that you need some

00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:47,850
way to combine those factors to computer

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,860
ranking score to order the results for

00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:52,019
the customers query and you can't do

00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:54,600
that as a human you can't sit down and

00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:56,340
tune constants to come up with a with a

00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,529
large ranking function that that'll work

00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:00,659
for for users you need some other way to

00:18:58,529 --> 00:19:03,539
combine those factors to come up with a

00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:05,010
with a function I was here for Ian

00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:07,679
Barbara's talk yesterday he talked a

00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:10,440
little bit about SVM's as a learning

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,179
technique we as those kinds of

00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,029
approaches at scale where we take a

00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:16,230
training set of data with it's labeled

00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:19,320
with things that are relevant and things

00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:21,000
that are irrelevant and we we use a

00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,519
machine learning approach to combine

00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,889
factors to deliver the best results for

00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:30,240
our customers so that's kind of ranking

00:19:25,889 --> 00:19:34,559
it at scale so let me get to the point

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:39,929
of this of this particular factor and

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:42,029
using our data so this thing called item

00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:43,830
quality is one of tens of factors that

00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:47,070
we use in our we use in our ranking

00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:49,289
function the idea is pretty simple what

00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:51,570
we're trying to do is using our using an

00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:54,090
hour extreme data is compute for any new

00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:55,889
item that's listed on ebay what's the

00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:58,080
likelihood that it will sell and what

00:19:55,889 --> 00:20:00,059
price might itself or in many cases

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,740
that's a reasonably easy problem if

00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:05,549
somebody is listening listing a brand

00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:08,610
new new in season six generation ipod

00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:10,799
nano new in its box it's pretty easy to

00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:12,600
work out whether or not it'll sell at

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,700
the price that the customers provided

00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,200
it's a much more challenging problem

00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,620
when you use a list

00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,090
something that's one off so I'm sure I'm

00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,370
sure our algorithms for example had

00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:26,100
trouble estimating whether or not my

00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:29,370
used boots would sell and for what price

00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:31,169
they might sell but nonetheless we

00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:34,860
worked very hard on this problem and we

00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:36,899
do we do a pretty good job of it so

00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:39,450
based on our based on how historical

00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:41,100
data using how do cluster we can we can

00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:43,980
compute for any item that's listed on

00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:46,169
the site its likelihood of sale and the

00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:49,950
likely price that or self up and then we

00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:51,539
can use that in ranking but as soon as

00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:53,549
it really is listed on the site

00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:55,529
customers begin to interact with it and

00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:56,970
we get much richer information so as

00:20:55,529 --> 00:20:58,559
time passes by and I've sort of done

00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:02,070
that on the drawing that on the x-axis

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:05,100
here as time passes by we put less and

00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:06,870
less reliance on in our ranking on what

00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:09,179
we've precomputed when the seller listed

00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:11,330
it and we put more and more emphasis on

00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:14,610
how the buyers are interacting with it

00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:17,240
so again if buyers are bidding offering

00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:19,889
watching asking sellers questions

00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,360
clicking viewing those kinds of things

00:21:19,889 --> 00:21:23,370
we're beginning to build up a story

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,919
about whether that item is interesting

00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:27,779
and by the time it's but by the time its

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,210
if it's an auction by the time it's it's

00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:32,159
about to it's about to complete we're

00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:34,019
almost entirely depending in our ranking

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,399
function on the information that the

00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:38,370
buyers have given us and we've almost

00:21:35,399 --> 00:21:40,740
completely retired our pre estimation

00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:44,010
that we made when the item was first

00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:45,750
listed so it's just one factor and in

00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:47,970
the tens of factors that go into our

00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:50,429
ranking function you can imagine if you

00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:51,929
worked on the applied science team you'd

00:21:50,429 --> 00:21:53,340
think this was a pretty intuitive idea

00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:54,899
you'd have worked on this for a while

00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:57,799
and you'd be pretty excited to get it

00:21:54,899 --> 00:22:01,950
out to the site but at our scale

00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:03,480
everything that seems intuitive and

00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:04,679
seems easy turns out to be a hard

00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,510
engineering problem and I thought I'd

00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:09,059
just tell you a little bit about this

00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:12,659
particular factor in its journey into

00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:15,600
our ranking function on the site so we

00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:18,750
have typically over 6 million item

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:21,929
updates per hour so that's things like

00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:23,570
bids offers revisions of descriptions

00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:25,860
people adding additional photographs

00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:29,549
answering questions all those kinds of

00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:31,139
things a rate of about 6 million an hour

00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:34,470
and you would need to process these

00:22:31,139 --> 00:22:37,950
events if you were going to accurately

00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:41,580
compute the behavioral side of this item

00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:43,499
quality factor these events are

00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:45,119
generated on individual machines we have

00:22:43,499 --> 00:22:47,249
a large farm of thousands of machines

00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:49,980
these these events are generated on

00:22:47,249 --> 00:22:52,919
individual machines the individual

00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:54,480
machines create logging events those

00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:57,149
events are sort of put out onto a bus

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,190
and there's a cluster of machines that's

00:22:57,149 --> 00:23:01,769
listening to that bus watching for

00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:03,869
interesting events it's collecting those

00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:06,330
events it's then partitioning those

00:23:03,869 --> 00:23:07,830
events by item ID so we're getting all

00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:09,960
of the events for an item on a

00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:11,429
particular machine then we have to we

00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,499
have to sort those so that they can be

00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:15,330
collated together so that we can do some

00:23:13,499 --> 00:23:18,090
computation of what's that what's the

00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:19,830
meaning from those behaviors and once

00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:22,340
we've done that then we need to decide

00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:24,869
how interesting is that set of behaviors

00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:26,879
because we have such a large queue of

00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:27,960
behaviors to process that we need to

00:23:26,879 --> 00:23:29,549
make sure that we put the most

00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,830
interesting behaviors at the front of

00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:33,869
the queue so then sort of our priority

00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:35,609
queuing exercise going on and then we're

00:23:33,869 --> 00:23:37,559
consuming that Q into our ranking

00:23:35,609 --> 00:23:39,389
function and updating the statistics

00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:42,149
about the items so that we can correctly

00:23:39,389 --> 00:23:44,489
compute the ranks so big engineering

00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:46,289
project in a nice intuitive idea from

00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:48,539
the from the search science team it

00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:50,190
works really well but big engineering

00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:52,230
effort from our search infrastructure

00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:55,289
team to really get it to scale at prac

00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:56,669
in practice so it's a long journey when

00:23:55,289 --> 00:23:58,799
you're working on tens of factors in

00:23:56,669 --> 00:24:01,049
search to go from an intuitive idea

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,519
based on data to an idea it's in

00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:05,879
production that's running at the scale

00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:07,200
that we need for our customers I'm going

00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:08,580
to come back and talk about search a

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,690
little bit a little bit more later on I

00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:14,519
want a little bit more about the search

00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:18,330
platform and where that's at two so last

00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:20,789
last story about the data of ebay if

00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:22,109
you've got as much data as we have you

00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:24,059
really need tools to be able to

00:24:22,109 --> 00:24:26,519
visualize and understand that data and

00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:29,519
I've listed up here some some examples

00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:32,399
of of tools and techniques that we have

00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:34,289
available to us to to work with our data

00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:39,269
I'll just dive in and tell you about

00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:41,129
tell you about two of them so we have a

00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:42,990
tool that we call the heat map tool and

00:24:41,129 --> 00:24:43,440
allows us to visualize the performance

00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,360
of a queer

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,970
the query that you're looking at here is

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,799
the query metal detectors and what you

00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:52,049
can see is our search results page and

00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:55,679
over that has been superimposed a heat

00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:58,289
map that can be red yellow or green or

00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:01,259
shades in between in this case it's it's

00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:02,759
reasonably green what that means to me

00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:05,190
is somebody who's looked at lots of

00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:07,710
these is that this query is performing

00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:09,240
roughly as expected I can see a couple

00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:11,129
of little nuances in this query that

00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,899
might that might concern me that I might

00:25:11,129 --> 00:25:14,429
want to go and investigate so for

00:25:12,899 --> 00:25:17,399
example I can see that the second result

00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:19,169
is getting about 1% of the of the clicks

00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:21,690
that go to the page while the first

00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:23,490
results only getting points73 of the

00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:25,049
clicks that go to the page normally I

00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:27,000
would expect to see the first result

00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:28,710
getting more more clicks than the second

00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,960
result and you'll typically see a kind

00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:33,570
of exponential decay in in the cliq

00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,240
curve as you move down the results so

00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:37,679
I'm a little bit interested in that

00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,179
diving into a little bit more I can see

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,889
that the second result is a fixed price

00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:43,470
item and I can see the first result is

00:25:40,889 --> 00:25:45,029
an auction item and so maybe I want to

00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:46,500
go and understand how our ranking

00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:47,820
function is bringing together auctions

00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:50,399
and fixed price for this particular

00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:52,110
query metal detectors but otherwise this

00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:54,720
looks like a pretty typical query and

00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:59,519
I'd probably move on and look at another

00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:01,409
case here's one so this query and the

00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:03,690
colors aren't reproducing very well up

00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:05,129
here on the screen but what you what you

00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:07,860
what you'll see here is this is quite

00:26:05,129 --> 00:26:10,529
red and the search box at the top is

00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:11,610
quite red so visually what this is

00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:13,220
telling me is that there's something

00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:17,730
interesting going on with this query

00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:20,490
this query is the create apple the good

00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:23,100
news is that lots of users are clicking

00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:24,720
on our our product results we've have

00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,429
these really nice product results that

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:30,149
bring together a summary of all items

00:26:26,429 --> 00:26:32,340
that that match a particular product and

00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:33,899
you can see here that over one and a

00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,580
half percent of our users are going in

00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:39,629
and learning about the apple macbook

00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:41,009
laptop that's great really high

00:26:39,629 --> 00:26:42,960
percentages on some of those other

00:26:41,009 --> 00:26:45,149
results so a user with the intent Apple

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,009
seems to like the results that we're

00:26:45,149 --> 00:26:48,960
presenting so that's the good part of

00:26:47,009 --> 00:26:50,970
the story the concerning part of the

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,940
story is that over five percent of the

00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:55,259
clicks are going to the navigation so

00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,549
there's lots of users who are coming

00:26:55,259 --> 00:26:57,379
here and saying well I'm not seeing what

00:26:56,549 --> 00:27:00,989
I want let me

00:26:57,379 --> 00:27:02,879
using navigation and at the top you can

00:27:00,989 --> 00:27:04,350
see six and a half percent of the users

00:27:02,879 --> 00:27:07,710
are going back to the search box and

00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:09,239
trying a different query which means

00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:11,279
that you know where we're not meeting

00:27:09,239 --> 00:27:12,899
their intent either so it's you know in

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,369
total maybe eleven percent of the clicks

00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:15,989
going to the page are going to a place

00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:18,570
that's suggesting the results we're

00:27:15,989 --> 00:27:20,249
delivering out the right results so what

00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,539
we might do as a team with this data is

00:27:20,249 --> 00:27:23,940
we might decide to go and look at other

00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:26,129
broad queries in a similar class those

00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:28,139
that are showing our product details we

00:27:26,129 --> 00:27:30,480
might try and sort of derive a theme of

00:27:28,139 --> 00:27:33,239
work that we might that we might go in a

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,009
dress to improve search spin up some new

00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:37,409
projects you know work on those and work

00:27:35,009 --> 00:27:38,820
on this classic queries but lots of

00:27:37,409 --> 00:27:40,019
engineers lots of product managers at

00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,519
ebay are sitting around looking at these

00:27:40,019 --> 00:27:43,109
kinds of tools trying to understand

00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:45,409
what's going on at scale and then

00:27:43,109 --> 00:27:47,429
working to improve the search experience

00:27:45,409 --> 00:27:51,779
I'll show you one more thing from our

00:27:47,429 --> 00:27:53,580
data if you ever come to to ebay in

00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:55,739
campbell which is in the south bay of

00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,909
california and you walk around our

00:27:55,739 --> 00:27:59,009
buildings you'll see there's large

00:27:56,909 --> 00:28:01,169
monitors in in most of the buildings on

00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:02,850
most of the floors and what these

00:28:01,169 --> 00:28:04,409
monitors do all day long is show you

00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:06,619
sort of interesting things that are

00:28:04,409 --> 00:28:08,730
happening on the site graphs

00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:10,980
visualizations and very frequently

00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:13,169
feedback from our users so i took this

00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,730
screenshot from one of our from one of

00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:16,919
our consoles and what you can see here

00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:18,450
is that a user's decided to give us some

00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:19,980
feedback you'll see throughout ebay

00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:22,649
there's a link that says tell us what

00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:25,169
you think you can type texts in you can

00:28:22,649 --> 00:28:27,690
rate us that goes into a system we do

00:28:25,169 --> 00:28:29,369
some automatic tagging of that data that

00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:31,259
data gets used by product managers to

00:28:29,369 --> 00:28:33,659
plan for the product and it also goes up

00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:35,279
on these screens that are all around all

00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:38,429
around the buildings so in this

00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:40,320
particular case we've captured the fact

00:28:38,429 --> 00:28:42,539
that the user was looking at this iphone

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,960
4s deal on ebay is part of our daily

00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:47,609
deals and if we knew something about the

00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,049
buyer we'd have some statistics about

00:28:47,609 --> 00:28:50,700
this bio whether they're a frequent

00:28:49,049 --> 00:28:53,369
buyer how much they're spending on ebay

00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:55,799
some some so interfer mation that might

00:28:53,369 --> 00:28:57,809
help us kind of characterize the the

00:28:55,799 --> 00:29:00,299
problem the buyers having and then the

00:28:57,809 --> 00:29:02,580
top you can see that this users quite

00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:04,799
rightly unhappy that we're not we're not

00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:07,409
shipping to Puerto Rico which is a u.s.

00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:09,320
u.s. Protectorate and saying hey you

00:29:07,409 --> 00:29:11,059
know it's it's

00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,830
it's much closer than shipping it right

00:29:11,059 --> 00:29:15,230
across the continental US come on you

00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:17,210
should be shipping to Puerto Rico so if

00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:18,409
I saw this kind of data up on the screen

00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:19,669
and the kiosk you know I could go and

00:29:18,409 --> 00:29:21,409
see our business team we could talk

00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:23,269
about that we could try to address the

00:29:21,409 --> 00:29:25,220
problem of this particular user is

00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:26,750
having so we try very hard at ebay to

00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:28,669
kind of live in our data you can see

00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:30,559
that story lots of tools lots of data

00:29:28,669 --> 00:29:36,559
lots of visualization that helps us

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:40,519
really work to improve the product okay

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:42,379
so that's a little bit about ebay a

00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:43,460
little bit about data and I want to

00:29:42,379 --> 00:29:46,279
spend a little bit more time talking

00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:47,269
about platforms at eBay I mean as I said

00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:48,559
if we get a little bit of time at the

00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:50,419
end I'll talk a little bit about the

00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:53,240
future of online commerce and speculate

00:29:50,419 --> 00:29:55,519
a little um so let me start by telling

00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:58,340
you about what I think is the most

00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:59,690
exciting endeavor we're undertaking at

00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:02,899
ebay right now it's a project called

00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:04,190
cassini to understand it I just to

00:30:02,899 --> 00:30:05,029
understand what Cassini is I just need

00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:08,840
to give you a little bit of a history

00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:11,240
lesson so we have a search engine it's

00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,980
its name is Voyager it is still running

00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,919
on the site it's supporting all of our

00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:20,539
users right now and it's been doing so

00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:22,490
since about 2002 it was named after the

00:30:20,539 --> 00:30:25,360
Voyager satellite which I think if my

00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:28,429
memories right was launched in 1976

00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,570
there's Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 again if

00:30:28,429 --> 00:30:31,789
my memory is right I think they're both

00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:33,889
still working they've left the solar

00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:35,929
system they're still sending back

00:30:33,889 --> 00:30:37,970
information they were good robust

00:30:35,929 --> 00:30:40,639
satellites for their time and they're

00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:42,500
still reliable work horses but they are

00:30:40,639 --> 00:30:45,409
old technology and that's a little bit

00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:48,259
like our our search engine it's a

00:30:45,409 --> 00:30:52,490
reliable critical proven workhorse a

00:30:48,259 --> 00:30:55,850
little bit like a 1976 satellite but at

00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:57,769
all it's design is kind of circuit 2002

00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:59,809
and so it's missed down on a lot of the

00:30:57,769 --> 00:31:03,679
architectural fundamental advances that

00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:06,559
have happened in search since 2002 it

00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:07,759
has very basic ranking functionality so

00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,919
one of the things that the search

00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:12,889
science team dreams about doing at ebay

00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:15,679
very very difficult to do on top of the

00:31:12,889 --> 00:31:17,570
voyage of platform it has title only

00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,340
matched by default so that means it's

00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:21,230
only matching user queries against the

00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:22,940
user titles it's not making really great

00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:25,520
use of all that descriptive information

00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:29,480
that the sellers are providing us and it

00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:31,130
has a very literal search it does have

00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,590
some improvements based on the query

00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:36,200
rewrite ideas I told you earlier but

00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:40,970
it's it's very literal relative to too

00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:43,220
many modern search engines it's

00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:45,290
inflexible and and and and most

00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:47,690
painfully to me as an engineering guides

00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:49,190
very manual so my engineers in the

00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:51,670
search back-end team spend an enormous

00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:56,440
amount of time rolling out code

00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:59,090
diagnosing faults remediating problems

00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,890
imaging machines making changes to

00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:02,510
configurations of machines as we sort of

00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:04,880
enter the holiday season which is the

00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:07,220
shopping season for e basis lots of kind

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,080
of manual work going on by our engineers

00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:10,400
and of course I want our engineers to be

00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:13,970
spending all their time having fun

00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:16,640
writing code and so the punch line is

00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:19,490
it's time for a new search engine it's

00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,980
time to kind of turn the page and build

00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:26,090
a modern world class search engine and

00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:28,160
that is where Cassini comes in we're

00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:29,540
pretty imaginative bunch us engineers so

00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,370
we decided what we'll name it after a

00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:33,230
satellite we did that once before let's

00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:35,510
do it again so he picked a more recent

00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:41,240
satellite Cassini was launched I think

00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:43,580
in 1996 you know modern wonderful

00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,050
satellite the only secret that I'll tell

00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:47,120
you about Cassini is it's stuck in orbit

00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:55,520
going around Saturn but we'll pretend we

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:57,560
don't know that it is undoubtedly this

00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:00,860
project the most ambitious engineering

00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:05,720
undertaking that ebayers has made in a

00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:07,610
you know in a long time there are well

00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:10,010
over 100 engineers working on this

00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:11,900
project full-time they're working on

00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:14,410
four tracks as an automation track

00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:17,380
around making running the system

00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:20,030
software driven on commodity hardware

00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:21,350
there's the search back-end track the

00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:24,020
actual rewrite of the search engine

00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:25,250
itself there's a such science track

00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,870
where we're thinking about all the

00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:28,520
factors that should be used in ranking

00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:30,410
and how they'll work on top of a modern

00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,700
platform and then there's a search

00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:34,460
front-end track where we're rebuilding

00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:36,950
the user experience that sits on top of

00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:38,840
search so for large tracks

00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:41,179
all running in parallel you can you can

00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:44,240
imagine the complexities of managing a

00:33:41,179 --> 00:33:46,490
project at that scale it'll be complete

00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:49,220
in less than 18 months hence the hence

00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:52,490
the the the tag of it being a very very

00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:54,710
ambitious project and it will be a

00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:56,450
platform for ranking innovation it will

00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:58,220
be it will be something that really

00:33:56,450 --> 00:34:01,039
takes the customer experience forward at

00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:05,269
ebay in a very very significant way when

00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:08,570
we launch it right now we're beginning

00:34:05,269 --> 00:34:10,879
tests I talked a little bit yesterday on

00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:13,879
the on the panel about testing at ebay

00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:16,280
and as I said yesterday if you do use

00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:19,970
ebay the chances are you are in at least

00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:21,500
one test perhaps many tests and Cassini

00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:25,010
is one of the things that we're we're

00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:27,649
beginning to test and understand of

00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:29,000
course we won't release Cassini unless

00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:31,099
it's a great experience for customers

00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,810
and that will take iteration it's a very

00:34:31,099 --> 00:34:35,179
significant piece of software in a very

00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:36,829
new piece of software but I think it's

00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:39,079
very likely that will launch Cassini

00:34:36,829 --> 00:34:40,609
this year but will only do that when

00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:43,159
when it's a great experience for our

00:34:40,609 --> 00:34:44,690
customers so really exciting times some

00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:48,919
really really challenging stuff going on

00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:50,720
in project Cassini let me tell you about

00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:53,810
another platform I'll tell you that two

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:56,810
of them and maybe some of you have heard

00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:58,910
of heard of this project we've we've

00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:03,920
recently open sourced it it's a thing

00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:06,290
called ql i oh so a little bit of a

00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,670
little bit of context I don't know how

00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:16,040
many of you have worked with with ebay

00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:18,170
api's yeah not fun yeah I when I first

00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,970
got to ebay I spent I spent a week with

00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:21,950
it with a buddy of mine trying to build

00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:25,430
a PHP application on top of ebay xapi

00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:27,980
eyes and I didn't have fun either it's

00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:29,750
it's pretty challenging I think if my

00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:31,849
memory is right we have over 20 api's

00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:33,740
and they're all really different and so

00:35:31,849 --> 00:35:36,260
things that work on on one API don't

00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:38,450
quite work on another API documentation

00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:41,950
is a little spotty it's you know it's

00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:45,650
it's it's it's challenging to work with

00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:48,050
what's what's also challenging is as a

00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:50,210
developer as a PHP developer you you

00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:52,820
find yourself making calls to lots of do

00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:54,109
forint ap is in a single script and then

00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:56,150
sort of you know working with the data

00:35:54,109 --> 00:35:57,740
massaging it to create the single result

00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:59,420
that you need so you tend to make a lot

00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:02,330
of HTTP requests and get a lot of

00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:05,060
responses to carry out any to go at any

00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:06,560
one task so we released this think ula

00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:10,940
i'll explain a little bit more about it

00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:13,190
in a moment and it's its goal in life is

00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:17,030
to make using our api is very very

00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:19,760
simple and it makes it simple in two

00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:25,570
ways it shortens your code it helps you

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:28,640
make one call rather than many calls and

00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:30,589
it also leaves most of the sort of back

00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,970
in work to servers that are hosted by us

00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:33,650
so you don't to worry about sort of all

00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:36,589
the details that details are much more

00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:43,220
abstract ofthe an in our current api's

00:36:36,589 --> 00:36:45,290
so let me give you an example so let's

00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:48,440
suppose you and I we're working together

00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:49,520
and we're working a PHP project we're

00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,650
going to be building some sort of

00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,900
console thing that's going to allow

00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:56,119
large business sellers to better manage

00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,980
their inventory on ebay and we're going

00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:59,599
to build that on top of ebay xapi eyes

00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:02,180
let's pretend that one of the modules

00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:04,940
we're writing is is a module that's

00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:07,640
going to find all the items that match a

00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:09,440
query it's going to find the best offers

00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:11,810
that have made made for those items by

00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,000
buyers it's going to find the bidders

00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:15,260
that made those best offers and then

00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,990
it's going to sort of collapse all that

00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:20,320
and return a JSON response so it's

00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:23,630
imagine we wanted to write that script

00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:26,390
we did and here it is so here's his page

00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:29,000
1 of the script working with our with

00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:30,260
our current api's i'll share the code

00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,550
out with you guys if you're interested

00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:37,010
his page 2 of the script you know making

00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:42,349
the call to the the second API that's

00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:49,280
needed for this task his page 3 he's

00:37:42,349 --> 00:37:52,420
paid for and here finally is page 5 to

00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:55,790
carry out that task so 180 lines of code

00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:58,070
just to find the items get their details

00:37:55,790 --> 00:38:00,080
get the best offers and get their

00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:03,089
bidders and wrap it all up as a JSON

00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:05,579
response so lots and lots of work

00:38:03,089 --> 00:38:12,239
let me show you the QL IO version of

00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:15,059
that so 14 lines of code really really

00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:18,930
fantastic what we've built is is a way

00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:22,619
in an sql-like language that you can

00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:26,809
express a complex information need that

00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:28,650
may require access to many of our AP is

00:38:26,809 --> 00:38:30,269
so if you're if you're sort of

00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:31,589
comfortable working in SQL you can sort

00:38:30,269 --> 00:38:33,210
of glanced at this and you can see that

00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:35,069
you know we're finding information about

00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:36,749
the items and then we're finding

00:38:35,069 --> 00:38:38,489
information about the offers for those

00:38:36,749 --> 00:38:40,950
items based on the set of items that

00:38:38,489 --> 00:38:42,809
were returned finding information about

00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:44,910
the bidders for the set of offers that

00:38:42,809 --> 00:38:47,460
were returned and then we sort of

00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:50,369
packaging it up as a JSON response and

00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:53,519
returning it what's really really nice

00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:55,529
here is that it's it's callable using a

00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:59,969
get a single get request so you can go

00:38:55,529 --> 00:39:01,079
to q l dot io / item details / a query

00:38:59,969 --> 00:39:02,880
in fact you can try that now if you've

00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:06,719
got a you've got a web connection so q

00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:08,729
le o / item details / Ferrari you could

00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:11,190
try and you'll see you'll get a JSON

00:39:08,729 --> 00:39:14,309
response back that that's running this

00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:15,960
little script if you go to q l I owe you

00:39:14,309 --> 00:39:17,190
can you can write your own scripts you

00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,869
can kind of play around there's lots of

00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:22,289
examples there and you can have those

00:39:18,869 --> 00:39:24,509
hosted on the q l io site so then as a

00:39:22,289 --> 00:39:27,839
PHP developer you can make a single get

00:39:24,509 --> 00:39:29,519
request to this q l io URL you can get

00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:32,640
back the JSON response and work with the

00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:36,479
JSON response so really simple hosted by

00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:38,700
us much less complex abstracts all the

00:39:36,479 --> 00:39:40,979
unnecessary details and best of all you

00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:44,910
get to make one HTTP GET request and get

00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:46,829
one HTTP response so really really cool

00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:50,309
and I hope you find it hope you find it

00:39:46,829 --> 00:39:51,900
useful just some some stats on it we

00:39:50,309 --> 00:39:53,729
tried writing this code in Java that's

00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:56,910
the red bar up here on the left it took

00:39:53,729 --> 00:39:59,160
over three hundred lines of Java to work

00:39:56,910 --> 00:40:02,309
with our AP is as I said the PHP version

00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:04,819
about 180 lines of code the nice little

00:40:02,309 --> 00:40:06,839
green bar is the 14 lines of qol I oh

00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:09,089
you can see the amount of data that's

00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:11,609
moved around over there on the right so

00:40:09,089 --> 00:40:14,819
before qoi oh you know lots of data

00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:16,390
moved around lots of HTTP requests with

00:40:14,819 --> 00:40:18,039
qli oh you know

00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:19,750
less data moved around the sort of

00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:21,069
pictorially represented down here as

00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:23,109
well so you can see lots and lots of

00:40:21,069 --> 00:40:26,380
requests being made by our original PHP

00:40:23,109 --> 00:40:31,329
script just the one request if you

00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:33,730
access the QL io URL so really really

00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:35,650
nice i hope you find it useful I think

00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:37,630
it I think it's I think it's the way of

00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:39,760
the future and I and I hope that lots of

00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:41,440
companies head in this direction I think

00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:47,260
I think we'd all find it useful as PHP

00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:50,500
developers well learn more about it HTTP

00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:52,240
qld oh it's on the github it's been open

00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,769
sourced we're certainly is a company

00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,950
pushing to open source a lot more of

00:40:53,769 --> 00:40:58,660
what we do we're becoming committers for

00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:00,519
major projects we're adopting more

00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:03,339
projects internally and working hard to

00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:06,099
become a much more much more open source

00:41:03,339 --> 00:41:10,720
friendly company so enjoy hope you find

00:41:06,099 --> 00:41:13,390
it useful all right so let me race

00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:16,450
through one last topic and that is sort

00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:19,269
of you know where to for e-commerce and

00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:20,440
ebay next of giving you that tour of

00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:26,920
data and I giving you a quick tour of

00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:29,940
the platforms I would argue that right

00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:34,509
now today we are at an inflection point

00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:37,180
in shopping it's a it's a it's a very

00:41:34,509 --> 00:41:39,730
very interesting time to be working on

00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:40,960
commerce online and I'm very very

00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:43,079
confident there's going to be more

00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,789
change in the next year or two in

00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:49,119
commerce then there's probably been in

00:41:45,789 --> 00:41:52,359
the last 10 or 15 years it's a very very

00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:53,890
very exciting time what is it exciting

00:41:52,359 --> 00:41:55,630
well I think I think it's exciting for

00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:57,160
many reasons but one is that there's oh

00:41:55,630 --> 00:42:01,329
there's a there's a convergence going on

00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:03,309
between online and offline shopping and

00:42:01,329 --> 00:42:04,900
I'm sure you're all part of it I'm sure

00:42:03,309 --> 00:42:07,509
that when you're in a bricks and mortar

00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:10,779
store you're you're thinking about

00:42:07,509 --> 00:42:13,180
buying a GPS or a phone you're looking

00:42:10,779 --> 00:42:15,220
at that device I am sure you're you're

00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:18,700
making that decision with with some sort

00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:22,329
of device in your hand yes hmm let me

00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:25,539
read some reviews perhaps i'll text a

00:42:22,329 --> 00:42:29,259
friend maybe i'll post something to

00:42:25,539 --> 00:42:30,410
facebook or twitter there's all sorts of

00:42:29,259 --> 00:42:32,210
things going on I'll do so

00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:34,460
I'll do some price comparison i'll scan

00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:36,950
the barcode with with red laser let me

00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:38,329
see what other offers are around me in

00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:40,430
fact let me check what other stores in

00:42:38,329 --> 00:42:42,859
nearby I might going I might go and

00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:44,240
check those out as well and in fact this

00:42:42,859 --> 00:42:47,030
price isn't so great let me just buy it

00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:49,579
online after all and pay for some

00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:51,619
shipping I mean I'm sure you're I'm sure

00:42:49,579 --> 00:42:54,049
you were all at that at that really

00:42:51,619 --> 00:42:56,329
really you're at that convergence of

00:42:54,049 --> 00:42:59,480
offline and online and I think that

00:42:56,329 --> 00:43:01,819
opens up a wonderful Lorraine ray of

00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:04,910
possibilities for those who are working

00:43:01,819 --> 00:43:06,140
on Commerce I'm sure that but those of

00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:08,510
you who are entrepreneurial and

00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:10,760
listening are thinking hey I got an idea

00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:12,829
I got an idea or something I could do in

00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,780
that space that would be great for

00:43:12,829 --> 00:43:18,289
customers that helps the the offline

00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:21,589
world and the online world converge so

00:43:18,289 --> 00:43:29,569
very very interesting times it looks

00:43:21,589 --> 00:43:34,309
like your phones ring somebody excited

00:43:29,569 --> 00:43:36,140
about convergence of Commerce he's some

00:43:34,309 --> 00:43:37,819
data to kind of back it up I suppose

00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:40,339
that this that this that this amazing

00:43:37,819 --> 00:43:44,510
trend is happening so if you look back

00:43:40,339 --> 00:43:46,520
at 2008 online commerce was worth around

00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:50,599
three hundred and twenty five billion

00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:51,880
dollars according to forrester and it

00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:54,049
was only four percent of Commerce

00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:58,390
ninety-six percent of Commerce was still

00:43:54,049 --> 00:44:02,750
offline if you jump forward to today and

00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:04,880
you you compute those statistics yes the

00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:09,020
online has grown from four percent to

00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:11,390
six percent but most excitingly web

00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:14,390
influenced offline is now thirty-seven

00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:15,890
percent and so there's six percent

00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:18,079
that's pure online and there's

00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:20,240
thirty-seven percent that's offline but

00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:22,549
has some online component as people make

00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:25,640
use of something online in order to

00:44:22,549 --> 00:44:29,770
carry out that offline piece Forrester

00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:32,289
also says that that in 2013 this

00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:34,849
convergence of online and offline

00:44:32,289 --> 00:44:37,480
commerce is going to be a market that's

00:44:34,849 --> 00:44:41,180
worth about ten trillion u.s. dollars

00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:43,030
compared to 2008 where it was only 325

00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:46,960
billion

00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:49,250
so perhaps that backs up my my my my

00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,960
speculation that there's going to be a

00:44:49,250 --> 00:45:00,110
lot of change in the next two years

00:44:50,960 --> 00:45:02,870
relative to that last 10 or 15 and I

00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:06,710
think we sort of tying this all together

00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:09,050
I think I think as people in this space

00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:11,180
we need to be very very aware that if

00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:13,580
this is a consumer-led revolution you

00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:16,250
know this is this is customers deciding

00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:18,140
to do things different ways this is

00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:19,880
customers giving us data that we need to

00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:21,980
understand in the ways I've talked about

00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:24,380
earlier so that we can push Commerce

00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:26,210
forward to help those customers and it's

00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:28,610
very much technology enabled I mean it

00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:31,460
is moving online and so it is it is

00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:32,780
moving in the direction of technology so

00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:34,610
it's all about the customer it's very

00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:36,440
customer centric it's very data centric

00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:38,990
and it's moving online so it's a really

00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:42,800
really interesting time I'm pretty

00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:44,090
excited about ebay i should say it's a

00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,490
very very interesting company to be out

00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:48,500
right now you probably know something

00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:50,210
about x commerce they're quite magento

00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:52,450
which i'm sure many of you have worked

00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:56,020
with it's it's a well known as of a PHP

00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:59,990
sweet that's used for building small

00:45:56,020 --> 00:46:03,050
online experiences so that's part of

00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:06,560
ebay we've also acquired gsi commerce

00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:08,720
which is a much larger player in in that

00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:11,350
in that same space they power they power

00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:14,720
folks like toys r us a big the big us

00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:16,580
children's toys retailer the power the

00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:19,280
the National Football League in the

00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:20,930
state's major league baseball so they're

00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,190
so that the engine that's sitting under

00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:24,020
those guys and they do everything from

00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:26,780
the online presence right through to the

00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:29,150
fulfillment in the warehouses so kind of

00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:32,240
X comma s kind of covering the the

00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:35,540
smaller emergence of smaller retailers

00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:38,630
onto the web and then gsi looking after

00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:40,250
the larger providers then of course

00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:42,170
sitting alongside that you've got paypal

00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:44,540
in the world's largest payments provider

00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:46,040
and then I'm very excited to be part of

00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:48,680
the marketplaces business which is all

00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:51,290
about connecting buyers and sellers so

00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:53,990
he's a very interesting suite of things

00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:56,180
that eBay Inc does and I think it sets

00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:58,190
us up

00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:01,640
to enable consumers really to buy

00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:04,690
anything anywhere anyhow so really

00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:08,450
really interesting times so with that I

00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:10,069
will stop talking and thank you what

00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:14,079
I'll also say is we're hiring so if you

00:47:10,069 --> 00:47:16,910
are interested in working in California

00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:19,940
with folks like me you can send me an

00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:23,000
email Hugh Williams at ebay com I would

00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:25,849
love to hear from you and I think we

00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,349
have maybe I think I've sped I've sped

00:47:25,849 --> 00:47:29,660
enough that we have a few minutes for

00:47:27,349 --> 00:47:36,829
questions if you if you'd like to ask

00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:38,900
any it's kind of wondering how you'll

00:47:36,829 --> 00:47:41,480
find him working with node four qot oh

00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:44,089
sorry I'm how're you finding mode for

00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:46,220
kilo so how're you finding a note four

00:47:44,089 --> 00:47:47,900
qot Oh however minding out how you kind

00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:49,520
of set up whether use cholesterol or how

00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:53,119
you saw route across all the different

00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:54,619
processes I to be really asked with you

00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:57,829
I'm probably not the right guy to give

00:47:54,619 --> 00:48:03,829
you the detailed answers to how qli Oh

00:47:57,829 --> 00:48:07,569
works but certainly it's the the guy who

00:48:03,829 --> 00:48:11,359
built it subu is a very very big fan of

00:48:07,569 --> 00:48:13,220
nodejs and very strong advocate for it

00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:15,950
in the company I know most of the talks

00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:20,540
that that he gives right now he has many

00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:22,520
had 11 you know no zealot back in 2009

00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:24,200
and now there's you know tens of us who

00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:26,359
was who was a lot since taking over the

00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:28,790
over the company he's very very excited

00:48:26,359 --> 00:48:30,799
about it but I can't tell you that I'm

00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:33,380
sorry I can't tell you the details uh

00:48:30,799 --> 00:48:36,619
what methodology are you you using for

00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:39,410
Cassini are you using agile or what

00:48:36,619 --> 00:48:46,460
waterfall or how are you managing that

00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:49,309
the product so again sort of going back

00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:51,950
to the the panel yesterday if you were

00:48:49,309 --> 00:48:55,130
here you know I have a very strong

00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:57,680
belief as an engineering leader that we

00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:59,569
should empower small teams to run in the

00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,920
way they want to run and have clear

00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:03,170
ownership are the things they want to

00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:04,880
run so I tend to push those decisions

00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:06,770
right down to the bottom of the

00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:09,109
organization to be made by the teams

00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:10,070
that actually build the software so

00:49:09,109 --> 00:49:13,010
there's no no sir

00:49:10,070 --> 00:49:14,480
scription coming from me I think in some

00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:16,670
cases folks would like more prescription

00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,560
from me but I really do believe about

00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:20,480
him believe in empowering engineers and

00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:22,250
align level leaders who run those teams

00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,900
what I can tell you is that the search

00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:26,120
back-end team who are sort of the

00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:27,830
infrastructure team have made a very

00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:31,210
profound shift from us at a waterfall

00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:34,430
model of a couple of years ago to a very

00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:35,870
careful adoption of agile scrum so they

00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:37,910
certainly don't do that sort of scrum

00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:40,730
but thing that lots of lots of teams do

00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:43,430
it's a you know a really careful

00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:45,950
application of scrum and they're very

00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:48,860
proud of their burndown charts and the

00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:51,920
way they do their scrum planning and the

00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:53,900
way they they post mortem the sprints

00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,550
that they've had those kinds of things

00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:58,010
so they've been very zealous in their

00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:59,270
adoption of it i think if i look at the

00:49:58,010 --> 00:50:01,360
search front-end team I'd say it's

00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:05,330
pretty a little bit more

00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:06,710
seat-of-the-pants scrum which i think is

00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:08,150
a little more probably a little bit more

00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:10,010
appropriate if you get sort of closer to

00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:12,410
the customer you know where it's it's

00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:14,060
easier to you know put together you know

00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:15,500
a simple user experience and try it out

00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:17,060
and then so hey what we want to do

00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:18,710
something different or it's a little

00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:23,920
easier to be a bit more agile with with

00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:23,920
the requirements the search science team

00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:29,180
you know don't don't really have a

00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:30,710
methodology per se that they adopt and

00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:32,120
they do very little software engineering

00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:34,490
it's much more about of digging your

00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:36,380
data and experimentation I'd say what

00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:38,990
they have is a very sort of fast fail

00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:41,570
philosophy so they try and let you know

00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:44,510
a thousand ideas bloom and then you know

00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:46,340
very quickly you know chop off the ideas

00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:47,810
that aren't working and invest in the

00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:50,350
ideas that they ask they have very much

00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:52,700
a setup portfolio experimental approach

00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:56,000
and the team that's working on

00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:59,810
automation again is a sort of a strong

00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:03,050
adoptive agile scrum and that's that's a

00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:04,580
very very complex project so little

00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:05,510
there are different philosophies I think

00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:07,100
you know one of that one of the

00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:08,930
challenges of course if you is if you're

00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:10,250
pushing those decisions right down to

00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:11,810
the bottom of the organization stuff you

00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:13,070
know who does what and sometimes the

00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:15,800
teams have trouble coordinating because

00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:17,120
they think differently so it definitely

00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,070
creates some overhead for guys like me

00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:20,090
to kind of work you bring those teams

00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:22,670
together and get them to work together

00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:23,589
effectively but I'm kind of up for that

00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:24,670
if the if

00:51:23,589 --> 00:51:25,779
the engineers and the teens that are

00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:29,009
happy with the methodologies that

00:51:25,779 --> 00:51:31,210
they're using great question thanks

00:51:29,009 --> 00:51:34,089
sorry you mentioned earlier about the

00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:35,559
conversion of the online and the offline

00:51:34,089 --> 00:51:41,589
and I was just wondering what you saw

00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:47,019
ebays role in that was um so I think I

00:51:41,589 --> 00:51:51,489
think our role is is very broad and I

00:51:47,019 --> 00:51:53,650
and I can't you know precisely say what

00:51:51,489 --> 00:51:56,170
it is we will do or presuppose what we

00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:58,630
will do but i think if you've got kind

00:51:56,170 --> 00:52:01,799
of the world's leading platform for

00:51:58,630 --> 00:52:04,329
bringing bricks and mortar stores online

00:52:01,799 --> 00:52:06,489
you've got the eBay marketplace you've

00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:08,410
got the the paypal payment engine I

00:52:06,489 --> 00:52:11,200
think you've got an enormous kind of

00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:14,319
aperture of things that you can of

00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:16,569
things that you can do you know on the

00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:19,390
on the one hand you can provide people

00:52:16,569 --> 00:52:22,089
with trusted identity so that they can

00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:24,009
have trusted experiences on the web on

00:52:22,089 --> 00:52:26,680
the other hand you've got you've got a

00:52:24,009 --> 00:52:29,380
marketplace with you know 100 million

00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:32,890
active customers and so you can you can

00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:35,410
help you perhaps help retailers get

00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:36,849
their inventory out to some more more

00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:39,670
buyers than they've ever dreamed of

00:52:36,849 --> 00:52:41,079
getting it out to before and you've got

00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:43,420
kind of tools and you put developers

00:52:41,079 --> 00:52:45,369
building on top of those tools so I I

00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:47,829
don't know exactly where it'll go but

00:52:45,369 --> 00:52:49,599
what I'll say again is what I said

00:52:47,829 --> 00:52:52,599
before is I think it's this time around

00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:54,579
it's a very very consumer lead I think I

00:52:52,599 --> 00:52:57,489
think what we what we all need to do is

00:52:54,579 --> 00:52:59,140
to understand how customers want a shop

00:52:57,489 --> 00:53:03,160
and what they're doing and then and then

00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:04,420
make that make that easier of course

00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:05,890
there'll be sparks of innovation along

00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:09,400
the way they disrupt is so things like

00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:11,170
red laser but I but I think this time

00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:12,279
around it's very much about looking at

00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:15,789
the data and understanding what

00:53:12,279 --> 00:53:17,170
customers want to do but I think in two

00:53:15,789 --> 00:53:18,819
years time we'll look back and say wow

00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:21,579
you know that that wasn't what we

00:53:18,819 --> 00:53:24,759
expected you know the world is the world

00:53:21,579 --> 00:53:27,479
is really different now things can be

00:53:24,759 --> 00:53:27,479
really exciting ride

00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:36,000
yeah I was interested that ebay took

00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:37,800
over gsi commerce because they seem to

00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,480
have completely different ways of

00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:44,580
developing software apart from anything

00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:46,080
else is ebay going to reform gsi

00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:51,720
commerce are you going to let them carry

00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:56,010
on going their own way um so I'll have

00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:57,840
to I'll have to confess to to you know

00:53:56,010 --> 00:54:00,060
some-some ignorance around the details

00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:04,470
of how of how gsi does its development

00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:07,020
and and then how it runs I think again

00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:09,900
as a company I think we're very

00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:11,280
respectful of you know teams having

00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:12,780
their own cultures and their own ways of

00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:15,030
doing things I think it you know front

00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:17,490
from the top we don't push down process

00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:19,200
or particular ways of doing things I

00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:21,180
think at the at the top of the company

00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:23,160
you know our leaders talk more about

00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:26,160
sort of goals and strategy and vision

00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:27,240
and aspiration and I think at the bottom

00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,460
of the company we can kind of rally

00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:31,500
around that and you know and push up

00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:34,230
what it is we should do to meet those

00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:37,620
goals in that those aspirations so I

00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:41,880
think I can't imagine any sort of you

00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:43,470
know heavy-handed you know pushing of

00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:45,090
gsi to do things you know in a

00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:47,280
particular way what I can what I can

00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:48,870
instead imagine is that you know gsi

00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,490
will make use of all the wonderful data

00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:52,080
that we've got and experiences that we

00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:56,940
have and the tools that are available to

00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:58,230
take themselves to the next level I want

00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:01,290
to ask a question about the future of

00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:03,570
the actual product itself and magenta we

00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:05,700
can like spoke the products and think

00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:07,290
was in the cover of Time magazine that

00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:09,060
more more products or impersonal eyes I

00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:10,560
was wondering if ebay was seeing that

00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:13,110
trend coming through and in the

00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:15,350
marketplace and you doing anything to

00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:17,010
support that going forward yeah

00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:18,210
personalization is really really

00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:21,240
interesting I think it's a very very

00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:24,270
challenging problem but I think I think

00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:26,430
you know everybody in commerce needs to

00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:28,230
be moving in that direction you probably

00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:31,230
saw that we recently did an acquisition

00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:32,790
of hunch com instead of well known for

00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:34,890
some taste graph technology that they

00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:36,840
had so you can play with hunch com if

00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:38,040
you're interested I have some really

00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,330
interesting technology around sort of

00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:41,700
you answering questions and then

00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:43,260
predicting things that you will like so

00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:44,970
we recently acquired those guys they

00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:47,070
they're really expert in sort of

00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:50,010
understanding customers and mapping

00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:51,900
customers behaviors to taste so the

00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:54,620
customers have and we're really excited

00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:57,020
about using that technology across ebay

00:55:54,620 --> 00:56:01,010
we've also invested really deeply in

00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:03,180
recommendations so you know when a user

00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:05,100
interacts with an item or purchases an

00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:06,630
item we're trying very hard to suggest

00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:08,160
other items that they may be interested

00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:09,660
in and to engage the user more on the

00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,310
homepage when they come back and they're

00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:13,320
looking for you know looking to be

00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:15,840
inspired by by a shopping experience

00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:17,760
sort of Aging in that direction I think

00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:19,290
10 be very hard I think it's very hard

00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:21,270
for everybody to really get to the point

00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:23,070
where online shopping is truly

00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:24,630
personalized because like there's a ton

00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:28,170
of challenges there you know I've had

00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:30,510
experiences online where you know I've

00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:32,040
made a purchase for example for a friend

00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:33,420
you know so let's let's imagine a

00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,770
situation where you know a friend good

00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:37,050
friend of mine's just had it had a new

00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:39,630
child and I decided I must buy them a

00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:41,430
gift and I go and buy this i buy this

00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:42,450
gift and you know I give it to them and

00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:43,890
then from then on the system's

00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:45,570
recommending all sorts of children

00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:47,040
things to me but that that intent for me

00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:48,780
is finished you know I'm kind of done

00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,970
and I think knowing when intents are

00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:52,350
kind of continuing and underlying themes

00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:54,390
and knowing when intense a kind of

00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:55,530
one-off is a really really challenging

00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:56,730
problem so I think there's a lot of

00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:58,200
barriers to really making

00:56:56,730 --> 00:57:01,230
personalization work incredibly

00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:03,300
effectively online but I think everybody

00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:05,010
needs to a you know needs to be aspiring

00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:08,190
to make progress in that direction and

00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:09,900
make the buyers experiences as custom

00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:14,220
and as tailored and as personal as it

00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:15,210
can possibly be it's been a lot of fun

00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:17,430
by the way it's great to see you guys

00:57:15,210 --> 00:57:18,600
how about a picture for you too it's not

00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:22,020
getting this is one of our data centers

00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:24,180
in in Phoenix Arizona it's pretty cool

00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:26,370
and uh and this is these are the

00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:28,730
machines inside it this is actually the

00:57:26,370 --> 00:57:31,410
Cassini machines so you can see

00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:33,840
interactive racks racks of servers the

00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:35,700
data centers super super cool we're

00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:37,230
really proud of it it's it's one of the

00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:39,210
greenest data centers ever built it's

00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:42,960
got you know amazing engineering

00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:45,330
innovation in cooling and power use it

00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:47,190
so really really really cool stuff um I

00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:49,800
just wonder what we have plans for

00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:50,580
Magento and why was it that you purchase

00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:54,500
that because obviously that's

00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:56,760
considerably smaller than ebay com so

00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:58,020
like what is the purpose of

00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:00,210
purchasing magento what are you

00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:02,280
expecting to do with the magento

00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:05,010
platform yes I think I think if you go

00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:06,240
back to what eBay Inc is fundamentally

00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:08,790
about you know we're fundamentally about

00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:10,230
connecting buyers and sellers in the way

00:58:08,790 --> 00:58:11,640
they want to be connected think that's

00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:14,340
really you know what's at the heart of

00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:16,620
the company and I think we're very you

00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:19,230
know we want it we want to position

00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:22,530
ourselves as a as a company that helps

00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:24,240
make that happen and you know we want to

00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:25,800
be part of this this revolution that's

00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,630
going to take place and so I think I

00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:30,480
think with that context no coring

00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:33,120
magento made a ton of sense you know I

00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:34,440
think it really brings to the portfolio

00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:35,910
of things we do you know another

00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:38,070
important way to connect buyers and

00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:40,380
sellers and and I think it fits really

00:58:38,070 --> 00:58:42,420
nicely with ebay marketplaces with with

00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:44,730
gsi and with paypal so i think it's a

00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:47,130
it's a really nice fit in in the family

00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:48,930
for us okay just got one tiny little

00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:51,060
question Ashley you couldn't get the

00:58:48,930 --> 00:58:55,050
slide back with a heat map could you get

00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:56,580
all my goodness ah yes probably this

00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:58,500
could take a while what is just asking

00:58:56,580 --> 00:59:00,150
the question okay well you had a load of

00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:02,640
central at one point one percent clicks

00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:06,960
here 9.97 essentially the members didn't

00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:08,430
that add up to 100 ah yes so you're not

00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,290
seeing you're not seeing lots of the

00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:12,240
lots of the clicks that go on so things

00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:14,700
like the pagination control have you

00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:16,170
know have have significant numbers and

00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:17,250
what you're also not seeing is the

00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:20,130
percentage of time that the page is

00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:21,210
abandoned so it's a percentage but that

00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:22,980
would count as a failed search

00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:24,810
presumably that's right the most

00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:25,860
innocent if the sum if the sum is

00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:27,270
significantly less than one hundred

00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:34,490
percent then is there's probably an

00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:34,490
issue going on okay Thank You Hugh

00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,660
