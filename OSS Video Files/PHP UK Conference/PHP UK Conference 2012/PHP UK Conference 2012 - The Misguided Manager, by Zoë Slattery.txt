well as I guess you know my name is Zoe

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,620
Slattery and what you may not know is

00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,300
that I've spent my life working for

00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,520
large companies I've worked for three

00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:25,570
very big companies over the last 40

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:28,570
years right now I work for a very small

00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:31,360
company I am the single employee I'm the

00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:35,680
managing director I'm the CTO it's great

00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:37,960
um but it gave me a chance to reflect on

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,500
some of the things that I'd seen in the

00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:46,180
companies I work for and so I put this

00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:48,190
talk together and I work with developers

00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:51,219
a lot I've always worked for developers

00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:53,800
you guys your developers right how many

00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:58,329
developers do I have in the room yeah

00:00:53,800 --> 00:01:02,399
okay so universally you and I complain

00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:05,980
about managers this is I feel a chance

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:09,090
for me to put the large corporate

00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,090
managers point of view

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:21,659
now I don't know how to advance the site

00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:24,810
try that it's not cool in this talk I'm

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:27,860
going to skip through personnel

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,570
management managing delivery product

00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,820
legal stuff and I'm doing in a fairly

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,470
random order it's kind of up it's the

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,970
way it came together when I wrote it

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,530
down on the plane on the way to Apache

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,000
con where I tried to give it to some

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:44,310
Americans who have a slightly different

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,530
sense of humor so anyway this is where

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,390
it worked out so let's start off I am a

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:53,729
manager in a large corporate

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:56,130
organization motivation is key there is

00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:59,340
nothing more important than motivation

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:03,960
to having a happy healthy productive

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:06,119
working environment now as a manager you

00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,259
will get sold many ideas about

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:12,030
motivation it's usually a consultant and

00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:17,010
they want to sell you a team-building

00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:20,640
course some education a book forget it

00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:23,280
it is no use to you the tools you need

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,590
are simple that tried and trusted

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:30,150
methods and a night you will find this

00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:35,340
theme a lot through my talk my favorite

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:38,370
the keris a mistake I beat people with a

00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:41,400
stick until they deliver and if that

00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:44,220
doesn't work the threat of unspeakable

00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,690
acts with a sharpened carrot is very

00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:56,520
motivating

00:02:45,690 --> 00:03:00,690
Oh backwards nope okay let's talk about

00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:03,890
own development sizing how do you plan

00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:06,900
what you're going to deliver and when

00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:09,240
now I've seen this fashion recently it's

00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,960
been pretty popular in companies that I

00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:16,200
have worked for a planning poker so the

00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:19,770
team sits around to shout the card who

00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:22,470
plays part planning poker right you'll

00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:24,480
hand out cards right everybody takes a

00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,580
guess at how long something is going to

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,780
take to deliver and then you kind of

00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,670
have a bit of a discussion in your

00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,620
average out guesses and come up with an

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,060
answer it kind of ignores the fact that

00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,770
there might be one or two people in the

00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,890
room who actually have done something

00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:40,020
like it before and know and it's kind of

00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,910
well I suppose this sort of thing keeps

00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,860
the developers occupied and happy I mean

00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,710
they even give me a vote so I say how

00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:51,360
long I think things are going to take it

00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:53,100
it's kind of ok and when they do it all

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,830
in story points which of course they

00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:58,370
think I don't know are actually working

00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:01,380
dates but of course I do I don't say

00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:03,300
anyway as I said it's a bit of a

00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:07,230
diversion because you see the problem

00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:10,170
with all of these things is the only

00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:13,190
person who knows how long it's going to

00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:15,180
take to deliver is me you know why

00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:20,690
that's what I've agreed with the

00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:20,690
executives don't bother with planning

00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:30,520
right how do you measure productivity

00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:37,720
well there are lots of ways to do this

00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:40,539
and again I keep it pretty simple so the

00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:43,060
average c developer to take a see

00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:47,919
developer for example delivers four

00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:50,500
thousand lines of code a year so the

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:54,250
average developer should deliver 100

00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,840
lines of code a week so that's it they

00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:58,659
sit at their desks till they've written

00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:02,560
100 lines of code done and it delivers

00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:05,770
our executives love these charts they

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:09,039
keep going up right I can do a plan and

00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:11,130
an actual and it keeps going up so it's

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:20,530
the best way to measure development

00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:22,599
productivity software testing well it's

00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:27,810
a nice idea that you know there's no

00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:30,490
point and you don't you know why well I

00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,840
mean from my point of view it gets in

00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,389
the way of your delivery targets so

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,520
that's not good but to really understand

00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:37,990
why there is no point you have to

00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:42,310
understand a little bit about our

00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:45,250
corporate strategy our corporate

00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:48,789
strategy ensures that we put our first

00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:51,219
line product support and we deliver

00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:54,789
large products our first line product

00:05:51,219 --> 00:05:58,029
support is based in cheap country of the

00:05:54,789 --> 00:06:00,069
year cheap country of the year gets the

00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:02,349
mission to support all our products at

00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:04,029
the beginning of the air after six

00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:06,759
months they can handle the have you

00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:09,430
turned it on yet kind of problem the

00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:11,620
chances of any customer actually being

00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:15,130
able to report a bug which gets through

00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:17,080
to us a zip at the end of the year we

00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,550
move product support to the next cheap

00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,310
country of the year because it's cheaper

00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:24,870
than the last one don't worry about

00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,870
software testing no point

00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:33,030
okay let's talk a bit about programming

00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:34,740
languages well the good news is for

00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:36,599
enterprise software delivery there is

00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,840
only one right programming language and

00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:43,680
it's java it's java because it takes

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:47,310
this many lines to open a file and read

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,400
it and if you do it in PHP it takes this

00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:57,180
many lines this helps with our delivery

00:06:50,400 --> 00:07:02,930
targets it also it also it helped to

00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:06,029
deliver serious weighty enterprise-e

00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:08,550
software people feel comfortable when

00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:12,180
they get something that's big and you

00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:14,099
get something that's big with Java of

00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,919
course if you PHP guys want to be taken

00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:21,620
seriously you can write Java PHP that

00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:21,620
looks like Java and well I recommend it

00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:31,740
okay let's go back to another personal

00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:35,460
subject feedback everybody needs

00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:39,120
feedback and you know what the two most

00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:43,469
important things are about feedback it

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:47,029
needs to be timely and accurate so I

00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:50,849
have this completely nailed timely

00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:52,770
timely once a year right same time every

00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:56,969
year everybody knows when they're going

00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:59,039
to get their feedback accurate well it's

00:07:56,969 --> 00:08:02,039
easy I have my lines of code they've

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:04,589
delivered in a spreadsheet i divided the

00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:06,539
team into three because I have to I have

00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:07,680
a quota i get i get a quote or of people

00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:10,080
i have to tell they're not performing

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:14,490
too so i have i divide my team into

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:17,069
three I tell the top third that they're

00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:19,710
doing okay you know keep delivering

00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:23,279
you're doing fine I tell the next third

00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:26,009
that um they need to work harder more

00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:28,800
lines of code not going home till you've

00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:30,300
done more lines of code and I told that

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,159
the bottom third they'll just be fired

00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,209
if they don't perform better and we'll

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,459
put them on a performance improvement

00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:37,880
plan and they find that exceedingly

00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:40,710
motivating

00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:43,590
yep it's a really good strategy for a

00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:45,420
happy team also if you can arrange your

00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,920
annual feedback to just after Christmas

00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:54,420
then it wrecks their Christmas worrying

00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:59,070
about it we do that education now I am a

00:08:54,420 --> 00:09:02,070
huge fan of Education huge I work for

00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:06,090
the team that employs graduate

00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:11,940
developers we only employ educated

00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:13,170
developers when I hire them I talk to

00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,110
them about whether they've done some

00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:18,680
partying I really only employ people

00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:21,020
have got partying out of their system

00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,400
because when they join our company

00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:26,700
they're not going to get any more

00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:30,410
education or any more partying so I have

00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:32,880
to make sure that they are pre educated

00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:35,430
they do of course they try and tell me

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,800
that they want to go to conferences now

00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:39,240
of course I know the conference is just

00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,730
an excuse for another piss up with your

00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,410
friends so there is absolutely no way I

00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:49,410
would ever send my developers to a

00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:51,450
conference crazy but I wouldn't want you

00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:54,510
to think we don't have a technical

00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:56,640
career path we do we have an excellent

00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,880
technical career path to progress in our

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:03,060
company you do not have to be a manager

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,950
so in our technical career path we do of

00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:08,430
course give people the education that

00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:11,070
they need now we need our technical

00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:13,800
career path to grow chief technology

00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:16,320
officer 'he's in our organization home

00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:19,800
we have a chief technology officer in

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:24,320
each and department and they are the

00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:28,260
sort of 400 pound gorilla of technology

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,060
the reason we need these guys is because

00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,860
when it comes to getting funding they

00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:35,670
need to fight it out with the other

00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:37,950
chief technology officer so we really

00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:40,920
need these guys to be pretty well you

00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:43,770
know pretty good pretty pretty beefy to

00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:47,780
fight the other guys their weapon of

00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:47,780
choice for these fights is

00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:55,690
powerpoint so we give intensive

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,840
powerpoint training all the way through

00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:01,090
our technical career path by the time

00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:03,430
you get to this end of it you can talk

00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:07,000
for 10 hours without hesitation

00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:10,000
repetition or deviation you can do 10

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,350
bullet points per chart with a size 12

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,450
font it's perfect and it's very good for

00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,190
customers as well if you have a bad

00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:23,980
customer you put one of these guys in

00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:26,200
front of them they are invaluable so

00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:29,170
let's talk about software law for a bit

00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:31,350
how it's the bane of a you know the bane

00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:34,870
of the enterprise developers problem

00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:38,380
well basically I i divide developers

00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:40,960
into three for this as well i'm not sure

00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:43,330
i don't mind a people copy code why

00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,130
would I long as it you know contributes

00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:47,410
towards I develop and targets I don't

00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:49,630
care where they copy it from the good

00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:53,220
ones if they find any kind of nonsense

00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:55,600
about licenses in just cross it out

00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,720
right I don't want any of this in

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,980
my code repository so copy it get rid of

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:07,150
the licenses that's my best developer

00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:12,340
right my second best developer is not

00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:13,780
quite so smart they cut they sorry the

00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:16,270
first best developer gets rid of the

00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:19,540
comments the second one leave comments

00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:21,100
in there now I don't mind people

00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,060
commenting their own code you know if

00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,630
they want to do it in their own time

00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,630
that's fine

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,410
copying other people's comments is

00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:33,120
stupid now I don't know I don't know how

00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:36,029
many of you've been involved in I am

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,040
sort of legal assessments of code but if

00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:39,689
you take a lawyer and you get them to go

00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,220
through code to figure out whether it's

00:12:39,689 --> 00:12:43,079
been copied on what they don't look at

00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,149
the code look at the comments they look

00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:47,310
for the spelling mistakes basically a

00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:49,500
spelling mistake is the best identifier

00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:52,920
of copied code so my second best

00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:56,009
developer forgets to remove these my

00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:59,430
third developer my least favorite my

00:12:56,009 --> 00:13:02,370
least favorite developer goes to the

00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:07,290
company lawyer and says can I copy this

00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:10,769
code no don't do it it's just it's more

00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:13,139
process for me for everybody for you

00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:15,779
it's a waste of time so the best thing

00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:22,110
to do copy anything you want remove for

00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:24,029
licenses in the comments you're good now

00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:27,899
i feel i ought to say something about

00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:31,050
diversity and if you hadn't guessed i i

00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:33,990
i am a cat herder i heard cats-- for a

00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:37,939
living I'm very good at it I don't care

00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:41,759
whether they're black cats brown cats

00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:47,720
tabby cats there you all heard pretty

00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:47,720
much the same but I have a new problem

00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:58,550
somebody in our HR department has

00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:04,709
recently told me that I have a quota

00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:08,220
which I have to fill of Lady Cats I need

00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:10,980
a lady cat on my development team have

00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:13,839
you seen what boy cats do when you put a

00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:18,470
lady cat in with them

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:23,779
this is absolutely insane but I have a

00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:27,230
solution I promote the Lady Cats to

00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:30,589
management positions in fact some of our

00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:38,990
best executives are lady cats and my

00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:43,520
problem is solved okay this is almost

00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:46,580
the last slide I work for IBM for 24

00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:48,200
years some of that was based on IBM but

00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:51,350
quite a lot of it wasn't some of it was

00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:53,180
based on a big company big companies

00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,890
that i visited while i work for IBM and

00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,930
i'm talking to other developers so don't

00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:59,800
don't go away from this talk thinking

00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:05,149
that IBM is somewhere you'd never work

00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:07,760
also I every point on that slide had

00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:10,970
some grain of truth in it wildly

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:13,339
exaggerated in some cases and only one

00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:19,870
slide was absolutely one hundred percent

00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:23,779
tree with no no twisting by me and I

00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:26,630
wanted to talk about it because I think

00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:29,380
managing developers is one of the

00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:34,190
biggest problems that our industry has I

00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:36,860
think it's not we don't understand that

00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:39,260
or our managers don't understand that

00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:41,209
this is a creative profession you need

00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:43,399
to treat people who are creating things

00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:45,500
differently from the way you treat the

00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:47,240
production line and many of the things

00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:50,060
that I've seen go wrong because people

00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,230
are being treated creative people are

00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,149
being treated as though they worked on

00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:56,329
production line and I think it's a huge

00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:58,279
problem for the delivery of reasonable

00:15:56,329 --> 00:16:02,600
decent quality code which is what we

00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:06,500
really want to do in the end so I have

00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:11,990
one wrap up slide which is I'm being

00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:14,630
kind of serious now and I don't know

00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:17,360
whether anyone was reading slashdot or

00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:21,680
their ridiculous rags over the past few

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:25,550
weeks but there was a patent filed by

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:27,080
IBM in June this year on the automatic

00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:29,270
automated analysis

00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,430
of a code developers profile now the

00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:32,930
idea of this patent is that you take a

00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:35,840
lot of tools and you look through your

00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:38,930
get repository or subversion and you

00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:42,290
make assessments at how well a developer

00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:46,670
is doing based on on this this is just

00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:49,580
the worst idea I have ever heard every I

00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:52,400
mean even on / shop retweeted this is a

00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:54,950
terrible idea it is a terrible idea I

00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,840
hope the only good thing that comes out

00:16:54,950 --> 00:17:02,500
of IBM patenting it is that nobody ever

00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:05,209
uses it um but what was what was mainly

00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,920
misunderstood in the reporting of this

00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:09,640
was it was treated as though it came

00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:13,670
from IBM management it actually doesn't

00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:16,220
the two guys who did this our engineers

00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:20,630
and they're quite they're not very

00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:22,880
senior engineers and and if you look at

00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:25,250
it from their point of view IBM

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,620
encourages patents encourages people to

00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:30,260
pattern things so you get brownie points

00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:32,150
for patents and they suddenly realize

00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:34,910
there's a whole bunch of data here that

00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:37,010
they can analyze and play with and I'm

00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:38,720
an engineer if somebody gives me a bunch

00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:41,060
of data and i can analyze it and play

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:44,180
with it and pattern something I'll do it

00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:49,430
I'm not thinking about what a

00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:52,400
stupid idea it's so what it comes back

00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:57,290
to is is really all of us me especially

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:59,480
I'm an engineer first I should really

00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:03,110
never have been a manager I was a

00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:05,720
manager for six years and in all honesty

00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:07,340
I knew right at the beginning that I'm

00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:10,700
interested in solving engineering

00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:15,020
problems people are not my primary

00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:18,050
interest so the best thing you can all

00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:22,780
do if somebody offers you a manager a

00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:26,180
job as a manager is sit down and think

00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:27,650
do you really care enough about people

00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,120
because they if you're a manager if

00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:31,700
you're going to be a good manager they

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,740
have to be your primary interest getting

00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,900
the best out of every single individual

00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:39,950
it works for you whether you like them

00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:42,289
or not has to be your focus if

00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:44,269
you know it's not going to be turned

00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:50,120
down that job because it's not right for

00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:53,929
you and the other thing I suppose is

00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:56,210
that if you if you are in a situation

00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:58,789
where you see terrible management you

00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:00,380
can do what I suppose I spent most of my

00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:04,720
time during which is to try and change

00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:08,120
it that works but it's bloody hard work

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:10,669
changing these practices is is difficult

00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,649
and in fact I've what I observed is that

00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:14,330
some of the senior technical staff were

00:19:12,649 --> 00:19:17,149
actually better at changing the

00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:20,929
practices than the managers trying to

00:19:17,149 --> 00:19:22,340
change it whilst being a manager and of

00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:23,870
course the other thing you can do is if

00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,340
you stuck in stop with one of these

00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:27,380
situations where you've got terrible

00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:29,120
management is you can leave because the

00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:32,929
more I look round the more there are

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:36,110
plenty of companies usually the smaller

00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:40,610
ones have to say that understand how to

00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:43,000
manage people properly okay that's all I

00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:43,000
had to say

00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:54,670
oh yeah anybody's got any questions um

00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:57,309
thank you very much for that uh guys any

00:19:54,670 --> 00:20:01,900
questions any anything to say don't

00:19:57,309 --> 00:20:03,400
matter how do you deal with corporate

00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:06,520
politics and how do you actually ask

00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:08,470
circumvent masquerading some of the

00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:14,530
problems you might necessarily have from

00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:19,240
from them how did I deal with it not

00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:21,490
terribly effectively much I am so I I

00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:24,250
had two strategies of dealing with it if

00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:25,720
something was so bad that I couldn't go

00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:28,210
on colluding with it well I was a

00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:30,130
manager I stopped by resigned so I did

00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:31,990
that I had a job where I thought the

00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:33,940
practice was so bad I resigned from a

00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:36,309
management position said now go back to

00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:39,730
doing technical job that a more

00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:42,940
effective way to do it is decide what

00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:45,670
you want done and find a good executive

00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:48,100
sponsor and get them to help you make

00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:49,900
that change and that that was that's

00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,550
really the best strategy because you

00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,830
have to find the good executive sponsor

00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:59,670
first and that's oh it's not always that

00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:59,670
easy anyone else

00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:09,190
from your big company experience what

00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:13,320
are the main things that you've brought

00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:13,320
into your tiny company experience now I

00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:29,559
give myself a talking to every morning

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:33,610
and basically nothing and I I was

00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:36,730
thinking about the the things I most

00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:40,960
miss about a big company or i miss the

00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:43,270
teamwork and so I and the things I most

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:46,030
love other I wake up every morning and

00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:50,710
think what shall I do today write some

00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:52,420
more code I'm so and you gradually you

00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,950
replace the teamwork by doing things

00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,090
like this so being part of the

00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:58,120
organizing committee for this

00:21:55,090 --> 00:22:02,080
conferences as part of my a team and

00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:05,920
I've got other teams but I don't you

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:08,740
know there's nothing much that I would

00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:13,840
wish to carry on from my large corporate

00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:16,030
career into my tiny corporate great I'm

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:19,540
a manager here what's the best way to

00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:22,080
avoid becoming a phb and keep myself

00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,080
honest

00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:38,020
the best way to avoid becoming a pointy

00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:41,050
haired loss I would say get some

00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:43,780
training I did a no you degree in

00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:45,670
professional management when I first got

00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:49,540
appointed as a manager because I thought

00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:52,090
it would help and it did help a lot to

00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:53,740
coat them to teach me how to cope with

00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:57,670
some of the things that I haven't come

00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:59,320
across before and so I think getting

00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:00,940
professional management training

00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:10,930
especially if all you've ever done is

00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:12,880
engineering is is a good plan no in my

00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:16,060
experience big companies promote to

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,500
management from there in in development

00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:19,420
and i'm really only talking about

00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,420
development promote from the development

00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:23,830
ranks and now you oh god no it's not

00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:28,450
fair to see you don't get any training

00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:30,370
you get some training and but it is

00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:33,670
training on how to implement the

00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:39,190
company's management policies it's not

00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:41,380
really that's that's not it's just not

00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:43,090
useful you need training on I mean the

00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:46,330
kind of thing we did on the AU course

00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:49,420
was understanding different sorts of

00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:51,310
motivation factors and you know trying

00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:54,360
to understand how people get motivated

00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:57,040
and that it's not carrots and sticks and

00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:59,320
so

00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:02,100
I was a bit slow in getting the joke on

00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:05,110
the backlog grooming but I was wondering

00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:08,830
what strategies have you used to

00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:11,440
encourage bringing scrum into a large

00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:17,080
corporation because they do sort of

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:21,070
think that is quite weird okay well and

00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:24,580
actually in my last two teams at IBM we

00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:27,820
used a sort of corporate agile process

00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:33,520
I'm about as close as you can get to

00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:36,970
agile in a big company and I wasn't a

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:39,130
manager then and the people that

00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:42,820
introduced that process with senior

00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:45,910
technical people and they they just did

00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:47,710
it by persuading the the company that

00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:49,360
was the right thing to do so you need I

00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:50,980
mean you need good senior technical

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,760
people who are going to go and explain

00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:56,830
and it's a really you know you need to

00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:59,140
explain a very senior technical level

00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:01,030
what you're doing is the right thing and

00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:04,150
it takes takes a while to get through

00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:06,250
but it is just having having those as

00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:09,160
kind of in your organization you need to

00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:11,140
sort of you need an evangelist to move

00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:13,540
things forward and they will take senior

00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:16,210
technical people by the way the

00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:19,240
development teams also were pretty

00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:21,100
skeptical about agile at the time that

00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,200
we introduced it so you also need the

00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:25,540
evangelists to pull those teams into

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:30,250
line and try and explain how it works

00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:32,860
White's benefit and even then in a big

00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:34,840
company it's very difficult because you

00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:38,860
still have the executive at the top that

00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:40,570
wants the progress towards the delivery

00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:47,520
goal in you so you have to have some

00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:47,520
kind of adapter in between yeah

00:25:48,149 --> 00:25:54,129
estrin sneaking in can a non-technical

00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:59,799
person ever be a good manager or a

00:25:54,129 --> 00:26:01,569
technical team yes if you want an

00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:03,849
example of that I'll give you a

00:26:01,569 --> 00:26:07,869
brilliant one does anybody work with a

00:26:03,849 --> 00:26:10,179
london java community no probably not ok

00:26:07,869 --> 00:26:12,249
let me just let me just tell you the

00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:16,929
london java community is run by a guy

00:26:12,249 --> 00:26:18,609
called Barry cranford he has about 2,000

00:26:16,929 --> 00:26:22,539
people signed up over the last couple of

00:26:18,609 --> 00:26:24,279
years Barry is a recruiter he is the

00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:27,939
most non technical person you've ever

00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:29,799
met but he got around him a group of

00:26:27,939 --> 00:26:32,079
technical people and he managed that

00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:33,579
technical team to create one of the

00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:35,889
biggest and most successful Java

00:26:33,579 --> 00:26:38,469
communities so there is somebody holy

00:26:35,889 --> 00:26:42,849
non-technical managing a very technical

00:26:38,469 --> 00:26:44,829
community it's not a software

00:26:42,849 --> 00:26:47,109
development project but they are doing

00:26:44,829 --> 00:26:50,379
things like you know they're working

00:26:47,109 --> 00:26:53,709
with Oracle on the JCP on JCP stuff and

00:26:50,379 --> 00:26:58,509
burry is overseeing that and providing

00:26:53,709 --> 00:27:00,939
and be providing helps of facilities to

00:26:58,509 --> 00:27:02,859
do things but it is a case of a

00:27:00,939 --> 00:27:05,859
completely non technical person doing

00:27:02,859 --> 00:27:08,669
something brilliant by managing a

00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:08,669
technical community

00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:23,190
a really good manager will assemble

00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:29,040
around them technical people that they

00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:30,690
trust that can explain to them in in a

00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,490
way that they can then explain it to

00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:35,490
other managers and senior executives

00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:39,570
what the status of deliveries are its

00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:42,750
own you don't have to be technical to

00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:44,610
manage a team well you have to have

00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:55,710
people you can trust and that will trust

00:27:44,610 --> 00:28:01,350
you it's all of those kind of who went

00:27:55,710 --> 00:28:04,590
to Eunice talk right not enough of you

00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:08,780
it's all of it the left think it's the

00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:12,560
left brain qualities the intuition and

00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:15,390
understanding how people work it's it's

00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:17,640
that kind of quality I think that

00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:20,970
exactly the wrong sort of person to be a

00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:22,590
manager is somebody who well I mean

00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:25,550
somebody like me who spent their life

00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:28,380
looking at data and algorithms and

00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:30,210
because you can't you can't your brain

00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:33,240
is hooked into that you can't take it

00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:35,010
away and if you try and apply that sort

00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:38,240
of stuff to managing people it's and

00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:40,920
work you get you get very unhappy teams

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,030
have you managed to work with good

00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,870
technical people who've made a

00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:48,780
transition into becoming a good manager

00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:51,900
where did that question come from yes

00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:54,570
yes I mean I'm making generalizations

00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:58,820
but there are good technical people who

00:28:54,570 --> 00:29:03,150
have become good managers and it's just

00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:05,580
not the majority it's a minority so any

00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:07,860
particular skills or processes they go

00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:09,720
through to get to that point no I think

00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:12,660
they just have those personnel skills

00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:15,600
before they start and and they happen to

00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:18,900
have the people skills and be good at

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,820
the technical stuff as well but they're

00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,119
not like me obsessed with the technical

00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:26,969
stuff you know they

00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:26,969
and they use both sides effectively I

00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:35,259
just I have to say I recognize myself

00:29:32,949 --> 00:29:37,449
when you say people who spend their

00:29:35,259 --> 00:29:41,679
lives they can get data and and have

00:29:37,449 --> 00:29:44,739
then tried to become managers but we has

00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:47,019
certainly have projects where the actual

00:29:44,739 --> 00:29:49,929
process of creation creating the product

00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:51,339
is an incredibly creative one and what I

00:29:49,929 --> 00:29:53,799
found quite interesting is when you were

00:29:51,339 --> 00:29:56,439
saying about the need for people to have

00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:59,379
the freedom to be creative what do you

00:29:56,439 --> 00:30:01,539
do when a products which had a very

00:29:59,379 --> 00:30:03,369
creative gestation then becomes a mature

00:30:01,539 --> 00:30:05,139
life product that then requires people

00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:07,239
to turn into a production lines just

00:30:05,139 --> 00:30:10,569
keep it going and maintain it and

00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:14,289
support it and well that's a difficult

00:30:10,569 --> 00:30:16,209
problem and it's it's I don't know that

00:30:14,289 --> 00:30:20,609
I really have a good answer for that I

00:30:16,209 --> 00:30:22,719
mean you just because you're not in the

00:30:20,609 --> 00:30:25,749
difficulty you're supporting a product I

00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:27,849
work with teams in IBM I mean iBM has

00:30:25,749 --> 00:30:30,759
been received support problems and it's

00:30:27,849 --> 00:30:33,279
very dull but I have worked with good

00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:36,159
well motivated teams that are doing what

00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:37,989
you might think is a very dull job but

00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,989
they have good managers on it they end

00:30:37,989 --> 00:30:43,479
up being happy doing it so it comes back

00:30:40,989 --> 00:30:45,339
to this thing of a good manager will

00:30:43,479 --> 00:30:49,209
motivate a team no matter how dull the

00:30:45,339 --> 00:30:53,199
job is and that's that's really good

00:30:49,209 --> 00:30:55,179
trick you can do it but I know you're a

00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:58,919
good manager because like somebody gave

00:30:55,179 --> 00:30:58,919
me quite a good reference for you so

00:30:58,979 --> 00:31:02,859
I've come it from the other for both

00:31:01,479 --> 00:31:04,149
sides I've been the technical lead who

00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:05,889
was promoted to the manager I've also

00:31:04,149 --> 00:31:09,279
been the upper management who's gone to

00:31:05,889 --> 00:31:11,589
the to the cat farm and try to manage

00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:13,659
them if you're serious about becoming a

00:31:11,589 --> 00:31:15,189
manager you don't know how to argue and

00:31:13,659 --> 00:31:16,959
you don't know how to negotiate the

00:31:15,189 --> 00:31:18,819
corporate level you have to go take

00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:20,859
classes they'll call them business

00:31:18,819 --> 00:31:22,989
organizations and local negotiation

00:31:20,859 --> 00:31:25,239
skills but if you're a technical person

00:31:22,989 --> 00:31:27,369
you're going from a position we're even

00:31:25,239 --> 00:31:29,709
playing fish to playing bridge and you

00:31:27,369 --> 00:31:31,539
really need to have good classes at both

00:31:29,709 --> 00:31:33,369
those otherwise you will be slaughtered

00:31:31,539 --> 00:31:35,190
and you won't know what happened until

00:31:33,369 --> 00:31:38,980
you're out on the street

00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:41,410
it's education again get get somebody to

00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:45,190
teach you what to do because it's not

00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:47,650
intuitive I really very much believe

00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:50,110
that you can have a good manager at a

00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:52,570
bad company and that you can have a good

00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:55,000
company with bad managers inside it and

00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:58,060
when I tend to try to do is really look

00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:01,720
for ideally look for both so my question

00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:07,030
for you as des developers how can we

00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:11,530
kind of find out how to look for those

00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:14,560
situate the good managers as an employee

00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:16,240
which people don't often it's kind of

00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:18,550
reversing the typically I think are you

00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,590
saying as a developer how do you find

00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:23,620
somebody who's good to work for yeah I'm

00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:25,690
like as if you're a developer and you

00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:27,610
you want you want to be happy in your

00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:28,960
job and you and your good and you want

00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:30,970
to find a good situation with a good

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,340
manager at a good company so what kinds

00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:36,310
of things i think that good developers

00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:38,950
should be weeding out should be looking

00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:40,000
for the good managers not like his

00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:43,360
usually think about the other way and

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,730
hiring like yes suki na ok so don't know

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:49,570
i don't have a really good answer i mean

00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:53,050
what i did in IBM was moved jobs every

00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:54,880
three years and and I did I spent a bit

00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:57,250
of time before I moved job looking

00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:01,510
around at the organization and looking

00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:03,040
at the person and it kind of trying to

00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:05,250
figure out whether somebody is a good

00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:14,770
manager when they're interviewing you

00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:17,410
quite hard you know its own yeah I got

00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:21,310
in the end I might have been I mean I

00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:24,010
guess there are different sorts of

00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:25,990
people I always knew exactly what I

00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:27,850
wanted to do and I was going to do it I

00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:32,170
didn't matter what my mom she did I was

00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:34,530
going to do it so I didn't need much

00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:38,509
guidance I didn't need much motivating I

00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:40,579
just you know I just get on

00:33:38,509 --> 00:33:48,619
so in a way it was a little less

00:33:40,579 --> 00:33:51,349
important for me yes yes the worst

00:33:48,619 --> 00:33:54,229
manage the absolute worst manager ever

00:33:51,349 --> 00:33:59,959
had was somebody who managed me

00:33:54,229 --> 00:34:06,079
micromanage me remotely by phone awful

00:33:59,959 --> 00:34:09,049
awful experience oh yeah I've got a bit

00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:10,700
of an answer for that the from my

00:34:09,049 --> 00:34:11,929
experience of being interviewed and

00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:14,960
something I've tried to take into

00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:18,349
interviewing if if the manager at

00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:21,829
interview stage takes an interest in you

00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:24,319
personally it's a good sign if they seem

00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:27,079
more interested in whether you're

00:34:24,319 --> 00:34:29,659
filling the requirements of the job then

00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:30,799
and they don't take any interest in you

00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:42,919
personally whether you're going to be

00:34:30,799 --> 00:34:44,419
happy in that job that's a bad sign well

00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:46,039
just gonna say and also reference

00:34:44,419 --> 00:34:47,929
tracking you know if you're speaking to

00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:49,279
different people talk to people who

00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:52,159
maybe have worked for them before and

00:34:49,279 --> 00:34:57,109
see you know ask some questions the same

00:34:52,159 --> 00:35:00,940
kind of things that matter to you any of

00:34:57,109 --> 00:35:00,940
further questions yes

00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:12,920
hi and when people do gave we've had the

00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,930
debate of whether you should be a

00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:17,150
manager you should go down that path but

00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:21,080
if you do take the step of going from

00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:22,430
developer to manager one pitfall I think

00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,470
is that you can end up doing your old

00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:26,060
job still and you can be a developer

00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:27,950
yeah and that conflict when you have

00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:31,370
these sort of advice on how to avoid

00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:35,240
that and yet just stop it don't do it

00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:37,550
take take take two weeks break a month

00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:41,120
break between jobs and don't even

00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:44,060
attempt to do it also a good principle

00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:45,440
any job you're doing is to line up your

00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:47,120
successor because you're not going to

00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,850
want to do it forever so in fact that's

00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:54,380
a good general principle for every job

00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:56,840
that I've done I start in it for a year

00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:58,340
do it for a year and then the third year

00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:01,460
I am trying to find somebody to replace

00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:03,130
me so that at the end of that year I can

00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:06,020
go on and do something else and that's

00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:07,550
always been that's just a pattern that I

00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,960
figured out I figured out was going to

00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:15,410
want to change every three years so

00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:19,460
figured that out yes would you say with

00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:22,160
agile and scrum it's working well it's

00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:24,650
you get less problems with managing

00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:29,030
teams I mean the team itself is a bit

00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:30,950
more self motivated in organization you

00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:33,890
have less problems with bad managers so

00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:36,170
my experience of agile is that the

00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:38,930
biggest thing that it does is make

00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:42,620
people feel responsible for what they're

00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:45,410
doing and that is that's really what you

00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:46,640
want if you a good team everybody knows

00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:47,780
what their job is and they feel

00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,610
responsible for it and they're

00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:51,650
delivering in that to me that was the

00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:54,050
biggest change that I saw between the

00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:56,210
waterfall processes and when we started

00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:59,180
introducing agile processes and it made

00:36:56,210 --> 00:37:04,279
a huge difference really I'm it's if

00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:07,529
it's worth doing for that alone yeah

00:37:04,279 --> 00:37:10,289
yeah I've been developing for about 10

00:37:07,529 --> 00:37:12,719
years mostly in PHP but a lot of my

00:37:10,289 --> 00:37:14,549
experiences are not being managed

00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:16,619
properly particularly and I'm very lucky

00:37:14,549 --> 00:37:18,959
now to actually work in a very very good

00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:20,609
environment for a good boss but um one

00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:24,239
of the great successes that we've done

00:37:20,609 --> 00:37:27,029
is pair programs yeah and it's a huge

00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:28,440
benefit not only for things like blaming

00:37:27,029 --> 00:37:30,509
you know there's no blame because two

00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,940
people doing the problem and all the

00:37:30,509 --> 00:37:34,529
rest of it but I found that really

00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:35,849
motivating and that's more of a

00:37:34,529 --> 00:37:45,420
statement sorry guys it was really a

00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:49,920
question but just to share that any

00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:52,910
further ones okay um thanks again so

00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,910
