The beauty of PHP is that everybody can read the code and see the inner workings of software. But understanding concepts from reading code isn't often helpful, especially if you are not proficient in that language.

This presentation will take apart many parts of the PHP runtime, describe the concepts behind so attendees understand the inner workings without actually reading C code. Concepts covered include HashTables, the foundation for PHP arrays and many other internal data structures, the reference counting mechanism, which is important for writing efficient code as well as the overall executor.
