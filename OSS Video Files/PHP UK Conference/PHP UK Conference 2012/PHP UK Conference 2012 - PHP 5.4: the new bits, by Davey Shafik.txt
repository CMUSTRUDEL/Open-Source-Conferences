PHP 5.4 is about to be unleashed into the world; bringing some of the most exciting changes to the PHP language to date. Learn about traits, array dereferencing, indirect method calls using array callback syntax and improvements to closures and streams.

Additionally, we'll go back over the new bits in PHP 5.3, in case you missed them! Namespaces, closures and PHAR, oh my!
