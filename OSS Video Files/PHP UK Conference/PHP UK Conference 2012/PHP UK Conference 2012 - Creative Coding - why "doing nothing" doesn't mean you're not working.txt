Title: PHP UK Conference 2012 - Creative Coding - why "doing nothing" doesn't mean you're not working
Publication date: 2012-03-12
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2012
Description: 
	http://www.phpconference.co.uk/talk/creative-coding

As programmers we create the most fantastic systems and constructions out of nothing, and there are endless possibilities in achieving this. Yet we are still confided by the structure and rules of the language we use, which makes programming an exciting profession to be in: in the cross fire of creativeness and boundaries. Our most important tool, no, not Vim, but the brain, can handle this perfectly well. Unfortunately, and much like the rest of the world, there is a clear focus on logic, rationality, and knowledge of the parts. An expert coder is also intuitive, creative, and remembers to include the whole picture.

This talk covers the creative process, our dual CPU-brain and the cognitive skills needed for successful programming. As an added bonus we will also investigate why doing nothing does not mean you are not working.

June Henriksen is an Oslo-based system developer at Redpill Linpro with a particular interest in web development and PHP. She has a passion for free and open source software, and holds a Masters degree in Computer Science from the University of TromsÃ¸ and Lancaster University. June also has a healthy interest in cognitive skills and the workings of the mind.

	00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:15,830
thank you so I'll just start my timer

00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:17,779
good afternoon ladies and gentlemen I

00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:20,630
hope you had a nice lunch and they're

00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:25,190
all ready for the next talk yeah not

00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:27,470
doing is allowed yes mmm um so my name

00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:30,500
is you know henriksen i am from norway

00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:34,250
and i work for a company called red pill

00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:36,970
in pro and despite the logo containing a

00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:39,739
pill we're not a pharmacy or

00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:44,480
pharmaceutical we are a consultancy

00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:47,030
company and we work with open source

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,479
software for the most part we do a lot

00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:53,989
of sysadmin hosting and development

00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:57,559
courses that sort of thing the whole

00:00:53,989 --> 00:01:00,260
jack I'm you today goose i would like to

00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:03,440
talk to you about something called

00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:07,820
creative coding when I say creative

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:10,060
coding I don't mean end products I will

00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,950
be talking about how the brain works

00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:15,500
when you are programming because I think

00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:18,229
it's very interesting and also that it

00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,990
is really important because it is your

00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:23,960
most important tool it's not emacs it is

00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:27,530
not like it is not whatever is you

00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:30,049
prefer to use it is your head hmm and I

00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:33,310
like to know how things work and I guess

00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:37,670
so you do too right mmm nothing Oh

00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:43,490
excellent okay so you can all hear me

00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:46,729
just fine right yeah okay so this is a

00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:49,009
quote I like which is from the mystical

00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:53,210
man months which you probably have heard

00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:54,939
of I would just like to say a little bit

00:01:53,210 --> 00:02:01,249
but why I got interested in the subject

00:01:54,939 --> 00:02:05,030
because I have them I like talking about

00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:08,360
or talking with people who are getting

00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:10,280
into the profession trying to get people

00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:14,120
to work with programming as well and i

00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:17,540
was reading an article about a woman who

00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,519
was being asked about her career choices

00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,379
and upon us whether or not she would

00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:24,109
become a program and she said it sounds

00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:25,939
like it could be fun but I'd prefer to

00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:29,599
do something that has to do with people

00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:32,959
or something that is creative and to

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:35,659
that my responses okay people great i

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,640
get that we do not work that much with

00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:42,140
people Lee's not as much as we've

00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:45,200
teacher would or a nurse but that is not

00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:48,739
creative that's just wrong it's not true

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:53,750
I mean how how can it be we are creating

00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:57,079
something out of nothing right yeah ok

00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:59,540
so if before i'll be talking about first

00:02:57,079 --> 00:03:01,400
we're going to go through we're going to

00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:04,099
have a bit of basic information a little

00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:07,879
bit background mm-hmm then i'm going to

00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:11,000
talk about how the brain works yeah left

00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:12,470
side right side the process that we have

00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,019
in your head cognitive skills start

00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:17,480
sorting and then we're going to get into

00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:19,909
why should you care is there something

00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,879
in programming that is doing this

00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:29,000
already hmm and then I'll just do it a

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:31,849
bit of summary yeah excellent okay so

00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,819
what is creativity the definition as we

00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:38,239
understand it today is that is something

00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:41,629
new that has value where new varies i

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:46,159
saw this value it could be quite

00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:47,239
confusing but if you didn't think it you

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,459
probably wouldn't say that you are

00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:51,109
created right but you actually are at

00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:53,239
least from this definition because

00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:55,359
creativity is kind of problem solving

00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:59,900
really it's a way of solving a problem

00:03:55,359 --> 00:04:01,939
so this example here is one domain this

00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,790
is you whenever you have a problem and

00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:09,049
you're trying to solve it and you can't

00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:11,689
find the solution by googling it then

00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:13,879
you have to think about that's creative

00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:16,370
process if you find an answer at you

00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:18,849
when googling it or asking a friend this

00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:23,270
is application that is not creativity

00:04:18,849 --> 00:04:24,740
hmm so when you are programming and

00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:28,880
coming up with something new that is a

00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:30,720
value to you then you are being creative

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,970
and this week

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:39,180
agree is the kind of problem solving

00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:42,060
right that is Mike Zuckerberg he

00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:44,190
invented Facebook that was creative it

00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,310
was something new in that domain I mean

00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:51,330
we've had that kind of service before we

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:53,130
have but it was new in that domain how

00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,930
it worked so that was being creative

00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:58,890
this is probably the more traditional

00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:00,330
sense that were used to thinking about

00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:04,200
when we are talking about creativity

00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:07,050
this is thomas edison right so when he

00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,150
and went to the light bulb that was

00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:16,170
something new that was a huge value to

00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:22,800
the entire world mm-hmm everyone with me

00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:26,340
so far so I mentioned this is the way

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:30,450
creativity is understood today it wasn't

00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:33,240
always like this during the Renaissance

00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:36,240
it changed and in the Enlightenment

00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,580
that's how we finally understood how it

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,860
works but before that it was actually

00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,320
thought that we couldn't come up with

00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:46,020
something new if we did it was an act of

00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,090
god is divine being that was sort of

00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:50,040
acting through you and creating

00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:53,100
something new because we as people

00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:56,729
couldn't do it just wasn't didn't work

00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:59,669
that way it was God that did it and it

00:05:56,729 --> 00:06:01,680
would really it was believed that here

00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:04,919
we didn't have an imagination that was

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,690
something that came about during the

00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:12,720
Enlightenment which is really

00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:14,040
interesting at least I think so when we

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,000
were trying to understand how something

00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:21,660
works i like to think about what kind of

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,970
research is there and here we have a

00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:27,120
couple of them creativity is something

00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:30,500
that is interesting for several types of

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,810
fields everything from psychology and

00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:38,419
neuropsychology to education and also

00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:42,030
economy creative economy imagine that

00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:43,910
and this is one of the fields that I

00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:48,960
think is quite interesting

00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:52,229
it's creativity and intelligence is this

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:55,680
related somehow we don't really know but

00:06:52,229 --> 00:07:03,150
because brain studying the brain is thin

00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:06,539
so it's really hard but on because it's

00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:10,229
hard there are several camps right one

00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:19,710
of those camps believe that it is

00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:23,580
something that is it is different some

00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:25,409
people believe that the reefs or process

00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:28,800
that go on in your head are completely

00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:30,300
different from the process that you have

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,759
in your head when you're doing something

00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,319
when you're solving a problem it's just

00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:36,479
one part of your brain and you're using

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,849
different processes in processes in your

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:42,330
head when you're being creative other

00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:44,610
people feel that they are the same and a

00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:48,800
third camp thinks there is a sort of

00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:52,590
threshold that means creativity and

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:55,620
intelligence is linked if you are

00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:57,900
creative you are also intelligent and

00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:01,860
this goes up to a certain level up to

00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:03,719
about an IQ of 120 and I personally

00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,719
believe that to be true because they

00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:09,479
have a lot of tests on it they've had

00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:14,759
tests on a lot of students and it seemed

00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:17,400
like above 120 in IQ and you choose you

00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:21,539
either get more creative or you get more

00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:27,449
intelligence so another field of study

00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:29,940
is lateralization meaning where in the

00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:31,919
brain is stuff going on when you are

00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,479
thinking about things so when you are

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,070
creative where in the brain does that

00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:37,890
happen is it lateralized does it happen

00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:44,820
in one side of the banner or the other

00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:46,770
or both right also you can become more

00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,779
creative it's not like you start at one

00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:51,480
level and then this is something you're

00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:55,410
born with you can actually work on it

00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:58,560
and become more creative also

00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:01,019
they are studying on how you can use

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,940
creativity to have make people learn

00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:08,300
better use techniques creative

00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:15,029
techniques to to become to learn yes

00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:19,769
alright so that was the basics all right

00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:23,879
now we have 11 the creative process as I

00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:27,720
mentioned it is a way of solving

00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:30,839
problems right these are the different

00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:33,120
stages that you go through when you are

00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:34,800
being creative say you have a problem

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,410
you're sitting right you sitting at your

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:41,189
desk you're solving a bug you can't

00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:42,540
really figure out what it is you've

00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:44,730
tried google you've tried everything

00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,310
can't you don't know what it is you just

00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,930
have to go up and do something else

00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:51,120
being creative it's an asynchronous

00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:53,670
process so you have to do something else

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,250
to find out to have less your brain work

00:09:53,670 --> 00:10:02,130
on it to find its solution this stage is

00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:03,509
called incubation that means when you

00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:06,240
are doing something else your brain

00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:09,509
isn't not thinking about it is it but

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,800
you're not conscious of it when it has

00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:15,750
worked through all of your memories

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:18,750
which we believe it does it will try to

00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:21,779
tell the other read the part of you that

00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:24,240
you saw over well that ok I think I have

00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:27,269
the solution this insight that you're

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,250
going to get that could be a cut

00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:32,089
somewhere completely random or something

00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:35,550
that you feels like it's not related

00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:38,160
like him Einstein he came up with the

00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:40,529
relativity theory in a dream the guy who

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,720
invented the sewing machine he had a

00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:45,000
problem with the head of the needle he

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,519
didn't know how to work it and he saw a

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,709
snail and he was all right that's how

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,899
I'm supposed to solve it because the

00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:55,620
shape of it gave him an idea of how he

00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:57,980
was supposed to solve that problem once

00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:00,360
you get that insight you need to

00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:02,819
verification just to check that it

00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,889
actually works this is just one model of

00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:07,070
how we think it works there are others

00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:09,760
as well

00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:19,460
they usually have one extra step but

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:21,980
these are the basic ones yes so um that

00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:24,260
was the fundamental but kind of a long

00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:29,920
introduction why I hope you are still

00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:29,920
with me and this is how the brain works

00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:36,200
we you're probably aware that you're

00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:38,810
right hemisphere controls the left part

00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,480
of your brain the left part of your body

00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:44,270
and the left hemisphere controls the

00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:47,540
right part of your body during the 60s

00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:50,570
and the 70s there was a lot of and we

00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:53,000
started doing split brain surgery this

00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:55,070
is why we know that worked also someone

00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,980
has a stroke in the the right hemisphere

00:11:55,070 --> 00:12:00,560
you'll see that the left part of the

00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:04,550
body can have some paralyzation so this

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:08,330
we know is true also because of this

00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:11,150
there was a lot of a guessing game going

00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:13,160
on so people thought that because of

00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:15,920
they had a stroke that we would see what

00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,420
was missing right so they would think

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,400
that because they were had a stroke in

00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:21,320
the left hemisphere and then they

00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,480
couldn't speak that means the left

00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,030
hemisphere it is controlling all of

00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,380
speech this is language but we not we

00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:29,630
now know that's not true it's a misnomer

00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,580
it's not like it's not true that the

00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:33,200
right hemisphere controls images it's

00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:38,630
not true that the left hemisphere

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:41,150
controls speech it's not it's the dance

00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:45,220
of neurons sort of that goes on on both

00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:48,530
sides and if you have a stroke you can

00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:50,690
the parts around the brain that could

00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:53,150
learn those functions or the parts in

00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:56,000
the other hemisphere which is similar

00:12:53,150 --> 00:13:00,230
can also take can learn those functions

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,080
you can learn to talk again however

00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:04,910
there are some structures of some

00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,730
control some processes in the brain that

00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:09,140
are lateralized that are on the right

00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:13,970
hemisphere and that are on the left

00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:17,140
hemisphere and that is attention this is

00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:20,930
just a way of

00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:23,120
describing how that works when you are

00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:26,300
trying to understand something you take

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,279
in everything at once you don't look at

00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,990
the little pieces and try to put that

00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:32,180
together to understand it you take it

00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:34,130
all in once you're probably seen on

00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:36,050
facebook you get one of those can you

00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:38,209
see what this is and you look at an

00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:39,920
image it is just nature but if you look

00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:45,320
at it closely suddenly it appears

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:47,360
alright it's a baby in a crook God yeah

00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,820
that's that's the right hemisphere that

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:53,300
so I've get it everything it wants and

00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:55,160
once it does that it will pass that

00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,990
information through the connection it

00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,850
has the back of the brain to the left

00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:01,670
hemisphere and it will choose which part

00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:03,260
is supposed to study and when it has

00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:05,690
dance that when it does that it goes

00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:09,350
back and get a bigger picture so it's a

00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:11,779
sort of them pattern going on big

00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:13,790
picture first then you look at the

00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:16,329
little ones and you go back to the big

00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:20,750
picture again so it's the attention and

00:14:16,329 --> 00:14:26,270
those are lateralized patients that have

00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:29,240
had strokes in the right hemisphere will

00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:31,870
loose the big attention span and because

00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,520
the left brain left part of your brain

00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:37,640
controls the right part they can be

00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:39,470
walking out through a door and focusing

00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,000
on things often on the right and they

00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,680
can't go away from it they just start

00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,750
studying it they can't stop studying it

00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,670
and someone has sort of kicked them or

00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:50,060
get them out of that before they can

00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:52,279
start moving on right love to have one

00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:59,300
of them people just look at what they do

00:14:52,279 --> 00:15:02,750
just to see how it works this is one

00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:05,209
model this is closer to the truth what

00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:10,160
we are going to do is use the dual cpu

00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:13,880
brain this is another model and it's a

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:16,940
metaphor and meaning it's not the truth

00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:21,339
but it works better to understand how

00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:24,980
how the brain works and for our purposes

00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:27,620
so your dual sifu brain instead of

00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:29,740
talking about left side and right side

00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:33,640
we're talking about modes

00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:37,540
the linear mode and the rich mode or CPU

00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:41,830
one and cpu 2 and they have a common bus

00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:44,500
up to up to a memory bank and now i'm

00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:50,620
going to scribe a little bit how they

00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:55,060
work cpu one is like a linear horn omen

00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:59,920
for Newman that's how is a process

00:15:55,060 --> 00:16:06,160
meaning it takes things step by step

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:10,570
it's logical it's synchronous it's it

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:13,360
does algebra language things that are

00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:16,470
that we're all very aware of right this

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,790
is what you get tested at in school it's

00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:21,010
common stuff this has got a lot to do

00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:25,210
with programming and how we understand

00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:29,830
it today well how we commonly understand

00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:32,950
how it works where cpu 2 is asynchronous

00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:35,260
and you can think of it like a google

00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:37,360
engine it will go through all of your

00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:40,720
memories with the reg ex pattern and

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:47,620
come back with the result see the

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:51,250
linking to the creative process yes they

00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:54,070
share a bus and this is important it

00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:57,850
means that when cpu one is accessing the

00:16:54,070 --> 00:17:00,640
memory bank see for you to come on if

00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:03,160
you are looking at a problem and trying

00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:06,190
to solve it by going through it step by

00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:08,320
step you can't you see for you two to

00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:12,910
solve the problem you need to go and do

00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:14,080
something else if you have to give cpu

00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:15,370
wanna break you have to give it

00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,410
something else to do something that's

00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:19,180
boring with you which it doesn't need

00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:22,120
the memory bank foot it doesn't have to

00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:24,850
be boring it can be just it can't use

00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:28,150
the memory bank because cpu one also has

00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:31,240
a an idle mode just keeps on chattering

00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:33,430
so if you're not giving it something to

00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,550
do it will just keep on it's the voice

00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:39,610
inside your head so it's quite common to

00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:41,380
think that this is you but when a

00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:43,000
thought comes to see if you're on is

00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:46,230
actually quite old it's been

00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:51,430
in your head for several milliseconds

00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:53,230
right so this is a little bit more about

00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:57,220
the linear mode these are the different

00:17:53,230 --> 00:18:00,460
cognitive skills or processes that we

00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:04,240
have in our heads we can group the

00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:09,760
different things as I said language is

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:12,340
here cpu to our rich mode it doesn't

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,300
understand language it can retrieve

00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:18,580
language but it can't understand it

00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:22,060
linear mode does it's it's purple it's

00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:24,370
also digital you can count its temporal

00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:26,500
it cares about which all these things

00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:30,310
are in this thing happens first then

00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:34,750
this it's rational meaning it can come

00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:37,360
to conclusion based on reason based on

00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:45,150
facts whereas logical is based on reason

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:48,100
and theory linear is linked ideas you I

00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:50,260
will need to go to the shop to buy

00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:54,550
something because I'm hungry so one

00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:56,790
thing leads to the next so similar to

00:18:54,550 --> 00:19:00,580
the voice in your head kind of thing

00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:03,850
analytical this is also something we use

00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:05,470
every day when we are programming you

00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:07,390
have a problem you have a bug you want

00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:10,690
to figure out how it works you take

00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:12,790
things apart okay read through the coat

00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:17,890
how does this work that's the analytical

00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:20,080
bit of you and abstract you take a piece

00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:22,810
of something and that represents the

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,580
whole also a familiar stuff we even have

00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:28,750
a construct in PHP which is called

00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:33,010
abstract right it means same symbolic

00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:39,100
also something that we use every day I

00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:41,470
mean we have variables should be a

00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:43,480
relatively familiar stuff this is what

00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:45,930
you get tested out in school it's easy

00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,930
to test

00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:57,310
so now on to rich mode this is the one

00:19:54,670 --> 00:20:03,120
that this is the site I'd like us to to

00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:03,120
focus on we're not doing enough of it

00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:09,190
left mode as actually especially in the

00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:12,460
Western mote Western world linear mode

00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:14,440
has taken over which is a bit sad we

00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:18,880
forgot about it i think it is a bit

00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:20,890
better in the Eastern world but language

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,530
for instance is very very important in

00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:25,450
the Western world and intuition that

00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:27,070
coin is sort of found upon you're not

00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:29,470
supposed to do that you're supposed to

00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:32,590
do to logically come to a conclusion the

00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:34,570
leap of facing so I can easily be

00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:38,350
disproved right but it's actually very

00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:40,720
important to get to an expert level so

00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:45,220
rich mode is non temporal it doesn't

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:48,220
care about time it's holistic it looks

00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:50,740
at a problem from all angles at once it

00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:52,210
looks at the whole picture not just the

00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:57,400
little pieces and come to a conclusion

00:20:52,210 --> 00:21:00,430
on that it's nonverbal as I said it can

00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:05,100
retrieve language it doesn't it cannot

00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:10,570
create it and if you've ever had a dream

00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:13,000
and you wake up is really vivid and you

00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:14,890
try to explain it it's all wait it goes

00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,830
away and that is because you're trying

00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:21,490
to describe it in words and rich mode is

00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:23,260
in pictures Rick schmoes does pictures

00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:25,200
it doesn't do words which is why you

00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:28,660
can't explain it it's the same thing

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:32,500
happens if you're trying to describe a

00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:35,020
close friend or a family member you can

00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:39,130
recognize all of your family members

00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:42,190
even if the group know they got really

00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:43,810
fat or if they got really old or if they

00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:46,890
change their hair color you still

00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:50,980
recognize them richemont has exceptional

00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:53,920
perceptional power it's something we can

00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:55,950
use when we're programming I'll get to

00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,950
that

00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:04,260
by moving on to the other ones

00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:08,400
analogical also very important when

00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:11,909
we're programming it means it has to do

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:15,570
with metaphors but in this example it

00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:20,250
means the heart it's a it's a pump right

00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:26,220
so how supposed to be a pump I'm not a

00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:28,890
very good drawer but and it has to do

00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:31,950
with metaphors you take meaning and and

00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:38,850
of one object and looting transfer it

00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:40,620
over to another object I'm really

00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:46,049
excited about an illogical and we'll get

00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:49,140
to that later all right um intuitive as

00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:51,149
well this is an expert rate really

00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:54,419
important this one usually isn't one

00:22:51,149 --> 00:22:56,130
plus one doesn't have to be I think yes

00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:59,730
it has to be it's intuitive we can't

00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:02,010
really see it but it will be synthetic

00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:04,380
as supposed to an illogical where you

00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:11,429
pick things apart to understand it you

00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:15,419
build it they have done studies on this

00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:18,630
for instance instead of dissecting a

00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:22,649
frog to understand how it works some

00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:25,460
schools in the United States try to make

00:23:22,649 --> 00:23:28,020
them build a frog instead and that has

00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:33,480
much better effect for example using

00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:35,760
Lego bricks or and what they called well

00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,580
those mechanical lego things macaque

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:44,940
mechanic that what I call meccano right

00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:46,380
and it's also concrete which mod really

00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:50,340
it cares about where things are in

00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:52,110
relation to each other spatial vigo

00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:54,390
thing that's the face of a cognition but

00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:56,730
I mentioned earlier and non-rational

00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:59,730
she's kind of insulting why would we

00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:01,470
want to be non-rational doesn't make

00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:04,020
sense but you do make a lot of non

00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:06,860
rational decisions in life for instance

00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:09,200
and if you're married or

00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:11,600
have a girlfriend didn't make a pro/con

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:20,450
list to decide whether or not you wanted

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:23,500
to be with this person hopefully yeah

00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:26,150
it's a leap of faith kind of saying it's

00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:29,720
it's a non rational decision which does

00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:35,020
make sense in some cases have I gone

00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:35,020
through all of them yeah

00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:48,180
so how can you use this on your way to

00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:50,520
becoming knowledgeable about whatever

00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:51,840
you like it can doesn't have to be PHP

00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,140
or a programming could be whatever you

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,160
like you go through different steps

00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:57,960
there's something called the Dreyfus

00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:00,360
model there are other models as well a

00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:03,630
drink from Dreyfus model has five

00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:06,330
different stages you start with the

00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:09,260
bottom level the beginners level where

00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:12,150
you don't really know anything about

00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:14,490
what you're trying to learn and you're

00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:18,200
really impatient at this level when you

00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:24,060
have a problem just want to solve it and

00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:25,800
the good thing about this is you can you

00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:28,110
can put these people to work this is

00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:30,660
what call centers work it gives them a

00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:32,760
list of things to do if this goes wrong

00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:34,560
then you do this if this goes on then

00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:40,980
you do this and you sort of move down a

00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:46,320
set of of instructions coding standards

00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:47,940
is a way of making beginners useful it's

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:52,670
an easy thing to follow it's a set of

00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:56,490
rules then you have a bit above that

00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:59,760
five stages and in the end we will come

00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:02,640
to the expert level this is where we

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:06,090
want to be they are intuitively don't

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:08,160
really know how they've solved the

00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:09,510
problem often they can't explain it

00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,370
which is why you shouldn't have an

00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:13,230
expert teaching a beginner because we're

00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:15,630
not waiting they just they just know

00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:18,680
they just looks at a problem it felt

00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:22,170
like that was the solution experts are

00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:24,000
there's not a lot of them maybe two

00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:26,220
percent in the world are expert these

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,710
are the source of information in that

00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:30,960
subject I think there are a couple of

00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:34,050
experts in this room actually in fear to

00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:39,140
be who are sources of knowledge but

00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:39,140
everyone can get down it takes hard work

00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:43,790
yes

00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:54,600
pattern matching that has to do with

00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:58,290
coding standards as well we as I said

00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:00,660
the beginners this is easy to do for

00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:02,970
experts this is something they need to

00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,830
recognize where they are people in the

00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:07,410
middle they don't really care about this

00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:09,750
because they don't see how they don't

00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:12,390
see the use of it that why should I do

00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:14,970
why should I document the cold I mean it

00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:17,700
just read cold but when you see a

00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:19,590
structure I've called a function with

00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:23,160
the doc block on on top you easily

00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:27,179
recognize where you are which makes it

00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:30,900
better it makes you more efficient it

00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:35,160
may sort of triggers the the the

00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:39,510
intuition of it mm-hmm holistic and

00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:43,669
illogical this is useful when designing

00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:48,900
a good design is actually very important

00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:51,419
because when something is pretty when it

00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:53,400
is beautifully designed people

00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:55,679
understand it better it just works

00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,480
better they've been doing tests on this

00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,299
we don't know why it's just the way it

00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:02,220
is they even thought it was like a

00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:04,290
cultural thing that they've tried it in

00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:07,650
every got in the Western world in the

00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:10,230
Eastern world and it it's weird that it

00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:13,470
is like this but if people even if

00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:17,730
they're just prying with apple logo they

00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:22,980
get more creative she's a bit weird but

00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:29,000
that's how it works as I said learn by

00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:29,000
synthesis already gone through that

00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:43,200
analogy and metaphors we use a lot of

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:45,930
metaphors in programming we don't have

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:49,080
demons in our computers we don't have

00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:54,020
said we're not sewing when we're dealing

00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:56,640
with threads but we still call them that

00:28:54,020 --> 00:29:01,230
one of these insults i think is funny

00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:03,030
with PHP is exceptions when you're

00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:05,730
throwing and catching an exception

00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:07,860
that's the metaphor you're not throwing

00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:09,480
anything and catching anything but we

00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,520
call it that and it says something about

00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:14,190
how it works it says a lot about

00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:18,020
exceptions and how it works so that's

00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:22,650
brilliant use of metaphors in my opinion

00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:27,470
also a metaphors are better if they are

00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:31,290
funny so this is a good reason to be

00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:35,760
funny who are your coding try not to use

00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:37,650
obscure TV shows for instance when

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,230
you're being funny because in five years

00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:42,240
big banks we hear theory might not be as

00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:47,700
popular anymore and no one knows what

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:50,550
bazinga means but it is true another

00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:56,190
example of how I think is funny in PHP

00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:58,560
is when your cloning an object we were

00:29:56,190 --> 00:30:02,490
referencing the object you are joining

00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:04,050
as this and the Wonder you are cloning

00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:07,470
there the one who becoming the object

00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:10,470
you're toning and that so here this and

00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:19,110
that is really funny but if I think it

00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:25,980
is also metaphor pair programming that

00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:27,780
is where left and right mode meets you

00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:31,010
can some people believe you can pair

00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:35,070
program your way out of any problem but

00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:37,860
the way I like to think of it one of the

00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:41,920
more useful users of pet programming is

00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:45,070
you have one person sitting at the

00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:48,190
at the computer doing the decoding this

00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:51,160
is the person who is sitting in the

00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:52,660
narrow attention span because the other

00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,370
person is sitting but he's not at the

00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:57,040
laptop piece is standing right and

00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:59,590
thinking in bigger pictures that way you

00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:02,950
can be in both the left mode and the

00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:06,670
right mode at the same time she's very

00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:08,350
useful and I hope that you probably

00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:10,240
discover this when you have been pair

00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:14,650
programming and prayer programming that

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:17,080
you can sort of get you can view the

00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:19,870
size of the problems from different

00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:30,030
angles at the same time and you get to a

00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:37,030
solution faster you still with me yes

00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:41,260
excellent right so here's an example the

00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:45,460
code itself isn't as important what is

00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:48,190
important is the way it looks it's you

00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:51,100
see the color coding if you've ever

00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:54,880
tried to look a cold without any color

00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:57,850
at all it's so much harder to read so

00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:02,050
for an expert to have things the way he

00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:05,320
is used to it's just it's really really

00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:07,690
important you see the color is the doc

00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:16,110
block up there and everything is

00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:18,460
indented this is the spatial spatial

00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:20,970
cognitive skill from which mode in

00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,970
action

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:34,330
right synthetic we are actually doing

00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:38,080
using the synthetic skill already when

00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:42,880
we are prototyping and also PHP and when

00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:44,620
we are unit testing when you are

00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,680
prototyping it means you are trying to

00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:51,850
figure out how to solve your problem by

00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:53,350
building it yes I do this and I'm pretty

00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:55,090
sure a lot of you do when you have a

00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:57,460
problem you want to try to figure out

00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:58,810
how it works you try to build it you

00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:01,720
just try to sit down and you start

00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:04,810
coding it this is being creative this is

00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:06,490
good this is a tool you have for using

00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:09,550
the right side of your brain so it's not

00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:13,000
all bad we are doing good things as well

00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:16,660
and the same thing is true for the unit

00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,930
testing you are building something to

00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:22,810
check if your original solution works

00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:26,800
and all the one you are going to build

00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:30,150
this is why it works do you understand

00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:40,450
that this is true so i'll give you a ah

00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:47,350
yeah good another example of an

00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:52,030
illogical or metaphors this is one of my

00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:54,670
favorite examples The Scream setting I

00:33:52,030 --> 00:34:00,700
don't know a lot about how XD Bert works

00:33:54,670 --> 00:34:03,250
but this setting is brilliant what it

00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:05,560
does it disables the they act the shut

00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:08,470
up once so you get all of the error

00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:10,810
messages you know you will get them and

00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:15,640
so instead of having a setting which was

00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:17,980
called this disabled at for which order

00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:20,980
was it I don't really remember you have

00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:25,020
scream it says exactly what it does it's

00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:28,510
funny and it's a metaphor this is how

00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:33,070
it's supposed to work did do you agree

00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:36,880
that this is a cool thing to do again

00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:39,280
with the besiegers and Big Bang Theory

00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:44,470
don't get overexcited and try to do

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:46,510
things too much but getting a good

00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:48,700
understand using words that everyone

00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:52,440
knows what is so what I'm getting at

00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:52,440
that's what you should use as metaphors

00:34:54,780 --> 00:35:05,430
um I already mentioned this this is a

00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:08,110
nice picture what's it to include it

00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:12,130
okay add something you shouldn't be

00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:14,590
creative with its test data you never

00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:18,760
know how it's going to get out in the

00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:24,370
open and it most likely will and I've

00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:27,040
heard stories about people adding

00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:30,060
especially with profanity if you are

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:36,070
trying to be funny I think it sort of

00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:38,020
profanity two reminders for instance and

00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:40,150
you forget to take it out before it goes

00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:42,970
into production and you sort of spamming

00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:46,860
your users with profanity every two

00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:53,160
weeks until someone artists market

00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:56,740
another example like read about was a

00:35:53,160 --> 00:36:01,270
Bill Gates shaped personal massager was

00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:03,580
left in the web shop that they had for

00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:06,940
every user Dubai it cost like a million

00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:10,000
corners so million pound so no one wants

00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:12,310
to buy it but you don't want that to

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,600
come out to your customers and it

00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:16,600
doesn't have to be something you

00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:21,580
actually put in in production it could

00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:26,440
be a salesman who comes up and wants to

00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:30,460
do some screenshots to present to the

00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:32,410
customer you have no control of this so

00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:35,800
you I mean there's nothing wrong with

00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:39,250
test data but just be careful it's not

00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:41,770
where you should be at your most

00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:46,690
creative level use it better use it as

00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:51,280
something else Easter eggs also

00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:55,720
a nice way to be creative my opinion we

00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:58,900
have this is google google moon it's not

00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:01,510
effective anymore sadly but if you at

00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:05,380
least in give us 2005 if you sumed

00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:09,730
enough in on the moon you it would see

00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:12,130
it was made of cheese it's a cool easter

00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:17,560
egg they don't have pictures of the moon

00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:19,990
that close so why not so if you do it

00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:23,859
today you'll just get like no in stock

00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:28,060
image you should put that back in it's

00:37:23,859 --> 00:37:33,460
funny PHP also has some easterlies

00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:35,920
php.net it has the view put thing they

00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:40,000
have different codes and if you put that

00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:43,300
at the end of some URLs you will see

00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,950
that it they're using PHP you'll get

00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:47,380
different images there are different

00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:50,950
course you can look it up the other one

00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:53,380
is the konami code it's that that

00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:55,510
sequence up up down down left right left

00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:58,270
right and you'll get they'll change the

00:37:55,510 --> 00:38:01,900
logo and php.net a lot of websites

00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:04,810
actually has the konami code and it's

00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:06,849
from a game i think i don't know which

00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:10,150
one I don't think I played that game

00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:11,470
when I was little but Facebook had that

00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:14,770
Konami code as well you would get

00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:19,119
bubbles that would sort of fly around on

00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:24,400
the web page yes and this the bottom one

00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:26,200
is from a varnished if you're trying to

00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,829
do something you're not supposed to do

00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:35,460
they will give you the 418 I'm a teapot

00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:43,770
it is from I think it's leftovers from a

00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:46,839
April first joke they made a standard

00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:48,339
which was called for 108 I'm a teapot

00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:50,230
and someone decided they wanted to

00:38:48,339 --> 00:38:52,000
implement it it was just a standard but

00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:55,060
it's a lot of people actually will

00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,180
return something if you get for one

00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,180
night

00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:07,420
right so this is the summary metaphors I

00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:14,580
like metaphors you should too it's funny

00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:17,710
and another one is learning bison

00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:24,340
synthesis it's good we've covered that

00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:26,650
in lengths and have fun it's important

00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:29,290
it will engage the right side of our

00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:30,790
modes and that your fight for the right

00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:38,369
side of you and you will be more

00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:41,260
creative exactly 40 minutes so we have

00:39:38,369 --> 00:39:44,160
about four minutes for questions does

00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:46,690
anybody have a question right

00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:49,510
observation it seems to me that

00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:51,670
metaphors using metaphors is really

00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:53,740
important in making stuff intuitive for

00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:55,960
other people like scream not very

00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:59,619
intuitive but it's a metaphor let me

00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:04,210
kind of play into each other yeah it's

00:39:59,619 --> 00:40:06,250
an observation thinking I agree oh we

00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:08,260
have one in the back I'm just wondering

00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:09,820
if you have any advice for the workplace

00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:12,910
things we can do to get a bit of

00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:17,100
creativity flowing ideas moving around a

00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:17,100
bit more what did yes

00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:30,720
really um I think management is

00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:34,619
important in this actually because they

00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:37,380
have to realize that even if you're not

00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:39,000
working it doesn't mean if you're not

00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:40,619
doing anything it doesn't mean you're

00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,849
not working it's the fact of you not

00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:46,980
doing something and this is important so

00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:49,560
I'm allowing people to do something else

00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:53,040
and sitting in front of the laptop is

00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:55,109
actually important outside some

00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:57,210
hospitals I don't know if you've seen it

00:40:55,109 --> 00:41:02,910
start hospitals and universities they

00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:04,560
usually put out labyrinths is the

00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:08,180
difference between labyrinths and mass

00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:10,349
and mazes do you know the difference now

00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:11,820
labyrinth means that you can just walk

00:41:10,349 --> 00:41:14,040
and walk it's like you're going for a

00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:15,450
walk mazes means you have different

00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:18,210
person you have to find your way out of

00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:23,820
it is more like a puzzle labyrinths are

00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:26,609
meant to dissolve just go for walk in

00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:29,700
confined spaces this is a way to become

00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:32,190
more crazy because Leo left the left

00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:35,280
side of use or disconnecting and allow

00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:37,950
the right mode to take control so

00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:41,490
getting back to nature is actually a

00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:44,310
good thing and having a labyrinth

00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:50,880
outside to hospitals and universities

00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:53,490
have a good effect I would think but

00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:56,430
also allowing people to not sit in front

00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:59,430
of the laptop is actually good so if you

00:41:56,430 --> 00:42:01,530
have a problem just step back do

00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:06,540
something else and you'll be surprised

00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:08,880
so then what results you'll get so I

00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:13,380
think was the one more question this

00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:15,300
side or no okay in that case I think we

00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:18,060
probably better wrap up there because

00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:20,110
there's a very small time-space tie into

00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:22,170
the next talk

00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:22,170
you

00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:37,670
