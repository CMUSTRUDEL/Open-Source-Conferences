Description: 
	Building and deploying applications with Phing

Building and deploying an application can be tedious and error-prone. Using Phing's rich set of tasks, easy extension points and simple XML build files to handle the building, packaging, deploying and testing of your application can help you save time and increase quality.

During this talk you will be introduced to the workings of Phing, and how to tailor the tool to your specific situation. A number of demonstrations will help illustrate file transformation, database migration, packaging, application deployment and other real-world use cases.
