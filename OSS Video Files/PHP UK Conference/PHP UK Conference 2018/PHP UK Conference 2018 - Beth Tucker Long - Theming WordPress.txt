	00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:07,410
so I'm here today to talk about theming

00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:09,630
WordPress just to give you a little

00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,090
intro onto Who I am I am Beth Tucker

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,809
long I'm from the US I'm a PHP developer

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,310
I run a consulting firm so I do a lot of

00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:19,250
various types of projects including a

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,660
lot of wordpress drupal and so on so

00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:24,660
WordPress theming is a big part of what

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,160
I do I'm also a stay-at-home mom so I

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,779
work from home while I stay at home with

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,570
my kids I'm a user group leader

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:32,160
I run Maddison PHP and I also

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,410
participate in mentoring and

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,640
apprenticeship programs and if you have

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,980
ever thought about being a mentor or

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,020
being mentored come and talk to me

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,540
afterwards I'd like to get you hooked up

00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,160
with PHP mentoring or another mentoring

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,920
program depending on what you want to be

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,690
mentored on butt mentoring is really an

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,180
amazing thing I've learned so much from

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,070
being mentored but almost even more so

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,370
from being a mentor to other people it's

00:00:53,070 --> 00:01:00,660
an amazing way to help someone else but

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:02,039
also grow yourself at the same time so

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,899
I'm fine with questions at any time

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,240
these lights are really bright so I can

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,530
just barely see you all so if you do

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,909
have a question feel free to raise your

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,470
hand and wave it around a little bit so

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:14,880
I can see you but feel free to ask me

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:17,909
questions at any time so getting started

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,040
why am i up here well let's start with a

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:23,250
very typical story that happens pretty

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,350
often in my daily life so once upon a

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,180
time we decided to switch to WordPress

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,060
or you know your business decided to

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,159
switch to WordPress marketing picked out

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,740
a theme everybody loved it it was

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,270
working great it's perfect it has all

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:40,470
the features we will ever want right oh

00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:42,329
except then all of a sudden we've

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,070
decided we have a new campaign coming

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:46,770
out and it's centering around the color

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,720
purple so now just for a couple of days

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,750
we want to change these titles to be

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,850
purple okay fine so we make a little

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,880
tweak to the theme now the titles are

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,990
going to be purple well we really liked

00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,579
the purple so we're gonna keep the

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,100
purple and now we want to move this up

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,960
we want to move some things around we've

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,840
changed the menu we've tweaked the

00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,590
colors oh now it's perfect again and we

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,569
love it oh but look a security patch has

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,500
come out for the theme that we were

00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:16,590
using

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,540
okay so obviously we want to stay secure

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,060
we want to apply the patch we apply the

00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,710
patch and all of our beautiful changes

00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,090
well beautiful beautiful being

00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,590
subjective there because those were just

00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,720
quick changes I made for this example

00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,660
but all of our beautiful changes are

00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,490
gone now what's happened is because we

00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,190
were making changes directly to the base

00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:37,680
theme when we applied the patch those

00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:39,240
changes were overwritten making changes

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,150
directly to your theme is not an upgrade

00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,280
safe way to do it but there is an

00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,610
upgrade safe way to do it and that's by

00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,890
creating child themes there are other

00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,900
benefits to child themes as well if

00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,820
you're using a child theme instead of

00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,890
creating your own from scratch you don't

00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,780
have to code it all yourself there is a

00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:01,380
lot of little fiddly stuff that goes

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,820
into a complete WordPress theme and why

00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,230
write it all yourself if someone else

00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,510
has already done it you just have to

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,730
tweak it so save yourself some time it

00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:10,380
also means that someone else is actively

00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,540
working on new features for your theme

00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,950
alongside you so there are more new

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,650
features coming in that you don't have

00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:19,080
to build it's also another set of eyes

00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,910
on security as much as we all like to

00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,739
think we're really good about monitoring

00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:24,570
the security and testing our things we

00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:27,150
get busy we have other work to do and

00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:28,920
having someone who is actively working

00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,870
on the theme or a team of people for

00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,610
open source themes who are testing the

00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:35,760
security and applying security patches

00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:37,500
for you is really a helpful thing so it

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,320
gives you a little bit more security as

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,880
well it can also be really helpful with

00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,670
meeting accessibility and mobile

00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,470
guidelines again there's a lot of

00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,180
accessibility guidelines out there and

00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,920
there are a lot of accessibility experts

00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,370
who do a great job of making sure that

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,690
seams can match that so let the experts

00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:59,040
do their thing and then you can take

00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:00,330
advantage of their expertise so there's

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,880
a lot of different things you can do

00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:05,100
with a child theme you can modify the

00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,450
page templates to change the layout so

00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,700
you need one page that looks different

00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:10,440
from the rest you can create that custom

00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,260
page template to look exactly how you

00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:15,720
want you can create new widget boxes new

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,459
menus you can create different sidebars

00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,859
if you want or remove all the sidebars

00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:22,610
you can do different things you can even

00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:24,599
change the upload size for the images so

00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,820
WordPress gives you the three default

00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:27,240
sizes for inserting images when the

00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,940
users

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,460
come in if you want to have different

00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:34,349
sizes you can program those in so that

00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,660
the rest of your team who may not be as

00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:38,610
tech savvy at adjusting images before

00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:42,930
they upload them can now have the

00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:45,180
defaults built into WordPress so how do

00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,590
we get started with a child theme the

00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,000
very first thing you want to do is you

00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:50,729
want to make sure the theme you're using

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,080
is not already a child theme when you're

00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:55,319
going through the theme directory on

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,639
WordPress here you can see over where

00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:58,530
it's with the download this is on

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,110
wordpress.org in their theme search

00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:04,319
you'll say it says this is a child theme

00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:07,050
of one limelight so if you're already

00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,909
using a child theme we can still create

00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,500
another child theme of that but we'll

00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:12,810
get to that a little bit later towards

00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,190
the end of the talk so initially you

00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,560
probably want to start out with a theme

00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:20,009
that is not a child theme itself makes

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,479
things a little bit simpler you also

00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:24,360
want to make sure you're starting with a

00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:26,099
clean copy and the latest version a lot

00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,120
of times people want to start a child

00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:29,310
theme but they've already started

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,380
tweaking the base theme and that gets

00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,759
really messy the first time you have to

00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,289
upgrade the base theme after you've

00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:37,490
created your child theme so you want to

00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:37,490
make sure you start with a clean slate

00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:41,639
you're gonna create a child theme

00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,860
directory you can name it whatever you'd

00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:45,990
like I'm fond of calling it whatever the

00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,610
original theme is - child's just because

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,620
it keeps it makes it really easy to tell

00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:51,810
which theme it's a child of but really

00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,430
you can name it anything you'd like so

00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,259
inside your themes directory create a

00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:58,889
directory and now we're gonna add a

00:05:55,259 --> 00:06:00,539
stylesheet now an important thing to

00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:02,550
note with the stylesheet the stylesheet

00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:04,380
for the child theme is going to be

00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:07,380
loaded after the stylesheet for the

00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:10,139
parent theme so your styles will be

00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,880
loaded last which is nice your styles

00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:13,469
will then overwrite any of the parent

00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,449
styles as long as you use the same name

00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:18,870
and so it's a way that you can modify

00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:21,750
those parent styles now some themes use

00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:24,270
inline styles directly in the code or in

00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,650
the templates and your style sheet will

00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,780
not overwrite those because the

00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,389
obviously.this the inline styles are

00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,949
going to take precedence so those we can

00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:34,349
get to when we talk about how to update

00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:35,789
the page templates but anything in the

00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:39,120
style sheet you'll be able to overwrite

00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:40,469
with your style sheet there's a set of

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,160
headers that you need at the top of the

00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:42,870
style sheet

00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,780
helped identify this as a child theme

00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:47,460
for a wordpress so you give it a name

00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,410
again the name can be anything you want

00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:53,760
and this is going to be the name that

00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:54,810
shows up at the very top in your when

00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,250
you go into appearance and you're

00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:58,080
choosing your theme this is the name

00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:00,030
that's going to show up there so unless

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,500
you're making your theme public you

00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:05,460
don't really have to worry about it too

00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,720
much the theme URI again it's not really

00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,460
that important what you put in here

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,920
unless you're going to be marketing your

00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,360
child theme so you can generally just

00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,540
put in the theme where you're installing

00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,310
it or leave it as example.com the

00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:19,530
description again is more if you're

00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:21,210
advertising it on wordpress.org that's

00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:23,580
the little description paragraph that

00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:25,920
shows up you can put that here the

00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,660
author information is whatever you'd

00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,640
like it to be as well so these things

00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,840
are not overly important what you put in

00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,060
there if you're just using this

00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,770
privately but if you do ever intend to

00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,210
put it live that's when those things

00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:38,040
become more important and when they

00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:40,890
become public otherwise nobody will see

00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:43,140
these it is important though that your

00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:45,690
header block be unique compared to other

00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:47,190
themes out there so you want to try to

00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:49,290
make sure you've customized it a little

00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:54,090
bit so it's not - not too much the same

00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:55,590
as others now the template line here is

00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,870
where it starts becoming important what

00:07:55,590 --> 00:08:02,100
you put in the template is going to be

00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:04,980
the parent themes directory name now

00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:08,669
most parent themes use their directory

00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:10,140
name as they're slug for everything but

00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:12,300
you can also double check if you look in

00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,919
the style sheet for the parent theme you

00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,169
can see what their template is called as

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:20,880
well but generally it's going to be the

00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:23,190
directory name version and licensing

00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:25,140
again are not too important one handy

00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:27,720
thing though with the version is that it

00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:29,310
can help with caching issues so if you

00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,080
need to bust the cache and make sure

00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:33,599
your new styles get out right away you

00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,340
can increment the version number if you

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:39,090
don't include a version number it will

00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:42,599
default to the current version of your

00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:44,430
install of WordPress and so then your

00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:46,110
stylesheet version will match the

00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:48,660
version number of your WordPress install

00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:52,050
and so it will increment every time you

00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:54,450
upgrade WordPress but like I said if you

00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,990
use your own numbering system it you can

00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,670
force a

00:08:54,990 --> 00:09:01,589
to refresh the cache which is really

00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:03,450
handy the tags here these tags are

00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:05,850
actually from a pre-approved list of

00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:08,399
tags from WordPress I've included the

00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:10,800
link here so you can't just type

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,110
whatever you want in for the tags you

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,180
should choose off the customized list it

00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,500
doesn't cause an error currently if you

00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,050
type in something that's not on the

00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:21,360
approved list but always a good idea to

00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:25,260
follow the follow the rules just in case

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,540
the next version complaints and lastly

00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,620
the text domain this is another thing

00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,360
where you can sort of make up whatever

00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,149
you'd like it's a good idea to make it

00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,070
as unique as possible but unless you're

00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:37,470
using internationalization or multiple

00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:42,690
languages on your site this text domain

00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:44,580
doesn't really come into play the second

00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:48,270
file we need to add to our child theme

00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:50,760
is going to be a functions file so it's

00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:52,620
going to be called function stat PHP now

00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,450
the functions file is loaded in a

00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,130
different order than the stylesheet so

00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:58,890
the function file is going to be loaded

00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:01,500
first and so it's loaded in addition to

00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:03,480
the parent themes functions file what

00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,430
this means is is that if you want to

00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,770
overwrite one of the parent themes

00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:09,750
functions you can't do it by just

00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:11,459
putting in a function with the same name

00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,930
because the parent theme will be loaded

00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:15,870
after and it will overwrite your

00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:17,250
function so what you want to do is make

00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:20,190
sure you give the themes in your

00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:21,750
functions file customized names to

00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:27,630
prevent them from being overwritten by

00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:29,399
the parent theme I will say as a side

00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:30,810
note there is a way for your parent

00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,839
function to check if your function

00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:35,610
exists first and then not overwrite it

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,230
if you've already created it which is a

00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:39,510
really nice thing for theme developers

00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:41,430
to do but most don't do that yet

00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:44,100
so you can check your parent theme and

00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:47,100
if it has an if function exists

00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:49,800
call then it will not overwrite your

00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,600
function but like I said you can't count

00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,060
on that and you never know if the next

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,920
upgrade is going to include that so I

00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:58,890
think it's a safer idea to just make

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,200
sure you have a unique name so in our

00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:03,690
functions file here you can see we're in

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,930
cueing the styles now you may see things

00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:08,640
online that say to use at import in your

00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:12,210
stylesheet to pull in your

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:14,430
your child theme but that's no longer

00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:16,860
recommended and it's no longer

00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:19,770
recommended because what happens is

00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,600
browsers with the functions here when we

00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:24,150
and queue them will load multiple

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,460
resources simultaneously however if

00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:29,010
you're using an import statement in your

00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:31,470
stylesheet it has to load parse and

00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:33,270
execute your stylesheet then it will

00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:35,910
load parse and execute the import line

00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:38,850
so you can actually almost effectively

00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:40,050
double the amount of time it takes to

00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:43,920
load your style sheets and your

00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:46,110
resources so this is much faster at

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,730
import currently still works no

00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:49,230
guarantee that that will work going

00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:51,570
forward although WordPress is pretty

00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,760
picky about backwards compatibility

00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:57,030
always working so in theory it will work

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,680
for a very long time but but this is a

00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:01,170
better way to do it so I'd recommend

00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,790
doing it this way just know that you'll

00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:04,350
see a lot of tutorials online that still

00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:08,400
tell you to do it with the at import

00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:09,480
line so now you know what that's for so

00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,190
what we're gonna do here is we're gonna

00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,830
in cue the style so you can see we have

00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:18,180
the wpu and cue style and we're gonna go

00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:21,360
through and go through each line here

00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:23,040
quickly so I've given my function I just

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,150
called it my theme and cue styles you

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,370
can call your function whatever you'd

00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:28,110
like again it's a good idea to have a

00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:32,430
unique name so you don't run into any

00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:34,380
conflicts generally the best practiced

00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:36,840
is to call it your child theme name

00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,160
underscore and Q underscore styles just

00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,630
for consistency it makes it really

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,760
obvious to everyone else what that

00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:44,880
function is doing but again you can call

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,580
it whatever you'd like here's where you

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,620
define the parent style again this is

00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:52,050
what's going to match what's in your

00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:54,720
parent themes in queue styles call and

00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:56,520
it's most often going to be the same as

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,440
the directory name for the parent theme

00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,910
but you may want to double check their

00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,900
function call just to make sure because

00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:05,730
not all of them match here's where we're

00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:11,820
actually going to pull in the parent

00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:13,260
theme child a parent theme style and now

00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:16,440
we're gonna pull in our child theme

00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:18,060
style so you can see we just called it

00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,430
child style again you can call it

00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:22,080
whatever you'd like the get stylesheet

00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:26,340
directory URIs going to be the

00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:28,230
directory for your child theme and then

00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:30,330
here's where we're going to list the

00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:32,040
parent style as a dependency it's a good

00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:34,260
idea to always list your dependencies

00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,330
though these last three items are

00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:40,050
optional so you don't have to list the

00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:41,730
parent theme as a dependency this again

00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:44,400
will gives you a version number if you'd

00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:47,040
like to version your your theme to make

00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:49,500
sure if you need to get the cache to

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,420
refresh or anything and again this will

00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,210
default to your WordPress version number

00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:56,970
if you don't assign it and then you can

00:13:54,210 --> 00:14:00,260
also assign media like print screen etc

00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:05,400
it defaults to all or you can specify it

00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:07,830
and really that's about it well kind of

00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,930
we at least have a child theme at this

00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:11,640
point so at this point if you went back

00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:14,490
into your WordPress admin panel you'd

00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,800
see for instance if you had tribal was

00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:19,200
your base theme here's our tribal child

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,180
theme that we just created you'll notice

00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,330
that it doesn't have a preview image yet

00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:26,460
that's pretty easy to add at least once

00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:28,980
you've got your child theme up just take

00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:31,320
a screenshot of it and then add it to

00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:33,540
your root child theme directory and call

00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:36,920
it screenshot PNG and it will

00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:40,110
automatically populate that for you

00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,400
so once you've activated it you should

00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,710
be able to go through and everything

00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,390
should here at this point look the same

00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,830
because we haven't made any changes to

00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:49,770
the styles or the functions of the

00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:51,510
templates yet so any of the style

00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:54,030
changes we want to make now we can put

00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:55,890
in our style our child theme stylesheet

00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:58,440
functionality changes again are going to

00:14:55,890 --> 00:15:00,090
go in the functions and if we want to

00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,090
change any of the templates we can do

00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:06,480
that as well what we do is you can

00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:08,370
create a new template by just creating a

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,440
name of some kind if you want to replace

00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:12,480
one of the parent templates say you want

00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,030
to overwrite the header file or the

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,610
footer so what you would do then is you

00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:19,350
copy the file from the parent theme into

00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:21,570
your child themes root directory or

00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:25,500
match the directory structure of your

00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:28,130
parent theme and it will override the

00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,130
parent file

00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:34,800
in the template file if you're gonna

00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:36,390
create a new one pretty much all you

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,500
need to do is give it a template name in

00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:39,060
a comment at the top

00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:43,680
following the WordPress commenting

00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:45,480
format and one thing to note when you're

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,620
making your template files or in your

00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,540
function calls and things like that

00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,400
there are two different ways to get the

00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,380
path to the files on the server

00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,690
there's get stylesheet directory and get

00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:56,220
template directory and these oftentimes

00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:58,290
get confused because they're very

00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,210
similar with a key difference get

00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,700
stylesheet directory is going to be the

00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:04,440
root directory of your child theme get

00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,930
template directory is going to be the

00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,550
root directory of your parent theme so

00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:09,600
it's important to make note of that so

00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,580
if you're having some issues with

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,140
something not changing when you think it

00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,670
should change it may actually be calling

00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:17,850
the parent file instead of your child

00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:22,590
taya child file if you're using get

00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:24,210
template instead of get stylesheet now

00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,890
if you need to add JavaScript to your

00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:27,330
child theme which is a very common thing

00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:29,040
to need to do there's a couple of

00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,540
different things you should do first of

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,100
all it's a good idea to always place it

00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:34,260
in a separate file that's considered

00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,030
best practice it's not necessary it's

00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,710
not enforced at this point but it is

00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:39,720
considered a best practice to keep it in

00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,980
a separate file and then you'll just

00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,980
need to go through and in queue that

00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,300
file so again here we're just in

00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,430
queueing just like we did with the other

00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,530
files this time we're using encrypt in

00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:53,850
queue script instead of in queue style

00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:55,740
and we put in this time we're adding a

00:16:53,850 --> 00:17:00,060
script from the parent theme so we're

00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:01,860
using the template directory and then we

00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:05,880
can give it a version number now the

00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:08,250
true or false at the bottom the last the

00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:11,400
last parameter there if it's set to true

00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:13,590
it will load the JavaScript line in the

00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,270
footer instead of in the header if it's

00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:17,250
set to false which is the default it

00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:18,660
will load in the header so depending on

00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,010
where you want it to load with the Dom

00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,110
you can have it load in the header or

00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:24,140
the footer of header or the footer of

00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:26,190
the page

00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,720
especially when including JavaScript

00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:30,480
libraries check to see if it's already

00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,640
included first WordPress includes a ton

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,500
of JavaScript libraries already so

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,140
chances are it already includes one it

00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:39,540
may not be the version you want but it

00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,310
may already be included and that this is

00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:43,610
a link to the complete list of what's

00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,610
included

00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:50,159
now a common thing to need to do is to

00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:52,259
get rid of one version of a JavaScript

00:17:50,159 --> 00:17:54,120
library and load a different version say

00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:57,269
you need a newer version that what

00:17:54,120 --> 00:18:00,029
WordPress has by default it's always a

00:17:57,269 --> 00:18:01,679
little dicey unregistering a library and

00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:04,110
choosing your own version of it because

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,399
WordPress may complain but depending on

00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:07,440
how much testing you've done what you

00:18:05,399 --> 00:18:10,230
can do is you can use deregister and DQ

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,779
to get rid of an older library and then

00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:14,669
you can register an in queue your own

00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:16,379
version of the library instead so you

00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:18,720
can actually get all of WordPress to use

00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:29,279
a different JavaScript library if you'd

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:31,110
like for the admin panel you mean yeah

00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:40,590
you can redeem the admin panel as well

00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:42,179
with the libraries I believe it does it

00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:44,970
just in your theme and you'd have to

00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:46,350
also do it in your admin panel like

00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:48,059
you'd have to do a function to do it in

00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,409
the admin panel but I'm not positive on

00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:55,740
that I've never tried to change it in

00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:57,529
the admin panel so yeah okay so when

00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:00,749
you're starting with your parent theme a

00:18:57,529 --> 00:19:02,159
couple of things to do you want to let's

00:19:00,749 --> 00:19:03,570
say they've come out with a new security

00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:04,919
patch so we have our child theme

00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:06,960
everything's working great but we need

00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:08,940
to upgrade the parent what you want to

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,730
make sure you do is backup the parent

00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,320
theme and the child theme every once in

00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:14,730
a while parent themes will upgrade

00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,169
something and it's going to break

00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,279
something in your child theme so you

00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:18,960
want to make sure you have that backup

00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:21,529
of the parent themes you can roll back

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,539
really quickly if you need to not all

00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:26,610
theme developers keep older copies of

00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:28,139
their themes so if that's why it's a

00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:31,440
good idea for you to have a copy of it

00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:32,999
just in case it's a good idea always to

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,619
compare the upgrade notes to see what

00:19:32,999 --> 00:19:36,389
they've changed sometimes they change

00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:37,889
how you call things sometimes they've

00:19:36,389 --> 00:19:40,200
changed certain functions that maybe

00:19:37,889 --> 00:19:41,669
you've customized a step further and so

00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,259
making sure you know what they changed

00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:45,809
can help you make sure your child theme

00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:47,759
is ready for the upgrade as well and the

00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:50,999
last step I always run is I run a diff

00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:53,100
on the old theme versus the new version

00:19:50,999 --> 00:19:54,539
of the parent theme because their

00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,240
release notes don't always tell you

00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:58,999
everything they've changed and some

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,369
innocuous changes that they've made may

00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:03,169
make a big deal to your codebase so I

00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:05,299
always run a diff on those files any

00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:07,009
files that I've customized so any of the

00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:08,179
template files or the stylesheet and

00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:11,950
things like that just to make sure I

00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:14,779
catch everything that they've changed a

00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:17,149
couple of other tips when you are

00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:19,580
creating your child theme document

00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:22,369
everything really well give everything

00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:24,350
consistent but unique names again do not

00:20:22,369 --> 00:20:28,249
use at imports and I do have a link to a

00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:30,019
blog here where constantan did some time

00:20:28,249 --> 00:20:36,409
tests on things so you can see that it

00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:37,970
is faster to use the in queue and I like

00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:40,070
to start with a starter theme if you

00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,720
don't have a theme already in place

00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,379
let's say you want to create one from

00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,179
scratch

00:20:42,379 --> 00:20:46,460
there are starter themes which are not

00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:49,190
designed to be used as a theme on their

00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:51,019
own but provide a really good solid

00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:53,149
foundation for you to build your child

00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:54,740
theme on so they do a lot of the heavy

00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:56,450
lifting on the WordPress side of things

00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:59,210
for you and then you can customize

00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:01,879
things from their foundation press is a

00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:03,789
really good one it's very very mobile

00:21:01,879 --> 00:21:08,119
first it's built on the ZURB foundation

00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:09,619
six I believe right now framework and so

00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:12,230
if you need a mobile friendly website

00:21:09,619 --> 00:21:16,429
they've built this mobile first and so

00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:18,289
your child theme is already almost done

00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:21,230
as far as mobile readiness which is

00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:23,259
really handy Divi is really helpful as

00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:27,259
well Divi comes with a really awesome

00:21:23,259 --> 00:21:30,230
GUI customization panel so if you have

00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:32,539
say another team at work who needs to

00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:35,330
make changes to the colors and the

00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:37,220
styles of your theme and you don't want

00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:39,200
to have them contact you every time they

00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:40,999
want to make a style change you can give

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,240
them you can base your child theme off

00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:47,179
Divi which has a GUI admin panel where

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,730
they can change the colors for the

00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:51,710
various header items for the links and

00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:53,539
those kinds of things and also gives

00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:55,070
them a place to add in their own custom

00:21:53,539 --> 00:21:57,289
Styles where they don't actually have to

00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:59,720
interact with the style sheets on the

00:21:57,289 --> 00:22:02,210
backend so you can give your users a

00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,769
little bit more accessibility for making

00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:06,019
their own changes without contacting you

00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:10,119
but still keeping your code to sort of

00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:13,059
insulated from them there are also ways

00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:15,669
to automate child themes so if you have

00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:16,119
a theme that you've created and you love

00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:17,709
it

00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:19,539
but you want to convert it to a child

00:22:17,709 --> 00:22:22,059
theme there's a bunch of different

00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:25,419
things you can do so there's a couple of

00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:26,829
plugins here child a child defy me child

00:22:25,419 --> 00:22:29,889
theme creator and child theme

00:22:26,829 --> 00:22:34,599
configurator the last one is a paid

00:22:29,889 --> 00:22:37,119
plugin the other two are free and these

00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:38,739
two are very helpful plugins but there

00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:41,499
are three versions behind now so they're

00:22:38,739 --> 00:22:44,829
considered fully outdated and no longer

00:22:41,499 --> 00:22:47,019
supported however they both still

00:22:44,829 --> 00:22:50,319
currently work so maybe they'll be

00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:54,489
updated soon but the one kick one-click

00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:56,409
child theme will basically create a base

00:22:54,489 --> 00:22:58,269
child theme off your current theme and

00:22:56,409 --> 00:23:00,759
then you can just tweak it so it does a

00:22:58,269 --> 00:23:02,439
lot of the like in queueing and the base

00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:04,779
stuff for you so you can really save a

00:23:02,439 --> 00:23:07,749
lot of time with that the child theme

00:23:04,779 --> 00:23:09,339
check goes through and checks what

00:23:07,749 --> 00:23:11,589
you've changed compared to the parent

00:23:09,339 --> 00:23:13,389
theme so it gives you a quick rundown of

00:23:11,589 --> 00:23:15,669
all your customizations that are

00:23:13,389 --> 00:23:17,469
different from the existing parent theme

00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:18,819
and that could be really helpful when

00:23:17,469 --> 00:23:22,709
you're getting ready for an upgrade it

00:23:18,819 --> 00:23:22,709
sort of automates those diffs for you

00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:27,699
now I mentioned at the very beginning

00:23:25,329 --> 00:23:30,659
about if you're already using a child

00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:34,329
theme you still can create a child theme

00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:38,469
however not in a traditional child theme

00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:40,569
way so WordPress out of the box they

00:23:38,469 --> 00:23:43,629
call them grandchild themes because it's

00:23:40,569 --> 00:23:45,579
the child of your child and grandchild

00:23:43,629 --> 00:23:49,659
themes are not supported out of the box

00:23:45,579 --> 00:23:53,619
by WordPress so in theory you can create

00:23:49,659 --> 00:23:57,399
a child theme and list your other child

00:23:53,619 --> 00:24:00,969
theme as the parent and maybe about 40

00:23:57,399 --> 00:24:02,319
percent of the time that'll work but you

00:24:00,969 --> 00:24:05,739
never know when it's going to stop

00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:07,359
working and you never know at what point

00:24:05,739 --> 00:24:08,889
in your site it's going to stop working

00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:10,509
so you really need to do some heavy

00:24:08,889 --> 00:24:13,089
extensive testing if you're going to do

00:24:10,509 --> 00:24:15,069
that but luckily there is another way to

00:24:13,089 --> 00:24:17,469
do that and we can do that by using a

00:24:15,069 --> 00:24:20,919
plug-in instead of a theme to create our

00:24:17,469 --> 00:24:23,499
grandchild so what you do is find a

00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:23,650
unique name for your plugin it's really

00:24:23,499 --> 00:24:25,390
a

00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:27,190
important with plugins more so than

00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:30,060
themes even to make sure that your

00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:33,190
plugin names are all very unique

00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:34,990
so go ahead into your WP content folder

00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:38,290
into your plugins folder and we're gonna

00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:40,060
create a folder for our plugin we're

00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:41,470
gonna create a PHP file which is

00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:43,030
basically going to be our functions but

00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:44,890
doesn't have to be called functions in

00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:46,930
fact it's most commonly called the name

00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:51,550
of your file or you the name of your

00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:53,680
plug-in dot PHP and then in that PHP

00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:55,240
file we're going to put in this header

00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,010
block so this header block is going to

00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,590
look very similar to the one we put into

00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:01,390
the style sheet you'll notice that we're

00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:04,120
giving our plug-in a name we can give it

00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:05,740
the URI in the description again once

00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,240
again these are not real important

00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:09,130
unless you're planning marketing your

00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,860
plug-in on the like the WordPress

00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:14,170
plug-in site if it's just gonna be a

00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:16,660
private plug-in to do your theme then

00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:19,420
it's not super important what you put in

00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:22,240
there version number again helps with

00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:25,210
caching the author information the

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,100
license and so on the text domain again

00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:27,910
is going to help with

00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:31,240
internationalization that's going to be

00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:32,860
helping with multiple languages and the

00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,170
domain path here is where you're going

00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:39,640
to specify where your plugin like the

00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:41,800
name of the folder for your plugin after

00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:47,080
that we're going to because we're doing

00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:49,510
a theme here we're gonna encourage every

00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,970
we want I tend to stick with the you

00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:54,430
know theme name underscore add styles is

00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:56,140
my function name and you can see we're

00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:57,700
registering the style and then in cueing

00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:04,630
it and then we've got the action to

00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:06,370
actually activate that you can do

00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:08,200
templates as well this way so you can

00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:10,180
overwrite the templates via the plug-in

00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:13,360
what you'll do is you'll create a

00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:16,660
templates directory in your plugin you

00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:18,400
can sort of leave them all in the root

00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:20,590
directory but it can be kind of messy

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,540
with the automatic loading of them so I

00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:24,460
strongly encourage you to create a

00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:27,460
separate templates directory when you're

00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:28,750
dealing with plugins versus themes copy

00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,790
over the templates you want to change

00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:34,090
into there and then you'll need to add a

00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:36,280
function in your PHP file to include

00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:37,460
those templates so here we're going to

00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,320
double check if the file

00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,730
exists in our templates the in our

00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,429
templates directory then we're going to

00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:45,980
use that instead of the one in the

00:26:43,429 --> 00:26:47,840
parent theme or the child theme so we

00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:51,200
will do our grandchild theme over the

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,210
top of that okay so to give you an idea

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,200
I'm gonna pop out of this for a second

00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:56,200
and we'll see how this works

00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:15,290
there we go okay so here is a sample

00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:17,990
child plugin and a sample child theme so

00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:21,860
we'll start with the child theme and let

00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:22,220
me see if I can make this bigger there

00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:26,360
we go

00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:28,130
is that readable okay so here you can

00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:31,790
see I have a super simple child theme

00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:34,610
and I've based it off the 2016 base

00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:36,260
theme and WordPress and all I've done is

00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:38,360
I have assigned a color to the

00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:40,750
background and then a color to the

00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:45,320
background of the main content area so

00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:47,990
here I am making the background or the

00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:51,290
body background blue and the content

00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:56,900
background green it's very exciting

00:27:51,290 --> 00:28:00,200
child theme I have my screenshot dot PNG

00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:03,230
here so it will display a preview of it

00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,700
and then in my function since I'm not

00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:06,740
doing anything too exciting in this

00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:11,120
child theme that I've created

00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:12,980
oops it didn't keep the larger font you

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,740
can see here that I'm in cueing my

00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:19,070
styles and assigning the version and

00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:23,030
then I am activating it so not super

00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:32,530
exciting but it is a child theme and let

00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:34,820
me okay so here is the 2016 theme and

00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:36,410
you can see now if we come into the

00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:40,280
dashboard we're going to go under

00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:43,340
appearance to themes here you can see my

00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:45,290
demo a child theme and you can see the

00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:48,020
green and the blue preview because we

00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:55,100
added that screenshot so I click

00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:58,310
activate over here and now our child

00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,940
theme is active so I know it's lovely

00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,650
isn't it

00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:07,160
I'd like to point out I'm a programmer

00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:08,870
not a designer yeah but if I would like

00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:14,510
to hire me for design you too could have

00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:16,280
this lovely child theme okay so but now

00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:16,669
let's say we want to modify this child

00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,499
theme

00:29:16,669 --> 00:29:28,190
they say this is a professional child

00:29:18,499 --> 00:29:30,710
theme use your imagination right so

00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:33,499
we've created a plug in here so you can

00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:35,899
see I have my left child plug in also

00:29:33,499 --> 00:29:38,840
very cleverly named so you can see I

00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:40,940
have make this a little bit bigger here

00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:45,289
I have my header block here at the top

00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:48,080
and then I've created the templates

00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:49,519
directory and I've activated that so if

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,950
we overwrite any of the templates that

00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:57,139
will work and then Ivan queued my Styles

00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:59,779
here and then in my style here I have

00:29:57,139 --> 00:30:04,309
very cleverly just swapped the colors so

00:29:59,779 --> 00:30:08,359
it will switch from blue to green so now

00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:13,249
if we go back here go back here so now

00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:14,899
we're gonna go under plugins and so here

00:30:13,249 --> 00:30:19,100
you can see my bus school grand child

00:30:14,899 --> 00:30:22,940
theme plug-in that I made and I just

00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:26,720
click activate and now if we come back

00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:29,149
over to the site you'll see now we have

00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:33,590
a green background with blue content on

00:30:29,149 --> 00:30:35,629
it very exciting so you can see I it is

00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:37,309
possible and actually relatively easy to

00:30:35,629 --> 00:30:38,840
make a grandchild theme that you just

00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:44,419
can't do it in the standard way of a

00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:47,950
normal child theme all right now let me

00:30:44,419 --> 00:30:47,950
see if I can switch back to this

00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:59,280
more plugins you mean you can you can

00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:01,440
the hierarchy starts getting Messier the

00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:03,720
deeper and deeper you go so you have to

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,940
be more and more and more careful with

00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,220
how you do things and how you reference

00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:10,410
things but it is possible

00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:14,880
I can't imagine ever needing to do it

00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:17,870
but Jenny's hands shot up so she might

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,870
be disagreeing with me here

00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:34,170
please don't yeah so okay so for example

00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:36,240
WooCommerce is a very very popular

00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:37,980
e-commerce platform and I have a lot of

00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,720
clients that use WooCommerce and a lot

00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,460
of them have purchased a theme for

00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:44,010
WooCommerce now themes for WooCommerce

00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:46,230
are child themes based off Luke immerses

00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:48,240
storefront theme then they want to

00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:50,370
modify that but we don't want to lose

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,100
our upgrade ability especially on an

00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:54,480
e-commerce site we really really want to

00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,100
make sure that we can upgrade with

00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,460
whatever security patch they come out

00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:01,260
with instantly so that's one time that

00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:08,280
like I used grandchild themes all the

00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:11,340
time because of that so it's what well

00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:13,230
any any sort of there's a lot of base

00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:16,620
themes that people have built child

00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:19,170
themes off of and then clients like that

00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:23,460
child theme and then they want to make

00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:25,020
changes to it so it happens a lot more

00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:27,030
it's not just Luke commerce that was

00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:30,440
just the first example that popped in

00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:38,850
because I do that one a lot so yeah yeah

00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:41,300
all right any other questions switch

00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:41,300
back here

00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:55,410
yeah okay so as you can see grandchild

00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:56,940
plugins are a little bit of a wonky way

00:32:55,410 --> 00:33:00,650
to do it but can be really helpful if

00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,650
you do need to modify that child theme

00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,990
so I have a bunch of resources here

00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:10,110
there are a lot of tutorials out there

00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:12,240
on how to upgrade child or how to create

00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:15,630
child themes and grandchild themes I

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,970
would recommend making sure to use the

00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:20,250
tutorials that are linked to from the

00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:22,230
WordPress codex because there's a lot of

00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:26,010
bad information out there about how to

00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:28,140
do it poorly and so I would stick with

00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:29,820
the tutorials you can find link to from

00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:32,310
the Codex the codex does have quite an

00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:34,800
extensive list of resources and things

00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:36,330
not just WordPress and automatic

00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,610
resources but links to blogs and

00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:40,320
screencasts so there's video ways

00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:43,460
there's lots of different ways to learn

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:45,690
it but stick with those resources and

00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:49,170
how are we doing on time because now I

00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:58,290
left my presentation 25 minutes okay

00:33:49,170 --> 00:34:00,300
sounds good all right so my demo went a

00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:02,820
lot smoother than I thought it would so

00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:05,240
I have a little extra time does anyone

00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,240
have any questions

00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:22,250
yeah you could sure you could but

00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:25,340
because the the child theme plugin

00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:26,990
method is it's not as elegant and it's

00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:29,330
not as automatic so you have to do a lot

00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:31,340
of extra work to get it to work so it's

00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:35,990
a lot easier to make a child theme if

00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:37,670
you just need a child theme yeah also

00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:40,610
when you you're dealing with plugins

00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:42,230
versus the standard child themes you

00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:45,950
lose a lot of the built-in GUI

00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:48,710
automation so for instance like being

00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:50,210
able to go in and customize under

00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:52,190
appearance all those options and

00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:53,660
customized for the themes you don't get

00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,490
those with the plugins with the plugins

00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,930
everything has to sort of be or you have

00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:59,390
to build the GUI yourself through your

00:34:56,930 --> 00:35:00,890
plugin in your plug-in settings but

00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:03,440
otherwise you know if you stick with a

00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:05,000
child theme you get the advantage of any

00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:13,000
of that gooey stuff that the parent

00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:16,000
theme has built-in so if we have a one

00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
yep

00:35:24,829 --> 00:35:31,260
for the templates you mean yeah so in

00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:33,180
the grandchild theme here actually I

00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:36,500
have it up right now so you'll create a

00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:38,880
function to check your templates folder

00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:40,470
before it checks the other one and so

00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,000
here this that's what this function is

00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:45,150
doing here it's checking if the file

00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,160
exists then use our file instead of

00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:50,040
WooCommerce Azur the WooCommerce child

00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:51,720
theme and so in this manner you can

00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,760
create that templates directory and then

00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:56,990
anything you copy over just like with a

00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,109
child theme will overwrite that template

00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:00,890
mm-hmm

00:35:58,109 --> 00:36:04,020
it's important to note though that again

00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:05,400
these the functions that you put in here

00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:08,160
are not going to overwrite the

00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,329
WooCommerce functions so those what

00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,430
you'll have to do is you'll have to

00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:13,770
create a custom function with a custom

00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:15,570
name and then in the template call your

00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:17,820
function instead of WooCommerce as if

00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:21,140
you're modifying the functions but the

00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:21,140
template files you can do this way

00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:30,180
any other questions all right well then

00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:32,200
I guess we can be first in line for

00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:41,010
lunch

00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:41,010
oh yeah I'm sorry yes that's fine

00:36:44,309 --> 00:36:50,980
I'm Guttenberg is that a theme Oh

00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:51,400
Jenny's raising her hand yay thanks

00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:58,140
Jenny

00:36:51,400 --> 00:37:00,490
I have not used Guttenberg so okay so

00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:03,460
this is gonna be the fastest talk on

00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:05,349
Guttenberg sorry Beth so Goodson burg

00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:08,079
for everyone who's doing WordPress or

00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:10,809
even using WordPress is a new editor

00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:13,900
that's coming into custom into WordPress

00:37:10,809 --> 00:37:16,180
so if you go to the admin panel of

00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:18,130
WordPress and then go to an edit post or

00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:20,349
an edit page there is going to be a new

00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:22,869
interface and that is what the project

00:37:20,349 --> 00:37:24,339
name is called Guttenberg and so if

00:37:22,869 --> 00:37:26,950
you're in the WordPress community at the

00:37:24,339 --> 00:37:27,940
moment you would you will hear people

00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:30,430
talking about gusenberg

00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:32,829
and the government book editor so the

00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:34,690
one that we currently have in core is

00:37:32,829 --> 00:37:36,849
called the classical editor the classic

00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:41,740
editor and what will happen in WordPress

00:37:36,849 --> 00:37:44,470
5 which will happen at some point is

00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:46,900
that Guttenberg will become core

00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:48,880
WordPress 5 will not ship until

00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:52,000
Guttenberg is ready so that's gonna be a

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:54,609
big deal now there was a massive massive

00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,770
argument going into whether the way when

00:37:54,609 --> 00:38:00,790
they ship it especially of cousin book 5

00:37:56,770 --> 00:38:03,369
WordPress 5 will depend on whether it

00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:05,380
will actually have Guttenberg on by

00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:08,079
default and just switch everything over

00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:10,119
or if it'll detect whether it's an old

00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,710
site and therefore only new

00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:13,930
installations will have gotten book on

00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:16,630
by default there is a book plug-in

00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:19,270
called Guttenberg free which basically

00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:20,559
deactivates Guttenberg and you can if

00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:23,410
you are looking at WordPress at the

00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:25,530
moment and you thinking about new newer

00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:28,180
projects then there's the Guttenberg

00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:30,250
project as a feature plug-in in the

00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:33,190
plug-in repo and you can use that to

00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:36,609
like test it out there's also a website

00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:38,349
cord from fronton burg because we like

00:38:36,609 --> 00:38:41,880
our puns in the WordPress community it's

00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:45,490
a my friends site for to Fulton burg Tom

00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,940
J and I think dotnet which actually

00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:48,550
allows you

00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:51,310
to test out Guttenberg in the front end

00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:54,280
it's purely to do a demo it's not

00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:57,040
something that we recommend but there

00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:58,329
are speculations that basically we're

00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,700
going through a whole entire rewrite of

00:38:58,329 --> 00:39:04,780
the whole WordPress admin interface to

00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:08,950
not only surpass stuff like Wix

00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:10,990
Squarespace and what's the other one

00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:12,880
medium and it's gonna be like a new

00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:14,200
thing and that's where the whole reacts

00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:18,579
conversation came into play with

00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:22,180
WordPress and all this crazy stuff but

00:39:18,579 --> 00:39:24,970
yeah that is a thing Isis personally

00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:26,710
suspect there was a someone through

00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:28,480
around that Gutenberg was coming to

00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:29,770
court on April the 1st and I pointed out

00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,270
that's April's fool day and it will

00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:34,540
never flow

00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:36,700
I suspect the end of the year is more

00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:38,319
likely and there's like massive

00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:40,869
discussions in fact I'm part of a

00:39:38,319 --> 00:39:42,369
project in two weeks where we're gonna

00:39:40,869 --> 00:39:44,319
be talking about gusenberg and though

00:39:42,369 --> 00:39:45,609
it's gonna be like online gusenberg

00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:47,349
discussions about how it's gonna affect

00:39:45,609 --> 00:39:49,359
like the whole entire WordPress

00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:51,310
ecosystem because it affects page

00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:53,319
builders like themes all the whole nine

00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:57,190
nodes are the saying that themes is the

00:39:53,319 --> 00:39:58,839
least problematic point because like

00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:00,130
this is all in the admin section and

00:39:58,839 --> 00:40:01,450
that front end actually doesn't really

00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:04,150
make a difference is still taking out

00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:09,099
data from the same way but we're still

00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:12,220
super super super super super proud of

00:40:09,099 --> 00:40:14,500
our backwards compact standpoint so that

00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:18,369
is being fought tooth and nail at the

00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:21,010
moment so don't panic too much it's what

00:40:18,369 --> 00:40:22,420
is again so the classic editor will stay

00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:24,069
in for at least the foreseeable future

00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,839
as well so you'll have an option to

00:40:24,069 --> 00:40:27,640
choose yeah you'll lock me up since

00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:29,440
issues and the idea is obviously we

00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:31,540
there's so many WordPress out sites out

00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,520
there that have the old version of

00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:34,960
WordPress and our clients are just not

00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,700
going to pay us to like update to

00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,250
Guttenberg so that's where the pain

00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:41,050
point is so the idea is that hopefully

00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:42,730
personally I would hope that we'd be

00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:44,260
able to detective you're already got at

00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:46,780
least like because the meta box is and

00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:48,990
you can confer over then you can just

00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:52,329
like turn on the classical editor

00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:54,520
enabler or ideally what we want as

00:40:52,329 --> 00:40:57,040
developers is actually do at the convict

00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:59,330
level so in BB config okay but that's

00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:01,220
all been debated at the moment

00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:04,280
the debates pretty hot at the moment if

00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:05,420
you're in the WordPress ecosystem as PHP

00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,890
developers if you don't need to care

00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:08,480
about it just let them argue because

00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:11,720
there's plenty of agencies arguing on

00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:13,100
your behalf I tend to try to let other

00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,570
people just argue about it and let me

00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,640
know when you make a decision yeah yeah

00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:18,230
I will let you all know what is this a

00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,610
thing but the one of the reasons why I

00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:21,770
haven't started giving talk some good

00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:23,960
some back in the old PHP community yeah

00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:25,610
it's because it's just it's far too much

00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,930
hassle and it's not settled down so once

00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:28,310
it starts that something down then

00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:30,200
that's where you'll start seeing

00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:31,520
Guttenberg being really pushed forward

00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,260
because you everyone will need to know

00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,510
about it but there's lots of stuff like

00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:38,990
metal boxes have been putted over and

00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:41,270
Mullen Works has said that it needs to

00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:43,130
be feature complete so it has to do

00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:45,080
everything the classical editors now

00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:47,180
before we can even consider ship in it

00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,920
and usually we wouldn't ship it straight

00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:50,060
away because the whole of the community

00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,370
team needs to then then tell everyone

00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:53,660
hey we are going to ship this so there's

00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:56,030
gonna there's there needs to be a grace

00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:59,390
period as well otherwise we'll just make

00:41:56,030 --> 00:42:01,180
lots of people angry is there a way to

00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:04,730
avoid that

00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:06,830
no but its new its new its shiny is

00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:08,420
supercool and the other thing is like

00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:10,700
with the Guttenberg and please don't be

00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:12,650
afraid of it because with WordPress

00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:14,480
the last time we upgraded the admin

00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:16,130
panel was like before I started on

00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,950
WordPress and that was a long time ago

00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:21,050
so when we changed some finish it's a

00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:22,580
change for a very long time so that's

00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:23,930
why there's lots of considerations even

00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:26,060
the accessibility team haven't got their

00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:27,560
hands on it yet because they keep on

00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,700
alliterate in what's going into

00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,410
Guttenberg so they're like the

00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:31,970
accessibility team I'm like it's

00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:34,370
pointless of us trying to make it

00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:35,300
accessible until it's settled and we

00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:40,910
know what we're trying to make

00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:46,550
accessible sure cool there you go it's

00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:50,870
an important topic you know yeah awesome

00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:53,170
you're welcome all right any other

00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:58,160
questions

00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:59,540
all right well again the resources you

00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,000
can look at those later I do have my

00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:03,500
slides posted if you do think of a

00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,090
question later or you'd like to talk to

00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,650
me about mentoring or apprenticeships or

00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:07,310
user groups or anything you can find me

00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:11,090
on Twitter
