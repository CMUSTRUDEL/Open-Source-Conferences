Title: PHP UK Conference 2018 - Derick Rethans - Introduction to PHP Extensions
Publication date: 2018-03-27
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2018
Description: 
	n this presentation, we take a first look at writing PHP extensions. Using step-by-step examples, we'll take a function written in PHP and convert them into a loadable extension using C. We'll then test both versions and compare the results. After seeing the size and scope of the benefits that can be realized with only a few minor changes, you'll want to try it out for yourself. You'll also understand why we start with simple things, and not try to rewrite all of Symfony in C.
