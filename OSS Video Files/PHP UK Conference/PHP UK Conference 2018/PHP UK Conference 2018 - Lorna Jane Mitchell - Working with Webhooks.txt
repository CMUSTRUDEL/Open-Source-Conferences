Title: PHP UK Conference 2018 - Lorna Jane Mitchell - Working with Webhooks
Publication date: 2018-03-27
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2018
Description: 
	In an increasingly connected world, APIs are key to great tools and effective workflows. What is better than an API? A webhook of course! Webhooks are a key building block of a modern application, allowing systems to exchange data in response to events. This session gives examples of webhooks currently in use ""in the wild"", and examines both when a webhook is useful and the internal design and structuring of webhook payloads. We'll discuss how to work with webhooks in a scalable way regardless of technology stack; how to receive and process incoming webhooks from an external system and how to design and publish your own for use by partners or consumers. Recommended for anyone wanting to teach their applications to play nicely with others.
