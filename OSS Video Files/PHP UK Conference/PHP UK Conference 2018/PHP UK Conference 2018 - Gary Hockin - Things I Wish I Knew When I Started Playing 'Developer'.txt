Title: PHP UK Conference 2018 - Gary Hockin - Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Playing 'Developer'
Publication date: 2018-03-27
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2018
Description: 
	I'm a gamer, and some of my favourite articles to read about computer games are those click-bait posts that read "Ten Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Playing Pac-Man!". When you're playing computer games, it's easy to miss things that are obvious to others, and these posts can help you to understand a simple game mechanic that you'd otherwise have not used. It got me thinking about the things in my own career that I found out about too late, or didn't fully understand until much later than I needed it. We'll cover both the technical and the conversational, so join me, as I introduce you to Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Playing "Developer".

	00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:09,139
this is things I wish I'd known earlier

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,129
when I started playing developer also

00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:13,679
alternative titles could have been

00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:15,269
casinos will hit you when you learn

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,630
these simple tricks will prove your

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:20,340
developer life or maybe I followed these

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:26,250
simple developer hacks and you won't

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:30,420
believe what happened next hello hello

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,860
I'm Gary yeah I came back they had me

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,600
back from last year's keynote so thank

00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:36,660
you very much for that I'm pretty

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,579
excited to be here I love playing

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,390
computer game oh hello

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:44,850
I love playing computer games I have a

00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:46,800
podcast to talk about computer games I

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,000
really enjoy playing computer games and

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,470
if you were at my keynote last year

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,960
you'll know that I like to talk about

00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:54,059
games unfortunately I'm really really

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,500
bad at playing computer games but

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:57,239
somebody who loves to play them so much

00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,570
I'm terrible at actually playing the

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,200
games

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,670
so like I've got really bad hand-eye

00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,899
coordination and I'm not quick enough on

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,460
the on the controller or on the mouse

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,320
and keyboard I'm not very good at it so

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:11,220
I tend to spend a lot of my time

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,500
googling for phrases like this to try

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,229
and get a little help and understand and

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,580
improve my gameplay inability so this is

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:18,270
a pretty common thing if you play

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,950
computer games

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,560
if you don't play a lot of computer

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,680
games and this could be a long talk to

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,619
him sorry but I'll try and sort of keep

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,000
it to a minimum but I tend to do a lot

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:31,619
of googling for things like this things

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,689
I wish I knew earlier when I was playing

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,610
and the game this is particularly useful

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:37,470
in sort of role-playing games or games

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,760
where there's lots of hidden contents

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,310
you can go and find that cool hidden

00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,979
content and the reason I think this is

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,780
kind of important is because if you're

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,340
playing pac-man and you've you from a

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,259
generation like I am where you know you

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,670
remember playing this as a kid it's

00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:52,650
pretty obvious what you have to do right

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,210
you have to eat the little dots and stop

00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,619
the ghosts from from killing you

00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,619
but if you've never played this before

00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,939
and if you come to the game from fresh

00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:02,460
it's not actually that obvious what you

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:04,770
have to do things are only obvious when

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,270
you actually know them so things that

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,340
may be obvious to me and not obvious to

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,689
somebody else and it's kind of important

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,430
you know oh look I didn't even realize

00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:13,470
that when I eat this this little white

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,090
dot now I can go and eat the ghosts you

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,930
know when you when you know it it's

00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,930
obvious but when

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:21,150
don't it's difficult and I think it's

00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,829
important for me to think that this is

00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,810
definitely something that I feel like in

00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:26,700
my career there's so many things that I

00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,769
wished I'd started doing or wished I'd

00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,480
known earlier in my development career

00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:35,150
so we're going to just cover a few with

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:39,299
us today I'm not shaking it yeah I am

00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:40,980
mm-hmm and so the first thing I think

00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:41,730
these are in no particular order of

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,379
importance

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,719
they just how they randomly came out of

00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:47,430
my consciousness so the first thing I

00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:49,590
think is really important is to put some

00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:53,400
points into charisma so again with the

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,750
the tedious game in analogies when you

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,459
create a character in a game like this

00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,200
anyone know we will have some stroke to

00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,419
know games again today I think anyone

00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,419
know what this game is follow four

00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:05,370
rights of classic so I I typically never

00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:06,599
ever put any points in charisma when I'm

00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,889
creating a character I'm like I don't

00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:10,139
care about that you know I want to be

00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:12,030
strong or accurate or lucky I don't

00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:13,650
really care about the charisma and when

00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,090
I say in your career to put some points

00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:19,290
into charisma what I'm not talking about

00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:21,299
is things like being more of an

00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:23,280
extrovert and talking to people and you

00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:25,859
know that's not what I mean at all you

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,419
know it's difficult for people to to

00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:29,940
just sort of start conversations that's

00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:32,519
not what I'm saying I'm saying to try

00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:35,180
and make your interactions with other

00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:38,310
developers in your in your daily job

00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:39,780
more friendly and more thoughtful I

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,939
guess that's what I'm saying here so

00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,409
we've all had conversations you know

00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:45,299
maybe we're trying to think about how

00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:48,030
we're gonna solve this new problem in in

00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:49,259
in our job and somebody makes an idea

00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,540
and you're like in your mind you're like

00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:54,299
that's a really bad idea you know that

00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,979
it's not a great idea you know this is

00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:57,509
the stupidest idea I've ever heard is

00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:00,120
what you're thinking and it's how you

00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:01,859
kind of push that along how you make

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,269
that statement to your colleagues and

00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:05,489
you've got you know your friends and

00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:06,659
your that your bosses and and the people

00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:09,150
you're working with is the most

00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:12,150
important thing and it took me it took

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:14,430
me an embarrassingly long time to figure

00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,799
out that if I just said oh that's a bad

00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,449
idea you know it didn't really go down

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,359
well with my with my colleagues

00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:22,560
whereas if I phrase it another way you

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,539
know I'm not I'm not particularly sure

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,620
about that idea but have you considered

00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:29,580
this idea you're much more receptive to

00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,139
your call

00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,629
again this may sound really really

00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:36,150
obvious but it took me a long time this

00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:38,250
is like a bit unnerving but we will see

00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,719
what happens it took me a long time to

00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,699
figure that out right come back with

00:04:39,719 --> 00:04:44,840
another idea that you think improves

00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:47,280
upon the idea that's given rather than

00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:50,729
just saying you know that's it does it

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,620
now that's a terrible idea sometimes we

00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:55,469
have to say no though you know sometimes

00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,330
we really do have to say to our to even

00:04:55,469 --> 00:04:59,159
to our superiors in in the office

00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,539
environment or you know our careers

00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:03,000
sometimes say you know is the right

00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:06,180
thing to do and it's important to to

00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,650
realise that saying no is definitely

00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,949
something that you need to learn to do

00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:12,710
this is really flickery and scary but we

00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:15,599
still have slides it's all good

00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:19,940
so yeah just saying no is sometimes what

00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:19,940
you really really need to actually say

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:28,469
don't be that person who says horrible

00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:30,150
things but then prefaces it with you

00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:31,469
know me I'm a straight talker I tell it

00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,000
like it is you know being a straight

00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:36,120
talker it's no excuse of being a dick

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,509
you just have to try and be nice in your

00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,710
in your daily interactions and yes try

00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:42,270
and be honest yes

00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,219
trying and and be a straight talker

00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:47,069
because things get solved quicker but

00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:49,319
just try and be nice and sometimes you

00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:50,490
you do have to be a bit of a dick to get

00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:52,500
things done and that is the

00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,969
contradiction here you know sometimes

00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,219
being too nice doesn't really achieve

00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:57,960
what you want to do I'm not saying get

00:05:56,219 --> 00:05:59,699
walked over by people is basically what

00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,860
I mean yeah I'm not trying to say you

00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:04,919
know always be nice at the expensive of

00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,419
of your career and your perception so

00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:08,639
sometimes we don't have to be too nice

00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:10,889
but really try and be as nice as you can

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,110
and this is definitely something I've

00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:15,300
struggled with in my career and this

00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:18,029
kind of done the runs on Twitter a few

00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,860
years ago listening to someone is not

00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:23,789
just waiting for them to finish so you

00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,469
can make your cool point and I I'll put

00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:26,819
my hands up and say you know guys I've

00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:28,650
been there where I'm not really

00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,729
listening to what the person saying

00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,740
anymore I'm just waiting for them to

00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:34,349
finish so I can make my really witty

00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:36,060
comeback remark and that's not listening

00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:37,919
because you tune out halfway through the

00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,199
sentence you think in your mind you know

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,569
where the sentences go in there for you

00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,080
kind of tuned out well really you don't

00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,430
really know

00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,139
because once you've tuned out you don't

00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,289
know how that that sentence is finished

00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:50,430
so this is definitely something I've

00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:52,800
consciously tried to work on over the

00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:54,990
fat past few years to try and engage in

00:06:52,800 --> 00:07:05,610
conversation rather than it just be two

00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:07,729
people talking at each other so my next

00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:10,470
tip is to quick save regularly and

00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:12,030
there's no excuses in this modern day if

00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:14,699
you're if you're as old as me then you

00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:17,099
you'll remember like saving the game was

00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:19,259
a real pain to actually do every time

00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:21,120
after swap disks and put the other disk

00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:22,590
in and I even remember having to save

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,289
games onto tape which is a whole

00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:27,090
different problem but there's no excuse

00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:28,710
now we can quick saving games regularly

00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:31,080
we can work f5 and then when we

00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:32,969
inevitably you know overreach and and

00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,919
end up failing something we can come

00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:36,840
back and quit gloat and of course the

00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:38,669
obvious analogy here would be like

00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,969
version control is your is your quick

00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:43,259
save so commit into version control

00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:45,030
regularly means that you have points

00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:46,979
where you can get back to if you your

00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:50,690
experimentation goes wrong that's kind

00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:52,949
of the obvious analogy but you know I

00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:55,169
used to use Dropbox of version control

00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:56,840
so I'm not saying to use Dropbox but use

00:07:55,169 --> 00:08:00,029
something that you would actually

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,159
probably get the the obvious knowledge

00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:03,810
is not what I went for because I wanted

00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:05,159
to really shoehorn something about unit

00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:08,460
test and in your so I guess I've

00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:10,830
tediously linked data quick saving but

00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,840
for me like it is almost like a

00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:14,969
quicksave having a unit test suite or a

00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,259
test suite not necessarily a unit test

00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:18,870
suite is something I really really

00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:21,719
really wish I'd learned about much

00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:23,580
earlier in my development career it's a

00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:25,710
big step to take I don't you know I'm

00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:28,529
not gonna sort of judge anybody who's

00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:30,210
not doing automated testing but I just

00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:33,419
really encourage you to give it a go

00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:35,370
because if you've ever had that feeling

00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,680
where you've written a new feature and

00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:39,539
you've tested it yourself manually you

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,849
know you've gone you wiped their five a

00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:42,719
million times and filled the forms in

00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:44,610
and checked everything in the

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,380
validations are working and then you

00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:48,720
hear that codes gonna get deployed to

00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:50,300
production and you still have that it'll

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,279
feel in in the pit of your stomach

00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:55,380
you're like I'm pretty sure I've test

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,889
this really well but I'm not a hundred

00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,720
percent

00:08:55,889 --> 00:08:59,359
it's going to production and orgies you

00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,889
know is everything gonna be alright

00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:03,290
that's the time where you need to step

00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:07,049
into the realms of automated testing

00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:09,989
100% I'm saying automated testing

00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:12,029
because I don't think you know unit

00:09:09,989 --> 00:09:14,160
tests can be a scary place to start and

00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:15,929
maybe acceptance testing is a good place

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,569
to start if you have an existing product

00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:21,269
if you have an existing project and you

00:09:18,569 --> 00:09:22,829
just want to get some of this safety net

00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:24,929
under you to make sure whether every

00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:26,850
time you deploy to production you don't

00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:29,189
have to have that horrible feeling then

00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,600
maybe a browser-based acceptance test

00:09:29,189 --> 00:09:34,169
week would be a really nice place for

00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,059
you to start the the resources that

00:09:34,169 --> 00:09:38,790
actually got me over the hump were were

00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:41,369
chris hatches books I am on commission

00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:43,470
so use my referral link if you if you're

00:09:41,369 --> 00:09:45,689
going to buy the books but these are

00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:47,369
honestly I swear I'm not just Chris as a

00:09:45,689 --> 00:09:50,100
friend of mine but they genuinely got me

00:09:47,369 --> 00:09:52,259
over the the bump of understanding what

00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,970
automated testing is and why it's useful

00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:56,069
and why you should be doing it this is a

00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:58,230
really nice book the minimum viable

00:09:56,069 --> 00:10:00,509
tests because it it really concentrates

00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:03,919
on the minimum you need to do which is

00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:03,919
kind of a really nice place to start

00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:12,480
yeah so the next tip is definitely play

00:10:09,749 --> 00:10:15,149
with friends these games are much more

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:20,059
fun if you end up play and playing with

00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:23,639
friends excuse me I forgot to ask what

00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:25,619
game that is anyone out life right yeah

00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:28,949
the original cool sorry so playing

00:10:25,619 --> 00:10:34,589
friends is really really good and anyone

00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:36,149
know this game pub G yeah yeah let's not

00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:38,040
talk about that because I am I'm

00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:39,079
actually having flashbacks of the horrid

00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,449
s of it right now

00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:43,589
this is pub G is about the Royal game

00:10:42,449 --> 00:10:45,179
this kind of really popular at the

00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:46,350
moment playing with friends to me is

00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:47,789
something that I've definitely in my

00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:50,459
career wise you know what I'm talking

00:10:47,789 --> 00:10:51,989
about here is we're all at this amazing

00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:54,559
conference there's a roomful of

00:10:51,989 --> 00:10:56,579
developers you who face the same

00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:59,100
challenges that you do in your daily job

00:10:56,579 --> 00:11:01,289
who who have the same frustrations and

00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,329
have the same problems and being able to

00:11:01,289 --> 00:11:06,119
talk about that stuff with with peers is

00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:08,960
absolutely amazing and the people I've

00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:11,570
met through working in PHP I

00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,550
count several of them as friends real

00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:15,410
friends not sort of conference friends

00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,970
but proper friends who I'd like to see

00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:19,060
if I'm not even out of conference so I

00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:22,040
really really think it's important to

00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:24,400
play to do this job with other people

00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:27,080
the other thing that I would mention is

00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:30,230
there's this concept in in online

00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:32,150
role-playing called a twink where high

00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:34,430
level characters who've been playing the

00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,750
game for a long long time will help

00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:37,580
their friends out who were new to the

00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,930
game by sort of giving them items and

00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,640
running them through through dungeons

00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,960
and doing all this stuff to really help

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,550
them out when they're the new to the

00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,980
game and I think that's a really good

00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:49,040
analogy as well because certainly there

00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:50,660
are people in my career who've kind of

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,540
reached down and helped and pulled me up

00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:54,710
towards their level and I meant we're

00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,960
talking about really a mentoring

00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:58,370
relationship but I don't think it needs

00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,170
to be a really formal mentoring

00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:02,450
relationship there is if you really do

00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:05,750
want a formal mentoring relationship

00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:08,750
then PHP mentoring is a really good

00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:12,110
resource um your mileage may vary I

00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:15,260
don't I'm not confident that having a

00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:17,300
mentor of somebody random that you've

00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:19,340
kind of met online with no pre-existing

00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,500
relationship is the best way to do this

00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:24,440
I don't think that those tend to work

00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:26,570
out as well some people have had great

00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,240
success with that sort of former so

00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:31,640
again you know it's up to you but I I

00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:34,460
think it's harder to find a good mentor

00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:36,980
on a site like PHP mentoring or you know

00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:38,480
through Twitter or through slack or IRC

00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:41,240
or whatever you use and then it is if

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,640
you have relationships in the real world

00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:47,090
I I genuinely believe that it doesn't

00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:50,240
actually have to be that this mentor is

00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:52,070
this big formal mentor apprentice or

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,920
whatever you use the other side of the

00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:56,530
mentor mentee I don't know it doesn't

00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,390
need to be this hugely formal

00:12:56,530 --> 00:13:01,640
relationship I count several people as

00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:03,500
my mentors who have helped me through my

00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,570
career but it's never kind of been this

00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,100
formal structured thing there may be

00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:08,840
somebody in your office you think are

00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,280
you know they they they do really good

00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,590
work I wish I could do work like that

00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:15,320
and just just ask them just say you know

00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:17,270
I I really like some some help is there

00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,280
any chance that we can we can have this

00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,510
kind of mentor relationship it works

00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,420
more often than you'd be you'd be

00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:24,800
surprised

00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:27,260
again just to go back you don't need

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,390
this formal mentoring relationship we're

00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:31,880
at a conference you're all sat in these

00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:33,920
amazing roundtable situation you just

00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,900
just talk to people make friends within

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,360
the community and leverage those

00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:40,460
friendships to help you to to get

00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,820
through you know your job in your career

00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:45,100
that's really important the one thing

00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:48,050
I'll say you weren't talking about

00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:52,839
friendships mentorship is it all

00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:55,910
revolves around asking questions and

00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:57,670
asking questions can be really really

00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:59,690
difficult for lots of people me included

00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,220
you'd never know it because I ask

00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:03,380
questions every single day now I'm

00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:05,360
almost too lazy or I'll try and solve a

00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,710
problem by asking a question of a friend

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,279
rather than trying to solve the problem

00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:09,230
myself

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,839
but when I first started out in this

00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:14,779
community asking questions was a really

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,980
really difficult thing for me to do you

00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:18,380
know it's fine

00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:20,510
to not know things and it's fine to ask

00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:24,710
people for help if you don't know things

00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:26,060
but there's always this problem where

00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:27,980
you you ask somebody for help

00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:29,660
particularly I think in an office

00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,940
environment or in a work environment

00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,589
that when you do ask for help you're

00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:35,870
worried that you're revealing a weakness

00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:37,370
in yourself you're worried that oh I'm

00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:39,320
asking a question here I'm gonna look

00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:41,360
like I'm an idiot people are gonna know

00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,400
that I don't know these things and

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,230
that's a you know there's a it's a

00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:49,010
recognized imposter syndrome it's a

00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:51,020
recognized trait I would suggest more

00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,850
people in this room have felt that than

00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:55,970
happened so it's completely normal

00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:57,740
it's really difficult to get over but

00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,360
asking questions is the way to

00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,580
fast-track your career really you know

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,350
ask questions make friendships and try

00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,839
and get some kind of mentor relationship

00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:07,370
it'll really really help you out I wish

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:14,560
I'd done that a lot a lot sooner

00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:18,620
personally so this is a really quick tip

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:21,230
I haven't just shoehorned in an idea

00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:26,660
into a convoluted gaming metaphor

00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:28,640
honestly but play online so does anyone

00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:32,000
know this we had pub G anyone know this

00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:33,920
good for tonight right yeah so weirdly I

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,360
just grabbed some screenshots of a

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,510
freeze to use off the internet that's

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,339
got me in the corner even though I was

00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:41,870
playing a surprise I wore I just found a

00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:44,360
screenshot with myself in it it is not

00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:46,160
actually me we um got slides but it's

00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,980
fine I can waffle on forever without

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,300
sight so it's not a problem what I'm

00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,250
trying to see you when I say play online

00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,420
is it's really challenging to play

00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,490
online because you're playing against

00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:59,660
other real-life players rather than play

00:15:55,490 --> 00:16:01,730
in single-player and what I'm trying to

00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,560
say here is it's difficult but you learn

00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:05,570
much quicker because you you put

00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,630
yourself into that difficult situation

00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:10,820
so we say drop hot when we play in these

00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:12,740
games that means drop into an area where

00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:15,290
there's loads of people it's tempting to

00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:16,760
sort of skirt around the out you know if

00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,260
you're playing pub G is tempting to land

00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,970
somewhere really quiet so you won't see

00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:21,890
any other players early which is great

00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:23,209
but you just waste 20 minutes and then

00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:25,370
get sniped from across the map without

00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:27,320
ever seeing anyone the way to learn

00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:29,390
really quickly is to put yourself into

00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,430
the difficult situation to move outside

00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:33,890
of your comfort zone and that's kind of

00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:35,209
the point I'm trying to make is jumping

00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:37,010
in at the deep end like if you're trying

00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:39,230
to learn a new framework you absolutely

00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:41,480
need to understand the basics but going

00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:43,040
through a blog tutorial is going to

00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,510
teach you the basics but not a lot more

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,449
trying to solve your own real-life

00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:49,550
problems is the way to learn things much

00:16:47,449 --> 00:16:51,680
quicker I think I think you're much

00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:59,959
better off to do the difficult thing

00:16:51,680 --> 00:17:01,730
early you'll learn a lot faster so the

00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:04,040
next step is about learning the

00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:07,640
mechanics so with my wonderful game and

00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:11,270
analogy understanding how the mechanics

00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:14,240
of a game work allow you to be better at

00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:19,309
that game quicker and does anyone know

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:21,199
this wonderful game anyone know yeah

00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:24,290
it's EVE Online yeah spreadsheets and

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,240
space so this is this is a genuine

00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:28,520
screenshot of an EVE Online battle it's

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,470
it's a crazy crazy crazy crazy game and

00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,090
it's the best one I could find to to

00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:34,400
illustrate this when I talk about

00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:36,950
learning the mechanics I mean I'm really

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,320
learned talking about learning I think

00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:40,970
that for my personal experience I really

00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,520
wished I learned about design patterns

00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:46,429
earlier on in my in my career so design

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,010
patterns are just reusable ways of

00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:51,130
solving common problems in

00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:53,470
I mean it sounds much more scary than it

00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:55,540
is this is the typical the Gang of Four

00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:59,890
book that is typically held up is to be

00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:02,290
the kind of the design pattern Bible so

00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:04,750
to speak but I I mean I couldn't really

00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:07,180
read that I'll be honest it's a bit too

00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,570
convoluted and a bit too dry for my

00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:10,750
taste

00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:12,430
so I I mean design happens will really

00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:14,110
really really help you out in your daily

00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:16,330
job and you don't need to be scared

00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:18,250
because they have crazily crazy names

00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:20,980
that make them sound complicated they're

00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:23,320
really simple ideas packaged in a way

00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:25,330
that for some reason makes them sound

00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,860
really complicated dependency injection

00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:28,210
sounds like this really intimidating

00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:31,300
thing but it's a really really simple

00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:33,610
concept and you don't have to know every

00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:37,180
design path then right down to the sort

00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:39,580
of computer science scientific level you

00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:41,230
just need to understand generally what

00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:44,460
they are and what problems they help you

00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:46,930
solve that's all you need um I I learned

00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,850
about design patterns from Anthony

00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:51,280
ferry's YouTube channel they're really

00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:53,170
old dated videos now but the design

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,850
patterns haven't changed so they're

00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:57,010
still really really good I highly

00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:58,810
recommend you can't put a youtube link

00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,340
on a slide so just search you YouTube

00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:03,370
for programming with Anthony and there's

00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:05,350
a ton of YouTube videos that Anthony did

00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,460
that just really easily introduce you

00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,410
into design patterns really

00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:11,050
unintimidating pretty cool

00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:14,440
there's a good Lara casts series on

00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:17,940
design patterns as well take those as

00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:20,650
you find them they're not they're not

00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:22,150
exactly how I would interpret some of

00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:24,070
the design patterns but it's a really

00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:25,630
good resource at the end of the day if

00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:28,030
you're if you're learning about these

00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:29,860
tools to help you to solve your your

00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:31,600
daily problems you know it's all good

00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:35,320
however however they called it doesn't

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:38,380
matter the big scary thing for me about

00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:40,510
design patterns is that once you see and

00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:42,790
learn the design patterns I tend to then

00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:44,170
see these problems everywhere and end up

00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:45,550
using these design patterns because I

00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:47,740
know them I'm like oh yeah I will solve

00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:49,960
that with a proxy or will solve it with

00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:51,400
you know this or that when all you have

00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:55,270
is a hammer everything looks like a nail

00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:57,310
so I do say to use them as you know

00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:59,380
always learn them always use them but

00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:02,080
sometimes you know you know you may be

00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:03,790
being a bit convoluted to solve

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,500
because you like to use this new shiny

00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:08,530
thing that you've learnt I definitely

00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:10,450
did that for a long time the other thing

00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:13,810
we talk about really with mechanics as

00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:16,150
best practices most best practices are

00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:18,340
best for a reason it's a really

00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,790
opinionated thing the word best it's not

00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,890
less

00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:24,070
your best may not be necessarily my best

00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:25,960
but I think most of the things that have

00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:28,630
floated up to be best practices have

00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:32,800
done so through years and years of

00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:34,420
people using these practices and they've

00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,460
come before us it's like almost like

00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:39,070
standing on the shoulders of giants we

00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:40,900
are we are working on practices the

00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:44,050
people before us have decided our best

00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:47,080
for a reason definitely use them if you

00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:51,490
don't you know not everybody actually

00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:52,930
wants to use the PSR called in style

00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:54,490
because maybe you don't you know you

00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:57,880
don't like your curly braces on the same

00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:59,080
line in that place it's it's easy then

00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,060
if you to say now we're gonna use our

00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:03,160
own cord in style but when we're all

00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,780
using the same cord in style after

00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,880
you've got used to the new cord in style

00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:09,010
read in anybody else's cord becomes so

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,110
much easier there's a reason that we

00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:12,820
want best practices in the industry

00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:16,510
there's a reason we want standards in

00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:20,650
the industry so definitely use them or

00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:23,470
don't I mean it's your project right but

00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:26,530
I would definitely think to use them as

00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:28,300
much as as much as possible again I was

00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:30,160
definitely guilty early in my career of

00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,630
thinking I you know I could that's not

00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:34,500
right that's outdated way of doing

00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:34,500
things I could do things better

00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:45,259
yeah playing other games is that I get

00:21:42,649 --> 00:21:47,440
so infuriated at a point where I'm

00:21:45,259 --> 00:21:49,519
repeatedly failing to do something

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:53,389
switch off and won't play something else

00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:55,399
so this is as a really really bad gamer

00:21:53,389 --> 00:21:57,019
this is probably the worst game I've

00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:59,450
ever played for me personally there's

00:21:57,019 --> 00:22:03,129
anyone know this game kappahd yeah right

00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:05,779
so I so hard it's the hardest game ever

00:22:03,129 --> 00:22:09,110
obviously what I'm trying to say is - I

00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:12,200
really feel like trying trying out other

00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:13,700
languages outside of PHP gives you a

00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,399
really really interesting perspective

00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:18,320
when you come back to PHP when and I

00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:21,259
don't mean sort of learning languages to

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:24,230
the same level that you know PHP I just

00:22:21,259 --> 00:22:26,809
mean just you know dip your toe into a

00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:28,340
different language understand what what

00:22:26,809 --> 00:22:30,139
problems could place and solve me that

00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:32,419
I'm not you know that makes it easier

00:22:30,139 --> 00:22:34,999
than PHP what problems could go or Swift

00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:37,129
or Java or whatever just look at what

00:22:34,999 --> 00:22:41,139
problems other languages can solve if

00:22:37,129 --> 00:22:44,629
nothing else you you'll come back to PHP

00:22:41,139 --> 00:22:46,190
with a renewed sort of appreciation of

00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:48,019
what it does well you'll also have a

00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:50,809
renewed appreciation of what it does

00:22:48,019 --> 00:22:52,369
badly but that's for another day you

00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:54,049
really well you come back to PHP and you

00:22:52,369 --> 00:22:56,269
go yep do you know what this shared

00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:58,340
nothing architecture actually makes life

00:22:56,269 --> 00:23:01,279
a hell of a lot easier than you know the

00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:03,169
alternative so definitely I would really

00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:05,720
recommend anyone if you feel like odd

00:23:03,169 --> 00:23:08,119
you know I fancy trying out go for a

00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,470
while just go out and give it a go that

00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:18,470
was a terrible pattern that I didn't

00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:20,360
even I do apologize I'm actually because

00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:22,999
I really really like badly typed

00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:25,159
languages that you can interspersed into

00:23:22,999 --> 00:23:27,019
HTML I'm moving into working in back-end

00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:30,470
JavaScript for a while so I'm really

00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:32,809
excited to do that believe it or not ya

00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:34,549
know types for the wind I think but I'm

00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:37,129
really excited to do it because I'd like

00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:39,860
to know more about what problems that

00:23:37,129 --> 00:23:41,570
solves and then come back to PHP with an

00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:43,190
understanding of how we could maybe do

00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:47,149
things slightly differently we've got a

00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:48,649
lot of influence from Java in PHP for

00:23:47,149 --> 00:23:51,259
better or for worse that's something

00:23:48,649 --> 00:23:52,310
that seems to be getting only more so as

00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:54,050
time goes on

00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:59,690
so maybe learning a bit of Java could be

00:23:54,050 --> 00:24:07,160
really really helpful so here we go my

00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:11,720
favorite tip of the day cheat if all

00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:14,570
else fails cheat does anyone know this

00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:17,660
game yes Cutlass gonna come straight

00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:19,940
with a wallhack yeah

00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:22,550
cheating I've definitely learned a few

00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:25,610
sort of tips that I would consider to be

00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:27,830
cheating over the years this is not

00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:29,480
going to be like you know anything to do

00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:31,340
with hacking in and changing your grades

00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,130
or anything you know nothing to do with

00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:36,500
that this is for me when I look at wall

00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:38,090
hacking one thing that I really am so

00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:41,300
glad I learned I learned this fairly

00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:42,590
early in my career was was empathy and

00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,630
but it's like a superpower for

00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:47,090
developers and I really believe that

00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:48,920
it's something that can be learned and

00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:51,560
can be taught and can be practiced and

00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,090
can be trained I I think a lot of people

00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,070
think oh you know you either got it or

00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:57,580
you haven't I totally disagree you can

00:24:55,070 --> 00:25:00,770
definitely get better at being an

00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:03,770
empathy this book is really really good

00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:05,660
this is nothing to do with technology at

00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:08,270
all it's just a general book on empathy

00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:12,890
really really good and what empathy does

00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:16,250
for me is twofold really if I'm having

00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:20,150
some kind of let's say abrasion at work

00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:22,850
and a disagreement typically with Marco

00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:24,740
Parvati but it could be it could be

00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:27,140
anybody else if I'm having this

00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:31,160
disagreement being able to sort of

00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:33,350
switch sides and to see the problem from

00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:35,780
somebody else's perspective is just so

00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:38,390
so valuable so empathy is the ability to

00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:40,670
understand how someone else is feeling

00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:42,710
or how they're thinking and being able

00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:45,230
to do that will help you so much in

00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:47,150
development and in life let's be honest

00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:48,770
this is a this is a life thing rather

00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:51,680
than a development thing but it's it's a

00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:54,890
really powerful tool to have if you're

00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:57,140
working in a development so if if your

00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:59,630
boss is you know you really want to do

00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:01,850
this rewrite the the existing code base

00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:04,760
and do it in the latest sort of

00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:06,080
framework that's hot today and the boss

00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,130
is like oh now we

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,200
want to do that and you're like why

00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:11,600
won't he do it just maybe thinking about

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,340
what is going through your boss's head

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,480
rather than just going are you just

00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:16,070
doesn't want to do it because he's not

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,929
interested in the new shiny stuff

00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:19,250
maybe there's budget constraints maybe

00:26:17,929 --> 00:26:21,289
there's more projects coming up the line

00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:23,779
that you don't know about being able to

00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:25,669
think in someone else's shoes is amazing

00:26:23,779 --> 00:26:28,070
and the other thing it's really really

00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:29,690
good for I find is we build typically

00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:32,120
people in the room will be building web

00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:34,279
sites and web sites will have users and

00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:36,740
being able to put yourself in a user's

00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:39,190
mindset is like really is like a

00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:41,539
superpower for me being able to think

00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:43,220
from the logs nobody's clicking the

00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:45,289
cancel button why is that and then you

00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:47,299
look and you think alright because it's

00:26:45,289 --> 00:26:49,669
not on the page when my users are

00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:51,380
actually on a mobile phone being able to

00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:53,630
kind of put yourself into the mindset of

00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:58,130
what your users doing is so empowering

00:26:53,630 --> 00:27:00,320
it's really really useful tip to do this

00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:01,549
is totally irrelevant but this book is

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,350
really good this is nothing to do with

00:27:01,549 --> 00:27:06,080
empathy but because we were talking

00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:08,120
about users I just thought I put a quick

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:13,159
book up here this is an amazing book

00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:14,480
this is about how to how to it's not

00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:16,039
like I don't mean designers in the

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,190
design of a website for how to design

00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:21,500
applications so that your users of the

00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:23,720
application and becoming advocates for

00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:25,820
your application so I used to work at

00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,350
JetBrains and you know phpstorm we've

00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:29,330
always been a big believer in this kind

00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:31,460
of thing where we try and make our users

00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:33,200
feel so empowered that they go out and

00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:34,370
sell their product for us to their

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:39,139
friends and co-workers and colleagues

00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:40,159
it's a really good book for that don't

00:27:39,139 --> 00:27:43,880
worry we're nearly at the end and then

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:46,760
there's beer so the other the other

00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:48,769
cheat I think I've used mercilessly in

00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:52,070
my career record reveals I mean I've

00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:53,990
used this I've used code reviews to

00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:55,880
level up my my development skills

00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:57,669
mercilessly also known as Marco is

00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:01,549
watching if you were here last year but

00:27:57,669 --> 00:28:03,649
code reviews and code reviews with peers

00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:05,059
in worker grit because if you're not

00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:07,669
doing code reviews you probably should

00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:10,309
be and unless you work on your own in

00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:13,429
which case I guess yeah you're stuck but

00:28:10,309 --> 00:28:15,020
code reviews are amazing for getting

00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:16,760
perspectives of other people and for

00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:18,559
understanding how other people would

00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,490
solve the same problem that you've just

00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,870
solved and

00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,910
why they would do it differently more

00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:24,410
importantly it's almost like getting

00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:26,150
somebody else to do the work for you

00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:28,400
which is why I think is cheating it's

00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:30,200
like oh I'll just make a token go with

00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,400
this problem and then I'll go go for

00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,990
code review and everyone else can tell

00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:36,679
me how I should have done it it's like a

00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:39,440
really cool cheap to have you don't need

00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:40,820
to you know open-source I preached about

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,340
open-source last year but open source is

00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:45,440
a great place to get code reviews to to

00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:47,120
level up your development skills I say

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:51,650
it's free learning for me code reviews

00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:54,830
are really really good cheats it's

00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:56,420
teamwork it's teamwork but only if you

00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:57,980
make a really proper attempt at the

00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:00,970
problem before you actually put the code

00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:03,590
review up its otherwise it's cheating um

00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:04,880
yeah I was gonna ask if anyone else what

00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:07,610
this game is but I just realized on the

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,260
monitor here that it's in the title so I

00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:13,160
guess there's not really much point in

00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:15,710
me asking this I turn all this how

00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:19,070
obvious is too obvious but because I

00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:21,260
tend to spend most of my day asking my

00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:23,840
peers and friends to do my work for me I

00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:27,770
ask a lot of questions and the process

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:29,210
of actually verbalizing a problem means

00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:30,830
that you have to solidify what the

00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:32,300
problem is in your mind before you can

00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:34,610
speak to somebody else and tell them

00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:36,470
what the problem is and the number of

00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:38,480
times I've done that and then said

00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:39,590
actually don't worry I just realized

00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,840
what the answer is when I'm actually

00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:43,850
telling you the problem is unbelievable

00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,740
so there's this this concept called

00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:48,620
rubber duck in where did the idea is you

00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:50,929
take an inanimate object and you explain

00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,940
the problem to an inanimate object and

00:29:50,929 --> 00:29:54,650
in the process of doing that you

00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:56,929
solidify the problem in your mind and

00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:59,570
then the answer will come to you and it

00:29:56,929 --> 00:30:01,580
works so many times it's unbelievable I

00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:03,559
say honestly the number of times I've

00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,880
said to friends oh I can't get this to

00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:06,470
work and I'm trying to do this and then

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,179
oh no I know what the problem is now

00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:10,040
thank you and put the phone down is

00:30:08,179 --> 00:30:17,540
unbelievable it's a really really nice

00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:19,220
trick so yeh that's my that's my list of

00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:21,559
tips with only 30 minutes locked so

00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:24,290
that's nice and concise concludes my

00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:27,770
randomly conceived list of tediously

00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:30,080
link things to computer games really you

00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:31,640
know I want to repeat a few points

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,920
because that's what we do right at the

00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,150
end of talks

00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:37,310
so I'm sorry what I was trying to do

00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:38,810
here I don't know if I'm trying to like

00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:41,660
come up with a catchphrase myself or

00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:44,510
anything but let's let's give it a go be

00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:46,550
nice be nice you know it's just a

00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:48,170
general thing make friends

00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:53,830
we're talked about how important that is

00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:53,830
