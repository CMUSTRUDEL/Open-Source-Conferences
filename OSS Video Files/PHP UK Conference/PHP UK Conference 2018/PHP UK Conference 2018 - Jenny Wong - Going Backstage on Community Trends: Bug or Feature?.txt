Title: PHP UK Conference 2018 - Jenny Wong - Going Backstage on Community Trends: Bug or Feature?
Publication date: 2018-03-28
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2018
Description: 
	Over the years, the PHP community has enjoyed an increase in events. This has given us more choice than ever over what we attend. At the same time, some of our favourite events have come to a close. 

As the community recalibrates, needs have changed and events are repeatedly being challenged. Organisers are burdened with finding the solutions, but is there a way for us all to help? 

With change comes an opportunity for growth. This is our chance to grow richer and stronger as a community.

	00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:07,549
I'm gonna start this session with some

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,710
group participation you don't have to

00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:11,719
stand up all I want you to do is put

00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,190
your hand up so it's not too much

00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:16,670
hardware but we're gonna get some like

00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:19,939
arm exercises in great example right

00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:23,119
here please follow us along and what I

00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:24,199
want you to do is answer a couple of

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,060
questions and we're just going to test

00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:28,160
from this and you'll see every so often

00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:31,009
I'll ask you to put weight your hand so

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,300
to get started how many people in the

00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:36,789
room are at their first PHP conference

00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:42,410
wow that's amazing

00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:44,960
welcome all right another question just

00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:47,719
to make sure that we're all the way how

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,420
many people here attend a local PHP user

00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:55,960
group that's even more of you that's

00:00:50,420 --> 00:01:00,679
fantastic I did some research for this

00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:04,250
session and within the UK there has been

00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:06,350
26 different user groups that I am aware

00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:08,060
of and they say I'm aware of because

00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,670
obviously things might have happened

00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:14,210
then the internet doesn't exactly keep a

00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:17,270
history of things so let's have a look

00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:18,620
at this timeline can anyone guess and to

00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:21,530
the people who helped me do the research

00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:24,530
don't answer because I know they're at

00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:27,650
the front of the room can anyone guess

00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:34,670
how long we've had a PHP user group in

00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:36,910
the in the country anyone 15 years in

00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:42,080
your close

00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:46,790
14 years 2004 was the very first year

00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:49,520
that we had at least I found a user

00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:52,640
group in in the UK it started in this

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:57,410
city London which is pretty amazing and

00:01:52,640 --> 00:02:00,800
it's still going today in 2005 we have

00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:03,860
two user groups in the UK PHP West

00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:07,390
Midlands to put this into context this

00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:09,950
is the year that YouTube was founded

00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:13,010
which makes us all feel really old now

00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:15,560
I'm sure and it's also the year that

00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:19,610
Facebook opened their doors to Univ

00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:22,459
verse it is only in the UK so that's a

00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:26,330
long time ago and also yes it's not that

00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:30,470
far ago jumped three years later we have

00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:31,670
PHP Northwest yeah if you're free to

00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,450
chair if you're like from one of these

00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:40,880
years ago it's cuz literally this a lot

00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:44,540
2009 we get PHP East Midlands and then

00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:46,700
in 2010 we get six user groups in total

00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:49,220
what's interesting at this point is that

00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:54,200
they're all still based in England for

00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:57,200
2011 that trend keeps going in 2012 we

00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:01,250
have Brighton on the seafront jayna's

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:04,280
and in 2013 we have 13 different user

00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:07,940
groups across the country and Northern

00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:10,220
Ireland has joined the ranks now 2014 is

00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:13,580
an interesting year it's year Scotland

00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:16,220
came to the group Aberdeen Edinburgh and

00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:22,660
Glasgow all had their first meters that

00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:26,690
year which is pretty cool and by to 2015

00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:33,739
that's 23 different user groups across

00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:36,109
the UK 23 now 2016 we didn't get any new

00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:40,760
user groups but we did see one call it a

00:03:36,109 --> 00:03:42,680
day 2017 a few more called it a day but

00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,980
we also had last year

00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,750
PHP Essex and PHP Milton Keynes being

00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:50,389
the latest ones to join the family of

00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,590
PHP user groups in the UK and to be

00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:55,459
honest with you this is really

00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:58,970
impressive and he doesn't even stop

00:03:55,459 --> 00:04:01,459
there this month if you are in the

00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:05,750
Birmingham area a big shout out to brunt

00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:07,190
PHP who are basically bringing back PHP

00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,720
West Midlands and I've renamed

00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:10,190
themselves so if you're in the

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,079
Birmingham area it's like the end of the

00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:14,209
month they call Bron PHP do check them

00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:17,000
out because they are going to be the

00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:20,780
latest user group to join the the PHP

00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,310
community in the UK why are we telling

00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:25,900
you all this I mean it's pretty

00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:29,430
impressive for one slight look pretty

00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:33,210
but for two well I find more impressed

00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:36,180
is that all those user groups are run by

00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:39,420
volunteers for the community by the

00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:43,560
community it's a method of contribution

00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:47,010
that we see in code quite often we could

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:50,610
argue that it's the open source way it's

00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:54,030
even more closer home the way that PHP

00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:57,120
is built if you think about it all those

00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:59,400
people who have spawned to their time to

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,560
buy the language we use daily and many

00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,290
of us use at our day jobs and it's not

00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,030
just PHP but it's also the frameworks

00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:11,190
the ecosystem and the libraries around

00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:13,560
that all volunteer driven to help us in

00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:16,290
our day jobs and you think that is

00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:19,440
pretty awesome because it means that as

00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:22,620
a community we don't have to reinvent

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,270
the wheel if you want an autoloader you

00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:29,690
go to the symphony or Toledo and you

00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:29,690
know copy and paste that's pretty handy

00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:36,090
do you think about our day jobs though

00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:39,990
is that PHP is not the only thing that

00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:42,840
we work with in fact PHP is part of the

00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:45,180
technological mashup that allows us to

00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,820
build the solutions for both our clients

00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:50,520
and our products will ever kind of work

00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:54,030
you're doing and with each of these

00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:57,570
technologies comes a community a

00:05:54,030 --> 00:06:01,830
community of code a community of add-ons

00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:04,230
and plugins and a community of events in

00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:06,870
a mega city right London it means that

00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:08,520
you can go to a user group almost every

00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:12,500
working day of the week throughout the

00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:16,170
year now I know this is not the case in

00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:18,770
everywhere in the UK but it does bring

00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:22,020
up a good question

00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:24,500
why do we choose to go to our local PHP

00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,500
user groups

00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:35,820
I'm a co-organizer of PHP Berkshire were

00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:37,830
based in Redding and last Meetup one of

00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,660
our attendees came up to me and Chris

00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,950
one of the other co-organizers and

00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,060
thanked us for the work that we'd been

00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:45,690
doing

00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:48,120
they explained that we had opened the

00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:50,190
doors for him but what was even cooler

00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,740
was that then we use away who was

00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:55,590
explaining it to us was because

00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:58,020
unfortunately he is switched jobs which

00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:59,310
meant which is a good thing right but it

00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,990
also meant that he wouldn't be able to

00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:03,780
like make it to our user group which is

00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:07,560
a bad thing at least for the fact that I

00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:13,440
like to hang out with this person but as

00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:15,900
a quote he basically told us how I was

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,570
putting up a meet-up on about PHP on

00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,760
meetup calm in their local area meant

00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:23,790
that he could learn things that he

00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:26,010
didn't even realize existed he'd been

00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:27,120
doing PHP way longer than I had but

00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:29,190
didn't realize there was a community

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,490
there yeah when you look around this

00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:32,760
room

00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:34,710
there was definitely a community the

00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,860
things that they learnt at the user

00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:39,960
group were instantly able to improve

00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,940
their daily job which is really cool I

00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:47,280
mean he doesn't want to be lazy or at

00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:49,530
work I mean I know I do like we've code

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,860
the community events are a series of

00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:54,630
features compiled together so what I

00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:57,150
want to do is take this moment to go

00:07:54,630 --> 00:08:00,060
backstage at a user group and see what

00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:02,220
features it takes to build a user group

00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:04,590
and this can be applied to many other

00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:08,240
PHP events and actually other events

00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:08,240
that are being built around technologies

00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:14,430
this is not a complete list are things

00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:18,660
that every organizer does but it's a

00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:22,919
pretty good list this has to be done

00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:25,380
every month and this list is only the

00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:28,950
things that are about time and effort

00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:31,590
based it includes things like finding

00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:33,150
venues finding sponsors speakers

00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:34,440
thinking or even just trying to work out

00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:38,219
what topic we should be talking about

00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,570
next month what's hot what's not but

00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:42,260
then when you look at the financials as

00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:43,979
well because there is a financial cost

00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,200
depending on the meter but you're

00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:48,300
running the financial cost can go

00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,720
anything from the meetup comm fees

00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:53,820
because me TOCOM is not free all the way

00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,600
down to paying for food and drinks to

00:08:53,820 --> 00:09:02,250
encourage attendees to turn

00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:04,380
if we put some numbers around this and

00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,150
some of my colleagues told me that my

00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:09,930
original numbers were a bit too high but

00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:11,790
maybe I'm just used to London meter DOM

00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:17,700
works out about 11 pounds a month

00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:19,230
it's 1499 u.s. dollars so obviously it

00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,570
depends every week well how much it

00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:23,640
costs domain registration if your user

00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:26,160
group has a domain that obviously costs

00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:29,250
money if you can't have a free venue

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:32,520
that costs money and so on so so forth

00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:34,380
it means that roughly just look on these

00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:40,530
numbers it can't it could cost you a

00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:42,300
meter per month around 207 pounds now I

00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:44,400
don't know about you but I know I can do

00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:49,350
something else with that 207 powers like

00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:52,560
go shopping so why is it but user group

00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:54,330
organisers spend this money to do

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,340
something that you know they're doing

00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:58,490
for free they're literally like losing

00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:05,010
money from you no use agree which is

00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:06,750
absolutely mind-boggling I circulated a

00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:09,530
survey on Twitter because you know

00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:12,840
Twitter is the answer for all things and

00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:17,340
I put together a set of questions to ask

00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:20,250
PHP related events organizers both past

00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:22,050
and present across the world to share

00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:25,680
their experience of what they have

00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:26,730
learned from winning an event so we're

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,670
going to have a look at the results of

00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:32,480
that survey one of the questions I ask

00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:35,910
is why do you organize your event

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:41,040
why do organizers put in this time and

00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:43,530
effort Lea from PHP software basically

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,530
starts off by explaining he was an

00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:48,930
attendee at first and then gained so

00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:52,200
much that organizing was a way to pay it

00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:57,390
forward what going to keep it going for

00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:59,400
other people Danny Abbott Aberdeen PHP

00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:03,590
moved to the city and wanted to meet

00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:07,050
people who enjoy talking about tech

00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:08,400
somebody else wrote initially to improve

00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:10,860
their resume

00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:17,340
later the feeling of contribution kept

00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:18,960
them going but currently obligation the

00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:23,220
word obligation is an interesting word

00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:25,200
at least for me it has a sense of they

00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,000
feel they have to do something and

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,320
considering this is volunteering you

00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,700
shouldn't feel like you have to do

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,770
something surely like with code there

00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:38,010
are issues which can be sorted into both

00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:40,920
bugs and features and ultimately it

00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:44,750
comes down to the priorities of the

00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,750
community which one they are

00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:49,830
one of the questions I asked in the

00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:52,490
survey is how many groups and how many

00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:55,980
events went on a break

00:11:52,490 --> 00:12:00,570
just under 37% of groups have been on a

00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:03,060
break that's quite a lot and the most

00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:05,580
common reasons for those include lack of

00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:08,850
speaker organizers not being available

00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:13,620
on all nobody else offering to host the

00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:15,500
event and a lack of venue there were

00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:18,350
some groups that have been disbanded and

00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:21,000
they said that their reasons for

00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:23,670
disbanding and stopping included the

00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,330
organizer getting too busy no support

00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:32,400
from other people or just simply moving

00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:34,500
away from that location one of the other

00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,270
questions they asked because you can't

00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:39,690
do a survey like this without asking it

00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:44,730
is what do they struggle with now this

00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:47,340
is a list of things going from top left

00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:49,710
down and then on to the second column in

00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:52,830
order of which were the most popular

00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:54,900
answers this was a chatbox style

00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:57,750
question so they could pick multiple

00:12:54,900 --> 00:13:03,000
things both attendees and speakers were

00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:07,170
joint first this is what user group

00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,780
organizers are struggling with all right

00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:12,060
let's get those arms go in how many

00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:16,350
people here have a fear of speaking in

00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:20,370
front of a group it's fair amount of you

00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:23,660
I should put my hand up too but you know

00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,660
I'm on stage so if it's weird

00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:30,429
organizers nervous Nick from Glasgow

00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:32,139
sums it up pretty nicely a lot of tech

00:13:30,429 --> 00:13:35,679
focused people don't like to speak in

00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:37,479
front of clouds Nick also points out

00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:39,159
that a lack of time from organizing

00:13:37,479 --> 00:13:42,839
point of view means that they can only

00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:47,229
spend so much time looking for speakers

00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:50,889
yeah I met a guy called Matt he's

00:13:47,229 --> 00:13:52,389
actually speaking at this event and I

00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:54,449
noticed that Matt had been going to

00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:56,349
quite a lot of user groups in the UK

00:13:54,449 --> 00:14:00,489
speaking about various different topics

00:13:56,349 --> 00:14:03,220
and I asked him why did he spend so much

00:14:00,489 --> 00:14:05,439
of his time doing this and this is the

00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,209
answer I got back I've been going to

00:14:05,439 --> 00:14:09,459
user groups and giving talks so I can

00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:13,449
improve my confidence in speaking in

00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:15,459
groups both in public and at work it has

00:14:13,449 --> 00:14:17,619
resulted me being better at my job

00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:19,839
I think what's even more interesting is

00:14:17,619 --> 00:14:22,449
that this was something that he agreed

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:25,029
with with his boss as a way to improve

00:14:22,449 --> 00:14:27,249
his professional development I think

00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:33,729
that's such a cool way to look at

00:14:27,249 --> 00:14:35,229
speaking now I know just because Matt

00:14:33,729 --> 00:14:36,489
tried it and it worked it's not gonna

00:14:35,229 --> 00:14:38,079
work for everyone don't worry I'm not

00:14:36,489 --> 00:14:43,739
encouraging you all to speak although

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:46,239
secretly I really do wish you well but

00:14:43,739 --> 00:14:48,309
we've all been at user groups or even

00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:50,409
you know talking to our colleagues and

00:14:48,309 --> 00:14:53,319
we've heard someone having someone in

00:14:50,409 --> 00:14:55,629
something interesting to share if you

00:14:53,319 --> 00:14:57,939
know somebody who has an interesting

00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:59,319
story to share or even like a great book

00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:00,579
that they've managed to find and how

00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:02,559
they conquered that book or even

00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:04,259
sometimes not conquered that book and

00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:06,399
they're still trying to figure it out

00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:08,769
why don't we just introduce them to the

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:13,629
organizers why don't we just make that

00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:15,189
no group link means we don't have to

00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:18,359
speak we're just get someone else to do

00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:18,359
it I think that's called delegation

00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:27,149
another common issue was venues venues

00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:29,949
are always tricky to sort out

00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:32,109
Simon mentions in PHP Cambridge that

00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:34,029
they even found a commercial venue that

00:15:32,109 --> 00:15:35,329
was free which sounds fantastic I mean

00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:38,299
that's 100

00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:40,129
saved right there but the commercial

00:15:38,299 --> 00:15:42,649
bookings seem push the user group away

00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:45,829
yes a lot of us work in offices that

00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:50,600
might have a meeting room why are we not

00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:52,160
offering those up when I asked the user

00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,480
group organizers and I feel like this

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,879
was like a rabbit hole that I was

00:15:53,480 --> 00:16:01,339
opening up what they wish people knew

00:15:55,879 --> 00:16:04,879
about event organizing finding the right

00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:07,339
theme subject topic for the audience is

00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:11,029
never easy and at times finding speakers

00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:18,220
provide preser challenge to answer nests

00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:21,290
from PHP mines in nothingham it's true

00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:22,910
the concept to just figure out what

00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:24,589
people want to hear like we're literally

00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:27,220
going like I'm trying to be telepathic

00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:30,410
right now I'm not sure I can do it okay

00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:32,869
for letting it made me think why aren't

00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:34,339
we as attendees not just telling our

00:16:32,869 --> 00:16:36,730
organizers hey I'd like to hear about

00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:36,730
this

00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:43,129
anything Andy from PHP Essex something

00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:45,610
quite lovely that it's a fair bit of

00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:48,529
hassle that you don't get much thankful

00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:49,699
so please join me in thanking all the

00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:51,379
ease of group organizers because I know

00:16:49,699 --> 00:16:52,489
there's a quite a lot in the room for

00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:56,860
all the hard work that they've been

00:16:52,489 --> 00:17:02,230
doing over the last 14 years

00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:08,699
[Applause]

00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:08,699
oh I have a tea

00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:19,990
when I asked organizers what would make

00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:22,150
their life easier then it's no surprise

00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:26,620
there some of the answers included

00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:27,820
something as simple as more help people

00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:30,640
stepping up as speakers and

00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:32,620
co-organizers I mean this is the dream

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,790
for organizers honestly people just

00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,880
coming up to us and saying can we do

00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:38,500
this thing I will be amazed if you get

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:43,360
the answer now because usually no

00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:46,480
answers yes how many of us here and this

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,980
is another arm movement exercise working

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,720
a company that sponsors their local

00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:56,140
meetup this is the smallest group of

00:17:52,720 --> 00:18:02,050
people that put their hand up it's a

00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:04,990
tiny amount yeah Ben from PHP workshop

00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:07,060
points out that having sponsorships is

00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:08,890
actually an amazing thing because then

00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:11,290
they could pay for like venues and stuff

00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:12,970
like that maybe if a speaker list quite

00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,830
far away they could you know at least

00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:19,810
pay for the train fare because at least

00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:21,970
in the UK that's expensive I didn't even

00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:24,190
realize this but Ben and the

00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:25,720
Warwickshire community are splitting the

00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,500
payments between themselves to keep

00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,080
things going

00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:32,170
that's how determined they are to keep

00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:34,150
PHP Warwickshire going and I feel really

00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:36,880
bad because I didn't even think about

00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:38,530
this but I know one of my co organizers

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,190
have been paying for everything and I've

00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:43,420
basically not got no really giving him

00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:46,690
anything in return

00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:48,340
like any money so I felt really bad but

00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:49,990
I think it's amazing that people are

00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:54,550
literally willing to like split the cost

00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:59,970
and keep I'll use a group going and how

00:18:54,550 --> 00:19:03,760
many of us actually contribute no one a

00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:08,970
few of you so I'm like I'm not sure if

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,970
I'm contributing that's cool

00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:14,030
I'm not sure who wrote this in because I

00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:16,650
did a lot of people in the surveys to

00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:21,800
write in anonymously it gave me some

00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:24,030
very very blunt feedback but people if

00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,770
people contributed more to the user

00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:29,130
group it would have made this person's

00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:31,260
life so much easier and they sum it up

00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:32,880
quite nicely it's quite similar to

00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:35,790
open-source the way we contribute to our

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,310
code and the Giza group lives by its

00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:41,130
contributors and it can be both the

00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:45,000
developer yourselves all the companies

00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:50,850
that we work for there are things that

00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:52,620
we can do to make a difference I asked

00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:54,360
the organizers if they could remember a

00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:58,850
time when someone at their group had to

00:19:54,360 --> 00:20:02,160
help them out and what actually happened

00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:04,050
Rowan from Brighton PHP mentions how an

00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,240
attendee who took then turned her

00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:12,210
organizers started by helping out

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:13,830
informally all they did was engaging

00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:16,110
conversation whilst they were having

00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:22,410
discussions it helped to break the

00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:24,750
silence in a group of people how many

00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:26,190
people here have helped set up in a van

00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,260
like you turn up to the meetup a bit

00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:34,770
early and you see people like doing

00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:38,130
things the fear of you as few you Craig

00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:40,410
from PHP London remembers how people who

00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:41,850
turn up early help handle the drinks

00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:43,230
making sure that the drinks are cold by

00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:45,060
putting them in the fridge before

00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:48,420
everyone else turns up and setting up

00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:50,880
the tables that's police easy to do I

00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:54,420
mean most of us here can at least live

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,220
for charity and if you are going to user

00:20:54,420 --> 00:21:00,270
groups how many of you help clean up

00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:03,750
afterwards that's good that's good we

00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:06,060
get in there Frederick from PHP Antwerp

00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:08,610
mentions people who helped clean up our

00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:13,340
cool hey everyone he just for their hand

00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:17,700
up your call and I totally agree

00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:20,460
my favorite thing is at PHP Berkshire is

00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:22,680
a an attendee who then turned

00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,360
co-organizer because I didn't really

00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:27,549
give them much amateur

00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:30,070
but they at the beginning of the year we

00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:32,919
always do this like post it matrix where

00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:34,210
we get people in the user group to kind

00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:37,150
of say what things they want to learn

00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:38,650
about or even discuss and it's all on

00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:40,000
post-it notes which is great and then we

00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:42,010
organize them and we put them on the

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,650
wall and it's all nice and pretty and

00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:46,809
one of our organizers took a photo of it

00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:48,520
and then threw it up on me TOCOM or

00:21:46,809 --> 00:21:51,280
Twitter or something and what was

00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:54,130
amazing was that the next morning I get

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,110
sent a link to a Google Doc where all

00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:59,490
the post-it notes had been organized as

00:21:56,110 --> 00:22:02,200
it was in the picture I'm written herb

00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:04,600
and about five minutes beforehand I'd

00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,799
been like oh I really need to like write

00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,289
up those post-it notes it's gonna be

00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:11,980
such a boy and then just getting that

00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:13,510
Lincoln hey that has been done for me I

00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:16,990
was like oh this is easy copy and

00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:19,000
pasting I know how to do that it made my

00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:24,010
life so much easier I was so thankful

00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:27,850
for that small apps can have a big

00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:30,309
effect we've already seen how some of

00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:32,770
the people in our local communities are

00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:36,309
doing just small things but how

00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:40,000
organizers do notice it can go further

00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:43,450
than this if you are part of a

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,400
Toastmaster community which I'm not then

00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:47,440
there is a thing called a greeter and

00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,929
basically it's the person who is at the

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,600
front of the door and like invites you

00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:54,010
in that's a really Polly

00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,600
you know condensed version of what it is

00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:59,919
so I went on Toastmasters that you got

00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:01,919
the official thing the greeters role is

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,299
to welcome everyone to the club meeting

00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:07,330
particular visitors and people who are

00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:09,820
new to Toastmasters making everyone feel

00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:11,380
welcome at our club is important as this

00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,570
may be the start of their Toastmasters

00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:15,909
journey now if you get rid of all the

00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:17,830
toast mastery stuff it still applies to

00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:21,130
the PHP community and to other

00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:27,159
communities - how many greeter well say

00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:29,320
hey my name is insert name just knowing

00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:30,669
that you're in the right place is a big

00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:34,110
relief when you're going to somewhere

00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:38,460
new and this could be all of us

00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:38,460
literally I quoted you all

00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,240
if you don't want to be the greeter

00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,430
because you don't want to be the first

00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,900
in line and that's cool then start a

00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:50,350
conversation with the people around you

00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:53,140
I know as a group of people starting

00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:55,630
conversations with strangers is scary I

00:23:53,140 --> 00:24:00,730
mean I do it a lot and it's still scary

00:23:55,630 --> 00:24:02,980
to me so and I practice a lot now there

00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:04,810
is a trick to this and anyone I've

00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:07,650
talked to this morning will probably see

00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:10,180
me do this already so if you're like I'm

00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:10,540
opening and sharing a big secret with

00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:15,070
you

00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:16,750
are you ready conversation starters go

00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:19,330
to questions that you can delete you

00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:24,850
pick up and ask anyone and it's pretty

00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:26,500
much fault free asking anyone how that

00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:28,840
how they're traveling was in the UK

00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,880
pretty much guarantees a response of how

00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:33,100
bad their public transport in the UK is

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,170
so it's a wide known recognition that

00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:38,140
you can just acknowledge and feel some

00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:40,630
kind of companionship between them these

00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:42,610
are good questions for this event but

00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:45,460
also if you're at your local user group

00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:47,500
or any group for that matter most groups

00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,450
happen on a weekday which means most of

00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:53,980
us are at work so just asking the

00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:55,960
question how was work it's a really nice

00:24:53,980 --> 00:25:00,310
way to start a conversation with a lot

00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:02,260
of people there's a thing called the

00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:05,380
pac-man rule how do people here know

00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:07,450
about it there's a few of you well all

00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:09,700
of you are going to know about it now it

00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:15,310
was popularized by a gentleman called

00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:17,290
Erik holster and his definition is when

00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:19,870
stunning as agree for people always

00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:22,840
leave one leave room for one person to

00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:24,610
join your group the idea being that if

00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,020
anyone wants to join your conversation

00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:28,840
there's a space for them to be able to

00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:31,240
just stand right in if you want to

00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:33,400
remember it quite simply stand like Pat

00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,320
man and I don't mean like this I mean

00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:38,260
like studies like round in a circle

00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:40,240
huzza Batman leaving that one gap for

00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:41,620
that person who might be here on their

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:46,660
own to be able to join a conversation

00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:49,120
and get to know you all now these are

00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:50,970
quite active things to do so what wasn't

00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,500
inactive stuff

00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:56,649
most of you have foes I've seen a few

00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:58,809
phones go up already retreating and

00:25:56,649 --> 00:26:02,049
showing event information is probably

00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:03,760
one of the organizers dreams because it

00:26:02,049 --> 00:26:05,380
basically means free marketing and

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,350
reminding other people without them

00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:11,769
being too nagging so if you're going to

00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:13,659
an event tweet but you're going it's

00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:17,140
quite simple you know I'm going to this

00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:18,909
are you coming to you I was talking to

00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:21,100
one of my colleagues last night and they

00:26:18,909 --> 00:26:22,899
mentioned how it was actually for each

00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,519
pizza that he was reminded to go to

00:26:22,899 --> 00:26:27,460
events because he had always forget

00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:30,100
because you know work so tweeting about

00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:31,899
it even if you have two followers or a

00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:35,769
thousand followers it doesn't really

00:26:31,899 --> 00:26:37,510
make a difference just tweet you are

00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:39,460
like a no reminder and because it's from

00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:41,230
different people it sounds less nagging

00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:47,049
and that way the organisers of the

00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:50,159
events kind of appreciate it if you have

00:26:47,049 --> 00:26:52,500
ideas opinions or feedback share them

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,820
share them with your local user group

00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,440
organizers you can share them with the

00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:58,389
organizers of this event you can share

00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,570
them with speakers but more importantly

00:26:58,389 --> 00:27:04,539
share them with each other

00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:06,549
in conclusion there are many different

00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:08,590
ways we can all help out some of them

00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:10,570
take a lot of effort some of them don't

00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:12,970
take a lot of effort but more

00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:15,820
importantly you can pretty much forget

00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:19,690
all this because all I want you to do is

00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:23,190
have fun and have fun at PHP UK for the

00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:23,190
