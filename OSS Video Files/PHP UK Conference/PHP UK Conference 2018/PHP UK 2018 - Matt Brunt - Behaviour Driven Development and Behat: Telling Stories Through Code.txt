Title: PHP UK 2018 - Matt Brunt - Behaviour Driven Development and Behat: Telling Stories Through Code
Publication date: 2018-03-27
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2018
Description: 
	Stories? Scenarios? BDD? Are these just more words in the ever-growing list of jargon that developers have to know? Or are they something more important than new terms to memorise? In this session we'll look at how BDD fits into the software development work-flow, how to tell user stories through features, and how to automate them in Behat. These techniques will help to ensure you're writing well designed and tested software that focuses on what the users want from a system.
