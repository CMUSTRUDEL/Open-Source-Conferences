Title: PHP UK 2018 - Liam Wiltshire - London Calling: Creating a customisable, multi-tenanted i18n solution
Publication date: 2018-03-27
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2018
Description: 
	Buycraft is a multi-tenanted gCommerce platform for Minecraft. Having supported over 500,000 servers around the world, it needs to support a whole range of languages. Centralised i10n sucks - users can't customise it, if the application doesn't have a language file then you can't use that language, and users cannot add their own strings to translate. This is exactly how Buycraft worked - what's a dev to do? Join Liam to find out how Buycraft investigated, hacked and 'borrowed' code to solve this problem to provide a fully flexible, i10n layer for all their customers.
