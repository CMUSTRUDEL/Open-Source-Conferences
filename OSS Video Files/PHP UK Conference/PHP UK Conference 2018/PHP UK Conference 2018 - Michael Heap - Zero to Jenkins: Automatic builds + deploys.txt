Title: PHP UK Conference 2018 - Michael Heap - Zero to Jenkins: Automatic builds + deploys
Publication date: 2018-03-27
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2018
Description: 
	In late 2016, Jenkins finally made it to version 2.0 which brought a huge number of improvements. In this talk, we'll go from an empty machine to a Jenkins install that automatically detects repos, branches and pull requests and builds them according to the Jenkinsfile in each branch. We'll be running tests, linting and packaging applications in parallel where possible, and even auto-deploying our application once our pipeline passes!
