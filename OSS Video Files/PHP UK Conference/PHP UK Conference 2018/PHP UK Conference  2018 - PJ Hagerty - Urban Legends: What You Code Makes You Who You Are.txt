Title: PHP UK Conference  2018 - PJ Hagerty - Urban Legends: What You Code Makes You Who You Are
Publication date: 2018-03-27
Playlist: PHP UK Conference 2018
Description: 
	If you were a carpenter, would your skills at building be more important than the tools you use to build? Skills, right? Tools are just a means to an end. So why do developers think the language they use defines the problems they solve? 

This talk will take a look at misconceptions across the board, some experiences, both positive and negative, people have had crossing barriers to new languages, and show some of the benefits thinking of one’s self as a coder and not a “Ruby coder” or a “PHP dev” can have on being a better problem solver.

good mornin pH people one thing I love

00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,660
about PHP events is the fact that you

00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,400
always can take anything that starts

00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,200
with a P at a pH in front of it and then

00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,110
just roll with it you guys are all cool

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,140
with that right so a little bit about me

00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:22,550
I work at a company called devrel ATO

00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,080
these are all my wonderful clients if

00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,000
you have questions about what we do were

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,369
dev relations as a service community

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,750
relations as a service so it's really a

00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:31,880
lot of fun if you have questions about

00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,830
any of our clients feel free to ask me

00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,290
afterwards right now I'm here on behalf

00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:39,290
of Krait IO which are the people behind

00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:41,660
crate DB which is think of it like no

00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:43,910
sequel meets docker distributed database

00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,050
in the cloud it's it's pretty cool and

00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,640
I'd be happy to answer questions about

00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,800
that after the talk but that's not what

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,879
I'm here to talk about let's talk about

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,670
my favorite subject which is me so I'm a

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,379
developer evangelist technical advocate

00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:59,239
community engineer whatever title you

00:00:57,379 --> 00:01:00,410
want to put on there I'm lucky enough I

00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:02,449
get to travel around the world and talk

00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,190
to awesome people like you pretty much

00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:06,229
all the time 12 months a year it's it's

00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:09,290
absolutely amazing but beyond that I'm a

00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:10,549
hockey coach I play in a band I've been

00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:14,090
playing drums since I was six years old

00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:16,580
and I have kids I'm a dad which is

00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:19,549
wonderful occasionally which is really

00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:21,290
once I let my kids keynote large-scale

00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:23,920
programming events that's my daughter

00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:26,119
when she was eleven keynoting rubyconf

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,040
she was the keynote and also the guy who

00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,570
created Ruby was the keynote so is a

00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,549
pretty big deal I've never keynote a

00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:34,430
ruby comp on my own I had to use her as

00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:35,329
like an inroad so you know use your kids

00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:38,810
that's what they're there for

00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:39,860
I also run an organization called prompt

00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,439
how many of you ever heard a prompt

00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:47,000
before how many of you ever heard of Eid

00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:48,560
Fink ler before yeah so ed was one of

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,960
the major players when we started prompt

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,630
a few years ago prompt is all about

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,880
mental health in tech it's kind of a big

00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:58,100
deal but we kind of don't talk about it

00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,719
a lot so the goal of prompt is to get

00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,369
people to talk about mental health start

00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:03,020
a conversation about mental health if

00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:04,640
you run a meet-up and I know from

00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,500
Jenny's talk yesterday that some of you

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,000
do or you're just part of a meet-up and

00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,950
you want to contribute to it like Jenny

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,450
suggested you do feel free to get in

00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:13,069
touch and we will help you get someone

00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:14,750
who is willing to talk about mental

00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:16,280
health specifically as it affects people

00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,930
intact from their own perspective

00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,810
we're happy to send speakers all over

00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:23,000
the world to give these talks so what is

00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,620
this talk actually about if you saw the

00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,910
title we may have some misconceptions

00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,520
but that's actually what the talk is

00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:30,080
about so that's good in programming

00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,520
languages in different communities we

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,080
have different perceptions especially

00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,700
when we're inside of them

00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,050
we all think our own community is the

00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,700
best right

00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,720
not everybody outside of your community

00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,490
thinks that because they think their

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,580
community is the best that's one of the

00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:45,050
problems we have there's also certain

00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,460
things that different parts the techni

00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:48,230
means the non-programmers if you will

00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:50,600
when they look in at us what they think

00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:52,460
about us and then there's also the ideas

00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,050
that differ between open-source and the

00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:56,090
enterprise and we're gonna talk a little

00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:57,920
bit about that as well what this isn't

00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,510
about if you saw the title is actual

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,010
urban legends so if you thought this is

00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:03,560
going to be about cryptozoology or

00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:06,410
chupacabras or what have you I really

00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,150
apologize that's not what it's we're

00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:11,120
going to talk about but let's start at

00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:12,860
the beginning let's start with PHP first

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,810
of all really shocking that it's not

00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,300
pronounced tip I think that would be a

00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:19,640
more appropriate name for the language

00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:22,190
PHP has been around for years right it's

00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,050
been around so long that most people

00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:25,370
when I go to conferences and I gave it a

00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:28,070
say I've given this talk at other

00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:29,420
conferences and meetups and I say how

00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:31,760
many people have programming in PHP I'm

00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:34,040
not gonna ask that of this room I think

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,870
that's a silly question in here but Alma

00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,310
doesn't really matter wherever I go and

00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,050
I ask this question I say who Pro who's

00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:41,720
programmed in PHP are currently programs

00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:43,160
in PHP most hands go up with the

00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,959
exception of maybe some younger folks

00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,209
who you know have gone to boot camp and

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,040
it's their first event but for the most

00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:52,280
part everybody's program in PHP so kind

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,420
of a big deal yet one of the first myths

00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,489
that I found out about when I was

00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:59,050
working on this talk was it apparently

00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:59,050
some people think PHP is dead

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,980
quick caveat I could easily have named

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,660
this talk everything is dead and why do

00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:07,220
we even bother because you're gonna see

00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,260
this dead concept come up quite a bit

00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,239
every programming language at one time

00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:14,300
or another has been called dead but

00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:17,750
we're starting with PHP as some of you

00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:20,269
may know PHP is kind of a big deal it's

00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:22,669
used by large scale companies and I

00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:26,090
believe statistically the most recent

00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:30,020
statistic is that 68% of web

00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:31,400
applications use PHP and when I first

00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,980
for this I think I was told it was like

00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,840
72% by a friend of mine he might know

00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:38,990
you might know Davi shake he helped me

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,000
write this talk and we were talking

00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:42,560
about it I was like that's amazing so I

00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,970
started to look into it and there's

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,680
reasons why first of all a lot of

00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,570
servers use PHP because they're

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,330
expecting to have to serve it so that

00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:51,260
counts towards the grand total obviously

00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:54,620
there's bigger applications like

00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:57,650
Facebook uses PHP twitter has PHP built

00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,910
in lots and lots of big things but also

00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:01,790
there's the fact that other languages

00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:04,010
actually borrow from PHP in Ruby which

00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:06,110
is a language that I'm I've mostly been

00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:08,480
programming in the past few years Ruby

00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:09,680
actually has PHP modules built in just

00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,380
in case you're transferring information

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,090
from PHP to Ruby it already has built-in

00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:17,270
language tools so that you can convert

00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:19,240
these things so if PHP is dead why are

00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:21,920
all these other languages other places

00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:24,560
borrowing from PHP making sure PHP is

00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,930
compatible so that it's useful obviously

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,440
it's not really that big of a big of a

00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:33,350
death if everyone's still using it so

00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,090
Mike refers some folks think that PHP

00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:37,460
because it's so often used in

00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:40,060
large-scale monolithic applications that

00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:42,320
microservice are complete impossibility

00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,480
apparently a lot of people believe that

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:48,080
everything is kept in one giant PD PHP

00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:50,900
file this was kind of true once upon a

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,420
time I remember when I was at a place

00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,130
and this is a while ago we're using like

00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:57,920
PHP three maybe four had just come out

00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:01,520
and the entire thing was a hundred and

00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:03,530
thirty thousand lines of code yeah

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,940
that was not loud that was uncomfortable

00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,020
laughter someone just gave uncomfortable

00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,330
laughter because no one should ever

00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:10,400
build anything like that ever it was

00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:12,710
converted from 150,000 lines of visual

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,190
FoxPro any visual foxpro developers in

00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:18,890
the house

00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:21,590
I'm sorry I feel you I feel your pain

00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:24,860
so yeah making it going from visual

00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:29,420
FoxPro to PHP was like a major jump but

00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:31,520
still the idea is that this is this is

00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,630
completely untrue like no one should

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,640
build that way if you build something

00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:36,440
that model is that 130,000 lines of code

00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,320
in one file you're doing something wrong

00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,610
to begin with and and to be completely

00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,930
honest with with the advent of

00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,110
frameworks which just about every

00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:46,680
language that uses the web

00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:48,480
these days microservices are easy you

00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,010
can easily break things down and into

00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,180
smaller bits and make them work together

00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,800
that's the whole point of you know

00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,630
containerization and everything that

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,070
we're looking at you know serverless and

00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,150
all the new advents PHP can take

00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:59,100
advantage of that just like any other

00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,630
language so I think this is an old

00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,980
perception it's it's starting to go away

00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:07,020
but I think people still have this idea

00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:08,610
that PHP is is old and beat people say

00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,620
that because PHP is an interpreted

00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:13,470
language it's it's slow it doesn't have

00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,700
a compiler so it must be slow this is

00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,680
something that actually came up with

00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:19,080
Ruby that I was surprised to find kind

00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,670
of the two things together like oh it's

00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,860
not compiled and therefore it's a slow

00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:25,310
language this is another older

00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:29,430
misconception which I find interesting

00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:31,440
you know it's it's kind of odd just

00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:34,050
simply because there's no compiler a lot

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:38,580
of older programmers and I'm older but

00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:40,830
not that kind of older believe that it's

00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,690
impossible to gain speed when you have

00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,730
to actually do things like write tests

00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:47,100
and run them against it before you

00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:48,150
deploy your code so in this case they're

00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,130
not talking about speed of execution

00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:52,410
because PHP is pretty fast I mean it's

00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:55,760
not C but it's pretty fast a few things

00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:57,840
are seeing just pretty much C actually

00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,700
it's the idea that it takes you longer

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,290
to develop because it's not compiled you

00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,450
can't find your problems as quickly

00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:05,040
because it's not compiled I think this

00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,540
is a familiarity issue I think the more

00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,680
familiar you are with any language the

00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,870
easier it is regardless of whether it's

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,250
compiled or not I don't think that

00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:13,230
anyone who is doing something like go

00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,670
when it first came out was like man I'm

00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:16,530
brilliant I'm writing I'm writing

00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,910
modules in like 15 seconds because it's

00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,320
compiled now I'm so much better at what

00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:21,810
I'm doing because compiled is better

00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:26,310
than not compiled ridiculous complete

00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:30,330
another misconception security now this

00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:32,760
is an interesting one I put it here not

00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:34,770
because of PHP I put it here because

00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,180
this is the beginning of the talk and I

00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:38,729
think this is a very important point to

00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:40,290
make I could have put this on any of the

00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:41,010
languages any of the tools any other

00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,570
things that I'm going to talk about

00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:45,960
because security is an issue with

00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:48,150
everything PHP is no exception when you

00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,590
put applications up on the web there's a

00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,940
security issue because you've already

00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,980
made it public no matter what it's

00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,440
already a security issue if you do not

00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,470
design your application with security in

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,110
mind from

00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,130
start it's just like writing tests if

00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,390
you don't do it from the start you've

00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:04,060
art you're already behind the eight ball

00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:06,460
you've already made a mistake

00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,930
that's not exclusive to PHP that's

00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,760
exclusive to application development

00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:12,400
anything that will ever go out in the

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,840
world is inherently insecure you can

00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,220
only make it as secure as you're willing

00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,790
to make it but you have to be willing to

00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:20,170
make it secure so that's up to you so

00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:24,210
let's talk about one thing that isn't

00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:26,320
really amidst PHP has a stuffy problem

00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:29,590
some of you laughed and some of you

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:33,490
didn't when I was originally when I

00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:34,900
originally wrote this talk the idea was

00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,270
that PHP was for business applications

00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:39,520
it was stuffy no it's for people in

00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:41,250
suits it's for people in cubicles you

00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,960
know web applications that aren't fun

00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:45,310
obviously that's not true we already

00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,900
mentioned Facebook and some other things

00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:49,150
that use PHP that obviously have nothing

00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:51,250
to do with business although Facebook is

00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:54,250
kind of getting more business II by the

00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:56,470
day just slightly disconcerting but the

00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,450
real stuffy problem in PHP and this is

00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,060
no myth is that you people really go for

00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:02,470
these stuffed animals I don't get it

00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:04,360
I've never gotten I mentioned my friend

00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,530
Davey earlier who would who literally

00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,170
call me and be like you're not going to

00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:11,110
believe this I went to true north PHP

00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:13,210
and and grumpy made this woolly mammoth

00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:16,600
stuffy and I bought it for a hundred and

00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:20,500
fifty dollars and I'm like what it's a

00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:22,330
stuffed animal but in all honesty I I do

00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,590
kind of like it I won't buy stuffed

00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,880
animals we have like a rule in my house

00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:26,080
my daughter got kind of crazy with

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,580
stuffed animals when she was younger so

00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:31,480
we're not allowed to buy stuffed animals

00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:32,920
ever but I like the fact this is

00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,850
something that unifies this community

00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,680
it's something that brings people

00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:37,870
together there's a collection and a lot

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,650
of these goes towards good causes you

00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:43,089
know PHP women and you know what at one

00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:44,589
point time there was a prompt a prompt

00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:46,480
elephant for mental health and tech and

00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:48,250
you know it's just great to see that

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,930
these perpetuate the community they

00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,730
continue things because without people

00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:56,140
participating without fun stuff like

00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:58,510
stuffies your community dies so let's

00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:00,670
talk about the archenemy of PHP which is

00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,990
of course Ruby right how many people

00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:04,510
have programmed a Ruby before tried it

00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:05,710
out done anything you don't have to be

00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,860
embarrassed it's okay we're all friends

00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,860
here

00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:12,040
I program in Ruby for a while Ruby

00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,660
I hate to say this in this conference

00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,850
it's my favorite language I really

00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,500
really like it just cuz it's a lot of

00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:20,200
fun to code in and you can make a ton of

00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,899
absolutely useless crap with it which is

00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,720
true when I first started in Ruby which

00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:26,829
was about 10 or 12 years ago it was the

00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,350
belief of a lot of people that that's

00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:31,480
all you could do with it Ruby is useless

00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:33,490
hipsters use that and believe me I'm so

00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:37,240
old I'm not a hipster I literally was

00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:38,860
there before it was cool but that was

00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,570
the attitude unfortunately hasn't

00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:43,360
changed much and the reason for this

00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:47,230
attitude is because of rails how many

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,029
people have looked at rails yeah why do

00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:50,800
people think rails is hipster there's

00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:51,660
two main reasons anyone want to take a

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,510
guess

00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:58,300
can't one of them is just three initials

00:11:54,510 --> 00:12:00,209
two of those initials are repeated so

00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:04,060
there's this dude

00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:07,240
his name is David Heine Meir Hansen and

00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:11,260
on a personal level David is a very nice

00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:13,089
guy he loves open-source he loved

00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,920
open-source so much and Ruby's so much

00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:16,269
that he said I'm gonna build a framework

00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,589
I want to make web applications with

00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:21,250
Ruby because that's how much I love this

00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:24,010
at the time 15 years ago there was no

00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:25,120
way to do that ruby was just this

00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,560
language is just kind of hanging out

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,329
there you could make little desktop

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,949
modules little scripts things like that

00:12:28,329 --> 00:12:32,860
but you couldn't put it on the web

00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:34,410
David made that possible David is a

00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,699
really smart guy

00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:41,440
David got on Twitter and made a handle

00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:44,949
called DHH that's his initials David

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,769
decided that he has opinions and his

00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:49,390
opinions count for the community so for

00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:50,709
a long time anything that David said

00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,899
every will be like well that's the way

00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:55,870
rub rails developers are rails

00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:57,850
developers totally totally agree with

00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,380
everything he says and I can tell you

00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,149
from the standpoint of someone who is

00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:04,029
been a rails developer Ruby developer

00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:06,339
for years we do not all agree with DHH

00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:09,459
when he said CoffeeScript many people

00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:10,660
like Tom know when he said action cable

00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:12,579
does anyone know what action cable does

00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:13,899
I've been programming in rails for 12

00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:15,300
years I don't know what action cable

00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:20,410
does it as far as I know it's useless

00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:22,089
people said David David is has moved on

00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,709
a little bit he's still kind of like

00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:24,279
that benevolent dictator for life he's

00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:26,589
kind of like

00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:29,620
is Rasmus but at the same time like

00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:31,120
instead he races cars and fixes his hair

00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:34,629
I don't know what he does and spouts

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,519
 on Twitter all the time but he

00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:38,529
gave us rails so we have to be somewhat

00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:39,910
grateful the other reason why there's

00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:41,740
all these myths about rails being for

00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:44,050
hipsters and that it's not useful is

00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:46,990
that rails has a lot of auto magical

00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:50,019
features I hate that word rails whole

00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:52,290
tagline was get there get 90% of the way

00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:54,870
done in 10% of the time which

00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:57,370
technically can be true depending on how

00:13:54,870 --> 00:14:02,050
thorough and robust your application is

00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:04,149
so key thing to remember though is while

00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:07,870
Ruby and rails are similar and they have

00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:09,629
the same community ruby is not rails I

00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:12,309
continue to build applications as day

00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:14,920
very rarely do I fight you feel the need

00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:16,480
to do rails there are many other

00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,220
frameworks out there things have come up

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,129
there's no need to deal with this

00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:24,759
opinionated clunky monolithic thing

00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:26,769
anymore it's pointless yet people still

00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:28,300
have this procession someone let's this

00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:30,069
sink in for a second this is an

00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:34,389
exclusive to Ruby this is often a

00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:38,259
thought about open source so this is

00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:40,029
taken by from a blog post about software

00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:43,689
an enterprise enterprise software

00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:46,209
development not being dead the idea that

00:14:43,689 --> 00:14:47,439
only hipsters were doing open source and

00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:48,759
really important people were doing

00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:50,230
enterprise software we're gonna come

00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:52,269
back to that in a real in a little bit

00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:54,430
but I think it's interesting that the

00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:56,470
whole the whole idea here and this is

00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:58,750
from a few years ago whole idea here is

00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:00,160
that Ruby developers all wear ruby gear

00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:03,250
all the time they wear hats they have

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,889
beards and they make crappy applications

00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:07,449
I have made crappy applications I do

00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:08,949
have a beard now where however I'm not

00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:12,220
representative all of the Ruby community

00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:13,569
I'm just one person nonetheless when I

00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,850
saw this it blew me away I was like do

00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:18,579
people really still think like this and

00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:20,139
then I saw this the only thing worse

00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:22,929
than ironing rooming in prod is relying

00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:26,589
on a hobbyist hobbyist who's running

00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:28,629
Ruby and prod I saw this and I flipped

00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:30,839
and this is from a friend of mine it

00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:33,550
wasn't to me I just saw it randomly

00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:36,699
their name will be redacted I was

00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:39,360
shocked though I was like this because I

00:15:36,699 --> 00:15:44,590
had to remove the name of stuff this

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:47,350
November of 2017 so this is still the

00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:50,590
attitude where were 15 years into Rails

00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:52,000
and 25 years almost into Ruby this is

00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:55,450
still the attitude that Ruby is for

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,850
hobbyists so the shock has worn off a

00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:59,410
bit however I always have a response for

00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:01,060
when people say Ruby is for hipsters

00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:02,980
Ruby is garbage what's the point of Ruby

00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,560
and that's the fact that a lot of people

00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:07,960
happen to be using it a lot of these

00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,030
people use every day I have teenage kids

00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:12,430
I actually do use urban dictionary every

00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:14,020
day I don't understand what they're

00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:18,550
saying sometimes it's kind of important

00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:21,790
but I mean Netflix runs on Rails how

00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:23,710
many people use n decks that Zendesk not

00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,970
many maybe you might be you might not

00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,320
even know your company probably has its

00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:29,530
skin so it just looks like a ticketing

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:32,620
system Zendesk runs on Rails Hulu runs

00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:34,870
on Rails prompt runs on Jekyll which is

00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:36,520
another framework for Ruby all of these

00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:39,670
companies github is still a rails

00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:41,410
application at its heart there's a lot

00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:44,740
of other things going on but it's still

00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:47,200
there so obviously Ruby is not just for

00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:49,030
hipsters it's not just for useless South

00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:53,260
of Market Coffee apps for San Francisco

00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:56,170
people so let's dispel that myth let's

00:16:53,260 --> 00:17:03,640
talk about Java Java is totally dead

00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:05,320
right nobody uses Java but yet yet it's

00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,970
one of the biggest powers and

00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:10,110
application development still to this

00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:12,579
date I worked at IBM for a while

00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:15,160
IBM just about everything they write

00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:17,980
everything they write is at its heart

00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,720
Java we talked about microservices

00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:22,209
earlier so it's easy to plug things into

00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,020
other things now and have applications

00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:26,130
that are written in seven different

00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:29,740
languages however IBM still loves Java

00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:31,540
Java is amazing like to do your expenses

00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,770
at IBM they built their own Java applet

00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,510
to communicate with people they built

00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,320
their own Java applet Java is

00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:37,480
super-powerful

00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,160
and for people who think the Java is

00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,450
dead I'll have to say is how often do

00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,150
you see this coffee mug on your screen

00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:45,340
that you need to update this it's like

00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:46,510
at least once a week sometimes it's a

00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,250
lie by the way keep an eye on that

00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:48,940
there's a lot apparently I was reading

00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,670
in the news there's been a lot of

00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,120
fishing expeditions about Java recently

00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,160
and you

00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:57,730
thing this is update Java and flash and

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,350
it's actually complete BS so obviously

00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:00,640
Java is not dead so let's talk about

00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:02,020
another language let's talk about Python

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,750
I'm gonna go through these a little more

00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,680
quickly because I think they're a little

00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:09,030
less relatable how many people would

00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:11,170
program Python before sigh pi math.pi

00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:12,340
python is pretty awesome Python was

00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:16,390
originally developed as an academic

00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:18,280
language it was for theoretical language

00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:19,809
development the idea behind Python

00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,910
initially was actually to develop other

00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:24,610
languages that could do things that

00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:26,860
weren't academic so some people still

00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:28,630
have this perspective that Python is

00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,530
just it's strictly for the theorists

00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,480
it's for the people that are doing

00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:33,280
hardcore you know proof of concept

00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,710
papers at large-scale universities

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:39,130
computer science programs which is cool

00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:42,580
I guess but it doesn't really work that

00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:43,720
way at a previous job at a company

00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,179
called Engine Yard that some of you may

00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,340
heard of I worked on the community team

00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:50,110
which was a great great team one of the

00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,400
things that we did was an application

00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,929
called thank you

00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,640
the idea behind thank you was there's so

00:18:52,929 --> 00:18:56,140
many people that do open-source there

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,790
used to be this thing called get tip I

00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:00,340
know it changed his name and eventually

00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:02,230
went away but the idea was if someone

00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:04,179
signed up to get tip you could send them

00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:05,890
like you know a couple dollars a week

00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:08,200
and that would help perpetuate their

00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:09,550
open-source you know work it's just a

00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,100
little way to say thank you here's a tip

00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:13,809
thank you so we developed a Python

00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,150
application strictly built out of love

00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:18,340
no academics here at all that anyone at

00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,929
Engine Yard could say hey I know this

00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,520
person I know Dave Stokes and Dave

00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:23,920
Stokes does a lot of awesome open-source

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,290
work I'm gonna give him a good tip and

00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,429
put him on the list dollar a week cool

00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,320
and we had this budget and would take

00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:31,360
from the budget and put it in good tip

00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,460
for these people and it was awesome so

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,630
that's not really academic but that's a

00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:38,170
personal example let me give you another

00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:40,650
big example railsconf a couple years ago

00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:42,670
they brought this gentleman from Spotify

00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:45,670
I'm sure we've all heard of Spotify

00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:47,140
don't need to show hands on that Spotify

00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:50,080
is a pretty awesome program mostly

00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:53,980
written in Python with a lot a lot a lot

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,690
of JavaScript he talked about how they

00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,160
started like the original idea behind

00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:58,540
Spotify was similar to Pandora they

00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,670
wanted to analyze music and see how it

00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:01,570
went they started getting into Python

00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,280
and started realizing there were a lot

00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:04,450
of fun things you can do and one of the

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,680
things that he talked about at railsconf

00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:07,270
which was amazing because

00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,770
similar to talk about Ruby and Python

00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:10,660
and Java at this conference he was

00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:14,190
talking about Python at railsconf which

00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:15,820
was just keynote blown away he made a

00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:20,320
Caucasian his team made an application

00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:22,750
called jump to frog jump the frog you

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,430
give it two pieces of music and it will

00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:26,500
draw a line between those two pieces

00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:30,100
music so everyone knows who katy perry

00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:31,720
is right you know one raise their hand

00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,860
you know who katy perry is don't lie to

00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:37,330
me I know it's early people but come on

00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:39,760
so you know Katy Perry is I would

00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:40,540
imagine less people know who and I'll

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,190
use just because we had this

00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:44,140
conversation earlier fewer people

00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:48,520
probably know who Mastodon is who knows

00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:50,140
who Mastodon is yeah so Mastodon is you

00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,370
know they're a metal band if you really

00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:53,760
want to get literal during our sludge

00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:55,630
metal band from Atlanta

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,340
you wouldn't think there's a whole lot

00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:00,880
of commonality between Katy Perry and

00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:03,640
Mastodon you don't see a lot of a lot of

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,890
parody between you know a song about

00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,990
being a paper bag and baby you're a

00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:09,490
firework and a song about the curl of

00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:13,420
the burl which is about how you shave

00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:16,270
wood which is bizarre but anyway the

00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:18,309
point being within 10 songs he could

00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:20,620
find anything that's really the

00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:22,090
application worked and that's love you

00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:24,730
don't build an application like that and

00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:26,620
not see how people have a passion for

00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:28,780
something so the idea that is just

00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:30,880
academic just useless just not really

00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:34,870
for anything should be thrown out in the

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:37,630
garbage that's a myth Linux not a

00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:40,720
programming language I know I'm standing

00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:43,870
on the Red Hat stage I know that we all

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:49,080
love open source 2018 is not the year of

00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:51,520
the Linux desktop oh that was harsh Wow

00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,690
no really until someone like my grandma

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,860
can use it it's not the year the Linux

00:21:52,690 --> 00:22:00,160
desktop but still there are people out

00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:02,410
there we'll call them champions of the

00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:05,500
Mac or perhaps heroes of the windows

00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:08,070
world who believed that Linux is is dead

00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:11,500
it's gone no one uses Linux anymore

00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:13,540
that's preposterous I mean especially if

00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,670
you're a Mac user because it's basically

00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:19,360
the same thing just prettier on the

00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:21,940
outside and even I mean even

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,799
windows is big into Linux now I when I

00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,809
was at IBM where they literally make IBM

00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:28,870
laptops that are built to run Windows I

00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:31,990
think something like 90% of the Lenovo

00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:34,540
IBM ThinkPad users were running Linux

00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:36,630
and not Windows so if an organization

00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:39,160
that has 600,000 employees is doing that

00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:41,200
kind of a big deal not going away

00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:44,160
another exam another great example that

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:47,080
I like to use is so I travel a lot I fly

00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:49,570
how many people fly internationally you

00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:52,120
know periodically enough so that they

00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:54,549
give you a movie and you've ever been on

00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,140
the plane and the movie system goes down

00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:58,450
because one person the screen isn't

00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,950
working on a flight of 300 people and so

00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,630
we all have to suffer I was in the

00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:04,450
middle of Justice League which is a

00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:06,610
terrible movie and yet now I have to

00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:10,660
suffer because you know the person in in

00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:12,010
302 couldn't you know see the latest

00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,540
movie with some person who was featured

00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:15,160
in the television show friends whatever

00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:18,549
doesn't matter as soon as they reboot

00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,750
that system you see talks if large scale

00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:21,130
airlines are using this for their

00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:26,340
entertainment system again obviously

00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:29,860
Linux is not so dead is pearl dead

00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:35,770
mm some would say yes yeah if you're not

00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:37,030
been listening to me come on focus pearl

00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:39,330
looked dead for a long time though

00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,330
didn't it

00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:48,340
they had this issue I believe it was

00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:51,490
Perl 5 came out 2001 2002 maybe 2003 at

00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:52,750
the latest and it updated with some

00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:55,929
patches here and there but there was no

00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:57,910
like new full version history I'm in a

00:23:55,929 --> 00:24:01,299
while back I wrote this this article

00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:03,010
called is Ruby dead for Engine Yard and

00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:05,410
the immediate reaction of the Perl

00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:08,440
community was of course this Perl dead

00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:10,929
or just deader than Ruby it's like I

00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,370
don't that's not even like really an

00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:14,020
article like I really upgraded this by

00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:16,990
calling it an article these are the two

00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:18,340
sentences in that entire article I was

00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:21,010
happy because that means someone noticed

00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:22,540
my blog post but yeah I was interested

00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:25,720
in for a long time yeah Perl did look

00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:27,760
dead but a couple years ago Perl 6 came

00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,890
out I don't you guys know what a 6 is

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,059
right I know this is PHP and you guys

00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:33,270
kind of skipped over that whole six

00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:33,270
thing

00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,740
sorry I couldn't resist

00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:40,000
Perla six came out that how many people

00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:43,030
have looked at the latest version of

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,429
pearl it's actually kind of Awesome and

00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:47,799
the key thing about pearl is like a lot

00:24:45,429 --> 00:24:49,660
of us even before PHP got into

00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:51,669
development because Perl was open source

00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:53,620
and it was strong and it was stable and

00:24:51,669 --> 00:24:55,000
it was amazing those earlier versions of

00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,590
Perl that's how I started programming

00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,570
when I decided to move away from like

00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:00,340
you know Visual Basic and visual foxpro

00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:01,660
and you know all those other like

00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,320
microsoft languages that you're taught

00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,870
at school

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,340
I thought Perl was a gift I thought it

00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,900
was amazing and to be honest Perl 6 is

00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,400
really powerful and really really cool

00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:14,559
and I highly recommend if you haven't

00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:17,710
looked at it you should check it out wow

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:20,140
I'm talking a lot so let's move a little

00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:21,760
faster Swift Swift is the ultimate thing

00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:25,360
in the end of the Internet thank you

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,710
good night so when I first started doing

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,720
this talk someone actually post this to

00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:31,240
Objective C developers are now obsolete

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,640
please treat them with respect this was

00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,169
posted by Swift devs like the actual and

00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,820
this is a lot there's a while ago this

00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:38,919
is a long time this tweet came out and I

00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:40,390
was like oh my God look at this look at

00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:43,659
this picture this is the part that

00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:44,830
offended me the most so the elderly are

00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:46,780
obsolete ok

00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:48,370
that's horrible there's a lot that we

00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,840
can learn from older generations so

00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:55,990
let's not say that the elderly are

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:59,159
obsolete pregnant women full disclosure

00:25:55,990 --> 00:26:03,880
I am NOT a professional biologist

00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:05,470
however I am relatively sure that at

00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,600
this point in our scientific lives

00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:10,330
without pregnant women this species will

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,460
end I'm gonna say that's not obsolete

00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:15,580
also Objective C developers are kind of

00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:17,890
important so Swift it's not always about

00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:19,390
the new hotness luckily when they came

00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:20,830
out with 2.0 they actually made an

00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:23,740
open-source and realize their mistakes

00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:24,909
and they've moved on from there so

00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,440
that's that's a positive thing their

00:26:24,909 --> 00:26:27,150
community is moving along it's getting

00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,010
better

00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:32,740
anything with a J s in it if you were a

00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:34,000
developer a few years ago you may

00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:36,159
remember the point in time were

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,929
absolutely anything any word in the

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,340
English or any other language someone

00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:42,010
would appendage ass to it we'd have a

00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:43,540
new framework a new thing if you could

00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:45,340
tell me what most of these things do I'd

00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,419
be surprised I did the research for this

00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,809
talk and I still don't know what half

00:26:46,419 --> 00:26:49,480
these things

00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:52,659
do take anybody want to take a cracking

00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:56,499
j/s anybody guess it doesn't summon the

00:26:52,659 --> 00:26:58,870
Kraken Kraken j/s is a payment platform

00:26:56,499 --> 00:27:02,529
- specifically developed by PayPal to

00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:04,779
process cryptocurrency payments which is

00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:06,090
obvious from the name right and I don't

00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:08,379
mean to I don't need to poop all over

00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:10,029
javascript javascript is ubiquitous we

00:27:08,379 --> 00:27:11,679
need JavaScript there is no web

00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:13,240
application or mobile application out

00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,620
there today that isn't using javascript

00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:17,679
in some way shape or form

00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:23,200
you know react is awesome ember is

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:25,899
awesome angular is available javascript

00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,490
is an amazing amazing tool and there's

00:27:25,899 --> 00:27:29,710
lots of amazing tools that's my point

00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:31,240
there's so many different languages so

00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:33,309
many things that you can learn from that

00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,590
are different from your perspective and

00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:37,179
you should take a look and I think when

00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:38,289
we look at our own languages and we kind

00:27:37,179 --> 00:27:39,730
of you know poop all over everything

00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:41,950
else that's going on we forget about

00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:43,119
that we forget about the beauty of open

00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:46,600
source and how many cool things that are

00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:47,740
out there to try to learn from and a lot

00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,899
of times it's because something news

00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:51,309
come along how many people left the PHP

00:27:49,899 --> 00:27:52,210
community because Ruby came along how

00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:53,950
many people left the Ruby community

00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:55,330
because go came along how many people

00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:57,369
have to go because javascript is the new

00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:59,799
hotness like it's it's it's a perpetual

00:27:57,369 --> 00:28:01,149
thing and we can't just do that it's

00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:03,789
about evolution it's about things

00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:06,580
changing at a rate that's understandable

00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:08,259
and getting better so I want to talk a

00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:09,399
little bit we understand this from the

00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:11,169
language perspective I think we've got

00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:12,549
that now so let's talk a little bit

00:28:11,169 --> 00:28:14,169
about communities I love this picture

00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:16,840
because in many ways it describes the

00:28:14,169 --> 00:28:18,970
tech community to a tee let's say these

00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:21,309
red folks are Ruby folks and the blue

00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:23,440
folks they can be PHP and the green

00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:27,519
folks JavaScript sure why not

00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:30,820
Orange they can be just Java yellow is

00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:31,269
dotnet developers you see you see what

00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,279
I'm saying

00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:34,749
so they're all in the same place they're

00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,919
all connected by these lines they're

00:28:34,749 --> 00:28:37,570
connected because they're the tech

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,830
community they're all developers cool

00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:40,419
but they're all in their own little

00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:44,649
circles and they're not communicating to

00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:46,299
each other why can't we do that why is

00:28:44,649 --> 00:28:48,100
that a problem and I'll tell you why

00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:50,230
because people have these weird

00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:52,240
perspectives people say ridiculous

00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:53,499
things these are all things I've

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,789
literally had people say to me that I've

00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:56,710
either worked with or at a meet-up or at

00:28:54,789 --> 00:28:58,809
a conference I think it's weird

00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:00,550
designers aren't developers I for one

00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:02,080
I've been developing for years

00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:04,450
I would not be able to match my clothes

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,920
if I was not married and if you want to

00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:08,470
see pictures of before I was married you

00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,790
can see how true this is I used to wear

00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:13,450
black shirts all the time because you

00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:14,890
can't screw that up but you know I can't

00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:16,240
design a web application that looks good

00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:19,120
I can design a web application that

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,160
functions I can design a web application

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,540
that works and it's got a white

00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,920
background with black text and it's in

00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:26,230
time New York Times New Roman because

00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:28,060
that's the default and that's how it

00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:29,500
goes then I get somebody who comes along

00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,640
and makes it pretty and looks good so

00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,400
that people might actually want to use

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,500
it this other one sis admin's can live

00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:38,070
without developers this was said to me

00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:41,110
by someone who was obviously a sysadmin

00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:44,560
at a cloud company and it took me back a

00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:46,680
second and I said all right let's just

00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:48,940
say for example there's no developers

00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:52,090
what do we need system ins for what the

00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:53,830
hell are you serving that's like saying

00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,150
the restaurant industry is great if we

00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:59,170
just get rid of all these people who are

00:29:55,150 --> 00:30:00,640
eating makes no sense business folks

00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:03,790
just don't understand developers this

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,290
one small caveat it is difficult there's

00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:06,640
a cultural difference between the two

00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:09,010
groups

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,540
I personally I'm not I don't care about

00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:12,850
making money I don't think it's a big

00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:14,500
deal I'm not going to go on an anti

00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:15,100
campus capitalism rant that's not what

00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,050
I'm here for

00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:21,370
it's also not my politics don't really

00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:22,870
care but this came along when someone

00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:24,250
who was running a business was looking

00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:26,410
for developers came to a meet-up that I

00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:28,240
was running and you know someone was

00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:30,280
like I can't believe this guy walked in

00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,490
he's wearing a suit a suit are you

00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:35,260
kidding me it's like so your issue isn't

00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:36,640
so much with the fact that he's business

00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:41,110
C and not a developer that your issues

00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,460
with his fashion it's not true the guy

00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:44,140
is actually really smart he had been a

00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:46,120
developer he moved into business because

00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:47,380
he started his own startup and when

00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,060
you'd start your own startup you kind of

00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:52,240
have to do the business end to as I've

00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:53,650
learned recently and that might not be

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,910
great you might be super technical but

00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:57,940
you just happen also like three-piece

00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:59,760
suits that's cool too whatever don't

00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:02,260
shun people out don't shut people out

00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:05,740
tech people are socially inept all of

00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:09,430
them this is my favorite someone said

00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:12,850
this to me after I gave a talk in a room

00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:13,820
well like this one maybe a little bit

00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:16,730
bigger

00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:18,590
it was like 2,000 people and I was like

00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:20,210
these people are all talking to each

00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:22,130
other after I talked up on stage where's

00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:25,190
the social ineptitude I just laughed it

00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:28,550
off moved along the idea is we need to

00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:31,160
share ideas we can't just say oh you're

00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:33,190
a PHP developer I'm a ruby developer we

00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:38,810
should never identify ourselves that way

00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:40,700
I'm PJ your insert name here and you

00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:42,470
learn the more you cross pollinate the

00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,700
more you look at the different ways

00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:45,050
people do things the more you learn the

00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,190
better you can make the language that

00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:48,230
you focus on the better you can make the

00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:49,490
community focus on and the better you

00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:51,800
make it the cooler can be we could be

00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:53,390
giant super awesome robot guy of the

00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,530
tech community or lady I don't know the

00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:59,090
gender of this robot I should not have

00:31:54,530 --> 00:32:01,220
assumed this robot is awesome we can be

00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:03,650
awesome that's so we need to focus on

00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:05,030
but we have to get rid of the biases and

00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:06,320
what's one of the biggest biases we have

00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:08,900
throw all the languages out throw

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:11,000
everything out one of the biggest biases

00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,920
we have the comparison of open source to

00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,870
enterprise

00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:16,490
because enterprise is of course the most

00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:18,590
horrible thing in the world and open

00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:20,810
source is for hippies remember hipsters

00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:22,520
we make stupid apps people that live in

00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:24,860
basements with neckbeards even the

00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,750
ladies with neck beards trying to put

00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:29,660
together enough Linux packages so that

00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:31,580
we can maybe get enough food to feed our

00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:32,930
250 cats that are living in our mom's

00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,130
house where we live in the basement of

00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:36,350
because that's what open-source

00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:37,460
developers like and then of course

00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:40,370
there's you know the enterprise

00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:42,230
developer aha business working in a

00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:43,610
small gray cubicle to build software for

00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:46,190
other people who work in other small

00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:47,270
gray cubicles just eking out a life so

00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:50,320
they can make enough money to retire

00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:54,610
comfortably to you know the suburbs

00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:57,140
that's that's total I

00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:59,660
have a good friend guy named Chad Fowler

00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:02,330
a really good guy really good guy

00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:03,590
Madam's in the Ruby community he went to

00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:05,000
work for a place called wonder list

00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:06,350
wunderlist is an awesome way to keep

00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,550
track of things if you're like me and

00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:10,300
you forget things like you have a great

00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:10,300
thought then it's gone

00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:14,990
he was a ruby developer when he started

00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:16,490
there let me realize that you know

00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:18,230
Microsoft was on the table they were

00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:22,220
gonna buy this company so he started

00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:24,170
looking at vb.net and C sharp and F

00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:26,120
sharp and a bunch of other technologies

00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:27,800
and now he's like a full-on polyglot who

00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,900
understands the value of doing on sand

00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:32,090
is technically on paper and enterprise

00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:33,620
developer never seen him wear a tie and

00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:35,690
I don't know how much money he makes and

00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:37,850
he doesn't seem to care either she still

00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:38,270
has a big bushy beard still loves open

00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,700
source

00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:41,720
he's an enterprise developer there's a

00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,930
lot of things that we can learn from

00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:48,830
enterprise development community

00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:51,320
organization deadlines the importance of

00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:53,900
making things as available as general as

00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:56,750
we possibly can for everyone following

00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:58,010
guidelines like accessibility there's a

00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:00,500
lot of things that enterprise can learn

00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:03,080
from us like creativity the idea of code

00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,610
is craft the idea of making something

00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,980
with passion not just because it has to

00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:10,040
be made so if we get along things would

00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:12,620
get better do it for the children so

00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:15,230
what else we need to dispel a few myths

00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:18,740
in general there's no such thing as a

00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:20,000
rockstar wizard ninja developer we've

00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,290
all seen it on LinkedIn we've all gotten

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,900
the recruiter emails and it's complete

00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:24,980
and utter crap the viewer Rockstar you'd

00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:27,200
be up on a stage much bigger than

00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,670
 you'd be sleeping you'd be

00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,900
sleeping it's the middle of day but

00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:31,580
later tonight you'd be on a stage much

00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:34,610
bigger than this doing a lot louder

00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:36,980
things if you were a ninja okay maybe

00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:38,270
that's possible because you can't see

00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,570
ninjas there could be some in this room

00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:41,150
right now

00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:42,830
and as far as I know regards to the fact

00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:45,080
I spent a lot of time at platform 9 and

00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:46,520
3/4 last night don't judge me

00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:48,770
there's no such thing as Wizards in real

00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:50,179
life we have to be cooler with each

00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:52,400
other we have to stop thinking that were

00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:54,169
the best of the best we have something

00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:56,510
that what we code is is all about our

00:34:54,169 --> 00:34:58,430
identity there's so much more to people

00:34:56,510 --> 00:35:01,580
but the whole point of that intro slide

00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:03,790
I'm a dad I'm a drummer I also happen to

00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,790
code

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:31,490
thank you very much

00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:31,490
