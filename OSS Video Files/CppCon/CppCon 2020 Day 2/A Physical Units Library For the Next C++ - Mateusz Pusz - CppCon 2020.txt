During CppCon 2019 Mateusz provided an overview of current solutions on the market as well as challenges of implementing a modern C++ physical units library. This year's talk will focus on 'mp-units', the library that was developed by Mateusz and contributors, and which is proposed for C++ standardization. During the tutorial, we will get familiar with the building blocks of the library's framework and its most important concepts. Numerous code examples will present how to use and solve real-life problems with the library. The audience will learn how easy it is to extend it with new units, dimensions, or even whole new systems of quantities. Last but not least Mateusz will provide a fair comparison of how well this library performs in comparison to other products on the market.
