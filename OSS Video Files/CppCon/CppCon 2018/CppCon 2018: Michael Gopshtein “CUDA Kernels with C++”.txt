CUDA is a parallel computing platform for a generic computing on Nvidia GPUs. We will focus on CUDA C/C++ programming, covering in detail various types of GPU memory (Shared/Global/Texture/ConstShared/Pinned), optimization of the work distribution between CUDA “threads”, precompiled CUDA code VS Runtime Compilation. 
Often the CUDA code is written in C style, missing the opportunity to use safer and more readable C++ constructs. In the spirit of the conference a special focus will be given to the use of modern C++ features in the CUDA applications inside the device (“kernel”) code, host code, and more importantly – which of the C++ paradigms can cross the bridge between the two worlds.
