Challenge: Write a library function template that takes exactly one positive, integral parameter. 

There are many different ways to implement this function template in standard C++. The future additions of Concepts and Contracts will provide even more, possibly simpler, implementations as well. We will review the current status of both of these important new features, conduct a brief overview of what they can do, and then examine how they can work together towards an interface specification nirvana.
