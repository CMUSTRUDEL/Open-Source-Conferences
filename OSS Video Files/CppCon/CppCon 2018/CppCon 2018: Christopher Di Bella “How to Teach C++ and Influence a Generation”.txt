At some point in your career, you will need to teach someone something about C++. You might not be a lecturer or a trainer, but you could be helping a colleague with a problem that they're solving, presenting at a lunch-time session, or even at a conference! Perhaps you're someone who is helping to write your company's style guide or "Intro to Our Repo" manual. Correctly teaching C++ is a tough endeavour. C++ is often taught incorrectly at the university level, via online resources, and in books. Many resources are still outdated or refuse to change with the paradigm shift that the C++ community has been undergoing over the past two decades. 

We should seek to convey correct information and provide resources that are factual. We should make learning C++ an enjoyable experience, and that stems from the way in which we teach it. 

This talk digs into how we can achieve some of this, but it by no means provides all the answers, and may lead to more questions.
