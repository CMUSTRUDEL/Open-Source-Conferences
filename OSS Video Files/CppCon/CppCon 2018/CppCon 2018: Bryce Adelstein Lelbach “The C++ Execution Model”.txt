At the heart of the C++ programming language is the multi-threaded abstract machine and its execution model, the platform-agnostic formal model that generically describes how to run a C++ program. In this talk, you will learn the rules that govern how your C++ code is executed and see how those rules impact the C++ code you write every day. 

We'll explore the C++ execution and memory model, and discuss fundamental questions such as: 

* What are threads in C++ and how do they interact? 
* What is memory in C++? 
* In what order are things in my C++ program executed? 
* How are C++ expressions and statements executed? 
* What are the semantics of calling a function in C++? 
* What does "happens before" mean? 

If you're interested in gaining a deeper understanding of how your C++ code is executed and how concurrency works in C++, you should attend this talk.

Bryce Adelstein Lelbach, NVIDIA
Senior Software Engineer

Bryce Adelstein Lelbach is a software engineer on the CUDA driver team at NVIDIA. Bryce is passionate about parallel programming. He maintains Thrust, the CUDA C++ core library. He is also one of the initial developers of the HPX C++ runtime system. He spent five years working on HPX while he was at Louisiana State University's Center for Computation and Technology, and three years at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (a US Department of Energy research facility) developing and analyzing new parallel programming models for exascale and post-Moore architectures. He also helped start the LLVMLinux initiative, and has occasionally contributed to the Boost C++ libraries. Bryce is an organizer for the C++Now and CppCon conferences as well as the Bay Area C++ user group, and he is passionate about C++ community development. He is a member of the ISO C++ standard committee. He worked on the C++17 parallel algorithms; today, he works on standardizing better futures, executors, and multi-dimensional arrays.
