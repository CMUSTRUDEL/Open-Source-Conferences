This talk will be modeled on our previously successful talks at CppCon. We'll give the community an update on how we are doing in terms of conformance where we'll be announcing the final conformance state for MSVC for the final 2017 update. We'll be showing many many demos of new features (not in previous versions of this talk) that target cross platform developers in C++. This will include making it easier to bring your code to Visual Studio, significant improvements to ease of use for developers using CMake, improvements to unit testing experiences, a lot of new Linux targeting improvements, an update on our performance work, and new debugger features for C++ developers. Developers will learn new tricks they can apply immediately on leaving the session as well as get a sense of what is coming in future updates. The main message is that Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code will make every C++ developer (not just Windows developers) more productive.
