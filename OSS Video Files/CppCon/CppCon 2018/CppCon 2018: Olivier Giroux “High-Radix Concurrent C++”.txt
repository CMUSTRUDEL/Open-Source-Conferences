In this talk we will share the joy of seeing ordinary C++ concurrent code, doing ordinary concurrent things in 100000 concurrent threads. I’ll analyze how the code is behaving and point out what is similar and different about the execution of that code at this scale. This talk is the code-heavy continuation of last year’s English-heavy “Designing C++ Hardware” about the Volta architecture.

Featuring:

Multiple compilers.
Godbolting.
C++20 concurrency predictions.
Live demo (attempt).
