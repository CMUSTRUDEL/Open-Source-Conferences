Amid an avalanche of packaging solutions, who's side should you take? Trick question; you can support all of them! Discover the fundamental principles that make your library easy for _others_ to package so you don't have to! As a bonus, your builds will be faster, simpler, and more maintainable. 

This talk covers the lessons learned from packaging over 700 libraries in vcpkg, from the simplest single-header to the massive framework of Qt. We'll dissect the open source package maintainer's perspective and walk through the top library mistakes, supported by real-world examples from the vcpkg catalog.
