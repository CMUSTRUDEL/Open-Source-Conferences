Most computer languages, including C++, cannot guarantee that an integer expression will not produce a incorrect arithmetic result. 

This fact is documented in numerous books, articles and conference presentations such as CPPCon. These presentations give good explanations of the problem and it's causes. But they are short on specific practical strategies to address the problem. The Boost.SafeNumerics library addresses this problem through C++ techniques such as operator overloading, template meta-programming. This library can be used to write C or C++ code guaranteed not to produce erroneous arithmetic results. In many cases, this guarantee can be made without adding any run-time overhead. 

This presentation will 

* illustrate some common problems such as integer overflows and type conversions. 
* illustrate how the library can be used to address these problems. 
* describe in general terms what the library does and how it works. 
* describe the library API in some detail. 
* present a case study applying the library to embedded motor controller written in C.
