With the "C++ Renaissance" it is imperative that the technical leadership prove their mettle to lead a large organization into adopting modern practices and idioms. 

In this talk, John and Kevin will discuss various techniques that they have employed to help drive their large development organization (~ 75 software engineers) towards a culture of modernization - some techniques that have worked well, and some that have not. 

This will not be a discussion on specifics and nuances of the language. This is more a "fuzzy" discussion on what it means to be both at the forefront of the language and a leader / champion for your peers.

Kevin Kostrzewa:  My first piece of published software was in 1983, on a Commodore 64, published in Commodore Power/Play magazine. I have been a professional programmer since 1992 working for Thomson Reuters (originally Creative Solutions) working initially in C/DOS and now primarily in C++/Windows.

John Wyman: I have been working at Thomson Reuters (then Creative Solutions) since 1999. There I develop a US Tax application that contains modules for most conceivable forms of US Tax. US Tax makes for a dynamic code base and a strong desire for efficiency, making C++ our tool of choice.
