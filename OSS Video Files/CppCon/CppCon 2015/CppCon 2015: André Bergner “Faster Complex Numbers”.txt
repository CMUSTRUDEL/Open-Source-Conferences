Complex numbers are an important tool from mathematics enabling many problems to be written in a more generic form. The C++ standard library comes with an implementation to work with complex numbers in a natural way.

Motivated by useful real world examples from theoretical physics and audio dsp I will discuss benchmarks of std::complex and demonstrate how alternative implementations, naïve or advanced ones based on expression templates, outperform std::complex and can compete with hand-crafted C code (depending on compiler and std lib). A quick introduction to expression templates will be provided.

André leads the Traktor software development team at Native Instruments. There he is taking an active role in modernizing the C++ coding standards by organizing tech talks and introducing new techniques and libraries. Some of his main interests are functional and generic programming and solving meta-programming puzzles. Besides that he is lecturer at the Beuth Hochschule in Berlin where he teaches C++ and is one of the organizers of the local Berlin C++ meetups.
