This talk is an overview of how C++ can be used to quickly create cross-platform virtual reality experiences while sharing one codebase. 

To support all major vendors, a VR experience has to span not only across operating systems, but also device types, hardware specs, manufacturers, and SDKs -- and so pitfalls and learnings from shipping on Oculus mobile and desktop, Google Cardboard, and soon Sony's Morpheus will be discussed.

We'll cover networking, graphics, SDK wrappers, and even abstracting language oddities (Android's Java layer for Oculus mobile).

Nick is a VR/AR engineer who is passionate about bridging the interface between computers and humans. Currently he's VP of Software Development at OTOY focusing on VR and AR ("mixed/digital reality"). He was a cofounder of everyAir, a pioneering P2P game streaming application which was later acquired. Before that he worked at Microsoft on Office 2010 and 2013.

Feel free to talk to me about any rendering, real-time graphics, computer vision, and of course C++!
