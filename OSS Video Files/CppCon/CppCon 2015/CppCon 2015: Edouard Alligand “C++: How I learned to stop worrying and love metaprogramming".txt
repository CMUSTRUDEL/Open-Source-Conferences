Horrible software engineering technique conceived in the forge of Hell or the Only True Way of doing C++ in 2015, template metaprogramming and its cohort of companion techniques are sure to create animation in a group of programmers. 

What if we were to tell you that an actual software product, actually sold to real customers and in production for now several years has been built on it? What if we were to tell you that a lot of advanced template techniques helped us to build a better software faster? 

This talk is all about real life examples of template metaprogramming, why they are useful and when and how you could use them in your own projects.

Edouard has more than thirteen years of professional experience in software engineering. After years hacking the kernel of various operating systems, Edouard founded Bureau 14, the home of the hyperscalable database quasardb. Combining an excellent knowledge of low level programming with a perverse love for template meta-programming, Edouard likes to come up with uncompromising solutions to seemingly impossible problems. He lives in Paris, France.
