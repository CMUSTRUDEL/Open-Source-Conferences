This presentation will discuss the benefits of using a documentation generator for creating internal code documentation or end user documentation.  DoxyPress can be used to document your source code, generate API documentation, show class hierarchies, collaboration diagrams, and much more. DoxyPress supports several output formats including html, chm, latex, and man pages. 

As part of our talk we will cover the process of redesigning source code originally designed for C++98 and how to migrate it to C++11. We will talk about the advantages and drawbacks of moving to C++11 and show how the code changed in DoxyPress.

We will show a small demonstration of DoxyPressApp, which is a a GUI program used to set up your project file which is then used by DoxyPress to generate documentation.

DoxyPress is a fork of the Doxygen documentation tool. A very basic understanding of C++ will be helpful. No prior knowledge of DoxyPress or Doxygen is required.

Barbara Geller:  I am an independent consultant with over twenty-five years of experience as a programmer and software developer. I have worked with numerous smaller companies developing in-house applications. I have also designed and developed Windows applications for several vertical markets including medical billing, transportation, and construction.

My degree is in Electrical Engineering from Cal Poly Pomona with additional studies in Computer Science.

I am a Co-founder of CopperSpice, a C++ library derived from the existing Qt framework. I designed the Diamond Editor, a cross-platform programmers editor using the CopperSpice libraries. I have programmed in C++, Qt, Visual Objects, Clipper, PHP, and Java.

Ansel Sermersheim:  I have been working as a programmer for over fifteen years. My degree is in Computer Science from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 

Currently I work as a software engineer designing scalable, high performance, multi-threaded network daemons in C++. The daemons I have developed are used at a Tier 1 carrier serving static and live content to customers around the world. I am a Co-founder of CopperSpice, a C++ library derived from the existing Qt 4.8 framework. I have programmed in C++, C, Lisp, Java, and Perl. I am an avid follower of the C++ standard.
