Writing code that does what you want it to do, correctly and efficiently, is hard. Doing so when you don't even know yet what you want the code to do yet is quite a bit harder. Yet this is the job of a library writer -- the users of a library may have a very different use case from that of the original author.

How do library writers develop correct and efficient APIs that are also:

- easy to use correctly - hard to use incorrectly - highly reusable - gracefully interoperable with other code

This talk gives lots of practical advice and techniques for accomplishing those goals and more.
