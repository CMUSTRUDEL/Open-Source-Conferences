Sound is an essential medium for human-computer interaction and vital for applications such as games and music production software. In the audio industry, C++ is the dominating programming language. This talk provides an insight into the patterns and tools that C++ developers in the audio industry rely on. There are interesting lessons to be learned from this domain that can be useful to every C++ developer.

Handling audio in real time presents interesting technical challenges. Techniques also used in other C++ domains have to be combined: real-time multithreading, lock-free programming, efficient DSP, SIMD, and low-latency hardware communication. C++ is the language of choice to tie all these requirements together. Clever leveraging of advanced C++ techniques, template metaprogramming, and the new C++11/14 standard makes these tasks more exciting than ever.

Timur Doumler is Senior Software Developer at London-based technology company ROLI. He is working with Julian Storer to further develop JUCE, the leading cross-platform framework for creating audio applications that is used by hundreds of companies in the audio industry.

After five years of writing high-performance code in Fortran, C, and C++ for numerical simulations of the cosmic structure formation, Timur became committed to audio and music production software. Before joining ROLI, he worked on various projects at market-leading company Native Instruments, such as KONTAKT, the industry standard sampling platform used by the majority of music producers and composers for film score, games, and contemporary popular music.

Timur holds a PhD in astrophysics and is passionate about well-written code, modern C++ techniques, science-fiction, learning languages, and progressive rock music.
