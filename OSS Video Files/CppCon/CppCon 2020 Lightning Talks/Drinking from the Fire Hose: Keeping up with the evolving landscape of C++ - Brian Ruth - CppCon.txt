For years, there was silence, then, in 2011, it all changed. Now, C++ is being continually updated and best practices keep evolving. How does a working engineer keep up with all of this? I'll share some tips I've used over the past decade to convince people I know what I'm talking about.

Brian has been programming in C++ for 20+ years; working for both small and large companies on a wide variety of projects and technologies. For over a decade he worked with neuroscience researchers and created high speed acquisition, analysis and visualization software. He is currently a senior software engineer at Garmin, developing embedded devices and migrating legacy modules to C++. When he isnâ€™t knee deep in code, he is enjoying a home brewed beer or building some furniture. He has been a volunteer at CppCon since 2015.

okay

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,639
all right well my name is brian ruth i'm

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,000
a software engineer at garmin and i'm

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,120
going to be talking about drinking from

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,119
the fire hose keeping up with the

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:22,400
ever-evolving landscape of c-plus plus

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,400
so uh

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,599
things have changed in technology since

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,920
i started as a professional programmer

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,760
about a decade and a half ago

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,359
drastically not only has it become part

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,399
of everyone's daily lives

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,040
even more so now but uh the languages

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,120
and

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,640
technologies and tools that we use to

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,840
develop this technology has changed

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,320
drastically as well

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,840
and c plus plus is no exception so when

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,120
i started out z plus

00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,879
98 was state of the art and almost

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:54,160
760 pages in that standard and uh

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,000
as you saw oh three okay 11 14

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,079
17 and now the latest standard of 20 is

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,760
almost 1800 pages

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,760
so as somebody who is just a programmer

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,600
who works on projects for a company not

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,320
necessarily a maintainer or

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,840
standards committee member how do you go

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,479
about keeping up with this how do you

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,479
know

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,080
what the current best practices are what

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,439
you're you need to use in your project

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,560
what should you stop using in your

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,960
project

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,320
well i'm going to share a few tips to to

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,840
kind of help me

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,000
get through this but by far this is not

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,320
the most exhaustive list

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,080
so first of all is you got to come to

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,759
terms with

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,200
you don't have to know everything as a

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,400
senior engineer part of my job is

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,400
teaching people

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,159
about c plus plus how to use the code

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,880
how to do things the best way to do

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,400
things

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,560
and from time to time you start getting

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,439
this impostor syndrome of oh man

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,720
i i didn't know that i i don't i don't

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,640
know about those things

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,920
and nothing is more humbling than

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,000
sitting in a room or

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,079
nowadays virtual room with a whole bunch

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,159
of junior engineers trying to teach them

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,320
how to do something spend 15 20 minutes

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,600
describing the whats and whys and hows

00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,360
only at the end to have one of them

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,479
raise their hand and say why didn't you

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,240
try doing this other thing

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,399
it's so much easier and have them be

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,360
right if you just kind of internalize

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,719
that you're

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,879
you don't have to know everything it's

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,120
okay to ask questions and to not know

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,160
you'll open yourself up to to learn from

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,599
many different people

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,480
places but one of the problems with any

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,360
industry or

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,640
hobby or technology is things have names

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,000
and those names exist

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,879
to express very complicated uh

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
idioms or terms or ideas in a very short

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,480
concise manner

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,840
so in order to look things up and you

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,640
need to know what they're called and c

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,160
plus plus

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,200
has its share of weird names rai

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,840
crtp uh rvo

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,360
and safinae to name a few but you don't

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,920
necessarily need to know

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,120
this you know the details or the the

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,200
underlying definition

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,720
in its entirety of all of these things

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,519
simply just knowing the name of

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,200
something

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,720
is going to be enough take sofine for

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,840
example you don't need to know what it

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,800
stands for

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,680
or exactly how it implements everything

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,040
but

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,440
being able to know that it has something

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,319
to do with templates if the compiler

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,599
sees an error definition i mean that

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,760
should be enough to

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,200
into google stack overflow or be able to

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,480
ask questions and be able to get

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,480
out what that stuff actually means

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,879
but with everything coming in how do you

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,800
know what name you need to know

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,519
so for this you got to find a reliable

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,519
filter for every little esoteric corner

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,239
of every technology or every single

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,879
hobby

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,239
there is somebody who is shouldered in

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,680
that little thing and

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,000
they would just itching to tell you

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,200
about it so take advantage of their

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,159
enthusiasm

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,640
so things like podcasts conferences like

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,920
this

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,840
like take a look what the people at the

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,280
conferences are talking about

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,560
that's give you a pretty good idea of

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,280
what other people think are the most

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,200
important things coming to the language

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,799
and don't feel that you need to keep up

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,319
with this like if you

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,159
poke into slack you know once every

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,560
couple of weeks read about 20 messages

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,799
and pop

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,640
out that's good you don't have to to be

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,480
there every day monitoring every single

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,400
dm or message

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,319
meetups books blogs mailings there's

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,640
just an infinite way to go about finding

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:10,159
a reliable filter

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,519
and just reading about these things and

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,120
watching the videos

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,439
that's that's one way for you to be

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,239
informed but until you really like

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,040
teach other people switch the flip the

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,400
script and

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,720
start trying to describe what you know

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,560
how you know it to someone else whether

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,759
it's in a conference like this

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,120
a local meetup group trainings at work

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,720
that's when you really kind of have to

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,600
start articulating what you know and how

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,600
you know it

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,120
and you know if you're not up for

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,360
talking to someone in public

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,720
try writing it down for yourself i mean

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,840
odds are you're probably going to forget

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,120
about what you're learning right now

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,199
eventually anyway

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,479
so if you try and externalize that

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,840
information

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,440
not only will you understand it better

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,360
now but you'll be able to help yourself

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,160
out in the future

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,440
so summarize except not knowing know the

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,280
true names of things

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,280
apply some filters and teach

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,840
thanks

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,280
