okay guys so um this

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,920
is uh how to light for a live stream or

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,920
video

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,080
in five minutes so the first thing i'd

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,240
like to

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,439
the first rule i'd like to present is

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,039
lighting your subject

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:27,359
rather than the space or the camera or

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,960
any of the other elements around you so

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,720
you want indirect light

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,559
so the light source shouldn't be seen by

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,360
the camera if possible because that will

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:34,880
affect the

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,559
quality of the footage that you get out

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,399
of it particularly if your camera

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,480
appears on automatic or something like

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,480
that it will try to compensate and

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,160
any light sources it can see will

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,280
generally darken the image make you

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,760
harder to see

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,079
so i've got this set the circle where i

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,840
think here brings me in here

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,760
so this is uh standard three-point

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,160
lighting and this is something we

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,920
know in film and video and this is the

00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,039
way we set up for most interviews and

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,520
that type of thing

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,359
so the thing you want to know first is

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,879
number one the key light that's the most

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,519
important light i've got a key light

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,360
right here

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,840
it's casting onto my face i'll just

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,439
bring myself back into the view here

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,280
like this and you can see that it's

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,520
casting onto the majority of my face

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,840
this is my main source of illumination

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,840
and it's just off to the one side so i

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,799
bring this diagram back in again

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,600
that's not how we do that do this and

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,600
see how i've grown

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,439
screaming it's like that no

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,560
i've broken it there we go there we go i

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,479
don't know how to use the system that i

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,240
don't want to use so the second light

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,479
you might want is a fill light

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,720
the fill light is used to fill the other

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,880
side so this fills out what the main

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,960
key light is unable to reach and that we

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,000
normally have just to the left

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,040
so my keys to the right and then my fill

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,399
is to the left

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,360
and then finally if you want to get

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,640
really fancy you can then bring it back

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,479
so like this

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,399
and the backlight gives you the kind of

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,280
edge that helps separate you from your

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,360
background

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,280
and so those are the three fundamental

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,799
lights that we we tend to use when

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,800
lighting for an interview lighting for

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,800
video lighting for a stream

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,360
as people at home you probably don't

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,280
need to worry about the backlight

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,440
this is this is a nice to have and it's

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,400
just an extra the main two lights you're

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,040
really interested in

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,760
are the key and the film the film is

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,840
secondary

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,440
if you know you get one just get a key

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,520
and and use that

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,280
otherwise use a film and then you'll

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,080
have perfect balance lighting on both

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,000
sides

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,200
now the final thing to know is that it's

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,360
best where you can

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,040
to lock down the camera often when you

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,560
get a webcam something like that

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,720
it will try to do everything on

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,080
automatic settings normally

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,319
if you've got an application that comes

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,319
with it drivers etc you can find

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,760
the settings within that and you can

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,239
lock down the

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,560
exposure and those type of things frame

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,400
rate etc you can settle the resolution

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,239
and all the settings there and it's much

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,159
better to knock everything down

00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,519
control the environment like that

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,000
environment that then you know

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,159
is locked down and isn't going to change

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,440
and that way you can be sure that then

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,280
everything you set up and everything

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,720
that you present is all going to be the

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,319
same and you're not going to get

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,720
any fluctuations during the actual

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:16,400
footage um and then finally

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,159
um diffusion and using other likes so

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,560
you don't have to have a fancy light

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,760
these lights here i'll show you

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,720
are turned off so they're blind the

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,280
camera

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,879
these are small little kind of

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,920
rectangular shapes they're no bigger

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,560
than a credit card

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,239
these cost about fifty dollars each they

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,239
have lithium battery inside you can

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:40,319
power them off with a usb

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,159
they come with these uh little little uh

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,920
diffusion plates that go on them so you

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,959
can make it nice and bright if you want

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,959
to

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,200
and then you can put the uh diffusion

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,200
plate on the front which softens it

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,640
and these are fantastic you can scatter

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,319
them around as you need them

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,159
they say they're battery powered you can

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,000
throw them in a bag take them with you

00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,000
fantastic for just liking just about

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,760
anything and really inexpensive these

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,120
days if you don't want to go out and buy

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,319
something you can use

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,159
angle poised lamp uh desk lamp led

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,439
lamp anything like that um if you want

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,840
to knock down the brightness a little

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,640
bit

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,280
use a bit of tracing paper or some

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,040
kitchen

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,199
uh greaseproof paper something like that

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,720
just to knock that

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,720
harshness down with the actual light

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,040
itself and um

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,320
just a couple of things not to do and

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,320
unless it goes out to brett

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,000
don't don't fire floodlights into your

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,040
camera that doesn't work

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,040
that's not very helpful

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,120
don't turn all the lights off that also

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,440
doesn't help that's pretty

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,040
how are you supposed to see anything so

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,240
what you really want is the balance in

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,919
between

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,080
the best light you can try not to like

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,520
the space too much if you can keep your

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,560
background nice and dark that helps

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,280
separate you

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,160
and just go for an overall nice balanced

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,479
controlled

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,240
amount of light and control is the key

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,720
there you can use an outdoor

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,440
light source something incandescent but

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,199
if the light

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,560
changes because clouds because of the

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,320
weather that type of thing

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,400
you'll get fluctuations in your end

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,919
result and it may get dingy

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:25,840
it may get over bright etc so that's

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:25,840
three-point lighting in five minutes

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,800
