	00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,160
so

00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,280
hello everyone i'm tumal lurcer i work

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,160
for dallas at

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,640
in paris france and i will be talking uh

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,480
to you

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,840
today about how many languages a

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,119
simplest place expert

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,039
should speak so the first question

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,960
we must ask yourself is why learning

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,599
other languages than simplest place

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,160
well everyone has in his house on

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,280
opinion

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,239
about this but i'll bring you two points

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,480
the first one of it is if all you have

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,559
is a hammer everything looks like an a

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,120
if you only know surplus plus you can

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,320
only think in terms of simplest person

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,320
that's a bad thing in my opinion

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,920
and second point those who cannot

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,280
remember the past are condemned to

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,480
repeat it

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,719
indeed if you want to refactor code from

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,160
and into simple space you need to know

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,359
other things

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,559
so the question should i learn

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,320
other languages of course you do

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,680
that's not the right question the real

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,799
question is how many

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,600
other languages should you learn and to

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,280
answer that

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:18,960
i made a little chart in uh four point

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:22,159
in which we will uh iterate

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,200
and categorize its languages you know

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,000
and uh it will help us to describe

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,640
how to learn more of it though the first

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,600
level is

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,400
expert level so that's why we're here we

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,680
are

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,759
almost all simple space expert but

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,280
expertise is very time consuming and

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,320
it's okay if you're not

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,560
an expert in everything so i bring the

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,759
second level is practical there are

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,280
languages you tried

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,799
in your life and loved and you practice

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,240
regularly i have

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:56,399
several examples myself i practice piton

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,479
by c and other things third level is

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,719
languages you practice in your life but

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,719
you don't really like and

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,000
you don't practice every day for for

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,640
other reason

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,319
for instance i practice a lot chiara in

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,640
my scholarship but i

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,440
don't really like this but i could come

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,080
back to it

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,760
because i know how to document myself

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,560
and the final

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,360
category is the hello world level when

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,520
you

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,440
just do a hello world put it on your cv

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,120
and that's all that's not really knowing

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,239
a language

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,280
so the useful part the useful zone

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:34,319
is the third first

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,959
three levels which will be useful in

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,840
your life

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,640
as a simple space expert and the

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,519
question we will

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,599
ask is how to promote languages from one

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,319
level to another

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,160
so becoming an expert is very time

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,959
consuming and it's not worth it

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:54,560
to become an expert in other language

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,560
for the sake of civil space

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,720
you can't force yourself to practice

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:06,159
a language you don't like every day just

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,000
because you want to become better at it

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,599
it you you won't manage if you do

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,680
something you don't like

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,040
however what one thing you can do is

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,680
document yourself about

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,800
everything you can choose to be curious

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,720
and

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,000
practice a little even if you don't like

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,760
that's not

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,680
that's not bad you you will know you

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,239
will know how to how it um

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:30,000
how it works and i think it's the most

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,000
efficient way to be polybalant

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,159
so as a conclusion to answer the initial

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,879
question how many languages

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,680
should the simplest plus experts speak i

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,799
mean

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,440
as much as their curiosity can bring

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,879
them

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,200
you in my opinion curiosity is the most

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,000
important trait of an expert and as long

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,439
as you are

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,200
curious you will always go forward be it

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:59,280
in c plus plus or

00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,599
any other language so

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,560
that's what drives me to be here today

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,080
at the cppcon

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,599
and i hope you are

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:15,840
all curious about it too

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,840
and that will conclude my let me talk

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,479
