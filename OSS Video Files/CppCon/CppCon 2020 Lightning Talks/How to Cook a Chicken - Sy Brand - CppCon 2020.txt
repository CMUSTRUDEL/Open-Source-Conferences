You may be familiar with the meme of slapping a chicken at 3725.95 MPH in order to cook it. But how fast would we need to slap a microprocessor to run Hello World in C++? Or a Google datacentre to run it for an hour? I will answer these incredibly important questions.

all right

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,080
i am sai brand i'm at tartan lama on

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,759
twitter this is how to cook a chicken

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,359
you might be familiar with this question

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,039
if kinetic energy is converted into

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,480
thermal energy how hard do i have to

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,080
slap a chicken to cook it

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,359
i'm going to use a soy based chicken

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,720
alternative and this talk but will be

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,359
essentially the same thing so on the

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,039
left here

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,800
we have kinetic energy which is mass

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,080
times velocity squared over two

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,439
on the right we have thermal energy

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,520
which is mass times specific heat

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,440
capacity times the change in temperature

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,280
now if the average human hand weighs 0.4

00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,399
kilograms the average human slab is 11

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,680
meters per second

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,320
then the average human slab is going to

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,920
generate 24.2 joules of energy

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,440
if we have one kilogram of chicken

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,520
substitute and its specific heat

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,559
capacity is 2

00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:52,079
720 joules per um degree celsius

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,520
then every slab is going to change the

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,680
temperature by 0.008897 degrees celsius

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,280
now if our chicken substitute starts off

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,719
frozen and we want to raise it to 400

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,000
degrees fahrenheit in order to consider

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,640
it cooked then we're going to have to

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,240
raise it by 205 degrees celsius which we

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,960
can do in 23

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,479
and 42 slabs now this is equivalent if

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,159
we were to slap it once

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:16,960
then we would have to slap at a velocity

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:18,560
of 1665.65 meters per second

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,479
this is kind of cool slaps king seemed

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,119
kind of powerful pretty overpowered

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:26,080
uh imagine we have a cbos plus program

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,920
which prints out hello world

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,920
how fast would we need to slap a

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,200
microsoft surface laptop with an intel

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,799
core i7 7660u cpu running at 2.5

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,240
gigahertz in order to run our hello

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,159
world program well

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,840
intel has this program called power log

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,000
3 which can tell us what the power

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,600
consumption of our program is now this

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,960
tells me that my hello world program

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,159
consumes 0.183289 joules of energy i

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,840
have no idea

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,439
how accurate this is but i'm trying my

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,079
best so

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:57,360
if an average human slab is 24.2 joules

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,840
then we could actually power 132

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,759
executions of our hello world program in

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,560
a single slap which personally

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,840
i think is incredible now since we're

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,439
cpus plus programmers we're always

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,000
thinking about scalability what's more

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,080
scalable

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,160
than google data centers here's a graph

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,520
of the energy consumption of google data

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,280
centers over time

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,560
now say we wanted to produce enough

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,120
energy to power

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,480
all of google's data centers for 2018 in

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,640
a single slap

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,800
how fast would we have to slap one of

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,800
google's power stations well

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:31,200
since the google data centers took 10

00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,160
573 gigawatt hours of energy in 2018

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,280
this is equivalent

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,000
to 38 quadrillion joules now if we plug

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,920
this into this

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,360
um equation we can work out we would

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,519
have to slap one of google's power

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,879
stations at 436

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,440
million meters per second which

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,959
unfortunately is a fair bit faster than

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,400
the speed of light so we might end up

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,760
rupturing space time

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,959
and trying to do this but it might be

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,959
worth it we should also be thinking

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,040
about sustainability you know maybe we

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,840
want to extrapolate these numbers out

00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,519
ten years

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,959
or maybe a hundred years or maybe until

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,800
the end of time like

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,080
this news article says that the sun

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,159
might explode in about

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,840
10 billion years and maybe the the earth

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,440
will be consumed in about five billion

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,840
years so i tried to extrapolate all this

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,760
data out to five billion years and xl

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,599
crashed

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,720
which is not what i wanted but you know

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,000
we're probably not going to last that

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,840
long say we've got another 2

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,360
000 years to be generous to get an exact

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,159
number i looked at my printer which is

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,680
an hp laserjet 4350 and that sounds good

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,319
enough to me so say we've got

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,360
until four three five zero then that

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,840
gives us 2

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,799
30 years of energy which we need to

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,720
produce

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,400
if we use this equation to sum up this

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,480
exponential function we work out we need

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,879
to produce 5.3386 times 10 to the 188

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,799
gigawatt hours of energy

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,879
now if we plug that into this equation

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,959
we can work out the number of people

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,720
who would be required to slap a google

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,680
power station in order to generate this

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,519
much energy which

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,439
is eight point nine one one six three

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,200
times ten to the ninety nine people

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,480
now i'm gonna round this up to ten to

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,000
the hundred because it's almost there

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,400
and what's in order of magnitude between

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,920
friends and it turns out the 10 to 100

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,640
is actually a number which has a special

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,519
name

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,879
so the number of people required to slap

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,640
a google power station

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,120
in order to generate enough energy to

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:29,840
power their um data centers from now

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:29,840
until the end of time is one google

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,320
