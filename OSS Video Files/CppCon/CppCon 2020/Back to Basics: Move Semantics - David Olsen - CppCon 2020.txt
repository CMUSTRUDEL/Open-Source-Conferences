Move semantics was one of the many powerful additions to C++11, solving several classes of programming problems that had vexed C++ developers for years. But move semantics can be easily misused, and the details are sometimes tricky to get right. This back-to-basics session will give you a solid foundation in move semantics, covering rvalue references, std::move, move constructors, and move assignment operators. More importantly, it will present a set of clear guidelines for when and how to use these tools, and describe some situations where move semantics are most useful. This session will be helpful both for those who are still learning how to write solid, robust C++ code, and for those who already know everything about move semantics and would like a refresher. Attendees will leave this session having learned, among other things, how to read code sprinkled with calls to std::move and how to write classes that behave correctly and efficiently when moved.
