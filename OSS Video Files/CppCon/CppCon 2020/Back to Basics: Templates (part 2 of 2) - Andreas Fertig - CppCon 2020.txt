Advanced Templates
This is the second part of Templates where go more into depth. Attendees expected to know the syntax an properties of function and class templates, type_traits and constexpr if.

In this session, we look at variadic templates together with fold expressions by using a Printf like function as an example. This knowledge is then used to talk about template specializations.

At this point we will briefly talk about SFINAE. We compare it to the tag-dispatching pattern and see how C++20s Concepts make SFINAE way less scary. Next on the plate are variable templates as well as template template parameters.

This session is for developers with C++ experience who have avoided templates so far. After attending this talk, attendees have learned techniques like SFINAE and template specializations.
