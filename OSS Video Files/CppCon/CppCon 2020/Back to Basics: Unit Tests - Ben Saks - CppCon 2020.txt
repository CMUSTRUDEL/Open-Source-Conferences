Automated unit tests can accelerate software development by quickly identifying regressions, clarifying interface requirements, and encouraging more modular designs. However, actually incorporating unit tests into your development process can be intimidating. Choosing a unit testing framework can be a daunting task because there are so many frameworks with such wide-ranging capabilities. Moreover, even when using a really good framework, crafting effective tests is a skill that takes time to master.

This session takes you through the process of writing automated unit tests for realistic code, working from very simple tests up to more complex ones. It starts with a brief introduction to automated testing and test-driven development. It shows you the first steps toward using automated unit tests in your development process.

In this session, you’ll learn the practical benefits of a unit testing framework through examples using Google Test. You’ll see how you can simplify difficult tests using dependency injection and Google Mock in addition to Google Test. Along the way, you’ll learn about different testing strategies, as well as concepts such as test coverage and ordering dependencies. Whether you’re new to automated testing or looking for a way to test challenging components, this session will help you take the next step toward more reliable, test-driven software.
