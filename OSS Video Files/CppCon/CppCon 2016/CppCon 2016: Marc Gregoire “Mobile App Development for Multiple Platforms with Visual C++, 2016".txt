Visual C++ supports mobile app development for Windows, Android, and iOS from a single code base, optionally with a thin platform-specific UI layer. The resulting binaries can be deployed to an emulator or to a real device and debugged on both, all from within Visual C++ . This presentation is a follow up to my session given at CppCon 2015, and as such the session will only briefly cover the basics of cross-platform mobile app development. Please view https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y47g8xNE1o or https://channel9.msdn.com/events/CPP/CppCon-2015/CPPConD02V019 for this material in depth. In this follow up, we go over the new features added for cross-platform development since last year. Additionally, we continue where last year’s session ended, and will go deeper on how to write your applications to have a native look-and-feel UI on each of the different platforms.
