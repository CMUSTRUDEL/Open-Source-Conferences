Lead Software Engineer, Blizzard Entertainment
I've been programming professionally at Blizzard for over 16 years and am currently a Lead Software Engineer for Heroes of the Storm. While my day-to-day focus is on providing the best gameplay experience for our players, in my spare time I enjoy tinkering with the latest C++ features to discover better ways to implement whatever our designers dream up next.
