In this session, we’ll cover what’s new in the last year in the Visual Studio updates and our cross platform editor and debugger, VS Code. We’ll talk about and demo the features that are coming in the next version of Visual Studio and VS Code. This will include our ongoing roadmap for compiler and library conformance, major (and massive) improvements in performance and code quality and how to get the most out of it. We'll also cover cross platform development including Linux, Mac, iOS, and Android, and demo all the latest productivity features for C++ developers.
