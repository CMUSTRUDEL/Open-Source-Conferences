Want to meet your standard library maintainer? Now's your chance! Join us for a panel discussion of the C++ standard library with the people who implement it! C++ standard library maintainers and members of the C++ Committee's Library Working Group will talk about the philosophy behind the specification and implementation of the C++ standard library. We'll talk about all the new library features coming in C++17 (and beyond).
