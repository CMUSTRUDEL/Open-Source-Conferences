This panel of representative members of the C++ standards committee is ready to discuss everything from the just-completed C++20, to how the committee is working online as we start the C++23 cycle, and what to look forward to in Standard C++ in the coming years.

Besides C++’s creator, the panelists include the current leaders of key subgroups. These leaders are responsible for language and library evolution, and topics like compile-time programming, real-time/embedded systems, AI, and teaching as the community starts to absorb all the new features in C++20.

The panel also includes representation of fresh forward-looking thinking with the heads of some of the newest national bodies to join in and participate in ISO C++.
