	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,010
how about that weather isn't it okay

00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:12,059
that's the first joke so since dad up in

00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:16,410
and I see this watch works so duck

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:18,690
typing I love duck typing this is where

00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,820
you have a problem so you explain it to

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:25,970
a rubber duck and the dark solves a

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:28,260
problem and types it up for you okay I

00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:31,109
was looking into functional data

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:34,370
structures looking at the list and out

00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:36,570
of me I couldn't make head or tail of it

00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:39,469
all right maybe that's a bit too

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:43,969
highbrow let's sir bring it down a notch

00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:48,809
java it's a great tool for toning coffee

00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:53,100
into stack dumped any java programmers

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:55,500
here okay good you're going to help me

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,320
with this next one so knock knock joke

00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:06,600
so when i say knock knock you guys to

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:08,250
say who's ur so knock knock java all

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,420
right let's leave the java programmers

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,040
alone

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,380
making have an infinite number of

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,040
monkeys he put them in front of a

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:19,890
computer keyboard now eventually one of

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:24,420
them is going to write a complete

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:28,850
working java program the rest will be

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:31,380
writing pearl all right back to C++

00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:34,530
here's some C++ it's a random number

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:37,200
generator now I've actually seen code

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,990
like this in the wild it's not funny and

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,140
actually to be honest programa jokes on

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,640
that funny really fortunately that's not

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,649
the type of stand-up that I wanted to

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,119
talk about there's another type of

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:53,369
stand-up that we often face in our jobs

00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:55,110
that's the daily stand-up meeting who

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:58,380
does or has done a daily stand-up

00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:00,479
meeting quite a few people so real

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,340
familiar with them the idea is you know

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,130
we do these meetings regularly maybe

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,890
daily and we want to keep them short

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:11,250
maybe less than 15 minutes that's why we

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,200
stand up so we feel uncomfortable we

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,519
want to keep it short so who's going to

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:20,100
stand up meeting that's more than 20

00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:23,549
minutes half an hour an hour yesterday

00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:28,140
few hands who's done a daily stand-up

00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:31,709
meeting where everyone sits down quite a

00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:34,049
few yeah all right all right but this

00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:36,420
one who's been on a project where

00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:39,380
someone a high art felt that by doing

00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:42,959
daily stand-ups it made you more agile

00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:44,340
yeah yeah quite a few what it's good to

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,660
rent about these things but that's not

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:50,850
the type of stand-up I wanted to talk

00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:55,380
about either so actually oh it's not

00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:58,280
going to work is it here we go a little

00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:00,480
bit of science familiar with this mean

00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,910
stand back i'm going to try some science

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:07,170
what I'm going to modify that a bit and

00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:08,940
say it works stand up I want to try some

00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:15,859
science so I want to take this literally

00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:15,859
everyone stand up and yes that means you

00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:23,300
okay now this is interesting just in the

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,640
process of moving from a sitting to a

00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,830
standing position you've increased the

00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:31,010
flow of oxygen to your brain by about

00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:33,880
twenty percent and as make you slightly

00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:36,470
smarter than you were at this moment ago

00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:39,550
so it's a real shame that we spend so

00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:41,630
much of our working lives sitting down

00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,580
it's actually worse than that we'll get

00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:46,280
to that in a moment but just how much

00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:50,930
time do we so in sitting well you tell

00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:55,040
me ah doesn't help her forget tweets

00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:57,860
coming through okay so if you feel that

00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,590
you spend on average working day less

00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:04,850
than three hours sitting you can sit

00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:08,209
down now yeah just this one or two all

00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:10,190
right next group if you feel you spend

00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:13,360
less than six hours a day on an average

00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:15,620
working day sitting you can sit down now

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:20,630
few more but most people are still

00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:22,760
standing so you six plusses I'm going to

00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:29,540
let you sit down as well now but pay

00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:31,010
close attention to the next part so you

00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,450
may remember this infographic it was

00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:36,350
going around on the internet few years

00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:39,260
ago sitting is killing you it's quite

00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:41,690
long lots of shocking statistics and

00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,280
facts in there and right at the end this

00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,200
handy list of references to back it all

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,360
up I fortunate because it's an

00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,419
infographic you can't click on them and

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:56,419
actually quite hard to read so I did the

00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:58,880
job we're transcribing them all so you

00:04:56,419 --> 00:05:01,400
can read them and I even went as far as

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,130
clicking on them and reading all of the

00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,690
links and also following the references

00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,240
from those and in some cases the

00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:09,350
references of the references and

00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,500
cross-referencing them all so I made

00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:14,690
sure that this actually backed up all

00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,970
the facts on infographic and mostly it

00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:18,860
did few bits you can read things into it

00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:24,030
I just want to pick out one of the

00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:28,780
statistics that was in there so

00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:31,510
according to this if you sit for six or

00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:34,960
more hours a day which remember was most

00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:37,230
of you you're actually forty percent

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,640
more likely to die in the next 15 years

00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:42,220
but knows who said sm-3 which is the

00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:45,430
first group that's actually quite a

00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:46,930
sobering statistic so we were joking

00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:49,660
around earlier but now with mineral

00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:54,600
getting serious and here's the real

00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:57,510
kicker that's true even if you exercise

00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,040
so if you thought the going to the gym

00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:02,530
three times a week was going to get you

00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,420
out of this really doesn't those

00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,740
references i mentioned earlier a lot of

00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:09,370
them actually led back to a body of work

00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:10,840
by this guy James Levine so dedicated a

00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:13,570
large chunk of his life to this written

00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,880
a few books on it one of these books he

00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:18,880
says this quoting from a doctor actually

00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:21,430
going to the gym even several times a

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,980
week does not reverse the harmful

00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:26,740
effects of sitting to be clear it does

00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:30,610
help but it doesn't completely overcome

00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:33,490
a sedentary lifestyle so what's the

00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:37,600
solution there's actually quite a neat

00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:42,460
solution where neat is an acronym which

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:45,520
stands for no next five non-exercise

00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:47,910
activity thermogenesis that's just a

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,680
fancy way of saying everyday activities

00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:52,840
so the thermogenesis part is just the

00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,000
way we refer to the energy expenditure

00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:58,260
of your your body it's a measure of heat

00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,520
and we have a union for that the calorie

00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:02,470
which scientifically is defined as the

00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:06,100
energy needed to increase one gram of

00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:09,760
water by one Celsius to be clear that

00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:12,550
what we call the the small calorie will

00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:14,440
be using in science if you read

00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:17,110
nutrition labels or talk about exercise

00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,460
we talk about kilocalories we talk about

00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,840
them soft and we just call them calories

00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,520
as well it can be a bit confusing at

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,660
first but it's a thousand times

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,880
different so you shouldn't get them

00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:28,980
mixed up but bear that in mind you know

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,650
rigas interesting

00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:33,830
is a certain number of calories our

00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:36,240
bodies burn just keeping you alive

00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:38,790
keeping the organs running your heart

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,110
pumping lung is breathing brain ticking

00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:44,400
over and this is called the basal

00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:45,900
metabolic rate just a baseline varies

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,450
from person to person depending on you

00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:51,320
build and age and so on for me works out

00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:53,100
about eighteen fifty kilo calories a day

00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,530
for most people it's going to be

00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,510
somewhere around that sort of figure the

00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:59,760
exact numbers don't matter but there's

00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:01,380
is this rate of course we spend most of

00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:05,700
our time so we're not most of our time a

00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:08,220
fair chunk of our time sleeping so

00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:11,160
that's the basal metabolic rate that's

00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:14,880
fine on an average working day we'll get

00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:16,320
up in the morning hopefully get ready in

00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,780
the door low bits and pieces before we

00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,460
shoot out the door so we're burning

00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,830
about you know another 20 to 30 calories

00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:26,070
there not much more than the basal

00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:29,610
metabolic rate and then for a lot of us

00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:31,950
will have a commute into the office what

00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:34,530
would be sitting about half an hour to

00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:37,110
an hour a bit of activity while we go

00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:41,070
into the office and then the rest of the

00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:43,620
day or a large chunk of it as you set

00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:46,770
yourselves it's been most of that time

00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:49,910
sitting barely above the basal metabolic

00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:52,650
rate most of that time few little spikes

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:55,350
and even if we go out for lunch a lot of

00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:56,910
us have lunch at our desks we go out and

00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,860
maybe risk out to nearby restaurant and

00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:01,560
sit down again that's sitting all this

00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:05,190
time and commuting back of course but we

00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,990
tell ourselves it's okay because in the

00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:11,780
evening or lunchtime or whenever being a

00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:11,780
fit it in I'm going to go to the gym

00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:16,020
probably just learn that doesn't

00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:18,660
actually reverse the effects so I've

00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:21,090
jumped on a slide there so the solution

00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,590
now we know what the problem is because

00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:24,480
it's not the total calories we're

00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:26,460
talking about here it's breaking up

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,910
these periods of sitting you guys need

00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:32,160
to insert more breaks ideally at least

00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:35,250
every hour we should spend at least two

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,130
to five minutes doing something other

00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:39,500
than sitting roughly be walking around

00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:42,290
doesn't have to be a brisk walking

00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,670
you don't have to stop working you can

00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:46,070
be talking on the phone talking to a

00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:47,840
colleague just go down the hall to speak

00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:49,180
to someone instead of emailing them all

00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,200
these little tricks that we hear about

00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:53,960
but we just want to break up those

00:09:51,200 --> 00:10:00,620
periods long periods of sitting because

00:09:53,960 --> 00:10:02,390
that's what's doing the damage the other

00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,550
thing we can do we have the opportunity

00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:07,250
to get one of those standing sitting

00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:09,200
desks I've got one we'd only be standing

00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:11,020
all the time either but if you alternate

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,520
periods of standing and sitting

00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:16,160
interspersed with these breaks then

00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,600
we'll really go be a long way towards

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,660
overcoming this this problem with our

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:24,470
sedentary lifestyles if you want to

00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:28,270
really take it up a notch so XKCD has

00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:28,270
you back given moment to read that

00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:40,339
now this is why I know so much about

00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:42,740
this this was me a couple years ago this

00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:45,200
has me just last December I'm a bit more

00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:50,180
like that now just put that into figures

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:52,910
i was 130 three kilograms in down to 80

00:10:50,180 --> 00:11:01,300
2.9 that's the loss of 52 kilograms or

00:10:52,910 --> 00:11:01,300
key prefer 114 pounds 8.1 stone okay

00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:07,820
that wasn't just through the neat

00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:11,450
activity stuff there's a whole thing a

00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:14,209
nutritional change and so on and if you

00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:17,779
want to find out more about that and a

00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:19,970
lot more about fitness nutrition in the

00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:21,890
context of programmers I've done a

00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:24,130
couple of longer talks on that you go to

00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:27,829
my website level of indirection calm

00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:29,600
there's a this tab here appearances see

00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:32,740
my previous talks in as a couple of

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:40,190
videos talk is mens sana in corpore sano

00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:44,660
so recommend going to see that now for a

00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:46,279
wrap-up couple of things be great if you

00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:48,640
could support me doing the the london

00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:50,899
three peaks challenge next month by

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,390
donating something to my justgiving

00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:55,130
campaign in support of cancer research

00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:57,320
i'm going to be running up free of the

00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:59,180
tallest towers in london and running

00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,730
between them and then abseiling down the

00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:04,370
last one so that'll be great and then

00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:07,459
one more thing from that james levine

00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:09,500
book that i took away it talks about the

00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:11,060
muscles particularly the legs and

00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,339
apparently the muscles the outer layers

00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,680
for the fascia an interesting thing

00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:18,620
about the fascia is that it modes itself

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,800
to the position it finds itself in most

00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:22,730
of the time so if you're mostly sitting

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,810
mold itself into a sitting position

00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:29,209
you're mostly standing mostly a standing

00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:30,529
position which means you're more

00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:32,180
comfortable sitting if you're sitting

00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:34,220
most of the time and the reverse is true

00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,360
if you're standing and walking most of

00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,610
the time you're more comfortable doing

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,250
that and it's changed from one to the

00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,810
other and it takes a week or two so the

00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,470
more you standing and walking the more

00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:46,480
comfortable that becomes for

00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:49,890
so now we have scientific proof that

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:53,340
daily stand-ups do make you more agile

00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:53,340
thanks for being a star

00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,280
