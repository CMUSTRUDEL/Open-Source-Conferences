hey I'm Timur and the first time I got

00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:07,950
into programming was about ten years ago

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:09,900
I was doing astrophysics at the time and

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,450
we're doing numerical simulations of the

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,630
cosmological structure formation they

00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,230
look like this doesn't work they look

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,369
like this

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:22,080
yeah no hang on yeah so this is rendered

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:23,220
from such a computer simulation they

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,230
were running on like massively parallel

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,820
computer clusters and we were using

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,779
these things to study how galaxies

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:37,559
evolve yeah pretty cool huh let me show

00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:39,390
you the code hmm so that's like actual

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,760
actual production code anyone knows what

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,500
programming language that is that's

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:49,219
Fortran now let me scroll down a little

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:51,570
bit yeah um it's go down a bit further

00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:53,309
just keeps going it's like the same file

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:58,289
it's like I don't know tens of thousands

00:00:53,309 --> 00:01:01,410
of lines of code yeah it's the same

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,430
stuff so um this was my first

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,460
programming language this is how I

00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,979
learned how to code and then after a few

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,409
years of this I was like this can't be

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,659
it is this it is this how is this what

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,580
programming is no that can't be it that

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:18,840
must be a better way right and I kept I

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:22,080
started searching and I found this and I

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,640
said yeah this is much better yeah and I

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,610
went to my supervisor at the time let's

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,450
say hey that new project you know that

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,340
we're going to do I'm going to write

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:32,040
this in C++ that's going to be much

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,799
better right and he was like are you

00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,310
crazy no one's going to be able to read

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,310
your code

00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:43,910
well I went ahead and did it anyway um

00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:45,770
and then that was so much fun that I

00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:47,510
decided hey let's not do the science

00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:50,000
stuff let's just become a C++ programmer

00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:51,710
yeah and then I applied for a job at a

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,380
company called Native Instruments by

00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:56,420
doing music software and I applied for a

00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,310
job there in order to get it I need to

00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,750
pass a I needed to pass a coding test

00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,280
yeah the coding test looked something

00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:04,190
like that

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,750
I got a string and I had to replace you

00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:08,509
know one sub string with another sub

00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:16,490
string and I was like yeah I can do this

00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:18,470
with C++ huh Stack Overflow yeah yeah

00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:20,930
STL right you have to need to know this

00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:25,190
STL well if you need performance here's

00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:28,730
an optimized function uh yeah you can do

00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:29,930
it with the char pointer as well you

00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:33,740
know in super sauce eleven you can do

00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:37,130
with reg X right this is cool oh hang on

00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:40,940
he's a template highest version of it so

00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:43,880
um yeah and then I found this thing

00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:48,320
called AB juice which is a CSS framework

00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:50,450
and hey you can write it like this and

00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,580
that's the code s admitted and they were

00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:58,790
like hey this guy knows juice cool and I

00:02:52,580 --> 00:03:00,920
got the job yeah so um fast forward a

00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:03,830
few years I moved on and I now actually

00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,720
work on juice and since then I learned a

00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:08,180
lot and I want to part up point out like

00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:11,480
a particular book I read which is this

00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:13,670
one anyone here read this book really

00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:17,030
recommended I can be sir I can summarize

00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:19,250
the whole book in one slide the only

00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:24,500
valid measurement of code quality is WTS

00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:26,300
per minute and I think I can rephrase

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,220
this I think actually my philosophy is

00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:31,160
code should be as close as possible to

00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:32,900
plain English and this is something that

00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,340
Jews actually is really really good at I

00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,140
mean from what I hear from our users

00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,549
this is like the number one reason why

00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,560
they like juice so much you know you can

00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:41,720
you can write code like that you know it

00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,070
just tells you what's going on it's

00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,500
really easy to read and then you open

00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:48,440
the header and then you know you can

00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,640
just read it but you know as much as I

00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,180
care about juice there's one thing I

00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,170
care about

00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:56,269
more which is C++ itself and you know

00:03:54,170 --> 00:04:01,400
here's a piece a line of bus code from

00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:03,709
my talk on Tuesday and you know in C++

00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,659
17 I can't write this anymore now this

00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:10,340
is wrong I have to write it like that

00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:11,959
and you know this makes me sad because

00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,540
you know here's the problem I know what

00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:16,519
a Mersenne twister is right I know why

00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,880
the why the new version is the better

00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:21,320
one I'm a C++ fan right I'm here I can

00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,330
go to a talk about like template

00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,880
metaprogramming new techniques in C++ 17

00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,949
I'm gonna have a great time but it's not

00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,599
about me it's about the 90% of our users

00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:31,070
you know they don't know this stuff they

00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:32,720
don't care about the stuff they there's

00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,099
slack in C++ because you know they're

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,680
writing all your software you have to

00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:38,509
use C++ for that but but they just want

00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,280
to shuffle their vector because they're

00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:44,150
just implementing their first card game

00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:45,500
you know and and I think we all do

00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,000
people are not the only industry like

00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,139
that and I think you know the great

00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,940
thing about juice is that we allow

00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:52,160
people to you know write simple code but

00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:54,470
I think C+ busses the language really

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,090
should be better at this you know yeah

00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,500
we need the heavy stuff in there for the

00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:59,930
people who need it probably most of the

00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,370
people in this room but we really should

00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,810
also cater for you know all the other

00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,909
people out there who want to write

00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:07,250
simple code and they don't care about

00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:08,840
you know details and I think I think

00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:12,070
this is important so I just wanted to

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,070
share this with you thanks

00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,870
