	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,089
okay good so yeah I been thinking about

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:10,590
programming and I wanted to talk about

00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:13,380
programming and then I did this did a

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,610
presentation about programming and C++

00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,650
know and I thought I share that with you

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,410
because it's actually a fun experience

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,180
so I've been thinking about programming

00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:25,680
and you know the future of programming

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:29,699
is already micro hinted and so you know

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:32,969
during your career at least one of those

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:38,010
and you know you specialize and like C++

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:42,239
and meta programming or you generalize

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:43,980
and to something like C++ I was when I

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,829
was a freelancer I did that like a a

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:50,149
specialist in C++ but I generalize it

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:53,489
and C++ framework so I did I did work on

00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:55,590
other frameworks and if you have like a

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:57,360
normal job then you might be more

00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,340
specialized than doing a certain task

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,129
for your company which for a certain

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,960
product and at a certain point maybe you

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:05,309
mutate and you do you start doing

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,110
something completely different like I

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:08,670
did like you know getting involved in

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,450
community work organizing a conference

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:20,729
and doing all those things and and then

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:23,340
maybe something else happens and this is

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:26,670
actually a quote from a keynote at C++

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:31,049
now which is by those who see nerd life

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:33,479
very famous and this is one of the most

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:36,720
ridiculous things I ever heard at C++

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:39,659
now actually and so but on the other

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,790
hand it always wasn't Beckenham of my

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:45,270
mind I got me thinking today I think

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:49,970
maybe Stanley Lippmann wasn't like

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:52,649
totally wrong because on the other hand

00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:55,380
people who are not programming they they

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:58,500
they hear this safe you drop learn

00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,479
programming okay and that's basically

00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,219
the philosophy of a lot of what other

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,510
people do my brother did that and it was

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:06,970
like really crazy when I visited

00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:10,840
my brother this year I was sitting at my

00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:12,340
PC doing this laptop doing a C+ person

00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,550
he was doing on his laptop Ruby on Rails

00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,840
and this was kind of crazy because

00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,430
actually I started something completely

00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,530
different from that and he's not

00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:23,710
supposed to be a programmer that wasn't

00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,210
like in his career so what do you do if

00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,680
you're a programmer you know we can't

00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,700
become a programmer we cannot learn

00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,710
programming because we're already

00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:32,020
programmers so you know is the answer

00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:33,640
becoming a better programmer or what

00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,800
should we do as programmers what is our

00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,300
career advice as like everybody else

00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,480
like this loan program it's an outlet

00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:44,020
it's trying to learn a programming and

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:46,840
on the other hand learning programming

00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:49,110
is usually popular and we already like

00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:54,130
teacher that kindergarten level and

00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:57,580
elementary school it's so and on the

00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:59,290
other point in ten years we have no idea

00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,240
how you know predicting the future is

00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:05,350
that right oh I've seen you've seen it

00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:07,000
enough sites for that and so I think

00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:10,360
that programming we like to become like

00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,180
speaking like a foreign language like I

00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:16,450
speak English and German and Jennifer is

00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:19,570
it and so and on the other hand we have

00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:21,730
things like machine learning good things

00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,560
and maybe have self-driving cars in the

00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:26,100
future but maybe also said like you know

00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:29,290
our drops will probably become easier or

00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:32,590
become more productive language but also

00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:34,360
as a is cetera and we have no idea of

00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:38,050
the demand keeps up or there's like a

00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:40,180
lot of programmers then and if the

00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:43,600
demand is still there or we may be they

00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:45,070
have like it an overcapacity so again

00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,200
the question you know what what to do if

00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:49,239
you're a programmer what what what

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,970
you're doing and for your career to

00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:56,110
still be a programmer in ten years

00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:58,600
become a better programmer or maybe I I

00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:02,140
think maybe you like thinking outside of

00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:04,780
the box and learn to apply the tools of

00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:07,150
programming and other fears and like we

00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:09,250
really like to understand what makes

00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:13,450
programming what is programming not just

00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:16,090
like using api's so I think that domain

00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:18,280
knowledge plus programming should you

00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:21,990
know open a lot of interesting ways for

00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:25,750
your own future future and maybe feature

00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:28,300
and also yeah maybe you know have an

00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:31,510
exit plan like a plan B that's probably

00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:33,430
a good option to have as we do not

00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:39,660
really know what the future of us you

00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:39,660
