	00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,929
my name is pepper there's a potential

00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,750
for friends I'm Natalia leaving you okay

00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:08,580
so enough said about that small

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,740
disclaimer this is going to be like a

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,330
slightly political talk so what follows

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,340
are just my personal thoughts and

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:19,189
opinions not necessarily one so like my

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:21,480
community or my employer especially yeah

00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:22,980
but again I want to talk a little bit

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,410
about the elephant in the room

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,380
as I noticed yesterday what is the

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,090
elephant to room I work with cute in

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,790
case you don't know cute is a very

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,920
powerful C++ framework for

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,590
cross-platform UI development it's used

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,649
everywhere in all sorts of industries by

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:43,800
many companies just a quick poll how

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:46,350
many of you know about cute yeah holy

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,800
yeah so how many of you actually use

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:52,640
cute I hope I guess upset yeah good like

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,230
we're in the two digits percentage right

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,879
so here's something I noticed about the

00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,399
cute community when it comes to reaching

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,059
out to the sip office community to the

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,809
big one

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:05,339
so exactly last Thursday I think I send

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:07,350
out an email on the cute interest

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:08,880
mailing list I was flying here for

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,250
giving a training about cute I was

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,860
saying hi I'm pecan is there anybody

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,810
around and the response from the cube

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,619
calm for the cute community was actually

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,619
overwhelming

00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:26,950
yeah so exactly one reply uh by Charlie

00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:28,390
I don't know if he's around hi I start

00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,820
working uh why's that

00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:33,520
I mean what's going on right but you use

00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:36,130
cute and you know and get that much

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,510
feedback so I said thinking perhaps it's

00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,250
about you know the contents of this

00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:41,320
conference you know there are that many

00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:43,240
talks and that meant talked about cute

00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,400
actually I should increase that number

00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:49,990
by want it was mentioned right right

00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:52,360
here X yeah light wing but yeah that's a

00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:54,940
bit like that it makes me a little bit

00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,860
sad but that's kind of childish excuse

00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:59,080
right this is a big conference there are

00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:01,480
many kinds of audience we you can expect

00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:06,160
here to talk about each and everybody's

00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:07,660
very tool and yeah so I don't think that

00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,170
should be a sad face usually has a happy

00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:11,280
face

00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:13,960
however also did like an inverse test

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,730
next month in San Francisco do is the

00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,070
big cute conference it's called cute

00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:20,140
world summit so there's plenty to talk

00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:22,150
about cute there and I was curious how

00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:28,709
many talks about cute and like more than

00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:32,020
C++ more techniques are there well yeah

00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:36,040
yeah one over sixty at least at from

00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:38,770
what I can tell from the website so that

00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,540
makes me really really sad and that was

00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:43,239
that thing okay what's going on I mean

00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:46,420
there's these two communities I mean can

00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:50,170
we just be friends or no yeah

00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:52,450
what what happened really well I've made

00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,100
theory but as such it's a theory and I

00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,870
would like to reach out to this big

00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:58,120
community if you have better opinions

00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:00,280
what actually happened why these two

00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,860
things have got split up what a belief

00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:06,940
happened is that cute is somehow guilty

00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:08,590
it isolating itself many years ago cutie

00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,510
as this enormous not invented here

00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,430
syndrome it invented all over again

00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,620
instead of saying to people you know

00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,420
what it's not the case that we may been

00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,100
sharing pointers just used one from

00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,820
boost they're good enough and not use

00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:23,080
one from C++ in heaven the good enough

00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,820
there's has been barely two

00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,620
participation the language library

00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,030
centralization process II don't hear

00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,340
from you know you don't hear the cube

00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,730
story when we hear those boards at least

00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:35,110
I can't find a single contribution

00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:38,560
possibly it's not evolving as fast as

00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:41,560
C++ that's why it's just guilty between

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,600
quotes there's just a finite element

00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,580
bandwidth we can put in there so we

00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,180
can't do as we can't go as fast as we

00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,340
could

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,200
but I know that if I go down these ways

00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,390
of listing things I'm would be probably

00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,010
start pointing fingers and probably

00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,209
arguing with people about that if

00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:58,480
something I learned at this conference

00:03:55,209 --> 00:04:00,610
that if I start arguing yeah I'm losing

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,280
so let's let's not go there let's set

00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:04,690
try to change the mental frame let's try

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,489
to change what happened what is the

00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,680
mental frame what's what's wrong

00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:11,140
really I can't figure it out really I'm

00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,150
trying our Q developers afraid of

00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:16,209
moderns plus plus what's to be afraid of

00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:19,030
right it's the best language ever are

00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:20,829
just C++ developers using cute ashamed

00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:22,990
about using cubes say yeah that's the

00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:24,970
thing we my boss makes me you don't

00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,830
really want to use it or what oh it's

00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,630
just you I a platoon development just

00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:30,639
not that interesting I don't believe so

00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,229
everybody's using a new I on your

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,600
computer I'm pretty sure it some of you

00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:38,080
are actually w i's with cubed and you

00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,220
know i think it is interesting so yeah i

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,710
believe that this is actually hurting

00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:44,380
everybody this is hurting the community

00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:45,880
to developers the community gets cut off

00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,950
from the biggest prosperous community

00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,320
and therefore they doesn't get over here

00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,479
then i give talks and therefore cube

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,430
doesn't get enough visibility in the c++

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,110
community and therefore people think oh

00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,910
look could you sound represented let's

00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,560
logo there thats not sub we talked it

00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:02,020
was the first item unless recursion

00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,970
stack overflow but also this is hurting

00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,650
the c++ community because there are so

00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,720
many ideas that the cute country could

00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:10,330
contribute back so much feedback so many

00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,400
ideas so i think you know we should work

00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,830
together i don't know what's happening

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,419
really cute is striving to be an open

00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,430
inclusive fair and meritocratic

00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:21,880
community how do we connect them back

00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:23,289
well that i don't know so i would say

00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,000
that if you like enough to find someone

00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:27,850
you can tolerate synchronized in don't

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,350
let go yeah and

00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,000
let's get in touch if you have an

00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:33,539
opinion saying idea my name is backpack

00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,539
