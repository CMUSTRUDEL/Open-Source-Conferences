so yes I've had a beard and I feel like

00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:12,000
trolling so I'm going to troll a bit so

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,900
I'm going to tell you why you should not

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,300
use Conan Conan packets manager

00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:21,720
the first reason is because it is not a

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,390
C++ package manager it is a C and C++

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:28,590
package manager is it dares to have C

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:30,210
packages what the hell I'm a simplest

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,520
possible but I want a C++ package

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,940
manager so I've issued a feature request

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,700
to remove open ssl safely and those all

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:43,320
those unnecessary packages for us C++

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:47,510
developers because it is not written in

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:50,820
C++ and I only used to tar it in C++ so

00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:52,469
that's what I don't use gate anymore I

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:58,699
cannot use Linux anymore

00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:58,699
silly on Eclipse beam and many more

00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:04,199
because I don't need it there are

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:08,250
already system packet the system packets

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:11,220
managers I can use like the FK Jim no

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,680
wait whatever I know the or other

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,290
languages like 20 million developers

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,390
using language package managers every

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,240
day in the world but they are not

00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:24,380
programming in C++ they don't know what

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,380
they are doing at all

00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:30,440
finally these crazy people of Conan they

00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:32,750
allow anyone to create their own package

00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:35,360
so if you want to upload a boost packet

00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:38,780
for 140 you can do it tonight

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,270
and nowadays you will look for boost and

00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:44,240
you will have like 20 packages and so

00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:46,520
you will don't know you don't know what

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,290
what you use so you just have yes it the

00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,000
same crazy thing as a stack overflow

00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:52,610
you know it's impossible to know what is

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,710
going to be the right answer so I sued a

00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:58,009
feature request a stack overflow to just

00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:00,470
have one answer and beat it you know

00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:07,040
people should collaboratively edit the

00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:09,890
answer only one and finally because it

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:14,239
is not mainstream it is only like 600

00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:17,930
almost 600 starts in github 60 Forks 23

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:20,750
contributors for being that young is the

00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:23,900
it has more started any other community

00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:26,900
like hunter CPM whatever it is being

00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,820
used in production everyday for by

00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,980
several companies but those crazy

00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:33,320
companies are using get to and Linux and

00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,280
does all these cs6 holes so there they

00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:39,980
don't know what they're doing

00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:42,500
John is no start so actually I've been a

00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:46,220
bad troll because these drawings are not

00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,570
my own these are real trolling you can

00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,640
found them on the internet on our

00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:52,549
feedback everything those are things

00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:56,989
that people are either say everyday

00:02:52,549 --> 00:03:01,580
reasons I just want to say that okay

00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:04,209
trolls there's you know who loves

00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,209
