	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,410
thank you all I am delighted to have

00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,799
what I believe is the honor of what may

00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,880
be the last lightning talk at this venue

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,380
there's a rumor that there will be an

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,269
announcement tomorrow because this

00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:16,680
building is bulging at the seams with

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:19,590
C++ programmers so perhaps this is the

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,420
last lightening talk in Belleview it is

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,910
going to be a talk unlike any other I

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:27,269
have ever given in the last 50 plus

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,740
years of my professional career and it's

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:38,100
going to be difficult for me so please

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:42,480
bear with me it's very personal it's a

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:44,840
thank you talk but let's start at the

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,840
beginning

00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:55,730
we all realize that we don't live and

00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:57,560
work in a vacuum you know parents

00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:01,300
teachers mentor students colleagues

00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:05,180
customers family friends neighbors and

00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:08,690
of course I hope you agree that we owe a

00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:12,860
lot to these people but my observation

00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:16,550
over 50 plus years is that we rarely

00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:21,440
express our appreciation directly and

00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:23,600
explicitly please permit me just a

00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,240
couple of minutes to identify some of my

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,850
own academic influences I think you will

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,830
find some of them interesting and I'd

00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:34,040
like to recall just a brief memory or

00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:36,530
two about each one and when I'm finished

00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:40,790
I ask you please help me say thank you

00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:43,729
not with your applause but with a moment

00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:48,250
of silence and I invite you to recall

00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:48,250
your own mentors during that interval

00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:59,149
miss gravely she was my first grade

00:01:52,910 --> 00:02:01,190
teacher many many years ago she taught

00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:05,300
me that plus signs have to stand up and

00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:14,110
not lean sideways like an X that turned

00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:14,110
out to be useful in C++ mrs. grand ERG

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:24,140
she was my first algebra teacher she

00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:27,950
taught me that algebra was very easy for

00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:30,120
the ancient Romans because X was always

00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:41,310
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:45,540
I also found out a few years later from

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:47,310
one of her colleagues that the Roman

00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,260
Empire fell because they didn't have

00:02:47,310 --> 00:03:03,920
zero and couldn't return successfully

00:02:49,260 --> 00:03:03,920
from their programs mr. wheat egg

00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:12,390
during the day he taught me trigonometry

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:14,280
and after school and on weekends believe

00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:17,849
it or not he gave of his time and taught

00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:23,510
me computer programming in yes for real

00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:26,250
go Tran go tranfer tended to be Fortran

00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:31,769
except the statement like X equals y

00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:37,609
plus Z was too complicated you had to

00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:40,200
break it up into two he also showed me

00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:43,500
that the compile you needed a deck of

00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,209
roughly 1800 punch cards which is the

00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,450
bulk of a case in case you didn't know

00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:49,859
that

00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:52,370
2,000 cards do a case and then after you

00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:54,900
compiled and it punched an object deck

00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:57,180
you loaded it back in followed by

00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,220
another roughly 2,000 cards of live

00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,290
movie today we would call it library

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:05,430
code that had different names back then

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:07,290
and he was the one who inspired enabled

00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:12,690
and challenged me to write programs that

00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:14,310
ran faster than his own and that's when

00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:17,400
I first knew that I might be able to

00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:19,109
make a career of this before then I

00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,329
thought I might want to be a concert

00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:25,560
pianist but I discovered fairly quickly

00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:28,229
that although I had the ear I didn't

00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,970
have the hands but I managed to find a

00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:38,780
different kind of keyboard that I could

00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:38,780
learn to make sing dr. Barrick dr. Barry

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,620
Year dr. Barry

00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:51,650
an extraordinary mathematician of whom

00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:57,350
it was said he could easily publish a

00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:59,690
paper every day and I believe it he was

00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:06,250
a computer yes that's a real word go

00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:11,510
look it up more than once I saw him do

00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:15,380
interpolation in his head of 10 place

00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:22,390
logarithms that he didn't have to look

00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:22,390
up he knew them he knew the log tables

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,340
how many mathematicians do you know who

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,920
hold this country's highest civilian

00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:35,360
award this is the equivalent of the

00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:39,380
Medal of Honor for military personnel he

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:43,940
was my teacher his example was

00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:45,500
astonishing and in addition to calculus

00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:48,800
and a lot of additional mathematics

00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:55,220
beyond that he taught me how to write

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:56,870
and how to think rigorously and I ended

00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:04,030
up taking an undergraduate degree with

00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:06,500
him in mathematics dr. Rosen Bob Rosen

00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:11,090
one of the first people in this country

00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:16,670
to hold a PhD in computer science a true

00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:20,380
pioneer of computer science education he

00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:22,880
taught many generations of programmers a

00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:26,300
difference which is still very poorly

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:29,480
understood today I've discovered between

00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:33,110
the performance of a program and its

00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:35,990
efficiency they're not the same this is

00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:37,610
what he said a program that gives you

00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:42,550
the wrong answer if the speed of light

00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:42,550
is not efficient it's just fast

00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:56,210
dr. George strong my thesis adviser

00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:58,009
under whom I took my doctorate he was a

00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:00,439
mathematician his doctorate is

00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:04,249
mathematics and he became a computer

00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:05,629
scientist became a fellow of the

00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:09,620
American Association for the Advancement

00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:11,659
of science and he taught me that

00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:21,620
mathematics is after all just a very

00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:25,099
small branch of computer science dr.

00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:27,560
Stewart Bob Stewart chairman of my

00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:29,270
department professor of physics

00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:33,520
Electrical Engineering and computer

00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:35,870
science yes really

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,560
he taught me something of computing

00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:42,139
history from a personal perspective he

00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,240
told the story and I asked him to write

00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:47,300
it up and he did and it's in the annals

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:53,330
of computing history about 30-40 years

00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:56,210
ago when he was a new physics graduate

00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:58,039
student he was told to you know you've

00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,629
pointed at a laboratory and told to

00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:03,469
clear out a corner of it that he could

00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:06,550
use for his own office what he didn't

00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:08,379
realize at the time that by doing so he

00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:13,039
disassembled the world's first

00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:16,430
electronic digital computer the ABC the

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:19,449
App Nassif Barre computer platform Airy

00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:22,849
was JV at NASA office graduate student

00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:26,419
we still don't know how clifford berry

00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:30,110
died very mysterious death was never

00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:32,300
solved and incidentally those of you who

00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:35,169
have heard or hope or know of the ENIAC

00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:38,899
which was the first commercial computer

00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:41,120
it had a patent on it that patent was

00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:44,139
invalid ated somewhere around nineteen

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:47,029
seventy two three four I forget exactly

00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:54,220
because of pre-existing technology of

00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:54,220
the ABC here's the man who took it apart

00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,280
there's a there's a small piece of it

00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:02,860
left it's on display in at Nassau Hall

00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:09,490
on the campus of what is now Iowa State

00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:15,340
University JV at NASA John Vincent

00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:20,070
attend at NASA towering intellect yes I

00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:23,440
met him he was the one who built the ABC

00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:29,590
circa 1940 give or take with his

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:31,600
graduate student Clifford berry several

00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:35,710
decades after that when I first met him

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:38,020
he was incredibly kind and patient with

00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:43,680
me when I asked what in hindsight was a

00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:43,680
rather impertinent question why base-2

00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:50,530
and he gave me one hell of an answer in

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,580
case you're curious this is a

00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:56,620
restatement at the time by stable

00:09:54,580 --> 00:10:00,220
devices were more reliable and cheaper

00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:08,560
than try stable devices but ideally we

00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:15,610
would all be using base II he had done

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:19,050
the math and about a decade after that

00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:19,050
he gave me the great honor

00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:37,580
he allowed me to submit his name as a

00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:44,240
candidate and I was allowed to present

00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:51,340
him with an honorary degree for his work

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:55,310
I miss all of you friends and mentors I

00:10:51,340 --> 00:11:00,080
wish I could tell you but I've waited

00:10:55,310 --> 00:11:05,180
too long but an incredible effect you've

00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:11,210
had on my life my work and my ethical

00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:13,580
compass so miss gravely this is Granberg

00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:17,150
mr. wheat act dr. berry dr. Rosen dr.

00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:24,680
Stewart dr. at NASA with my deepest

00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:27,620
gratitude rest in peace a number of

00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:31,480
years ago Fred Rogers yes that Mister

00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:36,410
Rogers was given an honorary degree and

00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:38,180
in his commencement address he said

00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:45,890
let's think about those who have helped

00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:48,830
you become who you are today so let's

00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:52,660
just take a minute in honor of those who

00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:56,140
have cared about us all along the way

00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:56,140
one minute please

00:12:43,980 --> 00:13:04,559
thank you

00:12:46,640 --> 00:13:04,559
