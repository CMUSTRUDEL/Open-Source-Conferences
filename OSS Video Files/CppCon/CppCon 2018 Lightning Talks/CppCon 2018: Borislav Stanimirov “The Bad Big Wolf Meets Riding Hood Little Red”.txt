	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,740
hi so I'm gonna be talking about

00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:07,200
linguistics here so I hope everyone is

00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,599
interested the bad big wolf meets write

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:16,500
a whole little read okay so something

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:31,320
here is obviously on me oh I need more

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:32,910
time ten minutes I just moved and by

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,620
that I mean that writing who little

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:39,750
right of course sounds bit wrong doesn't

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:41,460
it now it's okay sure yeah Little Red

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,450
Riding Hood you know the phrase it's

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,969
popular so perhaps an unpopular phrase

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:51,809
like elephant purple will sound right

00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:53,340
but no it doesn't sound right so that's

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:57,180
the thing English has people deep

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,530
adjectives and many other languages

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,270
don't like for example the Romance

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,260
languages don't like Spanish French

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:07,500
Italian and also languages like Arabic

00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:08,850
Persian but many languages do like

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,810
English magnetic Bulgarian Russian

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,369
Chinese many others and of course the

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,110
right way to say it in English is Little

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:18,960
Red Riding Hood and purple elephant and

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:21,509
but in other languages would be the

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,790
opposite caperucita roja in Spanish or

00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:28,890
al formulae in French okay you got it

00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:30,930
but sometimes sometimes English allows

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,540
post positive adjectives if you want to

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:36,210
say art this if you want to be arcade or

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,540
quite excited say the the sounds of gold

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,579
cincy or something or if you if in

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,799
certain borrowed phrases from from

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:50,689
Romance languages like heir apparent or

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:53,130
parent Anita okay so but also but also

00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:55,500
there was nothing in the title it was

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:58,530
bad big group so this doesn't sound

00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:01,020
right of course but not as wrong as

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:04,920
writing for little red but certainly not

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:06,840
that right so humans

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,759
the thing is prefer certain order of

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,790
adjectives I do mean humans is not an

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,750
English only thing it's typically true

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,790
for most human languages

00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:20,290
and it comes with a handy acronym of

00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:22,260
exactly and this means general opinion

00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:26,050
specific opinion size shape age color

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:28,770
origin material this order of adjectives

00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:31,240
is typical for most human languages and

00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:33,370
that's why a big brown wooden spoon

00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,560
sounds correct and wouldn't Brown big

00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:38,790
spoon and round big wooden spoon just

00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:42,610
sound like make you sound like maniac

00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:46,140
there are exceptions to suction and

00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:49,780
they're mostly covered by specificity

00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:52,900
like idioms idioms have a combination of

00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:56,530
words which are mean something but well

00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:59,709
that neither of those words means when

00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,880
it's on on its own like last-straw it's

00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:02,350
not a last straw

00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,570
literally and there are idiom like

00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:07,540
phrases like big spender for example

00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:10,300
which although have literal meaning do

00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:14,440
typically come together so that's big

00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:16,690
evil man but an evil big spender and big

00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,610
bad wolf bad big goof if you were paying

00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:22,600
attention you would have seen that this

00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:24,400
doesn't correspond to exactly it it

00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,260
should be bad be good because bad is an

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,140
opinion a big is the size there is

00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,850
nothing called a bloat reduplication

00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:33,880
which means that let's this typical

00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:36,549
English thing though bowels in the order

00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:39,459
of AI a Oh typically sound good to us in

00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:42,940
English that's why I had hip hop and not

00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:46,780
hop hip we have that did for that and

00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:50,500
not that for hit though sometimes you

00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:54,070
have that protein you know happens and

00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:56,350
now I have a small interlude where you

00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:58,829
can prepare your tomatoes because you're

00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:02,370
not gonna like what I'm about to say

00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:04,560
what does this have to do with C++

00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:08,130
you think you can have your in fright is

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:19,139
it it's a type it's a noun you can add

00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:21,870
adjectives with this now like now who

00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:26,840
here is is familiar with the East Coast

00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:26,840
West Coast rivalry in American hip-hop

00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:34,530
okay now something like East Constance

00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:38,160
obviously it's obviously the winner and

00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:39,330
and well let's see about that English is

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,700
the lingua franca of software

00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:44,010
engineering great well that's ironic

00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:47,550
because English lingua franca means

00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:49,410
French language and it's in Italian but

00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,990
okay English is the lingua franca

00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:54,180
software engineering and programming

00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,340
languages are made for human beings and

00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,310
of course great effort is put into us

00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:02,490
like into educating us to create proper

00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:07,080
names in proper English of types and

00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:11,039
variables in the light and it's now

00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:14,220
unsigned in medium light phrase comes in

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:17,270
correct English and in constants

00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,270
incomprehensible gibberish

00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:23,870
[Applause]

00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,420
some people would say that you could

00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:28,940
have a integer constant where integer is

00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,560
the adjective but that that that's not

00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,750
consistent because that's the sconce

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,480
method or you can have a cost point or

00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:37,490
not method constant pointer constant

00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:40,460
fighter constant one never says such

00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:46,310
things does he and so unless you're

00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:49,220
French or or a shaksperean there's only

00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:52,300
one correct thing you could say quest

00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:54,860
Const and I still have some second so

00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,690
some some some proponents of west

00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:59,420
constant system calling it comes to us

00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:01,700
because const goes first you see but

00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:04,130
again no this doesn't correspond to

00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:07,010
exacting doesn't correspond to to a

00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:09,350
bloat or duplication and it's only

00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:11,120
proper in the context of the mix child

00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:20,279
of Kenya and Kim

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:20,279
