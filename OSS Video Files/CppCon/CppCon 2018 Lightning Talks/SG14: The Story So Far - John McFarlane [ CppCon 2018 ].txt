	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
actually going to tell you about study

00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,600
groups 14 which were meeting tomorrow

00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:14,990
also it's my son's birthday today

00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:22,289
he's time so I'm probably going to miss

00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,590
the conference next year just so I can

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:27,840
spend a birthday with influence and

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:32,130
it'll be ten hour probably playing this

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,030
video for you man oh okay I'll just

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,059
shout a bit louder

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,579
did you hear so okay okay my name is Joe

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:40,860
McFarland I work for Jaguar Land Rover

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:44,780
in Ireland as as all you should all

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:49,829
should too and I'm telling you about

00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:52,280
study group 14 which came about run

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:56,280
about this time I think four years ago

00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:58,230
actually yeah four years ago probably

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,820
during a guerrilla Committee meeting

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:04,860
when somebody asked why isn't there more

00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:08,700
representation of graphics developers

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:10,590
game developers and it it transpired

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,619
there's kind of a disconnect with a lot

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:17,180
of the developers who use C++ and the

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:20,759
committee in the broader community and

00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:23,369
so study group 14 was formed it

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,860
represents three main industries game

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:27,869
development high frequency trading and

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,900
embedded systems who all happen to have

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:35,189
a lot in common and a lot of similar

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:37,259
needs of their specific to them so study

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:39,869
group for 14 there's all the things that

00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:43,829
a regular study group would but also

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:47,070
because of this perceived disconnect we

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:48,780
kind of try and do things a little bit

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:52,049
differently so reach out to people who

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,110
maybe wouldn't normally you know get in

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:56,790
touch with us and we kind of sort of

00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:58,259
sort of bang heads together really there

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,630
are some developers out there who don't

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,280
really understand that C++ has improved

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,020
incredibly in the last 10 years and

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,719
there are a lot of committee members who

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:11,220
don't quite understand the needs of all

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:13,330
the developers who are out there and the

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,970
things that interest study group for

00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:20,200
pretty broad a lot of them are covered

00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:21,670
by other study groups some of them I've

00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,930
already started being covered by study

00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:25,660
groups since those study groups came

00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:29,620
into existence partly because of

00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:34,420
feedback from SG 14 but it's so it's a

00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:36,610
lot of stuff and we well we have a forum

00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,230
which is the main way that we get in

00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:41,830
touch with each other

00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:44,560
we also roughly once a month have a

00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:47,170
teleconference then we meet like we're

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,320
going to meet tomorrow here in Bellevue

00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:54,970
and we have a github account where we

00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:57,970
collaborate on code here are some of the

00:02:54,970 --> 00:03:01,150
people involved in SG 14 there are many

00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:03,810
others these are just well Michael Wong

00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:06,790
is the mr. chair and I'm the co-chair

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,709
and then to represent the individual

00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,110
kind of interests we have sort of

00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:16,830
experts from those fields many more

00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:21,570
people and also anyone who's welcome to

00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:24,730
to kind of join in see what's going on

00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:27,430
contribute and there's lots of things

00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:31,180
you can do to get involved with SG 14

00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:33,850
and the standardization process in

00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:36,459
general I would start with that top link

00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:38,470
there I'm sorry that this is such a long

00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:41,680
URL but it's pretty easy to Google for

00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:46,300
and that's the forum where we where we

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:49,060
chat about stuff and yeah if you don't

00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:52,810
really have a ticket or haven't reserved

00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:55,989
a spot you're still welcome tomorrow all

00:03:52,810 --> 00:04:00,100
day will be will be looking at papers

00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:03,370
and proposals and if you're curious to

00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:07,360
know what a study group looks like in

00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:09,010
when it's a meeting poke your head round

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:14,830
