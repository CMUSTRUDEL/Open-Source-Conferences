I hope I don't spook any of you too much

00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:11,519
so ever since I was a kid I was

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:14,340
fascinated by bugs I would go bug

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,920
hunting and collect them in jars I would

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,170
study them under the microscope

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:24,750
sometimes I would draw them and feed

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:27,920
them often to each other now these days

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:30,330
I go I take my kids on field trips and

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,759
whenever we go on field trips I make

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,520
them memorize the three bug three

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,640
common-sense bug hunting rules and these

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,280
days I can wake them up with me I can

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,520
wake them up and ask them to recite the

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,989
three rules so it turns out that there

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,629
is a lot we can learn from these rules

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:51,000
that affect how you debug live systems

00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:52,920
in production so even if you don't

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,440
unless you're actually a software

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,699
developer and an entomologist I hope I

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,420
might be able to teach you something so

00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:05,339
the first rule that I teach my kids is

00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:08,610
when you're lifting rocks never stick

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:11,700
your fingers underneath because you

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:16,110
never know what lurks there what might

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:18,540
bite you might sting you there are some

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:22,729
very dangerous things I come from Israel

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:26,820
it's the desert country venomous things

00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:29,250
poisonous thing so you should really

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:36,630
consider using protective gear maybe

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:39,329
gloves or clothes choose and in general

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:44,820
it's a good idea to actually not try to

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:48,720
touch a light system so try using

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:52,740
simulations for exam and because

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,780
sometimes when you do make a fix your

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,189
fix might create even bigger problems

00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,899
than you want the ones you're actually

00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:02,700
trying to fix so try to understand and

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:04,909
have some kind of passive logging

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,970
inspection environment look for

00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:10,530
footprints slither marks and understand

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,510
the environment where your system is

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,830
running and if you do have to do this

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,050
you have to prepare the

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,590
so that means have some kind of

00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:22,470
extendable runtime configurable logging

00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:25,140
logging system give your system

00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:27,120
diagnostic capabilities and if you

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,830
actually do want to push up flip over

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:36,900
the rock always touch it from the

00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:39,480
visible side now the second rule is to

00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,520
never live the rock toward yourself or

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:45,360
others because you never know what's

00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:48,930
going to jump out at you and look around

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,330
see who might be affected by your

00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:54,540
changes so it could be people it could

00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:57,660
be other devices sometimes we remote

00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,700
devices users try to prepare for these

00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:14,760
eventualities try to make simulations

00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:18,360
and in the controlled environment now

00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:21,300
rule number three always return the rock

00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:25,380
to their original position because you

00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:27,270
know bugs are people too right and we

00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,220
Came we disturbed their home and we

00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:32,730
gotta leave them alone when we're done

00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:34,890
and I think of course we this bug when

00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,239
we want to find them and study them we

00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:39,570
want to leave them alone but the bugs we

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,110
do fix we wanna at least clean up after

00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:43,110
ourselves

00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:44,970
so we gotta leave the code in a better

00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:46,920
condition leave the cyst in a better

00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:50,070
condition than it was before so that

00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:53,459
means add or update unit tests update

00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:55,709
you documentation and of course we

00:03:53,459 --> 00:04:02,010
factor your code so that it's future

00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:02,459
proof and so going over these three

00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,470
rules

00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:06,780
don't forget never stick your fingers

00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,790
underneath the rock never flip rocks

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,680
towards yourself and others and always

00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:13,620
return them up to its original position

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,010
so go teach that to your kids teach it

00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,010
to your colleagues

00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:22,489
