	00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:07,680
so my name is Mattel's Busch I'm a C++

00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:09,240
trainer so I those lights for living to

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,090
make my life isn't more miserable I

00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,910
decided to explore see make dark puffs a

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,580
year ago and that's how I end up here on

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,289
this conference how many of you were on

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:25,050
my presentation on Monday regarding see

00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:27,750
Mike yes that's a few probably you are

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:31,019
bubbly you may want to see it one when

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,570
it's available on the video but I was

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:36,800
asked by many guys how I do those slides

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,270
and I do them with CMake unfortunately

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:44,450
[Music]

00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:47,399
so yeah this questions I hear often but

00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:50,969
having more than 1000 slides and did

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:53,430
PowerPoint previously I I promised

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:56,250
myself I will never do it again so this

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,440
is how my lectures or emotions are

00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,750
organized I have more than 1000 slides

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,000
right now I have many they are divided

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,460
to different trainings and different

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,510
chapters so I can read chapters and so

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:12,510
on for four different as I have and as

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:15,060
you can see here the if not well not

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,409
only have the slides there but also code

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,900
snippets and I would like to build them

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:21,119
and verify them before the training and

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,970
the same process so this is how I came

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,220
up with this library it gives really

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:30,140
benefits for large decks for some sample

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:32,820
small probably it's not that fine and

00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,280
yeah you can build everything from

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,869
ultimately the tunnel to the

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,130
presentation layer turnstile so you can

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:40,829
easily change the styles for different

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:43,860
occasions if there is easy reuse of

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:46,500
stuff because you just copy paste text

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,000
in work down there is a special option

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,100
to do know it handout which I will show

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,759
at the end and I prefer to write

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,490
markdown

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:57,180
in empty files than in HTML that's why I

00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,619
created this one and no I'm not doing

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,570
the slides and see Mike I'm using cream

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,579
ideas and this is basically those two

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,649
slides from the previous written in and

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:06,960
model that you can see it's pretty easy

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:12,690
and it's much from much much more fun

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,650
than doing PowerPoint how to start with

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,650
this

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,540
from my website from develop and define

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:22,580
your style that you like this one would

00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:28,230
think style is not really the best one I

00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:31,890
shall put this presentation and default

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:34,140
language highlighting you can then write

00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,730
things in markdown file I will get my

00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:39,060
ultimate project that looked like this

00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:42,030
so far so good it's typical project that

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,620
you are using and then the magic happens

00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,360
these are the things that are in my

00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,000
library you can define slides you can

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,849
find here things like like a style for

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,099
example you have see this laser it also

00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:54,480
works fine if you don't know remote

00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:56,430
viewers you can do stuff like this this

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,069
is presentation mode that I often see

00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,750
when I'm doing presentations and with eg

00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:04,049
tragic of this type things you can make

00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,790
it look like this for example and that's

00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:09,659
pretty cool if you are handling

00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:11,549
different companies and having different

00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:16,859
occasions for doing slides like for

00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:18,540
example for a specific style this is how

00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:22,349
I define the engine you've done defined

00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:25,769
stars stars can be your hippo provide

00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:28,709
languages for this and add chapters if

00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:33,690
needed from chapters you generate one

00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:35,370
one good friend and there is as I

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,079
promised there is kind of generation so

00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:40,489
these are and these are the slides

00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:43,109
animations on one slide in remark and

00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:44,639
this is special flight mark as a flock

00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:46,919
handout in the wizard

00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,510
it will not be visible so you can have

00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:52,760
different slides for students then for

00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:56,870
teacher during this last generation and

00:03:52,760 --> 00:04:00,660
that's all if you won't export this and

00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:02,569
have fun loose email download it and use

00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,569
it it's open-source

00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:05,569
contribute

00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:11,909
thank you

00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,909
