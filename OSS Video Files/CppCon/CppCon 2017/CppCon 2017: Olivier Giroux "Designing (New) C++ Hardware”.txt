You can run C++ on any computer you want, as long as it pretends it is an 80’s computer. Conveniently most computers pretend to be 80’s computers – with extras, but nothing too radical – because they want to run C++. This contract isn’t written down anywhere, but both sides are absolutely bound by it. 

In this talk we’ll walk through the adaptation of the most radical new architecture to run C++ in decades, NVIDIA Volta. The talk contents will be divided into four parts that align to these abstract machine semantics: execution agents, progress guarantees, the object model, and the consistency model. 

We will close on new C++ features that make it easier, not harder, for hardware to support C++.

Olivier Giroux: NVIDIA, Principal Architect

Olivier Giroux has worked on eight GPU and four SM architecture generations released by NVIDIA. Lately, he works to clarify the forms and semantics of valid GPU programs, present and future. He was the programming model lead for the new NVIDIA Volta architecture. He is a member of WG21, the ISO C++ committee, and is a passionate contributor to C++'s forward progress guarantees and memory model.
