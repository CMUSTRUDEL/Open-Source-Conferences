We will provide a brief overview including an explanation of what Unicode is, string terminology, and how Unicode supports non US languages. 

We will cover the pros and cons of various String formats and encodings including UTF-8, UTF-16, UCS-4, etc. A time line of Unicode development will be shown and how other languages have handled string processing over the last twenty years. 

We will provide a brief overview of where strings are used, what can go wrong with strings, why string encoding is important, and how the CsString library solves a major problem with string handling. 

We will explain how the CsString library has changed our CopperSpice Gui libraries and improved string processing in DoxyPress. 

No prior knowledge of Unicode, CopperSpice, or DoxyPress is required.
