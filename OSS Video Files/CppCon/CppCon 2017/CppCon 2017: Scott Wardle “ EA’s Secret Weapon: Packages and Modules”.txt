A lot of people hate build systems. What if using a library was just as easy as header-only libraries? 

EA has had a Secret Weapon called “packages” for over 14 years. EA's Packages are like Ruby’s Gems or Perl’s CPAN or Rust’s cargo. If you build a package from the package server it will download all of its dependencies. 

This talk will be about what we have learned about packages and versioning while building our large AAA games over the last 10+ years. Finally, what do we see for the future, like how will C++ modules fit in?

In detail I will talk about: 
-Package layout 
-Package server 
-Versioning control and packages 
-Libraries teams and platform fragmentation 
-Packages' effect on large scale architecture 
-C++ Modules TS prototypes
