over the last years we have become used

00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:07,230
to the abuse of the word modern and now

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,540
we even talk about the word postmodern

00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,550
C++ but these words we borrow from

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,769
historians that used them to describe

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,710
the eras of Western civilization is

00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,449
there anything we can learn from them so

00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:20,279
we start recording history in the ants

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,590
in terror of which a fine especially

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,779
interest in the Classical period at that

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:31,769
time the Greeks developed elitist proto

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:35,160
democracies in which philosophy and the

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:38,070
lovin Porsche of sharing of knowledge of

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,510
knowledge flourished this allowed them

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,280
to learn so much at the time they knew

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,739
already that the earth was round and

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,899
it's radius and the rich rotated around

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:49,469
the Sun and they even speculated of the

00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:51,660
existence of atoms however with the

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:53,910
decadence and fall of the Roman Empire

00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,160
we entered the medieval era Europe

00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,680
divided becomes too busy fighting each

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,600
other in feudal wars a lot of knowledge

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,059
is forgotten be replaced by dogmatic

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,729
truth the earth is now flat and the Sun

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:08,460
rotates around the earth but eventually

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:09,810
a hill a huge cultural shift comes with

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,360
the Renaissance we embrace

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,570
anthropocentrism and humanism and this

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,650
idea that truth ultimately emerged from

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,380
human experience

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,390
wium Redis cover the classics and use

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,759
their knowledge to pursue science to

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,979
build more prosperous societies however

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,890
many people believe in that the way in

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:29,780
the end singular absolute truths leads

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,270
to trouble

00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:35,460
this leads to two world words that leave

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,079
the Western society traumatized this

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,759
finally symbolizes the death of the

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:40,560
universal and we come to embrace

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,200
contradiction and plurality in our

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,450
societies we get to acknowledge that

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,640
Western the Western world perspective is

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,439
just a part not a whole in multicultural

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,659
societies that face the challenge of

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,680
surviving the complex of globalization

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:55,259
and death capitalism

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,810
ok what the was this let's talk

00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,090
about programming

00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:01,340
[Laughter]

00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:04,470
the recorded history of programming

00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:07,050
starts in the classical era in this time

00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,369
initial explorers embedded in elite

00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:11,100
little democracies

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:13,230
this is universities gathered so much

00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,550
knowledge and asserted with each other

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,510
in a timing which only free software

00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:18,030
existed

00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:20,100
we had languages like Lisp email add a

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,420
small talk that explore all the

00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,790
different philosophies and pattern

00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:26,340
paradigms of work of programming that we

00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,750
know today we already have type

00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:32,250
inference continuations higher-order

00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:38,459
programming act or CSP so much more but

00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:40,830
in the mid late 80s in the Middle Ages

00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:43,110
we entered the personal computer

00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,640
revolution proprietary software is

00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,459
devised as a means to mass-produce

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,930
consumer software and with it we stopped

00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,560
sharing knowledge with yourself with

00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,840
each other

00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,120
companies get involved in feudal wars

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,820
producing a myriad of languages and

00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,680
change and change in proprietary tool

00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,860
chains analog Matic and narrow

00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:05,070
perspective of object orientation in

00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:09,690
this time we have Java visual basic

00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:11,370
Delphine and yes medieval C++ I am aware

00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,110
that some conservative forces in our

00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,900
community take pride in something they

00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:18,780
called C++ classic this reminded that

00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:23,760
such thing does not exist this is the at

00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:26,940
medieval C++ in the Middle Ages torture

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,720
was also prevalent so in the 90s we also

00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,720
get PHP

00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,090
but in the 2000s another revolution

00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,099
happened the Internet boom and its

00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,810
subsequent bubble call is not cheap

00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:46,180
directly to consumers in proprietary

00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:48,549
boxes anymore but it runs directly in

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,950
our servers developers share with each

00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:53,010
other again and free software becomes

00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,780
popular under the new brand open source

00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:59,010
furthermore the agile manifesto is

00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:01,510
published in 2001 which starts like this

00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:03,519
with value individuals and interactions

00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:05,620
over processes and tools

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,220
what a beautiful transposition of the

00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:11,200
humanistic values of the Renaissance new

00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,349
multiple the time languages like Python

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,299
and Ruby capture our imagination

00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:18,280
Alexandra's who publishes modern C++ and

00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:20,919
we work on new C++ standards that

00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,229
embrace ideas from the classics that are

00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:24,970
now mainstream again we get lambda as we

00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:26,770
get type inference and the hope for a

00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:30,100
better language driven by open

00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:32,410
implementations but in the last decade a

00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,900
new disruption of course the mobile

00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:36,880
revolution systems are not built for

00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,250
desktop nor servers neither embedded

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,410
devices but for all of them at the same

00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,870
time this means the death of the

00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:47,110
universal C++ developers now talk about

00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:49,330
whilst Haskell closure a perfect example

00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:51,310
of polyglot programming we embrace

00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:54,160
contradiction and with heterogeneous

00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:56,139
systems composed of my two services not

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,580
only is our technology more diverse we

00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:59,680
are also facing the challenge of

00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,900
building communities where people from

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,810
all backgrounds can feel welcome and

00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,310
tried this is so I said not only is our

00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,539
technology more diverse we'll also

00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,190
facing the challenge of building

00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:10,900
communities where people from all

00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:13,180
backgrounds can feel welcome and three

00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,740
thrive this is to assert the value of

00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,139
human dignity as a form of resistance

00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,729
against the alienating foreign forces

00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:21,580
that sometimes permeate our the our

00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:24,760
industry still our the one to be too

00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:27,280
prescriptive and just live here a big

00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,080
question mark because in the end we are

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,510
leaving this error right now so it will

00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,760
be whatever we make it be thank you very

00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,140
much

00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,380
[Applause]

00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,760
[Music]

00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,829
[Applause]
