[Music]

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,609
[Music]

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,300
[Music]

00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:42,219
[Music]

00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:51,559
like if you want to know a little bit

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,840
about Knicks

00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:59,280
it's kind of a special package it's a

00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:03,379
functional domain specific language

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,379
which is like close to the main language

00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:12,510
provide a lot of package like and most

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:14,220
most likely biggest distribution it's

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,439
one of the most active project on github

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,630
like you have a crazy number of people

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,680
that come into that like taking the

00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:25,470
package many from the function community

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,689
like Nix Nix OS and get the Linux

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,340
distribution on that but it does not

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:32,150
matter how much like what matter is what

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,740
we need in fact very interesting for C++

00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:37,530
why interesting because in one more one

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,820
thing that like mix bring compared to

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,729
the patent manager is what you

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,619
disability and if you don't care about

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:54,060
the passivity is probably because you

00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:57,149
never distribution what is not working

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,250
anymore something different which is

00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:01,649
more like yeah you oh dear colleague

00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,530
like Michael just walk on my machine not

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:07,520
on you know I'm sorry for you you have

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:10,910
to first yeah you probably get

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,910
compiler which is

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,150
like

00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,440
[Music]

00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,509
[Music]

00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,469
[Music]

00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,180
[Music]

00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:05,110
the red one turn it over to insert a new

00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:06,780
number to be square one is like you

00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,980
along that function to wind up saying

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,520
this is where you pick up those rules

00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:15,730
this is the function f on bottom part is

00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:18,370
just like what kind of package you put

00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:21,320
inside the function that you

00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:23,810
nothing very complicated ah oh you do

00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,580
like package collection maintain entire

00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:28,490
package very fun we need seemed like it

00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:30,620
just as a giant osep we've not unlike a

00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,300
name of Lamia but just wheel the shaft

00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:35,630
was a kind of package but you are seeing

00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:38,150
just before so like you get like ten

00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:40,340
thousand package like that where you can

00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:42,650
just person all with a normal power

00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:46,100
meter of like you know acacia variable

00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:48,500
name or you can also override like if

00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,090
you want to just use specified upon CF

00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,870
integral and you can have as many

00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:55,910
darshan of one packet as you want in

00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,560
parallel and when you want to build it

00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:00,440
you just get in the directory where your

00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,580
velocity will be example the package of

00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,229
needs cannot be a little bit

00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:09,090
automatically I'm a story about on you

00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:14,090
that makes everything honestly I just

00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:14,090
