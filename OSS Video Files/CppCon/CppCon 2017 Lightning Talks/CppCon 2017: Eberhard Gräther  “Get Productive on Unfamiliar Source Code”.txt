all right so today I'm gonna talk about

00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:07,649
sauce trail a software developer tool

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:10,200
for reading and understanding source

00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:13,110
code so my story starts a couple years

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:16,049
ago at the Google Chrome team I was an

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:18,510
intern and I my task was add a check box

00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:21,270
to the web inspector to show and hide

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,369
this frame rate meter and it was a super

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,820
simple test the only problem was it took

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:28,529
me three weeks and I learned a big

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,689
lesson I learned that software

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:32,820
developers really spend a lot of time on

00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:34,770
reading and understanding source code

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,170
and we can argue about the numbers but

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,530
most developers I talked to agree that

00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:44,879
it's somewhere between 50 to 98 percent

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:47,539
or something and that got me wondering

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:51,809
like do we really have the best tools

00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:53,850
for this task and so the chromium team

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:55,620
has a really powerful tool actually they

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,820
have chromium code search which does

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:03,390
some cross-referencing it's basically an

00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:07,170
in-browser find all references but after

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:09,689
working with this 2 or 4 months I was

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,240
wondering you know I look at source code

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:13,950
all the time and I have to collect all

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,990
information by looking at files and

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,759
build this mental model can't I just you

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:22,650
know I have a tool that helps me build

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:24,540
that mental model somehow and I'm gonna

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,020
do a jump here so you can read the whole

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,829
story on our blog but it turns out yes

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,610
it's possible

00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:34,950
and so our result is sauce trail which

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,799
is a offline cross-platform developer

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:41,250
tool and what it does is it indexes your

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,259
source code it uses clang lip tooling to

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,630
retrieve all the information about which

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:49,950
glasses exist and how they reference

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:51,930
each other and the user interface system

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,909
made for simple navigation and

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:57,700
exploration consisting of search code

00:01:53,909 --> 00:02:05,750
and graph and demo time

00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:08,899
all right so pretty much what works like

00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:12,380
that you just um search for anything

00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:15,050
like shows classes methods whatever and

00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:19,849
since the last bill you can also filter

00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:22,489
by just classes and then the graph shows

00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:24,650
you like first level dependencies to all

00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:26,959
other symbols and the code shows you the

00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:29,420
definition plus all the references you

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:32,360
can click on anything here and it will

00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:34,280
update both sides and here the class

00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,340
player you also see it has base class on

00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:40,220
top derived ones at the bottom and if

00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:43,940
you click on edges it will show you the

00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:45,769
exact location some features that are

00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:49,790
useful sometimes it's like looking at a

00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:52,579
whole call graph leading to to a certain

00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:55,340
function map of being called you can do

00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:58,489
the same thing with classes and see like

00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:00,769
the whole inheritance chain like this

00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:04,370
information just the information in the

00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:07,190
graph is scattered between four files or

00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:10,540
something so the graph really helps in

00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:15,739
seeing the bigger picture of things and

00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:17,090
lastly you guys like templates so for

00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:20,180
template classes you can also see

00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:23,329
implicit specializations and you can see

00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:27,579
where they are used all right I could go

00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:31,579
on for probably an hour but time is

00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:35,720
short alright so um we have an intro

00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:40,280
video where I show more of the tool if

00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:42,859
you're interested and so sauce trail he

00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,530
is already a tool that is that you can

00:03:42,859 --> 00:03:47,660
download and use and that's helpful but

00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,489
at the same time it's still in heavy

00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:53,720
development and we add new features with

00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:55,940
very new release so I'd be happy to have

00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,579
to you having a look and give give me

00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:00,290
some feedback and everything I just

00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:03,670
showed you you can find on sauce trail

00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,670
or comment thank you for listening

00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,030
