There are over 100 sessions of this conference and almost all have one or two presenters.

00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,160
For every presenter, there will be tens to hundreds of attendees in the room.

00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:20,340
For every attendee in the room, there will be hundreds to thousands of video views.

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,400
The main impact of a modern tech talk is not on the live viewers, but on the video viewers.

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,060
However, for every viewer who understands English well enough to watch the video in English,

00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,640
there are tens to hundreds of those who don't.

00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,780
Those developers can quickly and relatively well understand written English, but not spoken.

00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:48,120
And for every English reader, there are tens of those who don't understand written English well enough.

00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:53,800
The people in either of these last two groups just don't watch the videos in English.

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:59,100
They get nothing out of the work and money that has gone into creating the hundreds of hours of recordings

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,800
from conferences like CppCon, Meeting C++ or C++Now.

00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,380
This talk is about fixing that.

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,440
It is about how we can bring great C++ content to developers all over the world,

00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,680
speaking different languages, not just the English speakers.

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,800
YouTube supports video captioning.

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,020
For the same video, there can be multiple captions in different languages.

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,151
Those captions can be provided not just by the video owner,

00:01:29,151 --> 00:01:32,100
but by any of you with a Google or YouTube account.

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,560
Captioning or translation of the videos is called community contributions.

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,380
The captioners and translators can get credit for their work.

00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:47,220
After the video owner has enabled the community contributions, the translations can be submitted.

00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,160
After a review, they get published.

00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:57,640
For the CppCon, Meeting C++ and C++Now YouTube channels, the community contributions are enabled.

00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:03,360
Now comes the hard part: the community needs to step up and do the translating.

00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,900
This is obviously too big a job for a single person or a small group.

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:17,200
That is why we started the C++ Video Access Project located at cppvap.wikidot.com

00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:26,060
The mission of this site is to provide support to the captioners and translators, coordinate our efforts and publish our progress.

00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,100
It turns out that translating isn't the hardest part.

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:37,600
Once the video is captioned, it takes surprisingly little time for a bilingual speaker to extract the English captions,

00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,380
translate the English text and submit the translation.

00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,460
The real work is creating the original English captions.

00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,320
You probably know that YouTube provides auto-generated captions,

00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,300
but these aren't quite good enough for regular talks.

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,300
For tech talks, they fail miserably.

00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,780
We need a lot of help from English language speakers to create clean English captions as the starting point.

00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:10,220
And the conference presenters are in a unique position to know what captions best capture the intent of their presentation.

00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:17,340
Tomorrow at 1:10 PM I am giving a lunchtime talk: "Captioning and Translating C++ Videos".

00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:25,020
I will briefly illustrate the captioning process for video owners, presenters, captioners, translators and viewers.

00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:31,580
I will show you what the C++ Video Access Project website has, what you can add and how.

00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,020
Hopefully I will told [sic] you the story of this initiative.

00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,640
That session is not going to be recorded.

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,220
So for those who are in the room, watching in person is the only chance to see it.

00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:51,000
For those who are now watching this talk recorded, just go to cppvap.wikidot.com

00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,360
and start exploring the opportunities.

00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,120
Here is the takeaway of this talk:

00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:03,380
C++ videos are much more valuable when well-captioned in English and translated into other languages.

00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:09,860
YouTube provides support for us as a community, to work together to do this captioning and translating.

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,040
The C++ Video Access Project provides information and support.

00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:21,780
If you are a C++ presenter, you are in a unique position to provide quality English captions

00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,640
and to translate your videos to the other languages you speak.

00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:31,860
If you are multilingual, you can help leverage the value of the work done at major C++ conferences.

00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,720
In reply, your name will become known in the C++ community.

00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,540
If you cannot watch C++ videos in English,

00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:45,060
there is a resource that gathers in one place the links to the C++ videos in the language you speak.

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:51,820
And that resource is the C++ Video Access Project: cppvap.wikidot.com

00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,220
Come to tomorrow's talk to learn more and start getting involved.

00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,460
