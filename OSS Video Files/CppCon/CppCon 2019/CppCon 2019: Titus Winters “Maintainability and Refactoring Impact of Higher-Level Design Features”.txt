Higher levels of abstraction are useful for building things out of, but also have a higher cognitive and maintenance cost. That is, it's a lot easier to refactor a function than it is to change a type, and similarly easier to deal with a single concrete type than a class template, or a Concept, or a meta-Concept ... In this talk I'll present example strategies for refactoring the interface of functions, classes, and class templates. I'll also discuss how the recent addition of Concepts and the proposals for even-more-abstract features affect long-term refactoring in C++. If you're interested in refactoring and it isn't immediately clear that a Concept published in a library can never change, this talk is for you.

Titus Winters has spent the past 6 years working on Google's core C++ libraries. He's particularly interested in issues of large scale software engineer and codebase maintenance: how do we keep a codebase of over 100M lines of code consistent and flexible for the next decade? Along the way he has helped Google teams pioneer techniques to perform automated code transformations on a massive scale, and helps maintain the Google C++ Style Guide.
