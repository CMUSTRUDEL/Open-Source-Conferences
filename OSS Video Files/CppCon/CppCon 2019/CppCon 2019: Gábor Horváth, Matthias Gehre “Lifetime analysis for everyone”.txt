Object lifetimes are a common source of bugs in C++ that can cause crashes or other unexpected behavior. Fortunately, we now have tools to help us find issues before they can manifest. Guided by Herb Sutter's paper on lifetime analysis, the Clang community has implemented new lifetime warnings which work on single statements. These warnings are only a subset of what is described in the paper, but they have no false positives and still catch important problems in your code. During this talk we will introduce you to the basic principles of the new warnings, share their results on open source projects, and show you tips and tricks on how to get the most out of these diagnostics both for library and application code authors. Spoiler alert: these warnings found bugs in very popular projects!
