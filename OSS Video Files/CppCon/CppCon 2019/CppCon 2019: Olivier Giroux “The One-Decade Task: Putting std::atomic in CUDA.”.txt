Some tasks are projected to take a long time to complete, and many take more time than planned. We didn't plan for it at the onset, but putting std::atomic into CUDA will have taken almost 10 years when it's all over. Many exceptional engineers contributed, everyone learned a lot, I would do it again 100%.

In this talk I will share 10 stories from the trenches in the 10-year arc of this "one task", each with a concise lesson I learned and/or a word about people that made a big difference. You will get a glimpse of what it's like to work on a hardware team, take a quick dive into a seminal computer science thesis, learn the basics of a computer modeling language called Alloy, get a tour of the libcxx ＜atomic＞ header... and more!
