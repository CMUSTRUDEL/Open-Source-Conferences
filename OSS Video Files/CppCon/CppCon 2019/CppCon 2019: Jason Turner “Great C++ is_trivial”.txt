There are many ways to initialize an object in C++, and much time spent analyzing the efficiency of the many options. We then think and rethink and overthink how to avoid copies and if a `std::move` would be more efficient in a certain case.

But if we understand what it means for a type to be trivial most of these questions now become meaningless. We can get all of the efficiency we could hope for, and probably more.

We will look at the trivial type traits, what they mean, and how they affect our code. Will will then examine the benefits of using trivial types and the impact on performance.
