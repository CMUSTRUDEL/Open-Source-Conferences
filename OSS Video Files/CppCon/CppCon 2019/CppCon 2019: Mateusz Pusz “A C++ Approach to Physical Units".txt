This talk presents a new C++20 library for Dimensional Analysis and Physical Units handling. The essential requirements of the library are user-friendliness, compile-time safety, no runtime overhead, and easy extensibility. The syntax of the library is built around a few easy to learn concepts and strictly checked at compile time, which makes it easy to learn and very forgiving for the novice.

The talk presents motivating examples of why we need such a library, compares the library with other similar products on the market, describes the basic usage and interface, and highlights the benefits of the design choices made.

The talk is also a great showcase of practical usage of new C++20 features that make the library interface easier to use, maintain, and extend. Concepts, contracts, class types provided as non-type template parameters, and other C++20 features make a huge difference in how we can design Modern C++ code.
