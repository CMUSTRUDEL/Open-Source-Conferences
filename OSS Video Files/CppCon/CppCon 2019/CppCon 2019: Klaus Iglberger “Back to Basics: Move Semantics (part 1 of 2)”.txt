Move semantics is one of the most complex topics in the world of C++, including many technical details that often confuse even experts. This interactive back-to-the-basics session is entirely focused on understanding the details behind move semantics. It explains the motivation behind move semantics, the need for rvalue references and std::move, the reason for forwarding references and std::forward, and how to properly apply move semantics. The many interactive questions and exercises will help to quickly adapt the newly gained knowledge.
