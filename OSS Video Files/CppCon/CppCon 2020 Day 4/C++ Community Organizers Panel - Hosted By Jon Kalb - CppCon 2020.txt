Are you a C++ community leader? Would you like to be?

If you are or would like to be working to build a C++ community, either on-line or in meat space, we'd like to hear from you about your challenges and your successes.

We'll hear from successful community leaders, answer questions, and share resources and ideas. We'll discuss user groups, conferences, podcast, and online communities and forums.

hello

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,280
and welcome to the cppcon 2020

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,920
organizers panel a different experience

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,880
for us but it's not new for cppcon to be

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,840
supporting uh local user groups other

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,400
conferences

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,240
we have always felt like it's a that

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,359
we're in a community and we've always

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,199
tried to support

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,560
other events support people who go to

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,640
other events and

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,360
and we've been really grateful because

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,360
we've gotten that support in

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,680
in return and one of the things i want

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,879
to let everybody know about

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:46,320
if if jim could could paste the

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:49,039
url to yens's talk

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,559
last year he did a talk on starting

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,680
local group organizations and things

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,960
like that so for people who are

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,160
interested in that

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,280
check that out we also

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,000
have a starter group or excuse me a

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,320
starter kit

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,039
for if you are planning to start a local

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,799
group

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,640
i don't think we've really updated that

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,119
for how to do this in covit so it's kind

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,280
of a

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,640
you know read this over in preparation

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,360
for how to start a group in the local

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,320
world

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,920
actually there's a lot of stuff that

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,680
would be relative even if you wanted to

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,040
start a purely online group some of the

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,159
stuff would still be relevant but

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,880
um but i wanted to have jim also

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,799
paste that into the chat uh for people

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,880
to look at that

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,240
all right so i want to uh introduce our

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,360
introduce our panel and i'm going to

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,960
start with harold

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,439
harold you want to tell us uh where

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,920
you're from and what you're doing there

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,400
yes i'm harold i'm i'm actually from

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,159
austria but i live in stockholm sweden

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,079
four years ago a little bit more than

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,759
four years ago we had no

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,479
c blasphemous user group and i wanted to

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,840
have one so actually i

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:52,560
stepped in and and created one

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,079
and back to this it was sweden cpp

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,360
because it was the only user group

00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:00,399
in in sweden today we have one in

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,960
yeti berg or goldenberg and one in miami

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,560
also

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,360
and there is one in shopping which

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,479
would need a new organizer but yeah this

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,599
dissipation

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,640
so yeah i was just gonna ask you one

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,720
question about

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,239
those other groups did they happen

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,480
because you started the one you did or

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,120
were they just entirely coincidental or

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,040
well um actually i'm also the organizer

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,120
from from from criticbug

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,160
so i kicked off this because they had

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,520
none

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,440
and there were there was a inactive

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,280
group they had no meetings so i took

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,120
over the group and then i asked hey

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,480
who wants to take over this and then

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,879
talk with people in gutenberg and

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,519
they'll

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,200
also been there and in my emergence this

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,040
happens

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,879
how how do i start the user group and i

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,239
said well just that one

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,840
okay and uh jens

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,760
would you like to introduce yourself and

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,160
tell us all the things that you're

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,160
active with

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,720
uh yeah sure um hi my name is jan

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,480
sweeter

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,720
i run meeting c plus and

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,239
around 2012 i was in a similar situation

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,280
as it was but

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,560
for germany and europe so i started a

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,959
conference and

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,120
through this conference just like cppcon

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,280
i started motivating people

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,080
to get user groups running in their

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,159
areas and since then reading cpas plus

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,599
is an organization dedicated to

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,400
organizing and

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,760
helping other organizers uh user groups

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,480
in the newest

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,159
endeavor for this since this year's

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,000
[Music]

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,599
that have also started an online user

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,280
group um

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,360
which you can find the details under

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,959
online dot meeting cbp.com

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,640
which is basically um yeah i had a user

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,960
group in the sort of for very long but

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,360
then

00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,480
[Music]

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,599
i did not have enough

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,239
uh folks that would probably

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,400
follow into the online setting to make

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,920
it the local meeting so i decided to

00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,760
take a general approach and make an

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,799
online user group

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,280
we're definitely going to be talking a

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,360
lot about online stuff in this panel

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,640
but i want to introduce inbound in value

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,879
you want to tell us where you're from

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,439
and

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,560
what what you're doing sure i'd love to

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,959
thank you john

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,599
so uh my name is inval levy i'm from

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,600
israel

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:20,720
and i've joined the organization

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,160
of core cpp both conference and user

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,880
group

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,080
so i would i would say that the person

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,000
who actually started

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,320
our user group the israeli user group is

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,440
adishavit and michael

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:37,120
i think michael also was involved very

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:40,639
very early in the beginning um and i

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:44,000
but i will say that i think we

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:47,199
really increased our uh outreach to

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,320
to the uh international award and uh

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:54,320
we're actually uh enjoying uh izo

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:58,400
and now we're really um trying to have

00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,800
uh more of our local users to

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,000
uh to to approach you know uh

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,199
international

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,840
uh conferences and of course to to

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,520
have talks in international conferences

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,360
i'm very happy to be here today

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,360
so i think one of the interesting things

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,240
to learn from that is that creating

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,919
creating the local user group actually

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,000
caused people who were there to think

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,400
more internationally

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,759
because as you've said there's now the

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,000
iso

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,759
israel was wasn't didn't exist and it

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,240
came largely out of the user group stuff

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,160
so

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,280
that's that's a real tribute it's not

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,479
just people getting together and

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,000
ignoring the rest of the world in fact

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,440
it's the exact opposite of that as we

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,440
get together we think about

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,560
those kinds of things so i want to talk

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,000
to michael

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,759
you want to introduce yourself mike and

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,759

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,199
start asking all the questions right um

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,680
and i think it's uh it's fair probably

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,319
to start with the ends because he's the

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,120
uh dates back furthest of those on the

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,160
plan

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,199
uh on the panel for being involved

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,919
what um what's the impact then of covet

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,280
i mean this is

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,960
this is hitting us all i think it's the

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,680
obvious question for to talk about all

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,840
of us but

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,720
what's your point of view on it and how

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,120
is it

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:59,840
how has it made your situation worse and

00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,840
how has it strengthened it

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,400
well it more or less stopped our

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,879
meetings

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,479
and for the conference it's for a long

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,160
time it's like totally unclear it's

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,080
kind of unclear i'm very happy that

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:16,240
cppcon is working well

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,919
and that we are like seeing the whole uh

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,360
platform which we use in which we will

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,319
share with cppcon

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,680
um working and keeping up to the

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,560
stresses like the first time where we

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,160
see so many attendees

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,960
in the software and that it's actually

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,919
you know being understood and used by by

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:37,440
the secret bus community

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:41,440
i think that the full fallout

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,200
of covet will show itself next year

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,200
not so much this year this year still

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,640
like kind of here we are coming from the

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,920
happy times

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,519
um i think it will have definitely some

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,279
some impact on conferences and user

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,560
groups and

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:58,240
um that's why i think it's

00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,760
really variable to experiment on the

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,680
virtual field and have

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:06,080
virtual um meetings and that's also why

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,279
why i definitely started to to go in

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,839
this field right because

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,399
that's where i apparently see like this

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,880
decade

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,760
uh the change where yes you were coming

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,080
from

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,120
um the last seven years what what we

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,519
built and

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,680
i know cannot be in 2012 where like

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,880
cppcon didn't exist and was

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,959
as not even as an idea existing and

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,880
i mean cps was starting and john being

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,200
supportive of that and

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,320
uh then certainly the conference scene

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,640
growing but now

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,160
i think it's it's a certain situation

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,959
that

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,640
i hope has also it's positive that you

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,000
know we are able to to reach more people

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,440
online through this right

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,880
i think there's a lot of upside but

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,240
before we get into that i do want to get

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,080
it we do have a question

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,200
and uh this is from gabriel who

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,640
knows the answer to the question but

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,519
it's but it's reason a great point his

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,680
question is

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,920
how hardcore of a c plus plus expert

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,680
must you be to create a new user group

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,080
and uh who wants who wants to take that

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,080
one on

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,920
michael i don't think you need to be

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,580
hardcore

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,360
at all

00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:13,680
[Laughter]

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,399
what you need is uh you need the ability

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,600
to at least appear outgoing

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:22,959
and you need you need to be

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,600
willing to work really hard um and you

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,760
need to

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,519
you need to love the c plus community

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,279
you're especially your local c plus plus

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,279
community and want to build it

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,720
um but nobody's expecting you to be the

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,279
expert um

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,040
you go find experts and to be honest uh

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,680
some of the best content is not even by

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,880
experts

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,839
because content which engages a broad

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,279
group of people

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,279
is not necessarily the most advanced

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,560
content that's right um i think it's

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,839
interesting the way the way you started

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,200
that michael because it's like

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,399
you don't you don't actually need to be

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,890
friendly you just need to appear

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,839
friendly

00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:57,279
[Laughter]

00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,560
i think there's a great truth to that

00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,279
but i think that that's an excellent

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,959
answer and

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,920
i would i would build on that and say

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,519
also that you will learn about c plus

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,120
you'll become more of an expert

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,640
because you'll be talking to people with

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,440
a number of different points of view

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,640
who explain why uh they're interested in

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,200
certain things and you'll begin to

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,040
realize

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,720
a lot of interconnections and and those

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,560
kinds of things so you will become

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,079
more of a civil sector and you will

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,920
certainly appear more of one it'll be

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,600
easier for you to get hired if you say

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,279
well how did you see plus less skills

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,040
well i run the local simple swiss group

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,320
oh wow we don't talk about it then we

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,519
just assume you're a genius

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,880
yes did you have a comment uh i i think

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,880
i think you will get to

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,640
you will get to know your local c plus

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,800
plus experts if you run the group

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,399
you will get to talk to a lot of people

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,440
and you will find out that you know some

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,279
of them think that they're experts and

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,880
the more you progress to to become an

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,279
expert unless you

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,000
think that you are one that's right uh

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,320
you'll not only

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,680
you'll not only learn who in your area

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,880
is quite knowledgeable you also learn

00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,399
who's very good at

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,320
explaining concepts and good at

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,440
presenting um

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,600
and i would love to add if um

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,880
i just would love to add that i think no

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,240
one is an expert

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,880
in everything necessarily and everyone

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,880
in

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,399
every level have more to learn from

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,200
other people so

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:20,959
just by having the community you're

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,959
increasing everyone's benefits

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,959
you just need you just need the passion

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,560
for it i don't think that's

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:31,519
necessarily the technical part is the if

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,959
i can add one one simple thought is uh

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,000
i've been developing this

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,920
thought in the in the last few years i

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,680
think that the role of a community

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,600
manager is

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:46,000
very similar to the role of a gardener

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,399
that looks after a garden because

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,639
actually you cannot really

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,600
influence the nature because you have

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,600
just to create

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,720
the good conditions for a natural

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,720
process to

00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,959
to just work and that's not very easy i

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,839
mean because you have to

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,720
sometimes you have to you know to leave

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,160
the stage

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,560
let's say so the community is not

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,160
centered around you that is the

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,079
community manager but

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,639
the community is the you know the bunch

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,760
of people attending and interacting in a

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,920
natural way

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,880
right so that's something maybe we can

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,639
discuss about

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,720
in later but the spontaneity

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,839
of the interactions with this covet

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,399
emergency

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:35,360
in my opinion have been lost a bit and

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,920
so that's the message is don't be afraid

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,639
of being an expert to run a user group

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,519
but just think about creating the right

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,880
conditions

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,959
for let the group grow

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,480
from itself that concept of creating the

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,399
right conditions kind of feeds into our

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,959
next question which is from attila

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,160
who says in c plus plus we have strong

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,399
personalities very

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,480
strongly held opinions diverse attitudes

00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,160
some people are shy others outspoken

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,320
what are the tools to herd the cats and

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,399
make a smooth and friendly experience

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,760
i i don't know if it's actually true i

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,519
haven't really run any anybody in the

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,560
sequels community that had strongly held

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,199
opinions

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,639
but um if i ever do i'll be sure and let

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,800
you know

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:18,800
so um does anybody want to share any

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,800
particular insights as how we heard cats

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,440
i would love to i would love to i don't

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,360
know if hurt

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,680
is the right phrase for that but i would

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,040
love to to say that

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,199
i i on one hand i mean clearly i'm

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,560
a technical person and i really care

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,160
about the the details

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,240
and and that's probably one of the

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:44,320
reasons i'm on uh easel

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:47,760
but i really think that you just need to

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,839
to in a way you just need to lead it uh

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,560
the attitude the way you think that is

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,720
the right uh the right way to do it like

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,000
if if someone approaches you and you

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,360
talk with him

00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,240
and you're not i i would pref

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,519
i would i hope that i'm able to create

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,000
this atmosphere just by

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,720
having uh you know a personal example

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,760
and just

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:13,360
be friendly exactly

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:15,519
let's be friendly just be friendly and

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:19,440
and make sure that people aren't being

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:22,480
uh you know are being um

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:25,519
feel comfortable so

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,639
you know create atmosphere by just doing

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,759
that yourself

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,880
right set the example try to be engaging

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,480
try to be understanding of other

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,079
people's strongly head opinions those

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,120
kinds of things yeah right right

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:39,279
um so uh anchor

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,800
says well this is a cliche but i have to

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,399
ask what are some of the do's and don'ts

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,519
when operating a user group

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,880
i don't think we want to go through a

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,839
whole list because we've only got an

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,240
hour but any

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,959
high points of things that you learned

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,199
the hard way

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,880
oh that seemed like a good idea but now

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,560
i regret having done it or

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,639
watch somebody else make the mistake or

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,720
is there anything that you guys

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,079
learned that wasn't obvious but now you

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,079
realize wow that's

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,360
that's the key that's what we should be

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,600
doing any

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,639
thoughts on that well yeah if i can say

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,680
something about the

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,360
the dose the dose is uh one point is

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,000
collecting feedback all the time

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,600
uh i was discussing this with uh with a

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,959
couple of people yesterday during the

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,759
networking

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,440
it's very important to collect feedback

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,839
of your people attending the

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,880
you know the meetups or the events and

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,360
also adapt

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,720
along the way according to the feedback

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,839
when the feedback makes sense

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,959
you can also run some round tables

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,519
uh maybe with a few people from the user

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,600
group

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,800
so not from the staff but from the user

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,600
group uh

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,040
for collect new ideas and new concepts

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,079
to implement to develop

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,639
for the for the incoming event um the

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,079
the first few meetups i organized i

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,320
didn't actually collect feedback

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,079
and this was an error for me when i

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,839
started collecting feedback

00:16:54,079 --> 00:17:01,759
things really really started getting

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:05,839
better for me about formal

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,839
asking people to fill out paper

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,199
feedback is for example the surveys that

00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,000
you run at the end of each day of cppcon

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,039
so you

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,919
you reach people by email and

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:19,839
ask to fill a form uh with some

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,400
predefined questions and also with

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,520
you know free text opening questions

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,000
stuff like that also

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,199
asking feedback during the event go

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,280
through the people

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,559
speak with people i know the organizer

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,799
work is really tough

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,000
so it's it's hard during the day but

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,559
it's really important

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
and john yesterday you said something in

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,160
our discussion

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,679
that when you go through people in an

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,039
in-person event you can

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,760
realize the feeling just by chatting

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:49,600
with people that's really important

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,799
that's why for example i miss all the

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,559
talks during the

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,960
during my conferences because i have to

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:58,000
go through the the expo room i have

00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,240
to go to to reach people so

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,080
it's very tough but in my opinion it

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,799
gives you lots of

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,559
satisfactions at the end so my quick

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,400
plug is if you haven't done your surveys

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,840
please do your surveys you understand

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,280
how important they are to the

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:16,000
to the organizing the event anybody else

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,160
here i would like to add to the feedback

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,880
it's important but don't be disappointed

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,600
if it's not

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,280
as you expect it to be because you need

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,480
also to be able to take

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,559
uh feedback that is not not as nice

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,559
as you want so i've never had anything

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,840
like that but uh but i can yeah i can

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:35,039
see how you'd want to

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:39,280
approach that yes oh

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:40,840
uh uh so jim can you paste in the the

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,240
starter kit url

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,120
um in the uh in the chat channel so for

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,720
those of us

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,280
those of you who are watching this is

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,440
the url for our starter kit

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,880
and what this is is it's not really

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,799
polished but it's just a lot of

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,960
different information

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,919
about how to start a local user group

00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,840
and i think

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,360
jim's going to paste that into the uh

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,919
chat so that you can copy it rather than

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,000
having to

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:08,320
write it down um so

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
uh there's another question from john in

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,840
your user groups how many attendees

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,360
slash members are people who use people

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,880
plus professionally for their day jobs

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:19,039
versus people who use it

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,559
or are simply curious about it um

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,799
anybody have a particular insight on

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,799
that

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,720
my yeah uh we're making

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,559
uh in the beginning of our meetups we're

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,400
making a survey usually

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,640
and we're asking people uh those

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,600
questions and this is uh

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,640
uh this is changing a lot uh it could be

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,160
um

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,080
from uh 70 people that are

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,840
uh professional and doing simplest plus

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,280
in their everyday job and

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:51,039
it could be that 50 are

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,880
doing that as a side project it could

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,919
also be the the groups

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,760
aren't necessarily um

00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,120
there could be people that are in both

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,400
groups that have both

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,320
a side project and also do

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,159
something different in c plus plus in

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,559
the work place so

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,240
this is really changing even from one

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,679
meetup to another

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,280
do you mean you mean the numbers change

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,000
or you mean there's a wide variety the

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,679
numbers change

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,960
sometimes it's a lot of and there's no

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,960
particular pattern is it because of the

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,760
speaker or

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,919
i mean i i i haven't uh recognized any

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,760
particular pattern yet but uh

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,440
clearly it will have something to do

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,320
with the topic uh i would i would

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,360
imagine

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,840
but because we're also trying to engage

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,120
people

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,240
by having uh sort of a version for the

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,679
lighting talk

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,360
uh in the virtual uh

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,600
environment in both in the in the real

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:47,200
world so i think that people also come

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:50,400
just to you know shorter projects show

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,000
their uh interests and and uh neat

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,200
features that they found

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,400
so it it could really uh change also by

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,679
the

00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,880
by this whoever comes did somebody else

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,600
have their hand up does somebody else

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,640
want to make a comment uh michael yeah

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:09,520
um to me i think that it's a uh

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,280
i think our group is is quite mixed um

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,159
and there's also another group of people

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,760
who were

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,200
using c plus plus professionally and

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,799
want to get back to it

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,320
there seems to be a surprising number of

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:21,120
those

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,640
but it ties also into something i was

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,600
thinking about with the last question of

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,600
do's and don'ts

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,000
which is why surprising don't which is

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,600
don't

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,600
curate your content overly um

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,440
it's you know it's very tempting

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,240
especially at the very beginning of the

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,520
group

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,320
to to just go for you know the talks

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,240
that are

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,640
would be the most interesting cpp talks

00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,919
to you and you know cutting edge

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,039
big name speaker uh there's going to be

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,440
a meet up

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,880
every month you know you're going to be

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,679
doing this ongoing

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:58,960
just try stuff and you never know until

00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:01,440
you try it whether it's going to be

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,200
a success or not because you don't know

00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,440
what makes this day will be

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,280
of of experts and professionals and even

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,000
among professionals what you know it's a

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,600
it's it's a pretty broad community right

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,120
so just try stuff and that's how you're

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,720
going to learn about the mix of people

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,280
and engage different parts of your local

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,240
community

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,240
okay yens

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,919
i'm not hearing unions

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,720
so there's a fair share of folks coming

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,000
to user groups which

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:36,080
don't or used to use

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,640
used to work with uh cbs plus um

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,720
actually if you could put my uh i shared

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,080
a screen with you internally if you can

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,919
put that in the stream

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,840
i will show you i asked a similar

00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:49,360
question in my community story

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:52,000
and so from the community we reach

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,840
most people work in some way you will

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,840
see plus plus but at the user groups

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,240
there is a certain share

00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,400
of folks coming for the reason of having

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,000
this as an interest and or wanting to go

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,320
back into the industry

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,320
can you

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,360
but um the overall community which we

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,760
reach for cppcon and

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,960
um it's over very many people which

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,280
really

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:22,400
use cps no the desktop jens is desktop

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:24,720
sorry jim

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,679
right that's that's from my community

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,039
story

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:31,039
um and you you see like a

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:33,039
large majority is you know using it

00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,960
daily or using it often and

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,640
depends on your definition of often i

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,559
guess and then there is

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,679
of course a few people which you know

00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,559
reviews rarely or

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,840
not anymore but also there's like a

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,840
strong bias towards

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,600
taking a sip of survey i guess it's

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,799
using c bus plus so

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,200
thank you very much yeah i think i i

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,679
know

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,720
in in the local group that i've been

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,320
active in i do

00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,760
feel like a lot of times there's a lot

00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,720
of people who are really at the very

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,159
beginner

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,240
and we don't really cater well to that

00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,600
but i mean we're not going to shun

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,799
people or anything like that but i

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,480
but i do think you know we have a

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,799
typical talk about what are the new

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,000
features of c plus 20 or talk like that

00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:16,880
and the new people are like wow

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,600
uh so it so that's so this is tough but

00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,240
but you got to

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,360
find your way and part of it i think is

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,840
kind of what michael said don't over

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,919
cure it

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,440
if you've got a good talk that's coming

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,640
up and it's a little bit expert

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,080
just make sure you're describing it

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,120
properly and go ahead and let them do

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,480
that and then later on you'll have a

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,919
talk that's a little more beginner

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,200
and again there might be the experts who

00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,760
say you know i really don't need a

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,440
review

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,720
of how to do that and they won't come

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,840
but if you're honest about what the

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,400
talks are i think

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,360
variety is is key it'll build up build a

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,679
community

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,279
all right so we have another question um

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,000
could you all present some of the outer

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,919
box and highly

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,440
engaging activities you've held in your

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,520
user group so i think this is one of the

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,640
challenges of any

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,799
user group that's trying to do something

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,960
regularly which is that we don't all

00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,640
happen to have you know scott myers

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,080
isn't the local guy who can just drop by

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,120
every month and give us a

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,200
kick-ass talk um so

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,799
some of us are better off in in that

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,880
situation than others are

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,320
but we are i mean i think almost all

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,840
organizers at some point are saying oh

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,200
gosh what are we gonna do this month

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:18,000
and and so what do you

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,360
what ideas do you have other than just

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,960
let's hope there's a great speaker who

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,400
happens to show up at our doorstep

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,080
uh what can you do to um to create some

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,360
out of the box something interesting

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,279
that isn't just um

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,080
i can say something that is linked to

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:37,200
the to the next questions as well about

00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,600
having some lab sessions uh the

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,279
one of the user groups iran called

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:44,640
coding

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,159
uh it's only based on coding

00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,720
laboratories

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,080
where people basically pay program so

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,600
they work together on

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:55,840
some problems that we set and

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,880
so they actually they can use any

00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,120
language they want

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,960
so this is not primarily focusing on c

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,919
plus but obviously

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,880
many people use c plus plus but others

00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,880
learn

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,120
other programming languages so they use

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,400
other languages like python c-sharp

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,120
in javascript and it's very interesting

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,039
because

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,360
you know people are free to do whatever

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,720
they want so they can use any patterns

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,840
they want they can use functional

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,240
programming or

00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,000
object-oriented programming anything and

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,799
the problem is self-contained

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,279
is very let's say quick to do quick to

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:31,279
solve this is half an hour time

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,559
so that that's i think it's interesting

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,559
at the end of each problem we have a

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,279
retrospective so people

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:39,360
uh can come up on stage and present

00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,520
their solutions their approaches

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,799
but the session is quite small so it's

00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,120
not intimidating

00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,080
for people so it's not 100 people it's

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,279
20 people

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,600
so it's very informal it's like being

00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,799
you know with friends and so this way

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:57,120
people

00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:59,440
also can learn how to speak in public

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,240
so this is also an informal way you know

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,880
to approach

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:07,919
to open discussions and

00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:10,320
not being afraid of a rich uh

00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,679
amount of people a big amount of people

00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,600
so that's something

00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,880
interesting you can try with your own

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,400
user group seven

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,240
especially for c plus plus you can

00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,039
experiment with ranges uh

00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,600
i've blogged about some exercises in

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,960
coding.org we have tons of exercises you

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,159
can use if you want i can

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,799
send you the links and uh feel free to

00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,279
reach out

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,000
if in case you want to try something

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,880
that's one

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,399
contribution i feel too so anybody have

00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,080
any other suggestions about

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:43,279
kind of just add content um

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,720
you don't always need a stage it's like

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,480
really important when you work with a

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,840
group that sometimes just

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:52,480
people want to be on the same level um

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,080
so in the last years what i've done in

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,679
the months where i run my conference

00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,279
when you usually don't find a speaker

00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,840
and i don't want to speak it's like the

00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,600
other

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,679
side if you're an organizer you often

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,679
get to to do talks

00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,919
if there's nobody else talking then it's

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,399
still kind of doing the content

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,360
um but what i found out is like a really

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,520
great way to get

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,159
any debate started and just give folks a

00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,080
great evening to talk and to exchange

00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,360
what they know about the bus buses to

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,360
have an evening

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,640
like a book club where some people bring

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,919
their books which they

00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,840
about and you start talking like that

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,159
and this is just the beginning and then

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,880
you

00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:31,200
naturally have a group talking about

00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,200
either the books and then you get into

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,240
you you know scott meyer spoke another

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,880
certain topic

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,320
or you you get the new semantics and the

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,720
debate about that

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,840
and so it naturally moves on all evening

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,279
and

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,720
maybe also splits up into different

00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,880
groups because some people want to talk

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,559
about cute or this book and that book

00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:53,440
but that's it's a great way to

00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,760
to have some some form of content which

00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,320
uh

00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,480
speaks to a lot of folks which might not

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,399
want to just consume talks

00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,520
or which does not bring you as an

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:04,799
organizer to

00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:07,120
have a lot of organizing to do so

00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,080
um anybody else have particular ideas i

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,000
want to throw in

00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,840
if you go to the pub quit pub quiz

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,320
tonight that would be something that you

00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,399
could do

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,240
that would be extremely popular and i

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,880
also know just one other idea real quick

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,640
um

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,000
we had a we had a session where we just

00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,120
said hey uh

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,960
come with your stories about

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,799
interviewing and being interviewed and

00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,240
we just shared you know good techniques

00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,600
for doing interviewing and horror

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,520
stories about the worst interviews

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,440
you've ever had

00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,919
harold did you uh did you have something

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,440
you want to say yes just i wanted to add

00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,880
because especially when you want to

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,600
start a user group where you start a

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,679
user group

00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,720
you don't have to start with with

00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,559
conference like

00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,840
evenings with the speaker and so on it's

00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,720
totally okay just

00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,279
meet in a coffee if you meet five to ten

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,279
people

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:51,279
and you just talk then things will

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:54,399
develop so so

00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:56,799
so that's that's totally fine and then

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:58,399
you can also find ideas and

00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:04,159
possibilities

00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:07,760
in a cafe right yeah michael

00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:10,799
uh two notes one we we did do a

00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:14,000
we did a pub quiz um

00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:16,399
and i know i'm a broken record one

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,880
tricky part of the quiz is figuring out

00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:21,120
how hard to make the questions

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,440
so people are in teams our questions

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,279
ended up being a little too hard

00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,279
uh so there was a group of people who

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,640
really loved the pub quiz

00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:30,960
people who sat at the table and we're

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,720
just like

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,880
and even even the team part didn't fix

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,039
it completely because you know they

00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,760
they are silent at their table so you

00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:41,279
have to put a mix of questions too

00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,720
um the other thing is with these

00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:45,760
alternative types of programming

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,440
lightning talks show and tell pop quiz

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,640
even just to get together that harold is

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,240
mentioning you have to have a plan

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,840
uh even if your plan is to have some

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,960
unscripted time don't

00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,720
don't think that you can start the

00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,159
meeting and just how this part's just

00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,960
going to work itself out nothing will

00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,000
ever just work

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,600
itself out uh so so plan how long

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,039
plan plan what the segments are what

00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,240
things are going to do what's going to

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,760
happen if it goes well what's going to

00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,480
happen if it doesn't go well you just

00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,600
have to

00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,440
know in your mind how that's going to go

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,200
did you did you start to say something

00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,159
involved

00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,720
oh yeah i just wanted to jump in and say

00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,600
in a

00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,480
bit of a different perspective i would

00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,679
also suggest

00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:28,399
to try to

00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,840
pull more people that aren't usually in

00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:33,120
your jerusalem group

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,120
and for example we had uh we're trying

00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,399
to have more teens to

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:42,240
speak about their projects in in our

00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:45,120
uh group and uh before the pandemic we

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,640
uh our our group have met in uh

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,960
basically in a college

00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,840
and having students coming over and

00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,320
giving their

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,200
uh short talks and you'll be surprised

00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,760
how uh

00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,600
how that how continent that adds to your

00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,559
user group just by having

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,840
people with a bit of different uh people

00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,880
that aren't the usual

00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,480
uh audience okay thank you um so i think

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,000
this next question we did discuss as

00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,559
marco said he was talking about the

00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,679
lab sessions and attila actually follow

00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,799
that up with saying he's saying not

00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,880
scripted lapse where

00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,080
people do something new like hackathons

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,640
and i think that's kind of what marco

00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,919
was saying

00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,320
is giving people the opportunity to uh

00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,600
to explore problems and and and find

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,320
their own solutions and find out how

00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,240
that works

00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,080
uh so i think we've talked about that uh

00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,320
the next question is not a question

00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,600
i think it's uh a friend of michael's

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,320
who's saying could use

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,720
kudos to michael he used the online

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,799
thing to hold joint toronto montreal

00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,600
ottawa vancouver user group meetings

00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,320
so this is a uh you know canada's a

00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,120
country

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,679
a big country with a lot of time zones

00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,840
and

00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,200
uh so you want to mention a little bit

00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,120
about uh

00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,399
what you've done there and how how

00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:55,200
successful that is and

00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:56,559
is that a model for other organizations

00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,679
yeah i think it should be

00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:01,360
um it's been incredibly it's been a lot

00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,760
of fun it's been really successful for

00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,120
us

00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,919
um i think i think we might have had one

00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,240
or

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:10,640
maybe just two online sessions that were

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,360
just toronto and uh

00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,080
i knew montreal had a ug so i reached

00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,960
out to them

00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:19,120
and and then priya started a vancouver

00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,679
ug so we reached out to him

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,399
um so we started having joint online

00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,600
events

00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:26,240
um and we each each post an event on our

00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,320
meetup

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,799
to correspond because on meetup you have

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:34,159
to be a member of the group to join

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:36,080
so uh and we were just collaborating

00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,880
that way it's been absolutely fantastic

00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,480
um since then ottawa uh resurrected

00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,799
their community and joined in on them

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,840
and

00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,480
edmonton started a new user group uh so

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,480
now

00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,960
we're running pretty much monthly events

00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,000
with uh with the five canadian groups

00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,000
and

00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,760
i think time zones do come in for

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,720
edmonton and vancouver you know those

00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,720
people have to

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,200
have to take time out of their day

00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,360
because we usually are doing it uh

00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,720
you know the biggest the biggest three

00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,960
groups are uh

00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,080
are in the east coast so so we schedule

00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,399
it at 6 30

00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,800
and uh so it's a bit earlier for the

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:12,399
vancouver but people still come

00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,000
well if people are working at home

00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:16,000
usually that's not as big a deal

00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,760
if they were if they were commuting home

00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,520
it's harder for them to uh

00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,879
we really don't encourage people to

00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,320
drive and uh

00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,159
and go to use group meetings at the same

00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,839
time you should drive to your user group

00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:29,520
meeting when that's possible but

00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:32,320
anyway totally agree yeah

00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,520
okay um and i will say what we did in

00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,879
the bay area because we did

00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,079
we also had kind of you know there's

00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:37,440
something going on the south bay

00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,960
something going on in the city

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,879
and what we actually did was we combined

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,720
them as a single meetup group

00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:45,040
so the meetup.com you know about all the

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,879
because

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,240
it's basically now of course we haven't

00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,919
really done much literally in months

00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,919
because of covet but

00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:53,280
but when we were when we were actively

00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:55,760
meeting

00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,200
essentially the the different groups

00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,640
were pretty much independent in other

00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,680
words the san francisco group was doing

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,880
its own programming and they were

00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,720
meeting once a month

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,320
but it went to the same meetup so if you

00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,640
were in the bay area anywhere you would

00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,920
see

00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,440
all the meetups and you might just

00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,800
decide well i'm not i'm not going to

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,160
drive into the city

00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,920
but if there was a pretty good speaker

00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,320
then i would and so it

00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,040
it really helped out a lot and it made

00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,720
it

00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,079
you know it feels more like one group

00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,520
even though as i said it's really kind

00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,040
of run as if they're

00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,880
independent groups there's someone who's

00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,560
in charge of lining up speakers for that

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,240
session and talking to the host and

00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,280
doing all that kind of stuff and it

00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,920
makes it easier

00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,400
but for a population as large as the bay

00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,000
area

00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,000
it does actually make sense to have

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,200
essentially what we're almost weekly

00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,560
meetings

00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,720
but we just didn't have everybody going

00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:41,359
to all of them but anyway

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,160
um so have any of you considered whether

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,320
remo

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,599
can help improve the online version of

00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,880
your local meetings

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:51,119
compared to zoom google hangouts etc

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,960
so yeah let's talk a little bit about

00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,240
what we're doing online now what kind of

00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,640
software you're using how is this

00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,240
working how is this different

00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,920
one of the things a comment i was making

00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,920
earlier to someone else was

00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,119
i was i was kind of wondering if over

00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,880
time what we're going to see right now

00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,160
user groups are local because you get

00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,280
together it's easier local but if you're

00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,200
doing it online

00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,880
i was wondering if we would see local

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,560
user groups instead of being about

00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,599
geography but instead being an interest

00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,359
in other words

00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:17,359
a game developer group or a science

00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:19,119
group or a financial group or

00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:21,359
you know that kind of thing i don't

00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:24,160
think that's really happened yet

00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:26,000
but maybe as jen said it'll be next year

00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,839
before we really see the effects of

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,359
kobet but if we have lots of online

00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,040
groups i think we're going to be more

00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:32,240
likely to be

00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,640
you know might have just a beginner

00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,079
group where we just focus on getting

00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,480
people up to where they go to some other

00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,920
group

00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,280
right but uh anybody want to talk about

00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,720
the software you're using and how that's

00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,839
worked and

00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:48,160
what's good and what's not good and

00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:50,640
well i can i can share my i'm sorry ends

00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,560
if you want to go ahead yeah

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,160
i'd like to share my experience with the

00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,110
italian simplest press conference

00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,440
a few months ago

00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:59,599
[Music]

00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,040
for the talks i think we we opted all

00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:04,079
for the same solution

00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:06,800
we used stream yard and youtube

00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,079
as i basically discussed this with the

00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,720
ants and feel nash

00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,480
and they recommended also to use

00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:15,520
streamyard so we tried it

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:18,640
and we bought two licensees

00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:22,880
to overcome the limits of the free

00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:25,920
the free edition and it worked well uh

00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,760
what's what's missing uh is the you know

00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,280
the interaction with people we only use

00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,680
the live chat

00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,800
it was okay but can be better for the

00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,599
networking

00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,079
at the time we used discord so we had a

00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,960
discord

00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:40,160
server with several rooms and several

00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,079
you know channels

00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,599
a channel for each sponsor a channel for

00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,760
each community and

00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,040
stuff like that it didn't work so well

00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,040
actually i mean

00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,079
we had not so much interaction i think

00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,800
remo is is

00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,160
much better is also the structure and

00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,839
the integration everything is

00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:59,920
is here in remo so uh you actually

00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,359
don't need to leave the platform and you

00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,920
don't have to jump out

00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:05,280
to go to youtube and i mean i'm

00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,160
attending the conference this way i

00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,800
think it works

00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:11,599
very very nice the only problem i think

00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,720
is is a bit of expensive so

00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,119
we are discussing with also other people

00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,520
to

00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,720
join let's say together and have a

00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,920
common license

00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:24,079
we dropped an email to herb sarer

00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,560
for for the license for because we run

00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:29,280
free events so our events are all free

00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,920
so you know we don't we don't have a

00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,040
ticket

00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:35,040
price so we can we can have uh

00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,440
maybe a license for all these kind of

00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:40,160
things free events

00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,040
and so yeah i've been streaming even

00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,400
meetups

00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:47,520
since 2018 so i was kind of prepared

00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:51,839
to to switch totally online

00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:54,240
i was using hangout and and youtube so

00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:56,400
basically we live stream the hangout

00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,960
call with the speaker

00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,520
by using obs now we are using streamyard

00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,280
because it's much simpler

00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,280
but obviously we missed the networking

00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,320
part for the local meters and

00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,440
what i'm thinking about is organizing a

00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,200
dinner some

00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,520
sometimes let's say every two months if

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,520
it's visible it depends on the

00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,880
also on on the curve of you know of

00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,040
contagious so

00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,400
that's it but anyway i think remo is

00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,560
fantastic i think is

00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,000
uh is wonderful yeah just just to

00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,640
clarify um

00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,280
if if you're interested in using remo

00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,440
for your

00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,359
event whether it's just a local meeting

00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,200
or if you actually want to do

00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:34,240
a conference uh you know whether a

00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,200
day-long conference or a longer

00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,280
conference

00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,480
uh contact phil because he's the one

00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,240
that's kind of coordinated but

00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:45,359
but the um the foundation

00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:47,280
is going to keep a remo license that

00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,480
if you aren't charging we're essentially

00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,960
going to let you use that if it's for a

00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,960
free

00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,800
plus event we will let you use that and

00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,880
if you are charging then we'll

00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,480
we'll expect you to pay in some way but

00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:00,160
but you talked to phil about that

00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,560
and filled nash yeah i don't and we can

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,880
um

00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:08,000
we can work that out yeah yes thanks so

00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:10,079
just like john phil

00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,319
i did my research on platforms so the

00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,560
biggest problem we have with the online

00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:19,200
platforms is that most of them are built

00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:22,160
for lead generation and marketing and

00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,119
they are quite expensive and prohibitive

00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,440
and they are not

00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,480
built like raymo around having a

00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,720
conversation

00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,200
and having those little video chat rooms

00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:33,760
these tables which we sit on

00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,560
um remo is not perfect but it's the best

00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,400
solution

00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,000
um i found another platform which is

00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,480
close to it and maybe one

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,119
could talk to them that they get the

00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,880
other

00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,560
part of the features which we would need

00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,280
in that platform

00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,480
um then the only problem is that they

00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,000
charge by time

00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:54,720
and attendee so for every attendee you

00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,920
pay a setup cost and you pay an hourly

00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,880
cost

00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,000
and um that is you know in the situation

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,880
we can

00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,800
host conferences in such a setting but

00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,520
we are not able to host and bring the

00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:10,640
community into user groups and

00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:13,359
um the other point why why i

00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,040
decided to kind of do the concept of

00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:18,240
music sports online is

00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:21,280
just to give the community a chance to

00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:23,920
get used to the platform and

00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,760
um even if you would have alternatives

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,319
uh i think that like

00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,920
being on one platform has its advantages

00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,720
so that you need one account

00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,680
once and cannot join other events if you

00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,760
attended

00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,880
cp con you can also go to other

00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,000
conferences or

00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:42,000
attend other user groups and not need to

00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,440
to learn every time a new platform which

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,240
is

00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,440
being used for this and on the other

00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,640
hand

00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,000
yeah we have to see if rainbow stays

00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,880
around for this

00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
i think it's like first license is like

00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,480
one year

00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,280
so we'll see some movement in the whole

00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,520
market of

00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,599
uh and i guess there's enough software

00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,880
software developers listening

00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:08,400
a web-based platform where you can have

00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:12,000
video chat rooms

00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,520
and uh some way to navigate between them

00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,560
in a nice form

00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:18,640
easy to to host and easy to to use

00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,000
as something which we would definitely

00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:22,640
uh probably like

00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,079
using for the rest of the decade and

00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:28,000
there definitely is some funding

00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:29,440
through the conferences uh for this so

00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,920
for the moment it's remo but it doesn't

00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:34,960
have to stay real that's what i

00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,640
basically say but for for now remo is

00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,839
really is really good and you have to

00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:44,240
beat uh remo

00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:49,119
that's that's hard to do in my opinion

00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:49,119
um so we may have uh

00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:57,119
um so jim roper is letting us know that

00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,160
he and phil have been uh been working on

00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:00,400
an idea

00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,920
to kind of build out their own platform

00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,599
and jim is the

00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,280
technical magician that's that's working

00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,760
behind the scenes to make sure all the

00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,839
the stream yard and remo streams are

00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:13,040
working for us here at the conference so

00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:14,240
i'm i know this is news to me i knew

00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,000
that jim and phil were working on this

00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,920
and i'm i'm very much looking forward to

00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,319
seeing where this ends up because they

00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,920
are definitely the people who understand

00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:24,319
both the technology and the demands of

00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,720
somebody running a conference so

00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:28,000
it sounds like it would be really cool

00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,280
in the meantime of course

00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,599
um we we uh

00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,200
are looking at you know the the existing

00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,720
online solutions does anybody else want

00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,920
to talk about

00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:42,640
uh success or lack of success that

00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,640
they've had with things

00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:47,680
well when it comes to to online i can

00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:50,079
say we decided to do not something or i

00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,920
decided to do not something

00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:54,240
because i didn't know which platform to

00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:57,280
use and i had no motivation to

00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:59,119
to learn all this stuff so what i

00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,200
actually did was forwarding the

00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,160
people to existing events from others

00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,319
because

00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,720
today you can join events all around the

00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:10,000
world basically

00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:12,160
which is which is good and

00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,440
but there will never be a full

00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:16,400
replacement

00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,839
for physical events also so there are

00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,560
there are people that see

00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:21,280
online stuff strictly as a asynchronous

00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,800
task

00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,960
they do it whenever they want they want

00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:28,079
to break they want to curve

00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,520
back and forth in in talks

00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,680
and on the other hand there are people

00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,200
that will never go to

00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,119
to to a location they don't know to

00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,200
people they don't know

00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:39,520
so it will be interesting how this this

00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:41,839
will develop in the future

00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:43,119
and maybe some kind of future will be

00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:46,240
streaming the

00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:49,119
the talks or the sessions

00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:50,079
out in some way but it's it's i don't

00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,280
know how to include

00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:57,359
people into discussion and then make the

00:44:53,280 --> 00:45:00,079
the physical feeling available

00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:01,200
so i will i will share my my personal

00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:02,640
point of view here

00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,040
this has been an extremely difficult

00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:08,240
year for me trying to figure out

00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:10,079
i love the the in-person conference this

00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,240
is something that i've

00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,760
worked an awful lot at and i've seen

00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,040
head nods on the panel i think we all

00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,640
believe in

00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,160
in getting people together in the same

00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,800
room there's magic that happens there

00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,440
you know it's

00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,839
the the the magic of the conference as

00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,839
i've said

00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:25,520
many times it's not just the content i

00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:27,359
mean that's an important part

00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,200
it's a it's a bit of a gravity that

00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:30,640
pulls people together but the real value

00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,000
of the conference is the discussions

00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,240
with the people there

00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,680
and they're not always planned and

00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,119
always laid out saying oh

00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,359
you know what i really want to talk to

00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:41,040
marco about this particular topic

00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:42,400
and i'm going to grab him for what no

00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,839
it's the accidental thing

00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,440
of who you have to be sitting at the

00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:46,160
table with who you happen to go to

00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,680
dinner with

00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:50,160
who you have to be standing next to in

00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:53,119
the break line those are

00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,760
those are just magical things that

00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:55,040
that's what's

00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,800
the thing in the conference it's hard to

00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,240
tell people that you have to have

00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,480
experienced it a few times you can't

00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,599
market it that way you can't say

00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,400
you want to come to this conference

00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,520
because you're going to stand in the

00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,720
line

00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,640
and you're going to run into somebody

00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,240
who whose name you don't know who don't

00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,280
have particularly great credentials but

00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,640
you're going to realize they have

00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,839
incredible insights that are

00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,400
going to make a difference in the way

00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:15,440
you write code that's hard to tell

00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,720
people that that's the magic of the

00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,640
conference but

00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,079
but on the other hand people will tell

00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,520
you that you know i went to this

00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,640
conference and i met these people and it

00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,880
was like wow

00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:27,119
and i'm excited about that and so that's

00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:30,079
what we all want to get back to that

00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:31,359
but i would say that as painful as this

00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:33,280
year has been

00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:35,040
putting together this conference has

00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,040
made me think more about

00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,720
what exactly is a conference for why do

00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,240
we do this what's the value of it how do

00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:43,520
we capture that value

00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:45,200
in a way that that if we can't be face

00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,319
to face we can still have the value can

00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,480
still create that

00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:49,680
thing i'd like to think we've had some

00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,800
success at that

00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:54,400
but i think we can do better and what's

00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:58,079
opened my eyes about it is

00:46:54,400 --> 00:47:01,040
that i think that that can be part of

00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:02,720
um an experience that is based on and

00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,680
focused on when we get back together we

00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,000
can do things

00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,800
face to face but having a dimension that

00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,720
says well

00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,640
there are people who will never be able

00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:12,319
to travel for whatever reason

00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:14,160
and they want to participate too they're

00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:14,960
part of our community they might be

00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,800
presenters

00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,240
but they certainly can also be

00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:22,000
contributing in other ways

00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:23,440
and how do we create an event that

00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,079
takes advantage of everything you can do

00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,839
in the face-to-face world but also

00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:29,599
has a dimension where people who aren't

00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,720
face-to-face can also participate and

00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:33,200
contribute

00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:34,319
and i don't know the full answer to that

00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,680
but i know that it's worth

00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:38,240
figuring out what the answer is and

00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:40,319
that's what i'm that's the path i've set

00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:42,480
for myself is to figure this out

00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,920
um that doesn't mean i'm not you know

00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,440
praying for the day when we

00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,599
return to normal again as quickly as

00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:49,520
possible and can meet but it's going to

00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:51,760
change the way i think about

00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,359
user group events and and conferences

00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,480
forever that there

00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:58,400
there can and should be a dimension um

00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,920
that that is not at the physical space

00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,040
now that may be as they say that may be

00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,839
the gravity that pulls everybody

00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,640
together

00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:05,119
because everybody wants to see and hear

00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,040
you know

00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,400
the big-name speakers and the

00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,960
not-so-big-name speakers because they

00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,079
know that

00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,680
that there's a lot there but what

00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:15,280
happens is

00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,640
the what you want what you really want

00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,640
is you want to talk to the other people

00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,240
who are excited about those same talks

00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,839
that's what you really want you want to

00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:24,319
be with the people who

00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:26,559
who are attracted to the same thing and

00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:28,880
i think that we need to figure out

00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:30,079
and we we have already some and i think

00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,640
we can do much better and i think

00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:33,760
part of that is is that the software's

00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:37,200
got to improve we've got to figure out

00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:37,200
how to use it better yeah yens

00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:43,599
did you want to say something yet i'm

00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,599
not hearing you

00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,240
get around myself welcome to the virtual

00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:51,280
world

00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:54,000
um i i will have run

00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,040
run a virtual event this year which is

00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,079
also

00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:59,200
a local event so i'm going hybrid this

00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:02,000
year

00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,520
um but i've come to the conclusion for

00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,200
myself that i

00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:09,440
don't want to do this as a new normal

00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,040
to offer like a live stream from a

00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,839
conference or something

00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,559
uh for the reason that the av setup for

00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:16,960
this is

00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:19,760
kind of expensive and if i already see

00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:22,960
people complaining about prices

00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:26,240
there's no way to justify

00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:29,280
those prices and i would have

00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:32,319
like a thousand tickets or more

00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:35,440
being sold to

00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:39,359
to recoup the costs for that i think

00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:42,319
that online events offer a certain

00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:43,040
opportunity and we still are at the

00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:44,960
beginning and

00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:47,359
finding out which formats are working

00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:50,079
and maybe it's not only talks

00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:51,200
and i think for for me superspas i have

00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,880
decided that i'm

00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:55,760
going to split this we're going to have

00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:57,599
the online conference which is one day

00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,520
first time next week and then we're

00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:01,839
going to have also an online version of

00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:04,079
this year's meetings plus conference

00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:06,240
because it's 2020 and likely next year

00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:10,079
we'll just have a normal conference

00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:13,200
because i don't want to run

00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:15,440
a show locally and have in parallel

00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:17,040
some some other show on the internet

00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,760
where we have to wash up that

00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:21,839
the lines are staying online and the

00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,599
stream is online and the sound and all

00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:25,839
that

00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:27,440
because if you want to do that

00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:30,640
underneath quality

00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:32,319
um coming from a conference it has to

00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,960
come through cameras it has to come

00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:35,280
through mix

00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:38,720
and all the technique behind it and that

00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,720
has to be professional that's very

00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:44,400
expensive

00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:45,680
uh yeah i i just wanted to add uh like

00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,119
the optimistic view

00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:52,240
and to say two things one is that

00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:55,040
i clearly uh this pandemic

00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,680
uh is something uh worldwide and

00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,720
therefore

00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:01,280
i expect us to have uh solutions

00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,480
uh in the near future i mean i what i'm

00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,720
saying is that not only c

00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,720
people's conferences are uh you know

00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:09,119
dealing with these issues so i'm sure

00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:11,680
there's going to be a lot of

00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:12,800
new platforms and i'm hoping that

00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:15,359
they'll be able to

00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,800
combine the good of remo and other

00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:18,880
platforms as well

00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,400
and the second thing i wanted to say is

00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,680
that we do have this debate

00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:27,200
regarding the localized versus virtual

00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:27,520
and in our among us the the organizers

00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,720
of

00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:34,000
core cpp regarding the conference and

00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:36,800
me personally i i actually uh

00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,760
want to take the other side and say that

00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:41,040
i think it's

00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:44,400
i would love to have uh the virtual

00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:47,520
part uh also exists in the

00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,000
following years because i think one

00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,400
thing

00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,440
is that it it makes the conference much

00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,559
more inclusive

00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:56,640
and for people that for example

00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:57,920
i'm from israel and of course cppcon is

00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,960
in usa and

00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:03,680
just to arrive for people uh

00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,000
that you want to join it's a thousand

00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,680
dollar

00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,119
just for the flight and additions for

00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,040
the hotels etc

00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:10,480
and i'm actually thinking about people

00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:13,680
like students that

00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,319
doesn't that not necessarily uh already

00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:17,119
working

00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:18,960
in the industry and and and that's why

00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:22,000
it's very important to me to actually

00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:25,520
do have i mean i would hope that

00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,400
um in general us as a society would be

00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:29,440
able to

00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:32,640
have uh more inclusiveness in the

00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:35,839
in like to eliminate

00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:39,040
the the the location uh factor

00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:39,839
from from this uh this limitation and of

00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:43,920
course i mean

00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:47,760
um i'm i am acknowledging the

00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:49,760
uh like the localized uh

00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,280
the ability to talk with people and it's

00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:54,000
it's really uh

00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,520
something that is irreplaceable but i

00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,160
would love to see that there is

00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,800
some kind of a way to combine those i

00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,040
mean i'm

00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,839
i'm thinking about it as well for our

00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,480
conference and

00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:05,920
in general i would love to see that in

00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,720
the following years we'll be able to

00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,599
have

00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,480
um you know uh students from india that

00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:13,520
otherwise would

00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:16,640
never be able to come to israel joining

00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:18,640
or either

00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:20,480
yeah one of one of the things that we've

00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:21,359
definitely noticed about this year is

00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,920
that

00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:25,760
the percent of attendees that are

00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:29,440
students is way higher

00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:31,359
and of course the the student pricing is

00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,119
is really discounted compared to others

00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:36,000
in in both scenarios

00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:37,119
whether we're on site or uh whether

00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,040
we're online

00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:40,880
and in fact maybe even more discounted

00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,559
for the on-site but the problem is that

00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,400
the real expenses

00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:45,920
uh even if you didn't pay for the

00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,280
conference at all the real expenses are

00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:49,839
getting there and staying there

00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,599
and that's just you know unless you let

00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:52,000
you happen to live in the denver area

00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:55,040
that's

00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,720
that's not necessarily inexpensive um

00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:58,480
and it also there's also another

00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:00,480
dimension of that and gabriel's putting

00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:02,319
this up he's saying one of my concerns

00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:04,160
with a hybrid event is the reduced

00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:04,800
physical attendance for the sake of cost

00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,040
savings

00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,880
the benefits of being physically present

00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,720
or not clear to every manager

00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,720
and i think there may be an issue with

00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,720
that where you're cannibalizing

00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,000
your own attendance if you make the

00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,200
virtual

00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,720
too attractive and part of the

00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,000
attractive is just it just happens to be

00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,680
less expensive because there is no

00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,280
travel there's no staying at a hotel

00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,720
all those kinds of things so that's

00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,240
something that maybe local user groups

00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,760
don't have to think too much about but

00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,440
because generally speaking they're not

00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,839
they're not doing any revenue

00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:33,280
associated with it anyway but for a

00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:36,839
conference that's something we

00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:38,880
really have to think about is how do we

00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:40,400
um

00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,240
how do we make it pay and and i think

00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,640
what jens is alluding to is there was

00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,559
some

00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:46,000
there was a whole thread on reddit which

00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:48,319
raised my blood pressure a lot

00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,760
because you know fortunately i forced

00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:52,559
myself to not respond

00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:54,240
um but uh but there's all these experts

00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:55,920
on how to run a conference just ask them

00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,359
they were they know exactly how to burn

00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,079
a conference and how much it should cost

00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:59,920
people

00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:01,280
and uh i think maybe they know a little

00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,559
bit less about running an online

00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,200
conference than niens does but they

00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:04,400
don't seem

00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,559
but they don't seem to think that they

00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:10,319
know exactly what it should cost

00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:11,119
um but but that's uh your point is uh

00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:13,280
it's very true

00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:14,720
yeah i agree i mean i would love to find

00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,640
a solution that could

00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:18,400
uh that could have the better of both

00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:21,839
worlds and i'm i'm thinking about it

00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,839
so yeah that's an issue

00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:26,160
well from a technical point of view this

00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,960
is actually very interesting because we

00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:30,079
will see what

00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:33,040
technologies like argument reality and

00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:34,400
virtual reality will contribute to this

00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,839
problem

00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,599
and then there are also already

00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:38,240
situations where children cannot attend

00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:40,160
the school

00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,359
so they have a little robot with a

00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:43,119
display

00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:44,720
which shows their face and they can move

00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:47,200
around with this so maybe we need to

00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:50,960
extend this idea a little bit

00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:53,040
so yeah so um

00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,079
gabriel's pointing out is john has also

00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,920
made it clear that conferences like

00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:57,440
cppcon are already extremely inclusive

00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,920
by posting all the videos for free on

00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,280
youtube

00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,200
making them globally available to

00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:03,290
everyone and of course

00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,480
this is this is

00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:06,880
[Music]

00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,760
cppcon unlike some of the other

00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,799
conferences

00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:12,480
is run by an organization that that that

00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:15,760
has a mission to

00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:17,280
evangelize quality quality c plus plus

00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,720
of course we run just like all the other

00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,000
conferences in this in the practical

00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,720
sense and we're doing the same thing

00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,160
they're doing

00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,760
they're giving their videos away free we

00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,880
are giving their videos away free and

00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,960
part of the reason is there's two

00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:29,200
reasons to give video was away free

00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:30,160
the foundations you know wants to

00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:33,680
evangelize good c

00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:35,200
plus plus uh but we also know

00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:37,440
i i'm pretty sure i don't know how to

00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:39,520
measure it but the best advertising for

00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:42,160
getting people to come to cppcon

00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,960
is showing them the videos and letting

00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,880
them realize

00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:47,040
this is what goes on at the conference

00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:49,920
this is what you want to be part of

00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:51,839
so even if we even if that wasn't our

00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:54,400
goal to evangelize quality c

00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:55,680
plus it's probably the smart thing to do

00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,920
to give the videos away

00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,200
um i think there might be something even

00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,799
more compelling

00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,799
to get people to come to the conference

00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:04,799
and that is let them do it at a virtual

00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:06,640
in other words if you're there and

00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:08,319
you're realizing wow there's all these

00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:11,359
really cool attendees that i

00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:13,200
kind of get to talk to on remo but

00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:14,880
wouldn't it be so cool if i could do

00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:16,319
this without talking into a microphone

00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,079
if it were just right there right

00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:19,520
so i think maybe the best ad is not

00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,760
going to be the videos anymore the best

00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,799
ad

00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,079
is going to be to get somebody to come

00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:23,200
to the virtual conference and then make

00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:25,200
them realize

00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,559
yeah it's kind of expensive to go to the

00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,559
conference and stay there

00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:29,680
but it very likely is going to be

00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:31,760
worthwhile

00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:33,599
we don't know that yet i mean this is

00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,400
all new to everybody but but i kind of

00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:36,079
think that

00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,760
and maybe i'm being overly optimistic

00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:39,200
and maybe what will happen is if we drew

00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,559
a hybrid conference

00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,240
nobody will show up because everybody

00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:43,200
says look how much money i can save if i

00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:46,960
just do it

00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:51,920
uh tell a community um we'll find out

00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:51,920
well next year

00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:59,440
so there's there's the other side

00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:02,240
uh companies are looking for c plus plus

00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:05,839
typical percentage highly sought for

00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:08,000
and i know that a lot of my attendees

00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:09,040
are coming to the conference either for

00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,799
their team

00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:15,200
and to make the contacts and to to just

00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:16,559
see certain talks but on the other hand

00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:20,000
i think it's also kind of

00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:22,400
um a way of that a company

00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,400
is you know giving something extra to

00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:26,240
you that you travel to burden or to

00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,160
denver and then maybe

00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:29,520
i know a lot of people con contin

00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:33,200
continuing their stay

00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:36,720
after berlin or after uh cppcon

00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:38,799
uh was a holiday so um

00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,079
and yeah being being physically at the

00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:43,520
conference has

00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:45,680
definitely an advantage and i i do think

00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:49,359
that physical conferences will continue

00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:50,000
but um as a conference organizer what i

00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:52,000
have to plan

00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,839
now for next year is like how big is the

00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,640
conference next year and i don't think

00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:57,920
it's going to be as

00:58:54,640 --> 00:59:01,280
big as the recent years

00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:03,200
and that's where i see for

00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,799
probably many of us the biggest problem

00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:07,119
that we have contracts

00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:08,720
and we now need to renegotiate those

00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:11,599
contracts as long as we can

00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,559
before that is locked in and otherwise

00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:15,119
uh

00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:17,040
all those organizations which are you

00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:18,000
know organizing those conferences could

00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:20,240
be in trouble next

00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,760
year for paying and contracts or bound

00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:26,079
to contracts that

00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:29,359
are not feasible for

00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:31,040
being exercised in their legality this

00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:32,880
is this is my nightmare

00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:34,799
we know that we can run a successful

00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:36,000
on-site conference in normal times we've

00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:38,480
done that we know

00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:41,280
that we can run a successful online

00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:44,319
conference we're doing that right now

00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:47,760
what terrifies me is what happens if

00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:49,599
the pandemic is partially dealt with and

00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,960
we have a contract with the hotel they

00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:51,599
let us out of it this year because of

00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,359
this

00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:54,640
but next year they might say look we're

00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:55,599
starting to get back on our feet you

00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,200
need to have the

00:59:55,599 --> 01:00:00,000
the on-site and then we end up in a

00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:02,079
situation where instead of getting the

01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
thousand plus attendees that we expect

01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:06,720
what if we only get a few

01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,079
hundred and suddenly we have you know as

01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:09,520
i say we have expenses that we have

01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:11,280
commitments with the hotel

01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:12,640
in terms of how many rooms and all these

01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:14,400
kinds of things um

01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:15,520
this could be devastating for us of

01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,480
course we're going to move forward we're

01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:18,240
not going to let that

01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:20,160
paralyze us but that's my nightmare is

01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:21,839
that we you know

01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:23,599
we can live in a pandemic we certainly

01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:24,240
can live without a pandemic what happens

01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:25,920
in the

01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:27,280
we're just recovering from a pandemic

01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,880
kind of situation

01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,880
and who knows what the timing on that's

01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:33,040
going to be so speaking of timing

01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:35,119
we're kind of out i will quickly touch

01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:37,599
on there was a question about

01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:39,280
maybe combining different languages to

01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:41,920
maybe have some kind of

01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,720
mega conference but i my my personal

01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:44,240
opinion is that c

01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:46,000
plus is deep enough that we don't need

01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:49,200
to throw in other languages to make

01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:51,920
to fill an entire week's conference um

01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:52,319
so uh that's not not what i want to go

01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,319
to

01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:56,000
uh and uh gabriel is saying what's the

01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:57,599
best advice to someone

01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,359
who wants to create a user group or

01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:59,680
someone who wants to volunteer to help

01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:01,680
an

01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:03,040
existing group if you're wanting to help

01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:04,640
an existing group

01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:06,720
there's nobody's going to say no to that

01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,839
contact contact whoever the leaders are

01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:09,440
of the existing group

01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:11,839
there is a way of contacting them nobody

01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:13,920
hides their email um

01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:16,000
and uh and if you want to start your own

01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,599
then the starter kit is great and jim

01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,640
wants to paste in that url to the

01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:20,240
starter kit again

01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:22,720
in the chat channel that would be

01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:24,319
absolutely terrific we are out of time i

01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:26,400
want to thank the panel

01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:27,599
uh not just for being on the panel but

01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:30,160
for doing what you're doing

01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:31,920
in the community because uh this has

01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:33,680
been a really tough year and for those

01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:36,640
of us that have stuck with it

01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:38,799
uh you know we'll see the other side and

01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:40,640
we'll be stronger for it but it's uh but

01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:43,119
unfortunately i think it's going to get

01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:44,480
uh harder before it gets easier so thank
