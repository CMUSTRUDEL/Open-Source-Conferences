Forget factories, singletons, and proxies; What are the real patterns in software development? This talk explores abstract mathematical structures that commonly recur in software development. Once a mind is trained to recognize these patterns, it becomes easy to identify the fundamental operations for domain specific classes and how to put the pieces together. This discussion is for those who enjoy math, abstract concepts, and expanding their minds.
