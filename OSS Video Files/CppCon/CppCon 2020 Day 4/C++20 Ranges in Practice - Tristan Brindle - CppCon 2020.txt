Among the many new additions to C++20 are Ranges, a modern revision of the STL offering updated algorithms and new “views” with lazy evaluation.

In this example-based talk we’ll work through several practical demonstrations of how the new Ranges functionality may be used to solve everyday problems concisely, elegantly and efficiently. In addition, we’ll offer tips on how to avoid common errors in your Ranges code, and demonstrate a couple of useful utility functions which you can drop into your codebase today.
