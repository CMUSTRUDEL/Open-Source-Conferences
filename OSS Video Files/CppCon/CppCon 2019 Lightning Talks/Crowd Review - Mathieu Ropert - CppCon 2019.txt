	00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,940
so yesterday I was a bit tired and I

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,309
tried to make a like inter without any

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,760
code so I kind of want to get that back

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:16,770
now

00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,540
so I proposed me to code with you as a

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,790
crowd so I'm gonna show you some code

00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,500
and if any of you thinks this should not

00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,550
pass code review just raise your hand

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,820
don't worry I have like three or four

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,310
examples all right let's review some C++

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,140
here is a task write a function that

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:35,330
takes an arbitrary number of integers

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,330
and print them here's the code

00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:43,670
alright I guess

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:46,890
No okay well I'll try something else

00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,629
read a word from the console input

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:55,829
copy it in another buffer and then print

00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:58,800
it how about this it's like she don't

00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:02,160
like my code guys okay let's try another

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,289
one okay you make a 2d pawn class just a

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,750
simple point with like x and y and then

00:01:04,289 --> 00:01:09,210
you also provide a way to compare it to

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:19,049
another point to see if a match here is

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:20,189
my here is my submission okay I just

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:23,400
okay when you finish reading you're

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:24,860
already in your head okay alright maybe

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,360
it's because I'm not using more than C++

00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,369
let's let's try to do something generic

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,860
let's write a function that takes any

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:33,360
arithmetic value as an argument and then

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,470
you double it huge and twice the value

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:40,920
okay generate code perfectly Mona

00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:41,189
in fact it's so modern that is anyone

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,939
okay

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:50,909
yeah it doesn't compile right no no yeah

00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:53,040
nah okay so that's not great right

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,320
are you starting to doubt my coding

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,990
skills because I have good news and bad

00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,149
news the good news is I didn't make that

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,380
the other good news is that the person

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:04,140
who made that is not actually writing

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:07,710
software the bad news is is teaching

00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,780
software because everything comes from

00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:12,690
this book holder my ownership is bliss

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:16,440
which is the best-selling book in France

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:19,470
on Amazon about C++ the guy who made it

00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,180
is as its ninth edition he's claiming to

00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,670
work for the CNRS the Nash

00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,069
Center for scientific research he says

00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:28,709
that his is sold over his carrier 300 to

00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:31,890
500 K books and the front page

00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:33,810
explicitly say cover C++ 11 14 and 17 I

00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,459
mean it's the ninth edition right let's

00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,159
take a look let's have a look at the

00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:42,060
index chapter 8 C style arrays and

00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:45,239
pointers chapter 9 C sty strings string

00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:48,120
copy swing cat chapter 25 oh we got the

00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:50,819
HTML we can a vector thank you stack

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,680
please great Oh map said oh we're Cl now

00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:55,680
we're modern Oh finally algorithm

00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,319
strings oh wow chapter 28 for Strings

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:03,000
so far we've been using C great stuff oh

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:09,930
and an XP o - pointer wait I'm not done

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,489
an X I C++ 11 14 and 17 yeah okay what's

00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:13,379
the problem there is no mention of rye

00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:14,609
there's no mention of value semantics

00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:15,989
there is new and sometimes there is

00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:19,049
deletes in the examples but not always

00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:22,709
and anything from 2003 onwards is

00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:24,180
basically in the annex section all right

00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:26,340
let's look at more code quickly because

00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,639
I only have two minutes does it looks

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:33,510
familiar it's kind of the same point but

00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:35,310
you know in the forbidden language you

00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,979
know why because it's from this book

00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:40,290
that he also wrote wait there is also

00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:43,349
one in C and in super Pascal and in

00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:45,599
Fortran and in general object-oriented

00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:49,489
programming that is both C C++ C sharp -

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:51,629
Java in PHP in the same book great deal

00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:54,079
actually the big biggest problem is that

00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:55,919
the first book I mentioned as 15

00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:58,199
recommendation and it's not even that

00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,699
bad I mean you don't read French but

00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:01,169
this guy is like it's an excellent

00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:06,750
manual if you already know another

00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:09,569
language that one runs C++ you know we

00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:11,069
could do a better job you like any of

00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:15,060
you in this room can do better job than

00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:17,009
this so please write blog pause write a

00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,739
book propose the talk go to your meetup

00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:22,220
be a guest speaker to university you

00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:25,930
cannot do worse than this guy

00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:33,830
it's just cannot happen we need you

00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:35,810
really I will I want to Frank Lowy Julie

00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:37,430
from my from my meet past meetup in

00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,560
Paris for coming with this book and

00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,820
sharing it with us and I stole most of

00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,740
his IDs here

00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:48,400
oh and furthermore I think your bill

00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:48,400
