Heights well I'm Rene Rivera I'm gonna

00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:16,270
showing you some algorithm magic and

00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,029
since we're talking about

00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:20,380
I'm gonna and do some magic tricks I'm

00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:22,990
gonna need someone to help me

00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:34,390
so with that Shawn could you come up

00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:36,840
here Thank You Shawn you might want to

00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,840
go in this way

00:00:37,809 --> 00:00:41,470
so since we're talking about slight wear

00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,180
the first thing I'm gonna show you is

00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:48,190
what I'm not gonna show you on the next

00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:51,519
slide we're gonna start off with

00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:58,750
something rather simple on this that's

00:00:51,519 --> 00:01:00,820
our main program cards a slide so first

00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:03,670
thing we're gonna do on this is we're

00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:06,970
going to show you some normal deck of

00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:11,530
cards it's kind of nice looking we're

00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:16,510
gonna have 24 cards which are iota

00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:17,830
algorithm will give us for us and for

00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,380
the next step Shawn is gonna help me

00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:24,490
with this we're gonna shuffle that deck

00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:28,259
of cards so go ahead and yes we have a

00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:28,259
clock so you might want to do it quickly

00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:39,740
awesome so for the next part we are

00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:42,320
gonna do some input and for this part

00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:45,250
since it is a little tricky I have to

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,110
take this off Sean is gonna pick a card

00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:50,450
show it to you all on the camera so you

00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:52,070
can see it no one should say anything

00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:53,840
and then put it back in anywhere he

00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:58,000
wants and this is where I get to close

00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,000
my eyes tell me when you're done

00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,379
[Music]

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:16,170
thank you I'm sure there's no trick in

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:17,940
there anywhere so just to be sure

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:21,600
there's nothing going on he's gonna

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,800
shine he's gonna shuffle it again we all

00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:32,910
know how that shuffle algorithm works

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:34,530
I'm sure fantastic so for our next part

00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:37,739
of the algorithm we're gonna do this a

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,970
few times and that's easy to figure out

00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:42,690
we're just gonna do it three times as

00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:44,640
you can see there and in order to do

00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,320
that we're just gonna split this up so

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,930
we have the 1 deck of cards and we're

00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,050
gonna split it up into four and we're

00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:54,600
gonna do something rather interesting

00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:57,030
we're gonna use accumulate to actually

00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,730
do a distributed algorithm through the

00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:02,730
cards and this is where I suggest that

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:08,489
someone think about this and submit a

00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:11,930
paper to ad distribute next part of this

00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:15,750
for that we need to find the card that

00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:20,280
Shawn selected but I don't know what the

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:26,070
card is so I'm gonna ask is that have

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:28,110
your card no okay let's move on to the

00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,940
next one and you can see we're just

00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:34,950
doing a fine than account to figure that

00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:36,299
out is it in there clearly it would be

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,329
nice to have the computer right about

00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:42,959
now

00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:44,430
fantastic so we have the deck for the

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,440
next part we're gonna do some more

00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:51,150
strange algorithm we're gonna use some

00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:54,110
moves and collect it all back up and we

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,110
get to do this two more times

00:04:01,749 --> 00:04:13,810
okay so is your card somewhere in there

00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:15,079
no is your card somewhere in there yes

00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:19,340
great

00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:24,639
so again we move it all back into one

00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:24,639
deck and the last time

00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:46,450
and yes I am running out of time okay is

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:52,280
it in there no is it in there yes great

00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:54,020
okay so now the really scary part we're

00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:58,810
gonna print out and assert that we have

00:04:54,020 --> 00:05:01,870
the right card because we know which one

00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,870
it is

00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:08,140
so thank you

00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:14,090
one last thing since Sean was so helpful

00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:19,020
he gets his own set of cards that are

00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:22,430
special that match those C++ cards

00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,430
