I have been developing software for roughly 30 years. Yes, I started before I was born. I have been doing C++ for roughly 20 years, not very well at first, and slightly better now.

I work at F5 Networks, and have worked at Disney, VMware, Yahoo!, and Microsoft, among many others. I have benefited from a wide range of experience and personalities.

I have a personal grudge against code that does not strive to reach a high standard. I am dismayed at code that does not reach its potential. And I firmly believe that writing code well creates a better, more stable, more maintainable product.
