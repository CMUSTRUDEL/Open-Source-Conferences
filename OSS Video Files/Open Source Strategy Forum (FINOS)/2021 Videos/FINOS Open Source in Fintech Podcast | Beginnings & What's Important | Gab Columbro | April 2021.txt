00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,119
little bit about finnos we might talk

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,799
about

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:40,000
um kind of with the end in mind what

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,399
you know what what is finnos and how

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,439
does it you know associate and what

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,399
should it do

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,040
um for you know all the people involved

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,560
all the

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:54,079
companies involved all the um you know

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,719
um and

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,680
you know but let's just let's just talk

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,200
um

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:05,920
so a little bit about gabrielle

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,920
colombo i'm bad i'm sorry go ahead

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,879
yeah so grizz i mean it's uh i think

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,160
he's spoiled already by now i

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:17,360
am italian uh and that

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:21,040
certainly permeates uh around

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,360
a lot of many things i do um but as

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,319
as a you know from a professional

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,000
standpoint i

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:31,280
am a born and bred uh computer engineer

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,280
um i grew up

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:39,599
in the what i would call the open source

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,920
gold rush era i've had a lot to

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,680
you know always pretty much always work

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,480
for for open source companies or

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,000
participate in open source communities

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,920
um and i think that has certainly shaped

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,040
um you know the way i look at software

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,360
the way i look about

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,280
you know the opportunities that uh

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,760
collaboration can bring

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,599
i you know certainly always been in my

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,440
life

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,080
i like to think i'm a pretty

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,280
collaborative person

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,640
and i'm uh i appreciate i'm agreeing

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,599
with you boss i'm agreeing with you both

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,830
right now great

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,280
yes you are yeah

00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:18,400
[Laughter]

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,840
but yeah i spent

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:25,040
the first 20 years of my life in

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,760
italy pretty much all over the place

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,440
between

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:32,640
rome sicily you know

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,640
learning to fight

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,080
for pretty much anything you want to

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,200
achieve you know even it's

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,720
an amazing country but you know it takes

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:46,239
um some real ambition and real

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:49,440
uh grit to you know

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:54,000
make it in a way uh and then i

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:57,120
uh um moved to amsterdam when i was 23

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,840
i um you know i had dreadlocks at the

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,280
time so people

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,680
i have seen pictures and and

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,360
and i'm probably going to post that if

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,319
in the blog post that we do for this

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,319
just fyi

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,080
yes yes yes it's extortion blackmail

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,840
that's um

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,000
this isn't being recorded you're very

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,600
familiar with that

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,520
oh yeah i

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,520
you know when i when i moved to to

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,720
holland for my first

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,800
um you know open source consulting job

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,639
you know clearly with dreadlocks people

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,080
had uh some hard time believing that i

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,240
was there for work

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:41,840
uh that's fair but uh that that really

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,720
changed my career and really that was um

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,280
you know pretty much

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,280
the first

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:53,440
i would say real

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:56,880
experience in open source um and just

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,160
sort of seeing how even a small

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,080
geographic

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,000
uh uh distance i mean in the grand

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,600
scheme of things

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,280
you know italy and holland are

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
relatively close especially if you look

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,800
it

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,520
from from the u.s standpoint right but i

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,440
remember

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,880
when when we moved to holland and that

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:17,840
was 2007

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,120
almost 15 years ago i remember one of

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,479
the craziest thing was

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:26,479
um there was a

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:30,080
a mandate from the queen of holland

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:33,919
that all public tenders would have to be

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,919
fulfilled by open source software

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,160
otherwise a strong justification should

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,759
have been provided by any

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,199
you know public entity that was not

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,360
going with open source

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,880
and that for me again this is 2007

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,560
that's like 15 years ago

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,919
and we're talking government we're not

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,039
talking you know private sector

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,039
so it was really amazing to me to see

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,960
wait you know in italy open source at

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,000
that time was still pretty small still

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,960
pretty niche

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,120
you know seeing how you know a moder a

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,280
bit more modern technology

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,280
uh centric country like holland was

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,560
really promoting this was very high

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,319
opening and

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,400
you know leaving aside the fact that i

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:14,400
had my questions whether the queen

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:16,240
um you know bless her heart

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,759
how much you know she knew about the

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,520
insights of open source but it was

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,440
certainly certainly amazing

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,800
and then from there you know i spent

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,600
seven years in holland

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,080
and and then moved to the united states

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,199
um

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,639
you know who knew i would have found uh

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,400
my better health uh in in the deep south

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,319
in georgia

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,560
and so i moved to atlanta in 2013

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,360
um still working for a company called

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,479
alfresco

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,319
open source content management uh and

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,800
the rest is history uh

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,360
two more years in atlanta and then we

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,160
moved

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,880
uh here in san francisco uh when i took

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,919
the job

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,919
uh to run finos so

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,039
hopefully a little bit of an intro here

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,599
yeah and that's

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,440
um that also explains why you said about

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,479
the queen bless her heart because that

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:11,440
is definitely a

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,440
southern um term for sure

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,080
we've joked about that before i'm not

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,199
going to venture into the y'alls uh

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,560
oh yeah you want to hear that with an

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,919
italian accent

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,960
yeah what go for it

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:30,639

yeah i uh talking with christine um

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,039
uh god how long ago was that now a

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:38,400
couple of years ago

exactly we might have planned this early

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,319
but

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,319
yeah you're right i mean it was a little

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,240
bit of a culture shock to move from

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,360
amsterdam to atlanta you know i don't

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,000
deny that and

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,560
sure i have a pretty funny anecdote

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
there

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,039
um it's safe for work yeah it is it is

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,850
okay okay okay

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,120
um thank you for checking

00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:32,240
[Laughter]

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,560
i remember one of the first time i flew

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,919
i wasn't living and i'm in atlanta yet

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,959
but i flew to see

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:42,560
christine my wife my now wife

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:44,000
um and the flight landed pretty late at

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,760
you know heartfelt jackson

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,399
um probably two a.m and i was

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,360
crazy hungry so christine picked me up

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,680
and

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,440
you know we tried to find a place of

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,959
course it was 2 a.m she lives in the

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,760
suburbs so there wasn't

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,800
a whole lot open but we found the waffle

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,120
house

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,959
uh it was my first experience with the

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,279
waffle house which of course is a you

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,320
know

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:12,080
it's a southern landmark in many ways

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,839
yes and you can't

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,760
just just just so anybody who's

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,560
listening that's never been to a waffle

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,519
house

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,480
i know that they're open 24 hours but i

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,120
can't say

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,880
that until maybe until the age of 40

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,320
that i'd ever been there

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,240
um during the day um

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,600
then i had kids and then we've gone

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,800
during the day but but

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,760
um your normal time to go to to waffle

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,839
house is

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:43,040
11 p.m until 4 00 a.m i believe so uh so

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:46,640
yes very very appropriate um i remember

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:49,680
sitting in and ordering drinks

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:52,080
so the way there's the the waitress come

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,760
and ask us for drinks and and you know

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,600
as a proper italian man so i was like do

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,360
you guys have sparkling water

00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:02,399
um the waitress look at my

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,320
my fiance at the time it's like

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,320
did you just snack with sparkling water

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,880
and they start cracking itself

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,720
up and it was my first sort of

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:18,160
understanding that you know

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:21,120
sparkling water is a luxury good here

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,000
one example of cultural differences that

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,360
yeah

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,120
did they offer you a sprite at that

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,560
point yes

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,560
we got sodas yeah

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,600
awesome um so

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:39,600
uh we're in san francisco

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,399
and uh uh phenos was not finos at that

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,040
time

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,760
so um let's talk maybe a little bit

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,440
about

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,279
if you want to go into any history of

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,959
finos um

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:53,839
and what thanos does all the above

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,839
but again feel free to go any direction

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:59,040
on this

00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:02,800
yeah i mean it was a

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:06,240
i in 2015

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:09,519
i did a talk at apachecon

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,480
on cloud and open source

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,800
um you know starting from the i would

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,320
say

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,240
false hypothesis that cloud was going to

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,079
kill the open source movement because

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,519
you know you're not selling software

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,640
anymore with a sas

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,079
model you are delivering a service to

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,640
your customers and so

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,120
you know why does it matter uh whether

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,240
actual

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,480
underlying software is open source but

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,240
you know by the end of the talk the

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,000
whole plan the whole sort of

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,680
hypothesis that i wanted to prove is

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,519
that you know

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,880
cloud would not exist without open

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,279
source um

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,640
you know if you think about it you know

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,399
all the

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,920
virtualization software that the cloud

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,959
is run on

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:57,200
the operating systems that that

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:59,920
are you know efficiently scaled in cloud

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,880
um you know most of the application

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,720
framework

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,959
uh that at that time were offered

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,680
through pass platform as a service you

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:10,800
know remember when that was a thing

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,200
all of those were open source and you

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,240
know

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,279
on the flip side sas and cloud

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,279
did indeed open a you know very

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,639
interesting new way of commercializing

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,560
open source so

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,079
you know by the end of the talk again

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,720
the idea was

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,200
uh it's cloud plus open source and cloud

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,240
would not exist without open source

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,600
um you know as usual when you do this

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,040
type of talks you have a little bit of

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,839
imposter syndrome

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,279
um but turns out that the talk was very

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,560
successful because

00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,880
just a couple of weeks later an

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,800
executive recruiter reached out

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,959
um with this opportunity around the

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,480
symphony software foundation

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:53,040
um you know

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,079
he reached out and he said look we got

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,320
uh all these

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:59,120
major investment banks you know goldman

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,240
sachs morgan stanley jp morgan

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,480
uh deutsche bank credit suisse uh

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,399
and also buy side firms like blackrock

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,800
citadel

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,160
they all want to collaborate together in

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,360
cloud and i was like

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,040
are you are you kidding me

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,120
really that was my reaction and then was

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,360
like but it's not all

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,560
they also are creating an open source

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,120
foundation

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,000
um to collaborate in the open and i was

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,519
like dude like

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,160
pinch me uh you know like

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,760
in 15 years of open source 20 years by

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,040
now man i'm old

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,480
um you know financial services has been

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,240
historically one of the one

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,680
one of the industries that you know has

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,600
lagged in

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,000
you know not only adoption of open

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:48,000
source but it really just cultural

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,959
uh myths uh uh you know not yet debunked

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,839
in their industry and so look i went

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,000
through that

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,760
i went through the interview process i i

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,600
interviewed with several of these

00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,959
executives at

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,519
these organizations and well you know

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,160
that was an actual real opportunity we i

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,279
knew it was a

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:10,160
you know big challenge of course but um

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,279
you know i ended up uh you know being

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,639
lucky enough to

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:17,920
to being given the job and so in uh

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:20,160
december 2015 i uh

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,959
got the job two months later i moved out

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,920
of atlanta

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,839
here into san francisco where symphony

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,360
uh the commercial entity was

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:32,720
uh um based um and

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:35,040
you know a new chapter started so

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,920
wait wait wait we've got to of course go

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,530
back just

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,480
a little bit when did you cut the dreads

00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:43,680
[Laughter]

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,839
it was much earlier man okay okay okay

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:49,199
grew up with uh

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:52,320
uh we used to tease each other in school

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:55,040
uh at middle school or high school about

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,639
how we were gonna lose our hair early i

00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,040
mean there's such a weird thing

00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,399
you know at high school making fun of

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,839
each other for losing their

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,920
hair and so you know after a few years

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:09,360
of dreadlocks probably when i was

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:13,120
24 25 i started you know looking at my

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:15,360
hairline and i was like um

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,120
and so that was actually you know you

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,560
might think it was professional reasons

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,000
why i cut my dreadlocks

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,440
but completely you know untrue

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,360
it's actually because i was scared of

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,160
losing my hair and now i'm happy to

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,880
report

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,920
that uh-huh you still have hair i still

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,600
have enough air

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,360
so yeah it all worked out in that guy

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,519
when i moved to the

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:43,680
united states oh that's awesome

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:45,040
um okay so so you're there

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,800
symphony soccer foundation in san

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,560
francisco

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:54,720
and and how wait wait wait so

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:57,680
so you know my background

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,279
you already know is is in events and and

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,079
design and developer events but also

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,480
open soft

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:04,240
open source software events and and you

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,920
know 10 years ago 12 years ago when i

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,480
first started it was more about

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,320
like you know rah-rah open source

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,399
because

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,399
because it was still not in the

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,720
mainstream people consumed it but people

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:20,160
didn't necessarily

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,959
know how to contribute um i i

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,839
github when i first started uh doing

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,399
events

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,399
that quit chris juan strath came to one

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,600
of our first events in columbia south

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,040
carolina because

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,600
like he could

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,040
uh first of all but but you know and put

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,320
a thousand dollars behind the bar and

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:43,639
that was how they did their marketing

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:45,759
at github back in oh man was that

00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:46,399
2012 or something like that i'm not

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,160
quite sure

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:52,000
um so so that's how long

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,360
i've been doing it and then it started

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,839
to turn into

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,120
you know no longer open source it was

00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,680
like okay here's what we're actually

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,279
doing

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:03,120
and so so how crazy was it you know

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,240
looking back at you know you've already

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,199
said a little bit about financial

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,240
services

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:10,559
lagging but like that's got to be a

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,679
monumental task just to

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:15,919
get that idea into

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,480
a community that you know first is

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:21,120
regulated right

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,880
and second you know probably doesn't

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,199
want to work with each other

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,919
not only because the regulated part

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,600
because it

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:32,640
can't in some instances but also because

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,799
you know

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,640
they're dealing with you know stocks and

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,520
they're dealing with their own stocks

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,320
and they're dealing with

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,919
you know having to make money um you

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,039
know against their competition

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,400
so why would i ever work with you you

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,799
know

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,200
and they're they're the forefront of you

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,200
know obviously financial services but

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,799
you know they're on top of everything

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:59,600
else that's already being traded

00:17:54,799 --> 00:18:02,720
i guess um so how crazy is that

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,440
well it was pretty crazy uh you know the

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,840
the

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,200
in some ways you know i would say we

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,240
were a little early

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,840
um you know in the

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:17,760
uh movement that we're now seeing lily

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:21,120
being taking over financial services in

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,120
2012 and 2021

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:31,280
you know when i first joined

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:34,960
look first of all i had the luck of

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:38,120
inheriting an already formed uh

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:41,679
very senior board of executives from

00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:43,760
distributions and really a sort of true

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,480
broad representation of the industry not

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,600
just

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,240
you know sell side uh and banks

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,799
uh like the ones i mentioned before uh

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,360
you know

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,720
probably 10 of the top 12 american

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,760
investment banks

00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,559
several banks in europe but we also had

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:03,200
buy-side representation macro

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:07,120
considerable we also had vendors

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:09,440
data vendors standard poor's factset

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,679
ihs market has been one of the earliest

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,320
contributors to the foundation and so

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,360
you know i gotta give it you know to the

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,720
symphony folks

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:22,000
to having created this

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,400
really um you know who's who type of

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,200
representation in our board you know and

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,640
as well

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:31,760
you know i had funding the the when i

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,840
uh started as the executive director of

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,960
the symphony software foundation

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,080
you know there was already funding in in

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,120
the foundation at least

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,080
for you know uh uh one or two years to

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,760
be able to

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,440
you know structure the team and and the

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,760
operations so

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,559
that certainly is one of the factors

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,000
that

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:53,760
you know made it

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,200
a little bit more feasible in my mind

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,360
when we

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,320
you know when i took the job and i gotta

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,520
say i was

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:04,799
you know relatively new uh this is my

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,799
first chief executive

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,880
job and so you know i think it was a

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,520
combination of

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,400
yes there are some we have really a good

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,520
thing going

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:20,559
uh already there ready to be exploited

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:23,679
uh you know for the good of the industry

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:26,720
i certainly had a little bit of um

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,840
you know uh i would say ingenuity

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,400
in in in a way that um

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,000
you know i've always went after big

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,840
challenges in my life and so

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,520
this was a certainly a big challenge

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,679
that that

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,679
i thought it was really worth and this

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,760
is an industry that again

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,760
has so much more potential for

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,600
improvement and better collaboration and

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,720
efficiency

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:54,080
i'm not going to go into rants on

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:56,000
our daily experiences on sending money

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,200
across the u.s we can talk about that

00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,440
later

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:03,280
coming from europe but

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,280
yes you're absolutely right when i first

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,919
joined um

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,200
you know these are fierce competitors

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:13,679
and

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,679
i think one element that really helped

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,840
sort of break in the deadlock if you

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,840
want

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,159
it's really the fact that i didn't come

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,320
from the industry

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,799
i didn't have any previous allegiances

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:30,400
with any of these organizations

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:32,559
right um you know as much as

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,840
this organization has tens of thousands

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,840
of folks

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,080
it is actually a pretty small circle

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,559
you'll see folks moving from

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,200
you know com the the first bank to

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,080
another

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,960
and right and so on and so forth and so

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,919
the fact that i

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,919
i wasn't an axe goldman guy or an ex jp

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,640
morgan guy or an ex-city guy

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,120
definitely sort of helped creating that

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,960
sort of

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:59,120
basal line of trust to build upon

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,320
right you know i don't deny that in the

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,840
first you know

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,840
six months uh at least most of the

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:10,080
questions that i was getting were

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,840
you know pretty um

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,760
i would say pretty inappropriate in

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:18,240
terms of as an executive

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,240
director of a non-profit you know

00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,240
would try to sort of grasp information

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,039
from me as to what other players were

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,480
doing and what

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,919
oh yeah we won't name names that's what

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,480
we're doing within the foundation which

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,919
of course exactly all that i'm not

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,039
supposed to talk about

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,559
uh trusted of pretty pretty important

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,720
information there

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,760
um but the good news is that that phase

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,559
really lasted

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,039
you know about six months three years i

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,080
will say

00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:48,400
yes um you know already by the beginning

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,039
of 2017

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,400
we had an established community around

00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,440
symphony

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:58,880
the trust was established between

00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,640
us and uh the banks and

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,240
increasingly between the banks

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,200
themselves and i think look

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,919
chris the if you think about financial

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,080
services

00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:13,760
it is a very different industry

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,320
than other sort of tech industries that

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,000
that i come from that we use was used to

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,039
you know if you even just think about a

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,200
trade

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:26,559
and how many entities and organizations

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,440
are involved in the completion of a

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,000
single trade

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,440
from sort of pre-trade operations to the

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,559
actual trading

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:37,679
to clearing to settlement

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:42,000
like it is an industry that must

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:44,080
collaborate in uh a certain way

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,200
to just run their business you know

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,279
definitely from

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,240
you know a facebook or a google you know

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,559
you have a service

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,760
you offer it to your customers they buy

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,360
it or they don't buy it

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,520
you know it's pretty much all in your

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,400
hands as a single entity yeah sure you

00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,640
can decide to partner with others but

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,679
generally you're sort of master of your

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,440
own destiny

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,640
when i think about financial services i

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:09,919
think about a highly interconnected

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:13,279
network of yeah as you say competitors

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:15,279
but also companies that have to

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,640
collaborate to be successful and so i

00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:19,440
think that was

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,720
really the premise why i was like look

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,120
yes it might be hard

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,799
it might be a big challenge but it does

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:28,320
indeed make sense

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:30,159
there is a way that

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,640
you know we can collaborate on common

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:35,840
standards common pieces of code

00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:38,720
common apis and that is going to

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,679
benefit each and every one in the

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,640
industry

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,200
and i have to say hopefully the average

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,039
joe

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:50,080
downstream that uses the the financial

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:52,640
uh services complex right so well

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,600
yeah i mean shouldn't it shouldn't it

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,320
ultimately be

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,360
for the customers and clients of these

00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,120
banks

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,480
you know whether it's on you know

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,200
trading floor or on

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,480
i guess retail with you know with

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,960
banking in general

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,919
you know i go to the bank and i write a

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,200
check which i

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,600
don't um but it it

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,120
should filter down to where those end

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,600
users the customers

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,279
should actually have a easier time doing

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,039
a transaction

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,559
just one transaction whether it's a

00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:26,559
trade or or

00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:29,360
at the atm you know

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,080
but it but but it all starts way back

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,919
here

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:35,440
with you know you know many companies at

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,240
once being involved in

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,600
one single transaction so yeah

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,640
absolutely

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:46,320
and you know i come

00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,880
from a place that look italy and europe

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,559
have

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,159
so many issues uh we dedicate a whole

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:55,279
other podcast to that

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:57,039
but you know i come from a place where

00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,120
especially having lived for many years

00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:01,919
in holland

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,440
you know you can send money to any

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:07,360
country in europe

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:10,640
in minutes without you know

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:13,200
a zealot or a venmo or a fintech sort of

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,559
bridging that gap and right the reason

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,000
is that there is an international

00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:19,039
banking standard

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,400
called iban that allows to do that

00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:25,919
um you know talking about anecdotes

00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:30,080
my wife was the one that

00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:33,039
literally at i think 33 years old

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:36,320
she taught me how to feel a check i had

00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:39,440
never seen a check in my life

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:42,960
i think my bed fulfilled when i was like

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,159
five but check it's not a thing uh uh in

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,320
europe you know in the

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,400
credit card in the era of digital

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,760
payments so

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,600
you know i think part of the drive

00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,279
knowing that this was a big challenge

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,559
was really the fact that yes

00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:00,000
i have seen uh a better model again with

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,679
all the caveats of the world

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,480
knowing that there are many other

00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:07,440
complexities with europe and you know

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,000
uh the the single currency as as we're

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,039
seeing

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,880
you know a lot of challenges uh um a lot

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:16,159
of countries challenging that model

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,480
think about brexit um but yeah i think

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,320
having been exposed growing up to a

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,960
model which i found

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,760
you know better for the ultimate end

00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,840
user

00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,679
uh was another you know motivator i

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,720
think for me to sort of take on this

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,559
challenge

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:36,159
cool cool so

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:37,840
simply software foundation get started

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,679
you get in there

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:45,039
um things are starting to

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:46,399
normalize a little bit um but we're no

00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,279
longer called the symphony software

00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:51,440
foundation

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:55,440
right so what happened

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,799
well that's uh i think probably the most

00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:02,240
exciting part

00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:06,480
of the story i mean

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:09,520
after a year working together with

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,559
um you know this very influential board

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,279
and

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:17,600
you know i have to say very not only

00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:20,159
very smart and very senior folks but

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,840
you know i think we build a relationship

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:25,039
that goes beyond

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:28,159
a professional um

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:31,360
i am a big fan of

00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:34,240
you know it not being just work

00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,480
uh when you when you look back um and i

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:39,919
think actually that was a fundamental

00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,960
uh sort of superpower that uh

00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:47,520
uh our foundation has

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:51,520
you know achieved or has developed

00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,520
but by mid 2017

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:57,919
we started having conversations on

00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,520
you know the broader opportunity that we

00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:02,799
were seeing in the industry

00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:06,559
um you know the fintech

00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:07,200
wave was growing and was hot in the

00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,440
media

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,399
uh you know potentially starting

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,600
chipping away

00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:17,520
at the very business of

00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,960
several of these institutions um

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,200
decentralized technologies like

00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:25,440
blockchain where

00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:27,520
even further uh sort of defining a

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,480
complete new model of carrying out

00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,559
financial

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,559
transactions um

00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,919
you know the the industry was undergoing

00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,399
a major

00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,080
and it still is candidly undergoing a

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:44,080
major talent crunch

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:47,760
um you know this east coast west coast

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:50,080
uh hate love relationship um

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,960
but clearly you know a lot of the best

00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,760
talent was

00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,360
was you know choosing to go work for

00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,919
technology companies and

00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,559
right you know as an open source guy i

00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:02,640
can

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:05,279
definitely see a correlation between

00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,440
you know being allowed to continue

00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:10,320
foster your individual portfolio

00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:13,120
by contributing to open source you know

00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:17,279
as a major

00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:19,279
factor in the choice of your next job

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:21,039
even further i would say for the newer

00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:23,360
generations i mean

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,960
turns out that i am a millennial because

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,440
i'm from 1981

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,240
some yeah you're a baby you're a baby to

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,600
me

00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,600
but you know especially

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,520
you know they come into the the

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,880
workforce they started coming into the

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,600
workforce

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,720
um you know we clear demands about

00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,279
making an impact

00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,640
about what are you doing to give back

00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:47,679
and you know

00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:52,480
while let's be clear

00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:55,360
open source is not charity um

00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,960
there definitely is a conscience aspect

00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,760
to information sharing

00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,200
and you know open collaboration uh that

00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,360
had a really strong appeal

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,440
on especially the newer generations and

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:09,039
so

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:13,120
you know the environment was fertile

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:15,840
to think about expanding our foundation

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,440
into what it is today the fintech open

00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,039
source foundation

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,360
really an organization that could

00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:24,320
provide

00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,840
you know an independent forum a trusted

00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,919
umbrella

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,840
for any type of open source and open

00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:34,559
standard collaboration in the industry

00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:39,039
and you know i'm not gonna say

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:42,559
it was easy um you know when you have

00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:45,679
uh to rally up um you know

00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:47,120
about 22 board members on a super

00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,159
majority vote

00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,320
i guess i realized why i've always been

00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:55,840
so much into politics in my life

00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,559
uh there certainly was

00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,120
you know a lot of conversations to be

00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:04,000
had

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:07,039
a lot of consensus building to be done

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:11,440
but in january 2018

00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:16,000
we took the leap and we

00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:18,240
approved the motion to expand into finos

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,760
and then three months later we had an

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,720
amazing launch event

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,240
uh at the nasdaq market site in times

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,559
square

00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,799
where we announced the fintech open

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:31,039
source foundation and

00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:33,600
you know that was really the turning

00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:35,919
point for us

00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,919
um

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,559
trying to think of where to go next um

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,840
because we could keep going

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:50,799
forward on that um

00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,159
what about you going we talked about you

00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:55,679
leading up to this

00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:57,600
um was there anything you want to talk

00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:01,679
about during that time too

00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:05,679
well look that has been

00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:07,840
you know when i mentioned the um

00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,200
sort of beyond professional relationship

00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,399
with my board

00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:15,679
um you know that that period

00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:19,440
uh was a pretty you know complex uh

00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:24,240
period in my personal life um and that's

00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:26,960
you know one of the areas where

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,519
the support from our board has been you

00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,360
know

00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:33,120
candidly fundamental um as we were going

00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,279
through the process of

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,960
you know pivoting and expanding the

00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:40,080
foundation

00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:43,679
um you know i had my first

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:46,240
son leonardo um and

00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,519
you know we knew we had a congenital

00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,559
heart defect

00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,360
uh um but when we when he was born you

00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,559
know

00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:59,120
we also discovered they had some

00:33:54,559 --> 00:34:01,919
pretty unique uh uh chromosomal issues

00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,120
you know every every parent like to say

00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,640
that their kid is

00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:08,639
is one of a kind right in this case it

00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,679
actually is one of a kind there's

00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,879
literally

00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:16,429
no other case reported in literature

00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:18,079
of this specific chromosomal pattern

00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:21,119
[Music]

00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,480
and so we had a pretty rough start uh he

00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,480
had a pretty rough start

00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,320
for the first three months uh three to

00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,520
six months we spent most of our time in

00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,159
the hospital and that was

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,359
late 2017 exactly as we were carrying

00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,079
out this

00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:36,000
uh pretty big lift of pivoting the

00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:39,119
foundation

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,560
and i still remember you know in one of

00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:45,200
the darkest times in the hospital

00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,639
you know getting a call from one of my

00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,720
board members which i'm

00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,320
you know not gonna mention for for

00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,720
privacy but

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,359
you know uh i remember them telling me

00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,800
gab

00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:59,680
you do what you need to do will take

00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,040
a business um and they did indeed

00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,839
actively took

00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,440
you know a massive role in you know

00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,640
dealing with some of the politics that

00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,200
of course is involved

00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,640
in uh bringing you know 20 different

00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:14,240
companies together

00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:18,160
right and create consensus there um

00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:22,240
and so you know that of course has been

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:23,760
you know a major turning point in my

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,119
life not just from a professional

00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,400
standpoint but from a

00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:33,359
you know a personal standpoint and

00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:35,119
in a way something that has really uh

00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:37,920
you know put things in perspective for

00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:41,280
me um i am a very driven person

00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:44,320
uh as you probably know i'm also a very

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:49,119
uh requiring person in terms of

00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,119
professionalism in terms of you know

00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:55,680
delivering always an outstanding uh

00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,880
service to our members for customers to

00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,079
the industry

00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:03,920
um but clearly

00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:07,200
uh you know there are

00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,359
different orders of challenges um that

00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,119
one can take and and the experience you

00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:13,599
know seeing my son

00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,880
fighting for his life effectively

00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:19,440
multiple times

00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,440
in in three months you know

00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:26,079
an ex you know spending time in a

00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,960
in a pediatric icu is an experience that

00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,000
i

00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:32,079
don't recommend to anyone i don't wish

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,560
anyone in the world even if it's not

00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:38,640
your son or your or your

00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:40,880
daughter just you know seeing kids

00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,280
connected to so many cables it's just

00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:46,640
something that nobody should ever see

00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:49,920
um but it really did

00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:52,000
uh solidify the idea that you know what

00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,599
yes open sourcing financial service is a

00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,280
big challenge

00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:58,960
but is it you know fair to

00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,320
you know what i've seen my son go

00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,839
through and come out

00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:07,119
you know with lifelong issues

00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:09,119
uh but here and happy and smiling and so

00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:12,400
i think i think that's been

00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:14,320
you know when we talk about

00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,240
maybe if we touch on how we build

00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:19,599
community and how

00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:21,520
you do actually uh

00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,200
have to have an element of sort of

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:27,280
empathy uh

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,800
in in you know everything you do

00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,560
you know i think that was one of the

00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,599
most teaching moments for me

00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:36,880
um yes it's

00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:40,800
amazing they were able to be vote

00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:42,880
but you know it's not

00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,400
it can be only work as we were saying

00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,160
before like yeah

00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,920
there's there's worthier and worth your

00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,000
challenges that i think

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:53,200
should put in perspective you know when

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,240
someone feels down or where your boss

00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,240
doesn't treat you well

00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,320
you know as we've seen for example in

00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,359
this pandemic

00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:06,400
there's always much worse uh

00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:09,280
you know very very uh i think

00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,320
consider ourselves very lucky i agree

00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,320
agreed on that in

00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:17,359
many different ways um

00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:20,240
thanks for that by the way um

00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:23,839
you know i kind of we talked a little

00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:28,400
bit beforehand but um but i feel like

00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:30,720
you know sometimes knowing knowing what

00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,760
i told you that i do another podcast

00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,359
that's uh

00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,920
personal and it's on leadership and

00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:38,720
mindset and things like that and

00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,160
huh yeah yeah uh no uh it's not mine

00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:43,359
it's a friend of mine um

00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:47,359
but you know but

00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:49,520
having the interpersonal stories that

00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,880
you know lead to what is happening

00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:54,079
around somebody is

00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:57,359
to me very important um it's it's what

00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,839
you know it's what biographies are built

00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,960
around

00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:01,920
it's um you know you can't have success

00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,920
without challenges

00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,440
otherwise it's just you know flying

00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,640
through life blissfully

00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,640
um so so

00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,160
sometimes those struggles that we have

00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:15,680
personally interpersonally

00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:18,640
you know really push us for something

00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,839
more and sometimes we put that into

00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,520
whatever that personal thing is

00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:25,520
sometimes we put that into

00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:29,440
whatever work is and and you're right um

00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:32,160
you know i go back to you know my time

00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,280
in the infantry in the army at fort

00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,760
bragg

00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,480
and you know i had it a lot easier than

00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,760
some people

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:42,079
obviously um while i was there but

00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,800
i look at it as there's some crap that i

00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:47,280
never want to go through again

00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,280
and so that always that has always made

00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,079
everything else that i do after that

00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,400
easier for you it's going through things

00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:57,599
with leo and christine and then

00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,839
you know everything after that is

00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,599
you know it's just work it's just you

00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:04,800
know it's something else

00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:06,880
um so that is

00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,960
that's probably more important how it is

00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:12,079
more important than

00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,200
you know what we do on a daily basis

00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:16,240
within the foundation

00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,599
but um but i think it does kind of it

00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,720
helps

00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:21,760
your focus on on you know what's

00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,880
important

00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:28,400
it helps my focus on what's important um

00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:31,040
and and how we go about that too i hope

00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,520
right yeah no i i couldn't agree more

00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:35,359
and

00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:37,200
again i think we've seen um

00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,960
you know we went through a pretty pretty

00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:42,000
hard year

00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:45,280
here yeah

00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,800
you know i think in a way

00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,480
having had to go through these

00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:52,480
challenges

00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:55,280
made it you know much easier for me to

00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,560
you know try at least to help balance

00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:00,240
not only my life

00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:02,960
but really making sure that i understood

00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,000
the challenges that my employees were

00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,440
going through and

00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,520
and our community and look

00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,800
you know you said going through life

00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,560
blissfully

00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,560
that had been pretty much the story of

00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,640
my life yeah

00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,760
you know i always been relatively

00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,599
healthy my parents are together

00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,119
you know i i've had the lack of being

00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,960
able to study and

00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,560
and have always a pretty successful

00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,680
career

00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,800
i have a wonderful wife which uh you

00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,880
know

00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:38,000
teaches me things every day and and

00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,000
you know it's really a

00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,880
beam that i follow

00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:48,319
my north star and you know

00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,880
it would have been much harder to relate

00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:52,800
to you know the challenges that everyone

00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,119
has gone through in the last year

00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,240
uh you know adam i had my own challenges

00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:00,480
to deal with so

00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:03,520
you know you're absolutely spot on um

00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,680
i think you know like in as you say any

00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:08,240
book or any movie

00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,800
there's you know there's something to be

00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,400
said

00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:15,040
around you know what you learn uh um

00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,839
again and how you apply these learnings

00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,839
in all you do

00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,160
right well you know what i think we

00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,520
should probably stop there

00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:30,560
honestly and and um and

00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:33,839
then let's let's do another one and look

00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,880
um as some you know topics i wanted to

00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:38,720
get to

00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:40,560
about you know what does finnos do

00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,160
what is the end goal what you know how

00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:45,280
does that affect you know

00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:47,760
different members and companies and then

00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:50,960
down to developers and end users

00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,599
let's do that um you know again i think

00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,640
that

00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:57,599
you know yeah this was great um

00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:59,680
thank you um but let's uh let's save

00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:02,880
that for maybe a part two

00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:06,160
um and uh revisit this

00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:09,520
