00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,479
also distinguished engineer at capital

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,880
one

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,320
and we're super excited today to tell

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,640
you a story about how

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,680
an internally built cicd pipeline

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,000
framework

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,479
grew to become a major inner source

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
product at capital one

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,600
we'll share with you the lessons we

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,680
learned that shaped our journey and

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,040
could help your organization harness the

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,560
power of inner source

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,560
inside of your company's walls

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,119
so we'll start at the beginning

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,000
many years ago capital one followed a

00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,240
waterfall approach to software delivery

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,280
we even built and ran our own data

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,159
centers

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,159
we had a painfully long approval process

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,520
for releasing software changes into

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,080
production

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,800
and the deployment steps themselves were

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,680
very

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,400
manual and error-prone it literally took

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,440
months

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,080
to get a release out the door and if we

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,720
fast forward to today

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,160
we operate a lot differently we have

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,879
agile teams that are following

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,680
continuous

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,520
delivery practices we're all in on the

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,720
cloud which enables our business to be

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,360
nimble

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,120
and most importantly we've automated our

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,280
deployment processes

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,680
they're safer predictable and more

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,680
frequent

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,560
but how exactly did we get here our

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,440
digital transformation didn't happen

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,599
overnight

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,120
it took a lot of hard work and effort

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,680
from everyone

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,040
and the cicd pipeline framework we built

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,560
was an important part

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,040
of the journey if we

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,560
hop into a time machine and go back to

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,560
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,840
capital one had publicly announced at

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,159
amazon's re invent

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,159
developer conference that we're moving

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,720
to the public cloud

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,879
and while our digital transformation was

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,959
are already underway at the time

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,720
that this announcement came out it was a

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,720
big moment for our company

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,760
and our software engineers were super

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,440
excited about

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,000
where we would hit it from a technology

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,000
standpoint

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:36,720
uh sorry

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:40,159
and so around that same time in 2015

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:43,360
across the great lakes and canada and a

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:47,120
relatively small office near downtown

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,959
uh toronto capital one was

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,400
was actually starting a brand new

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,360
technology organization

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,319
or what we called a software studio and

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,080
the intent of that

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,319
software studio was to transform the way

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,599
the capital one canada business

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,920
um operated and

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,840
this new studio in canada had a very had

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,760
a startup feel to it and we were

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,840
going to do all the transformational

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,560
goals our tech leaders had inspired us

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,000
to do

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:17,359
we were going to automate all the things

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,919
and on a more personal note uh myself i

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:19,759
actually

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,199
saw that the studio was an exciting new

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,360
opportunity

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,280
and challenge and so i packed my bags

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,680
and i i moved from

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,440
richmond virginia and in the states to

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,759
toronto to join

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,720
this team to to be a part of this

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,720
exciting new journey

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,880
but when we got started on our first few

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,360
business initiatives in canada

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,080
our developers quickly ran into a few

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,040
roblox

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,720
as we worked we we had hired a lot of

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,040
new developers

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,600
and they literally needed to learn all

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,600
the things

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,360
they needed to learn how to migrate apps

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,280
into the public cloud for bank

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,960
they needed to learn devops principles

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,639
and best practices

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,880
they needed to learn how to run

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,720
containerized workloads

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,960
they needed to learn how to use open

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,919
source software safely and securely

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,039
and how to automate manual processes

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,240
each one of these

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,840
on their own is a challenge but trying

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,400
to tackle them all at once

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:26,479
is very hard for the average developer

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,400
you know did i mention that we're also a

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:31,680
heavily regulated bank

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:34,160
across three countries that means that

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,759
there's many compliance requirements we

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,800
need to go through for everything that

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,639
we do as a company

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,840
we soon realized that getting from point

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,919
a

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,600
to point b which in our case was just

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,440
trying to get an application deploy into

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,280
production with automation

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,199
was going to be filled with twists and

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,039
turns along the way

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,280
and our developer productivity will

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,160
suffer unless we develop a solution that

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,560
made their lives

00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,560
easier

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,600
and so with that startup mentality that

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,600
i mentioned when we

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:10,160
began in this in the software studio

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,960
we began to build a ci cd pipeline

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,800
framework

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,800
that worked for our canada business

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,400
using open source software

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,840
so we were thinking about the entire

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,520
developer experience on how we could

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,000
reimagine our software release processes

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,360
to make

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,720
developers lives easier we made all of

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,560
our new framework

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,800
source code available inside of our

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,280
internal network using enterprise

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,039
github enterprise so that other

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,520
developers in the office could see the

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:40,000
code and contribute features as needed

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,720
this was a was a really exciting time

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,319
for

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,960
the studio and i recall a memorable

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,080
moment

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,080
where a software engineer who i won't

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,319
name but they happened to be a

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,560
co-speaker of this talk

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,400
uh committed a bunch of new code changes

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,560
to to add a brand new feature

00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,759
to the framework and immediately after

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,520
the code change

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,120
we had other developers running over to

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,880
our desk complaining that their pipeline

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,800
builds were failing

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,280
it turned out to be a simple syntax

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,840
error and we were able to fix it quickly

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,599
but this is just an example of how how

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,560
we were developing the framework very

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,720
quickly

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,400
and interacting with our developers to

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,840
gather their requirements and pain

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,280
points and solve

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,280
software them in real time

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,639
and it wasn't long after we built our

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,319
first mvp

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,319
of the framework that our canada

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,680
business launched its first

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:36,639
microservice api onto the onto the cloud

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,000
with a fully automated pipeline this was

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,560
a huge milestone

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,240
an accomplishment for a team we knew it

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,400
was a great start for the business

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,639
with many more automated deployments to

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,639
come

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,360
and to make the framework feel more

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,960
mature we gave the framework a name

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,120
and for the purpose of this talk we'll

00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,479
call the framework bingo

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,479
we design a cute little mascot for bingo

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:06,800
because what developer doesn't love

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,800
mascot stickers and free swag

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,840
the news about bingo quickly began to

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,440
spread across other parts of the company

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,199
developers started talking to other

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,039
developers about how they enjoyed the

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,840
developer experience and how it solved

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,960
the problems

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,720
problems that they were facing and we

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,199
knew word was spreading because we had a

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,400
dedicated slack channel for bingo

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,560
and a key indicator we use for adoption

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,680
was how many people had joined the

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,039
channel

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,240
we would celebrate every little

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:40,159
milestone so going from 25 members

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,479
in a channel to 50 members to 100 to 150

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,200
we were seeing natural and organic

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,959
growth which was exciting

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,959
but we didn't know what was coming next

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,399
so as the framework continue to grow and

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,839
take on new users

00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:01,040
and new use cases i actually decided to

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:05,200
pack my bags and move back to the us

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,640
partly because it was really cold but

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,360
it was an opportunity for me to move

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,040
back into the us

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,480
and through that transition we started

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,200
to see a huge growth

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,279
of bingo we saw hundreds of the

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,480
developers starting to adopt and use the

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,959
framework

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,600
mingo was reducing the amount of time it

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,080
took to

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,800
teams to release software had automated

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,480
away a lot of developer toil

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,640
reducing the amount of time it took to

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:35,920
deploy new software

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:37,680
from months down to weeks if not days

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,600
but we also soon noticed that there were

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,680
other similar pipeline frameworks being

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,240
built across the company

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,399
at first i was surprised and bewildered

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,200
how many frameworks have been built

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,000
and what felt like duplicate effort

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,640
turned out to be

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,959
developers trying to solve a common pain

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,959
point

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,880
and to put this into context like any

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,279
large enterprise

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,640
capital one comprises of multiple lines

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,800
of businesses

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,560
and given the size and scale of the

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,079
company it's easy for

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,079
duplicate efforts to occur even within

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,839
the same line of business

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,920
so case in point the candidate

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,040
organization falls under the credit card

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,800
division

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,079
and we were seeing multiple pipeline

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,120
frameworks sprouting up

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,800
just in the credit card business

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,040
and so within the credit card division

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,720
we began to ask ourselves

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,560
why do we have so many duplicative

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,000
pipeline frameworks

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,640
can we consolidate to a single framework

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,480
can we pull all of our talents together

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,279
and solve the problem once

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,120
and move on to more challenging problems

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,920
so this led to a healthy conversation

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,000
between the

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,880
various pipeline owners within the

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,880
credit card division

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,560
we came together in a community event

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,480
that we called a barn raising

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,839
and as a community we worked together to

00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,120
figure out which framework we would

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,519
standardize on for

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,600
the credit card division and so after

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,079
much deliberation the community

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,360
decides to standardize on the bingo

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,720
pipeline framework

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,480
that we have built in canada and a key

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,839
decision coming out of the barn raising

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,839
event was that we're going to use bingo

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,880
we're going to turn bingo into a formal

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,800
inner source product

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,560
and so for those who may not be familiar

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,279
with intersourcing the main idea is that

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,600
you take

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,800
many of the inter many of the concepts

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,040
of building open source

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,920
software and apply them inside your

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,959
company's walls

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,600
so think about public github issues pull

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,079
requests

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,360
project maintainers along with other

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:43,440
processes and governance

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,640
but they're optimized but it's optimized

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,680
for how your company

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,920
is organized there are a lot of great

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,000
benefits to intersourcing

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,079
um that unlocks collaboration and

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,480
productivity within your company as well

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:59,279
within your company's walls so benefits

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,440
that we've seen as code reuse

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,519
knowledge sharing to knock down silos

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,720
between teams that can

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,399
often occur in a large enterprise

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,639
it helps promote higher code quality

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,240
because we have more developer eyes

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,920
looking at the software being used

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,839
inside your company

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,959
and just overall better innovation

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,959
because

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:22,399
everyone is focused on the same goal and

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:24,959
feel a part of the solution

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,560
if you're new to intersourcing i would

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,120
uh definitely recommend checking out the

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,920
o'reilly book on how to get started with

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,920
with inner source

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,440
so returning to our story what happened

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:41,279
after the barn raising events

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:44,320
well imagine the excitement

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:46,880
but also panic and our faces

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,959
after we learned that bingo was going to

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,480
be leveraged by the entire credit card

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,000
division

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,920
a framework that had initially been

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,720
built for a few hundred developers

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,839
and a small office in toronto was now

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,480
going to be used by

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,920
several thousand engineers and hundreds

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,560
of applications

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:09,760
in both canada us and the uk

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,240
this was by far an exciting time but

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,320
also

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,320
a lot of pressure to make this work

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,440
at this point we had to fasten our seat

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,360
belt and scale up our operation

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,120
very much like a startup that had just

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,880
hit the jackpot

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,320
we quickly realized that we needed to

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,560
replicate

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:35,839
the bingo team and spread knowledge on

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:35,839
how our framework works

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,120
and among the first things we did was

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,120
conduct larger scale

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,040
boot camps and in-person training

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,519
sessions this enabled

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,920
a couple things one it helped educate

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,320
more developers on how to use bingo for

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,639
the

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,519
for their business application but more

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,639
importantly

00:13:53,519 --> 00:14:00,320
teach those who wanted to contribute to

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:03,360
bingo on how bingo worked under the hood

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,880
this education also helped adhere

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,399
help them adhere to many of the core

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,760
principles that happen

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,600
that had went into the initial

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:13,360
development and success of the framework

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,279
we also ramped up our mobbing

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,399
programming sessions we had multiple

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,480
developers

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,839
that would sit together physically or

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,199
even virtually

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:25,040
and develop new features and

00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:26,480
capabilities in real time together

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,639
we also found that there were other

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,880
areas that needed significant investment

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:34,160
including improving our documentation

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:37,519
and expanding our office hour support

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,320
things were moving very fast and then we

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,639
got hits

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:46,000
with yet another curveball

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:48,560
and so this brings me to act three

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,360
when a product process or product has

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,639
been found

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,480
to work well it's normal in a large

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,440
enterprise to figure out how to scale it

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,720
up

00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,240
especially the good parts so remember

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,600
when i said that capital one has

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,600
multiple lines of businesses

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,959
well just like within a division there

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,320
were multiple

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:13,600
frameworks across divisions we had

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:16,320
even more frameworks and the question

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,240
we asked ourselves again why do we have

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,279
duplicative pipeline frameworks

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,279
across the company

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,680
what if we had a single pipeline

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:30,160
framework for the entire enterprise

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,800
imagine the reduction of duplicative

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,920
efforts

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,880
in the time saved if the divisions

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,800
collaborated

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:41,680
and worked together just imagine that

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,199
and that's exactly what happened all the

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,680
divisions got together

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:48,160
to align on a single framework for the

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,560
enterprise

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,639
and collectively the organized the

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,320
organization decided to

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,959
take the framework that was built in the

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,720
credit card division bingo

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,000
and bring it to the enterprise as the

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,040
base for all

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,959
all other divisions to build upon and so

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,399
one of the good parts about bingo was

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,800
its inner source spirit so we needed to

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,120
take

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,560
many of the lessons that we learned from

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,199
inner source within the credit card

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:18,480
division

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:18,480
and scale them for multiple divisions

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,199
we thought scaling bingo in just one

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:28,480
line of business was difficult but boy

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:31,360
were we wrong while bringing the

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,720
divisions together while bringing the

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,680
divisions together i remember

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,000
a moment where the conversation went

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,120
something

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,639
like this hmm

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,199
our divisional pipeline framework

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:46,320
doesn't solve the problem that way

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:48,079
we solve it this other way and so

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,040
working through those differences and

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:53,040
aligning on aligning on a path

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,399
were probably the most some of the most

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,880
challenging parts of bringing the

00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,880
divisions together

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,639
but the more uplifting moments were

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,000
those aha moments

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:06,480
where oh you do it that way in your

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,919
pipeline framework well we do it that

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,839
way too

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,000
let's work together to remove the

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,079
duplication

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,360
and here's another example we had a team

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,319
and retail bank

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,360
that needed a new serverless capability

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,679
built into the

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,720
framework and they were wondering if

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,919
their use case

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,480
was supported in bingo we said no

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,520
it doesn't exist yet and their response

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,320
was

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,240
well we would love to contribute how do

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,120
we get started

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,200
and so those types of open conversations

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:43,360
is really what makes innersource

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,360
super viable in a large organization

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,240
and to help foster more of those

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,000
collaborative conversations

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,600
we've established what we call a

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,600
pipeline council

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,120
and this council is a group of leaders

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,679
from each division

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,160
to represent their division's business

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,520
needs

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:03,600
and to influence the direction design

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,440
of this shared enterprise framework

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,320
going forward

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,919
this is a great form for everyone to

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,840
align on priorities

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,320
use cases roadmaps and architecture

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,640
patterns

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,760
this really enhances the collaboration

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,760
between divisions

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:28,720
and like any popular open source project

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,679
or repo the number of github issues and

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,799
pull requests

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:35,919
against a successful intersource product

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,960
will feel endless and become very time

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,039
consuming

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,160
and so additional contributors are

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,280
definitely needed

00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,840
to really scale up we had a

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,799
community community contributor who got

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,559
to the point where they were

00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,559
consistently contributing multiple

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,080
high quality pull requests into our

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,320
github repos

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,919
they were also reviewing other people's

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,039
requests and issues and providing

00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,240
feedback

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:01,840
so to reward this contributor

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,760
who was actively engaged and

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,400
consistently and

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,400
involved we elevated them to become a

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,480
trusted contributor

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,559
and a trusted contributor is someone who

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,000
has achieved a special status in our

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,160
repositories

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,440
where they are trusted to review and

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,240
approve

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,919
pull requests from other contributors so

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,320
having a path

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,520
for users to become a trusted

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,360
contributor has

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,640
enabled us to bring others in the

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,600
community

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,480
and feel apart part ownership and the

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:38,559
product really

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:42,400
and as well as helped us scale

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:45,840
there's so much more to our story but

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,840
where are we today while i'm not allowed

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:51,840
to reveal exact numbers

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,760
i can say that today we have thousands

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,720
of developers in our slack channel

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:59,200
which is a far cry from the small

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,200
handful of engineers we had initially

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,120
we have hundreds of contributors and

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,240
contributions coming into the framework

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,960
from across

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,559
the company and the framework powers

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,679
thousands of automated

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:13,760
pipeline builds every single day

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,159
bingo has come a long way and it's

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,240
amazing to see how it's grown

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,240
but what lessons can you take away on

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,200
perhaps your journey

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,000
to growing an inner source product i'm

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,039
going to hand it off

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,679
to arthur all right

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:31,919
uh i mean the first thing to say is

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,799
thanks roderick uh now everybody knows

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,320
my embarrassing

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:38,480
syntax error story but

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,159
as roderick was saying our inner source

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,559
journey was a winding

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,240
and honestly sometimes fraught journey

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,400
but what we really wanted to do

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,600
by sharing it with you is we hope to

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,919
inspire you

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,600
to go on your own inner source journey

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,640
by sharing what we think

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,280
has helped us succeed in our inner

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,679
source

00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,039
journey and some of the pitfalls that we

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,159
fell into so

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:04,960
you don't have to and we want to share

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,400
uh this and and we believe it's valuable

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,720
regardless of whether

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,559
you're just starting out uh with your

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,640
inner source product

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,880
you've started to gain traction and

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,200
people are starting to make use of it

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,240
or you've really grown to enterprise

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,039
scale and now

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,440
as roderick kind of said you're swamped

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,880
with

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:28,720
issues and support requests and we think

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:31,440
that there's three key focus areas

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,640
that helped us build a successful inner

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,520
source product

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,559
and the first one is exactly that word

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,200
product

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,400
thinking about what you're working on

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,640
not as a project

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,600
to just finish wrap up and move on to

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,159
something else

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,880
but as a product that has continual

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,080
upkeep

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,360
a road map and other product ownership

00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,080
best practices

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,799
to really get the most out of your inner

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,919
source

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:59,039
work that you're doing the next is to

00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:01,760
focus on the user

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,039
and again just like any successful uh

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,280
customer product

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,080
you really need to focus on the user i

00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,559
think what's

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,520
unique and distinct with inner source is

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,400
often

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,320
the user is actually a developer so you

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,520
really need to focus on the developer

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,080
experience

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,799
versus just a customer user experience

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,400
and those are

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:24,960
distinctly different and finally

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,760
just like what makes any open source

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,640
project

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,720
successful contributors are going to be

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,679
key to the success of your inner source

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,000
product

00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,919
and as roderick said the whole point of

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,240
inner source is to bring

00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,480
many of the lessons learned from the

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,240
open source world into the enterprise

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,720
and again this is where contributors are

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,480
key so let's dive in

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:50,960
first to product we believe

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,320
that what helped bingo succeed and what

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,440
we think many inner source

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,120
products can succeed is by

00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,640
finding the ones that scratch your own

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,400
itch often

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,000
these are the ones that have the most

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,440
staying power because

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,720
they're addressing a organizational pain

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,240
point or something that

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,400
people find cumbersome and

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,080
once you invest in these these are the

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,120
things that will start to scale

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,200
and honestly and often address issues

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,400
across the organization right not just

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,240
in a specific

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,039
line of business the next as you start

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,720
to grow

00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,240
right so this is you know you've you've

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,159
found something that scratches your

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,600
niche now you've invested it's starting

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,559
to get bigger

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,600
and you're scaling more uh teams i think

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,440
at that point

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,600
it was really critical for us and we

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,000
believe in many cases to define

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,679
what your core principles are because as

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,440
you take on more people

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,679
they're going to be new to the culture

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,720
of your inner source product

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,400
and so knowing what the core principles

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,520
are what the expectations are

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,520
in this product will help people succeed

00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,360
when they make contributions and new

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,159
teams that on board to it

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,760
in our case one of like we really care

00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,679
about developer experience

00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,360
and an example of one of our core

00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,440
principles was that

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,360
error messages should be clear and

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,000
actionable and guide the user on how to

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,760
fix it

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,960
and that was just one of many

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:23,679
many inner source principles that we

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:28,240
wrote down for our bingo product

00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:31,840
and the next one is actually focusing on

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:34,799
the as you scale to enterprise level

00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,080
is to figure out how to make major

00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,400
changes to the product

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,600
while still keeping the big picture in

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,520
mind

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,760
and this is where we actually learned

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,360
from the open source community like russ

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,799
lang or swift lang

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,960
and others uh that a rfc process a

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:54,159
request for comments

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,520
do the ability to not only and you know

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,720
in these coveted times

00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,320
make better use of written documentation

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,159
right rather than a meeting where

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,760
everybody leaves and everybody had a

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,960
slightly different interpretation of

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,240
what we agreed to

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:11,279
right you write you write it down what

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:14,720
major change you want to make and then

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:17,120
have that reviewed by people who

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,520
have originally set those different

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,799
defined core principles down

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:24,480
and try to keep major changes to your

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,880
inner source product going in the

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,120
direction that you expect but

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,559
gives the ability for everybody to

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,520
contribute ideas

00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:35,039
and approaches and again as you get to

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,640
that enterprise scale

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,279
the other big thing to keep in mind is

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,440
to not lose sight of the details

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,320
right as you really get to that point

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,960
you can lose

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,600
the person in the metaphorical hills

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,400
here

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,799
and that's developer experience of that

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,200
in

00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,640
engineer is really what's going to keep

00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,240
the goodwill going

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,320
and get people excited about

00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,799
contributing and using your inner source

00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,000
product so and i'll i'll be totally

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,559
honest right once you get

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,200
to that scale it is easy to lose sight

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,960
of that

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,120
and so oftentimes you need to remind

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,720
yourself hey we we really need to sit

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,440
down with engineers do an empathy

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,440
interview

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,760
and make sure that we're still

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,600
addressing their core needs

00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,200
so from a product perspective quick

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,240
summary what we think helped us be

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,240
successful

00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,279
finding products that scratch your own

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,039
itch

00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,799
defining the core principles as you

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,799
start to scale and get larger

00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,640
and that enterprise scale to try to keep

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:31,200
the direction

00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,600
is to introduce rfcs and not to lose

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,760
sight of the details

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,080
as we move to the next focus point the

00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,520
user as i said one of the things that's

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,440
unique about inner source

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,799
products is that they're often focused

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,360
on the developer

00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,840
and what we found really helped us early

00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,480
on

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,279
as roderick kind of alluded to was that

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,159
white glove

00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,120
support so sitting down with the

00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,840
engineer

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,159
working through an issue troubleshooting

00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,720
it

00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,760
and also showing them here's how it like

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,480
as you're sitting with them

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,880
here's how it works inside uh here's

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,919
some pro tips on using the product

00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,200
that really started to help build up a

00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,159
lot of goodwill

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,200
and honestly led to better advocates who

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,080
helped us scale

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,760
and expand not only support but also the

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,880
reach of the inner source product i

00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,320
still remember

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,480
one engineer who's actually still

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,559
engaged just

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,760
was so blown away by how much faster

00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,159
they could get things done

00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,760
with bingo and they were advocates

00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:33,279
across their division

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:35,600
and really helped fuel that growth

00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,960
but the thing is as you start to grow

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,679
what you're going to find

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,159
is the manual touch points the different

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,360
parts

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,320
of your uh of your inner source product

00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,159
that require

00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:49,840
i don't know a manual step to onboard or

00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,200
some manual processes they're going to

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,679
start to really grind

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,559
and bring friction to anything that

00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,399
you're trying to do

00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,559
just because you're really starting to

00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:00,640
scale in our example

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,240
it actually took 20 to 30 steps to

00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,039
onboard somebody on

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,520
bingo early on and those were done

00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:09,919
manually editing like a really gnarly

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,720
jenkins regular expression it was not

00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,200
pretty

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,000
and we actually stepped back and took

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,799
the time

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,360
to totally automate that process to the

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,360
point

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,440
where it's now a slack app that

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:24,159
developers just chat with the bot

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,960
get fully onboarded and we never even

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,840
look at it

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,520
so that freed us up to focus on fixing

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,799
bugs and adding features

00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,679
so automate those frequent manual touch

00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,559
points that are

00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,880
frequent and common and as you start to

00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,200
get

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,039
to that enterprise scale when i

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,159
mentioned not losing sight

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,960
of the details as you grow one common

00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,559
practice

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:50,720
in the industry at large is to gauge the

00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:53,600
net promoters for the nps

00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,000
of your customers and see how happy are

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,159
they

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,120
with your product and what you really

00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,399
want to do

00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:03,679
is build up more promoters people who

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:05,120
rate your product as 9 or 10 when you

00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,240
ask them would you recommend this to a

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,840
colleague or friend

00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,120
right and you this running these surveys

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,039
on a regular basis

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,200
gives you an opportunity to find the

00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:17,840
people who are detractors

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,919
and try to hear out do empathy

00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,320
interviews with them understand

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,000
where they're struggling but then also

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,799
empower the promoters

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,080
to not only engage in using your product

00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,080
but advocate for it

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,120
help and support and as roderick said

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,960
maybe become

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:37,440
trusted contributors so

00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,919
one key focus point for us was focusing

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,480
on the developer which is often the user

00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,559
and

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,640
we found what helped us succeed was

00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,840
early on focusing on the white glove

00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,679
support

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,120
automating the frequent touch points as

00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,399
we started to scale

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,120
and including nps and net promoter score

00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,360
survey

00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,960
as we started to scale at enterprise

00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,559
level

00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,559
moving on to contributors and

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,559
contributors are really the lifeblood of

00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:05,279
an inner source product as they are

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,679
the lifeblood of an open source product

00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,640
and

00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,159
we engage contributors early on by

00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,360
building

00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:13,440
transparency into the inner source

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,840
product that we were building

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,120
we built everything in the open we did

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,640
code reviews in the open

00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,480
tickets etc and what the magic

00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,279
that happened from that was i still

00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:28,640
remember random engineers in canada just

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:31,840
jumping in to a pull request or an issue

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:34,000
or an rfc proposal and providing really

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,480
unique and insightful feedback

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,640
that really helped us make a better

00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,039
product in the end

00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,080
as we started to scale and get larger as

00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,640
roderick mentioned

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,360
the in-person boot camps and in-person

00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,600
training

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,520
really helped us scale and i think

00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,200
oftentimes when we do these boot camps

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:54,159
we focus on the

00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,240
how like why why how how are you doing

00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:59,120
something how do you use the product

00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,279
but i think one of the most valuable

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,559
things you can do with these boot camps

00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:04,880
and you know when we can do them in

00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:09,360
person or even over zoom right now

00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:11,840
is in infusing the culture the why

00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,600
behind your inner source product because

00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,399
that's going to provide the most value

00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,720
long term

00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:18,559
so focusing on those core principles

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,799
showing people how do we actually

00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,760
think through these problems because

00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:24,880
every

00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:28,080
product has a somewhat unique culture

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:30,240
and if you want to have a consistent

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,519
and well thought out product you want a

00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,159
consistent culture

00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,640
and a consistent way of building it to

00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,399
help

00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,919
push it forward and that's what you

00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,240
really want to infuse

00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,760
in these boot camps and in person trade

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,760
training

00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,159
and as you get to enterprise scale as

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,880
roderick mentioned what we found helped

00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,120
us scale

00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,399
is to really build that trusted

00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,880
contributor model

00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:54,960
and start to empower engineers to own

00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,120
parts of the ecosystem because

00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,519
honestly as you start to get to that

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,240
level no one person can hold it all in

00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,360
their head

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,039
no one person can keep up on all the

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:08,080
pull requests and you really need

00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:11,360
those trusted lieutenants to go forward

00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,960
and see to the future success of

00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,600
components and that frees

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,840
your headspace up to focus on the next

00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,000
thing

00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,159
and again at the enterprise scale

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,039
another big thing that we feel helped us

00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,840
succeed

00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:26,880
is focusing on recognition you'd be

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,760
surprised

00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,559
how far something as simple as sending a

00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,480
thank you note

00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:34,960
to that contributor and see seeing their

00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,360
manager how far that goes because

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,880
you know unlike open source we all have

00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,080
managers that we report

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,320
to and you as the employee feels

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,159
really great when your manager knows

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,600
that you did valuable work and people

00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:50,080
are recognizing it

00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,840
so just a simple thank you note really

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,559
goes a long way

00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,320
so again contributors are the lifeblood

00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,240
of an inner source product

00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,440
and what we found helped us succeed

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,240
early on was

00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,760
building in the open being transparent

00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,000
as we scaled inner

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,679
in-person training and boot camps and

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,159
finally at the enterprise scale

00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,480
a trusted contributor model and really

00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:15,440
not forgetting about recognition

00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,840
so those were the three focus points

00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,320
that

00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,519
we feel helped us succeed in our inner

00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,720
source journey

00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:25,840
but this wouldn't uh be it wasn't all

00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,840
roses and sunshine we of course had some

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,919
lessons learned we bumped our heads

00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,600
and if roderick and i could jump into

00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,760
that delorean

00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,640
you saw in the beginning and go back and

00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,679
tell ourselves

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,720
uh what to look out for and assuming we

00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,519
listened

00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,840
what we would tell ourselves is early on

00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:47,919
focus on documentation

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:50,640
make documentation a key part of your

00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,000
definition of done because if you don't

00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,559
keep the documentation up to

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,720
date you don't write that documentation

00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:58,960
it really comes back and haunts you

00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,000
and i'll be the first to admit that many

00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,960
developers don't

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,360
read documentation but even writing it

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,519
down

00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,440
and being able to quickly link to it

00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,919
rather than re-explaining

00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,919
the same thing over and over can really

00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:13,359
go a long way to reduce that support

00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:16,000
burden

00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:18,240
as we started to scale and get larger we

00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,639
would tell ourselves to

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,879
keep up with the code quality and keep

00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,440
up with updates

00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,240
you know it's it's easy to forget or

00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,639
don't forget but

00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,440
kind of oh i'll update terraform a bit

00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,000
later oh

00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,480
i'll update this a bit later or oh okay

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,159
we'll

00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,520
let this go through and we'll clean it

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,760
up later and

00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,800
as you start to build up that technical

00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,079
debt it

00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,839
really starts to slow you down in

00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,359
moving fast with your inner source

00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:49,040
product just like it does

00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:52,000
with you know consumer product as well

00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,760
so the quality and health of your

00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,599
product is the foundation

00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,440
on which you build it you build

00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,520
everything so it's really critical to

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,880
keep that well maintained

00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,680
and finally uh as we got to enter price

00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,000
scale

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,720
we we would remind ourselves to keep

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,200
evolving

00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,359
the contributor model right what you

00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,480
decide early on is not necessarily going

00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,480
to work when you get

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,680
to hundreds of engineers thousands of

00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,560
engineers so

00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,440
be mindful that it's okay to sometimes

00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,800
let go

00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:25,680
or it's okay to change it and improve

00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,079
and just make necessary changes because

00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:30,160
otherwise you can't scale

00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,680
so those are our lessons learned and

00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,119
things that we would watch out for if we

00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,440
did it again

00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,200
more documentation early on keeping up

00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,320
with the code quality as we

00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:42,160
scaled and continuing uh evolving the

00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,960
contributor model

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,599
and this wouldn't be a meeting of

00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,119
fintech

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,720
organizations if we didn't have

00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,680
something that looks like an excel

00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,880
spreadsheet

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:58,079
so here's a quick summary of everything

00:35:52,880 --> 00:36:00,320
we just talked about thank you very much

00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,760
uh my name is arthur mulson i'm a

00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:05,680
distinguished engineer

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:08,400
capital one and i'm roderick i'm also a

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,079
distinguished engineer capital one

00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,079
thank you arthur and rodrick for a

00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,200
terrific presentation sorry go ahead are

00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,920
there you're gonna say

00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,200
oh i was just wrapping up uh just here's

00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,599
a few of the resources

00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,480
uh links to the slide the slides

00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,560
themselves

00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,760
links to the inner source common

00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,480
patterns that

00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,880
uh roderick mentioned early on uh the

00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,920
book

00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,119
etc and then just the credits so thank

00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,560
you

00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:36,480
thank you so much um so this uh

00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,920
this edition of the open source

00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,040
readiness project

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,400
meeting uh was co-sponsored by the inner

00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,440
source commons

00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,200
group we have claire dillon and denise

00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,160
cooper with us from intersource commons

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,079
they've been

00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,720
working with us on co-producing every

00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:54,960
other open source readiness meeting

00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,040
because we've we've found that inner

00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,000
sources is a big area of interest among

00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:01,119
our members

00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,720
um we've also just announced uh the

00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,400
launching of the intersource special

00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,400
interest group at finnos

00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,599
and so i'm going to put some links in

00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,359
chat um

00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:11,359
about that so that you can get more

00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,839
information and join the mailing list

00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,800
and

00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:16,640
and check out some of the um the uh

00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,079
information in the github repo

00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,000
uh now i'm going to turn it over to

00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,880
denise cooper from intersource commons

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,560
who's going to

00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,560
leave the discussion with roderick and

00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,839
arthur about their presentations

00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,440
denise take it away hi there um thanks

00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:32,000
guys i knew you would be great

00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,880
and you were so so thank you so much for

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,640
that

00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:39,520
um and i find it an interesting story

00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:42,000
because i was sort of involved in the

00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:44,880
early days of capital one thinking about

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,160
inner source along with one of my apache

00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,560
colleagues who was working

00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,280
there at the time in the fellow program

00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,800
and

00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:55,839
listening to him talk about how

00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:58,480
much pushback he was getting um

00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:00,400
it it's really you know ingratiating to

00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,839
find out that you guys got there

00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,079
and i think the magic was probably the

00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:07,440
cicd

00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:10,320
as a pathway in um

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,960
i think you pretty much said that um did

00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,119
were you aware of earlier efforts before

00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:18,000
that this project started that you guys

00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:21,680
got involved with

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,880
yeah so we've had um we've had

00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:27,119
a number of so this pipeline framework

00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,599
wasn't actually our first air source

00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:32,000
um product if you will we've actually

00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,640
had a number of smaller

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,720
products that had an inner source kind

00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,480
of

00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,560
feel to it this was a little bit

00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:45,440
different because we actually had to

00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,440
it was more of a we had higher level

00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,040
sponsorship if you will from the

00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,920
executive level to

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,720
make this a enterprise inner source

00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,280
product

00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,000
and so that really kind of accelerated

00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,440
and

00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,640
part of the reason why we were panicking

00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,200
and trying to figure out how do we do

00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,240
these

00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:05,760
how we would make this actually work um

00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:09,040
so it's been a journey

00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,800
for for capital one we've you know

00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,079
i've been at the company for quite some

00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,960
time i've seen us

00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,280
actually everything was closed book you

00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,000
know

00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,720
everything was offshore took forever to

00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,800
release

00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,560
and then kind of seeing where we are now

00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,480
where we've actually

00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,760
into kind of arthur's point have more

00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,839
transparency and what's

00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,359
was what's happening within the company

00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:32,320
and being able to

00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,640
contribute to and influence products has

00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,720
been

00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:38,480
a really um huge transformation for us

00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,160
yeah no you definitely got there and

00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,599
that's really exciting but the reason

00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,160
i'm asking the question the way i

00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:46,320
am is because one of the leading causes

00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,440
in my opinion of failure of intersource

00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,480
programs

00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:54,000
is unrealistic time time

00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:55,760
duration expectations on the part of

00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,520
the senior managers that are that are

00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,640
usually backing the thing

00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:04,079
um it takes a while and

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,480
a lot of that is finding the magic itch

00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:09,280
that everybody has to scratch which is

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:12,800
why ci cd has been so popular as an

00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,560
inroad because it's the hotness now um

00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,000
if you know 10 years ago it would have

00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,800
been agile would have been the way that

00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,440
you get in

00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,119
inner source and you know right but um

00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,160
so i'm really glad you guys found it but

00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,599
i want to just

00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,319
for the people that are watching i want

00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:28,240
you to know that most of the time

00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:29,599
it's going to be a longer road than you

00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,480
think yeah they're

00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:34,079
definitely you know all along the way

00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,040
you can see those small

00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,720
wins that you can that you can celebrate

00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,800
but then there's also the problem of

00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,319
once the company comes to decide that

00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,800
this is a good idea

00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:45,680
how the heck are you going to scale it

00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,680
and in

00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,040
my experience watching several companies

00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,200
do this now

00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,160
the a lot of the problem is that the

00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,800
people who

00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,599
usually prove to the company that it

00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,400
works

00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,880
are not the people who specialize in

00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,720
communications inside the company

00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,560
and so figuring out i always tell

00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,160
companies if this is going well you're

00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,480
in the middle of your first experiment

00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:11,760
and you're already really jazzed by all

00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:13,839
means bring in a comms expert right then

00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,440
to learn how to communicate it to the

00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:16,800
rest of the company because it's not

00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,599
going to be simple

00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,240
agreed so how did you guys do that how

00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,880
did you

00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:26,160
donate this problem denise i've got a

00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:28,160
really interesting point here as well

00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,400
which is how do you get that senior

00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:35,280
management

00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:38,960
buy-in yeah it's interesting right so

00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:43,680
part of the buy-in was um senior leaders

00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:46,839
saw the re you know the

00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:48,079
redundancy right the inefficiency in the

00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:51,200
organization

00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:53,200
like this this kept popping up

00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,359
teams are spending so much time

00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:58,400
reinventing the wheel

00:41:55,359 --> 00:42:00,640
and how do we bring these

00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,760
these folks who are constantly building

00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,359
these things

00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,880
from the ground up together to work

00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:08,000
together right so

00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:11,119
it was partially us having a great idea

00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,000
of wanting to automate our processes but

00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,440
also you know pitching the idea hey

00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,480
there's so much

00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,880
um waste going on in the environment

00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,079
that if we all kind of collaborate

00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,720
together we would

00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,800
be a lot more successful and so you know

00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,119
you translate that to dollars

00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,079
right to things that actually affect the

00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,800
company and

00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:34,480
and you have a business case to move

00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,200
forward

00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,839
yeah i think i think it's really like

00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,839
once

00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:42,560
once they see the value i mean

00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:46,160
oftentimes with senior leaders

00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:47,119
you can pitch them an idea or you can

00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,040
bring them hey

00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,880
i've already got this working right it's

00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,200
the ask for forgiveness no permission

00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,680
right

00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,599
i got this working check this out we can

00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:58,720
actually deploy to production

00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:00,800
in a day rather than a month which

00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,760
is how long it takes today right and

00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,480
it's that

00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:07,040
that ability to show something that

00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,760
works that really helps drive

00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:11,280
uh buy-in from senior leaders if they

00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,800
care about the growth of the company

00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,520
ultimately which

00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,160
what we've seen in jp morgan i've seen

00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,839
is

00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,599
we've got a number of big projects that

00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:22,240
have been successful

00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:23,920
but it's the ones where the manager who

00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,680
actually within his division have

00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,480
developed a piece of code

00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,680
that's not his interest that's the

00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,440
challenge you've got something that

00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,839
actually is a really good idea but no

00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,520
one's willing to actually sponsor it

00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:37,839
and i just wonder whether you add any

00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,680
any techniques that you use

00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:42,240
i think we really need a central panel

00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,599
with resource that would take that on

00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,280
and say well look if you're not willing

00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:46,480
to do it we have a central team

00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,079
do you have anything like that where you

00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,960
have a team that will soak up those

00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:50,960
ideas and

00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,480
take that ownership yeah i think he's

00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,960
asking if you have an inner source

00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:57,440
program office

00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,280
which we do now but we didn't at the

00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,119
time right rodrick like

00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,119
when this happened early on i think

00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,240
inner source was more of like a word

00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,359
that we used

00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:09,520
to say hey contributions are welcome

00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:11,920
and then i think the inner source office

00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:15,359
came a bit later after

00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:17,599
we saw all of the uptake of inner source

00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:18,640
products yeah we have so we have a we

00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:21,839
have open source

00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:23,040
office and we also have an inner source

00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:26,160
um

00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:28,079
uh community if you will that's driven

00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:31,520
through from architecture so

00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:34,160
a lot of this is hey you know how to

00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,040
optimize how do you have common patterns

00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,680
for how you

00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,480
build software with the company and so a

00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,400
lot of

00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,920
these ideas are brewing out of the

00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:45,839
architecture

00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:48,000
um division or area right so

00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:49,040
um and that's that's the place where we

00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,880
actually

00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:57,200
talk through ideas patterns

00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:59,680
and and really foster the collaboration

00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,599
within the organization but yeah to

00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:04,000
arthur's point we didn't have that

00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:05,359
but we we now have that and there's been

00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,760
you know

00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:08,640
um because there's value and and having

00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,560
these

00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,920
these forms for folks because there's

00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,880
always ideas out there

00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,880
right and and a lot of folks have a lot

00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,480
of engineers have similar ideas is how

00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,880
do we bring these people together so

00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,560
that

00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,720
yeah but you're talking about

00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:25,520
democratizing that process so you

00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:27,440
are skipping levels usually to have the

00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:30,880
real conversations and that's

00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:31,520
often a cultural no-no that you have to

00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,480
break through

00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:36,079
you have to do it um but i i want to get

00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,680
back to some of the questions that were

00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:40,000
asked during the talk because we had

00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:43,119
people sending really good questions in

00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:46,319
so um there's a question about

00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:47,280
sort of a baseline what was a lead time

00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:49,359
for a commit

00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,880
uh deployed to production before you

00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:54,560
guys did bingo

00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:57,760
like what kind of time did you save

00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:00,800
um so we were it was actually

00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,720
probably a quarter to get something into

00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,119
production prior to having our framework

00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:06,079
like

00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:07,200
it literally took a lot of coordination

00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:11,440
time

00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:13,680
um and steps to get something else and

00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:16,240
what we've part of the part of building

00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:18,480
the framework was also figuring out our

00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,520
like what are the gates that software

00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,359
needs to go through

00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,200
to feel comfortable hey this change can

00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,760
actually go out in an automated fashion

00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:27,440
so

00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:30,079
making sure we have the right testing

00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,800
in place and so forth so it took a while

00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:34,079
to get

00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:35,119
to get that built out um but once a team

00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:38,640
has that

00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:41,119
foundation in place today it takes them

00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,680
like to arthur's point they can deploy

00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:44,640
within

00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,119
a day sometimes within an hour depending

00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,560
on how

00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:52,079
how fast the change needs to to go out

00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:55,520
um so yeah we were we were very slow

00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:56,480
and we've we've and even today i think

00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,480
um

00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,079
you know an hour is probably not the

00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,520
fastest

00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:03,520
in my mind i would love to go a little

00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:07,359
bit faster than that but um

00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:10,560
it's been it's been a um

00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:12,800
a journey for sure yeah that's great

00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,240
okay here's somebody who wants to know

00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:18,000
about and

00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:19,520
denise just to that to that point

00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,520
to what roderick was saying and i think

00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:25,440
to reiterate what you said about

00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:29,040
how this takes time it really took

00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:30,480
maybe three two three years just to even

00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,720
get to that point

00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,000
right right and then as it scales we're

00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,839
not even fully scaled

00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,200
enterprise-wide and it's been over four

00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:39,359
years since

00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,319
bingo started so that's right yeah so

00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:43,440
these things take

00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:44,480
time we have to make it well known out

00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,520
in the industry that

00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:49,920
we're not making um i used to see the

00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:52,800
promises that were being made by agile

00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,640
uh trainers and they always seemed

00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,520
really ill advised to me because i never

00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,599
saw

00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:59,200
that happen in real time and it made

00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:01,920
some people unhappy

00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:03,280
so i i want to be really clear this is a

00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,640
cultural change

00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:08,720
that is going to take some time um but

00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:10,880
but the rewards are huge so it's worth

00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,400
it okay here's somebody who is wants to

00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,800
know how connected

00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,440
the inner source journey that cap one is

00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,800
to

00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,800
doing real open source

00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:27,359
um so they are separate today

00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,119
um uh but i actually know the guy who

00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:32,160
runs our open source

00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:35,359
office program

00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:38,640
and we constantly have

00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:39,520
um interactions um and talk through kind

00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,839
of

00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,880
the challenges right so we've as we were

00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:45,200
scaling up

00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,200
inner sourcing we were we wanted to

00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,160
replicate some of the ideas that were in

00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,880
the open source

00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,520
space as well and so we have we have

00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,480
that

00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:56,000
constant you know back and forth of

00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,599
sharing ideas

00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,839
um but in terms of hey let's

00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:03,760
take what we have in our source and

00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:04,400
making an open source product like i

00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,160
don't

00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,760
you know that's that's a whole separate

00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:10,640
conversation

00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:12,319
but we do try to share ideas and make

00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:16,000
sure

00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:19,440
we're both learning from each other

00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:22,720
i think a big a big difference i see

00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:25,920
in inner source and open source is um

00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:28,079
i mean open source is a lot larger

00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,440
um a lot more people a lot more

00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:32,319
diversity across

00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,440
different companies right the culture is

00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:36,319
going to be different

00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,839
and inner sources is you know within

00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:40,240
your company's wall so

00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:42,160
you have a lot more influence there but

00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:45,359
there's also a lot more pressure

00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:48,640
to to ship and get things done quickly

00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:51,520
um uh just just from

00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,160
from experience so i don't know if that

00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:55,200
helps

00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:56,319
at all yeah i think i i tell people all

00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,040
the time that i see

00:49:56,319 --> 00:50:01,040
it helping people stuck inside

00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:04,480
proprietary organizations to

00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:06,319
frame better ideas about how to

00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,920
collaborate in the open source space

00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:09,599
i saw that happen at paypal and i've

00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,880
seen it happen a few other places as

00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:13,280
well

00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,160
and there are many open source activists

00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,000
who have been

00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:18,000
hesitant to get involved in inner source

00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,559
because it feels counterproductive

00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,839
because its prime directive is not more

00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,160
open source

00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:25,200
right and and as you guys know my thing

00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:27,760
i have two things

00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,640
one is we have to save engineers

00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,880
engineers

00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:32,559
we need more maintainers than we have by

00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,400
a scale of magnitude

00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:35,920
that the school system and natural

00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,559
growth of open source is not going to

00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,559
address

00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:39,760
and we and the kind of people that want

00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:42,400
to do maintenance

00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,119
are not the rabbits of the world right

00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,880
there

00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:46,160
and that a lot of them live in

00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,640
corporations

00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,440
and getting them to understand why

00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,040
maintenance

00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,800
would you know how to do that in a

00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,599
collaborative way and that it's not

00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,040
terrible

00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:57,280
a lot of people go in thinking they're

00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:59,280
going to hate it and end up loving it

00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,040
and and then they become potential

00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,079
people that might decide to do open

00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:05,359
source

00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:06,640
you know so anyway let me let me move on

00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:08,240
because we only have

00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,240
seven minutes left and we still have

00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:13,280
some really good questions waiting

00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:14,480
um okay what are some concrete

00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,280
recommendations for

00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,559
enterprise architecture as opposed to

00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,319
development

00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:23,040
um to champion inner source in other

00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:24,400
words what should the architects of a

00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:28,720
given company be

00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,720
doing to enable this

00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:35,599
yeah so one of the unique things about

00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:38,720
architects right they

00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:41,520
at least at capital one there's we have

00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:43,200
different levels of architects right um

00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:45,839
but they are the folks who

00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,880
kind of see the big picture right they

00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:49,599
kind of

00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,800
see the patterns being developed across

00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:53,839
the company or

00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:58,240
across with within a certain domain

00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:59,599
right um so even in my current role as

00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,440
this distinguished engineer i'm

00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:05,760
constantly seeing

00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:09,119
hey someone has this idea um

00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:11,119
how someone else has a similar idea like

00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:12,240
pulling these things together and and

00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:15,359
thinking bigger

00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:16,319
picture of okay how does how can i

00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:17,920
connecting people

00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:19,680
connect right how can i connect people

00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:22,559
as well as connect ideas

00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:24,480
and solutions right so i think

00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:25,440
architects has a plays a huge role in

00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,079
that because

00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:30,319
they have that unique visibility across

00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:33,359
the organization

00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:36,559
and and that's really like

00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:38,720
and and leaders executives listen to

00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:40,160
architects right they value their

00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:42,079
opinion on how things should be

00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:45,599
developed and built and so

00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:46,000
i think that's a key area for for inner

00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:49,040
source

00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:52,160
to to to to

00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,559
kind of um plant that seed if you will

00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,680
and

00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:58,400
and grow yeah and i i i'd say that you

00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:01,440
really want architects to

00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,559
talk about the value of reuse i didn't

00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,720
get people

00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:05,760
reusing and i think one of the most

00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:09,200
valuable things

00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:11,839
architects could do is just like the

00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,720
um martin fowler and thoughtworks puts

00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:16,400
out that

00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:18,240
uh tech radar every uh

00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,160
every six months you could have a

00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:22,480
similar tech radar

00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,920
internally in your company with you know

00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:27,440
adopt hold

00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:29,760
uh trial etc that model but for

00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:32,000
the both the vendor products that you're

00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,680
using but also the inner source products

00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,160
within your organization

00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,960
and that can really help promote that

00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:40,800
reuse

00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:43,280
in uh that inner source culture

00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,480
yeah thank you that's great okay this is

00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,839
the last of the

00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,599
queued up questions and it's probably

00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:49,440
going to take the rest of the time

00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:52,160
so i want to before i ask it i want to

00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:53,920
say um thanks again for doing this great

00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:56,640
talk for us guys and also

00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:57,040
thank you for your service as leaders of

00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,839
um

00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:00,960
anderson's common sick phineas inner

00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:03,760
source sig

00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,760
which of course is just starting and you

00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:07,040
know as a necessary piece of that puzzle

00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,480
we had to find

00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,640
other phoenix members that were

00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,000
interested in this and capital one was

00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,839
very quick to say

00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,040
we really want to help with this so

00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:18,319
thank you so much

00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:19,040
it's it's great um all right so this is

00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:22,800
a question

00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:24,559
about um regular regulated industries

00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:27,839
and being in a bank

00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:29,760
okay so and some of it and i find

00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:31,440
because you know i worked for a

00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:34,160
regulated bank right

00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,760
um there is some misconception and some

00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:38,240
really old-school thinking

00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,880
about what that means regulated industry

00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,480
but

00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,640
let me frame the question then you guys

00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,799
can have at it how do you address

00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:46,799
the all the code should be private since

00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:49,040
it has it could have secrets in it

00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:50,400
problem and then how do you address the

00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,920
challenge where engineers are assigned

00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,920
to a particular project and not

00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:55,440
allocated time to work on other things

00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:58,400
and i think i think it's not so much

00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:00,720
time as access to the secrets that

00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:03,280
he's trying to get at so have at that

00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,280
one guys

00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:11,920
yeah um it's it's the challenge for sure

00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:15,200
um even for us um

00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:17,520
and so these this

00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:19,280
i'll address the secret thing first one

00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:21,200
is um

00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:23,359
like i think there's patterns for making

00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,400
sure secrets aren't in your repository

00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:26,799
like we follow

00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,839
those best practices to make sure like

00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:30,960
credentials and

00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:31,280
and you know things that that shouldn't

00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,480
be

00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:35,520
exposed aren't exposed but the source

00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,880
code itself

00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:40,480
right we don't consider that

00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,240
secret if you will if it's within the

00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:45,839
company's walls

00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:49,200
um because that's like

00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:51,520
everyone is trying to solve uh

00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,480
a problem and get things done and write

00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,640
if you and

00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,520
if you close things off it's actually

00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,440
creates

00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,720
more problems than it does opening it up

00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,319
right like in fact

00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:02,160
the fact that you have the code

00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:03,839
available for

00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,280
you know our security folks to look at

00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:07,520
and assess

00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:09,040
and other developers to look at and

00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:11,040
assess and say okay this

00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:13,280
looks like this could potentially have a

00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:14,880
vulnerability here like it just brings

00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,480
more transparency and it gets those

00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:20,079
issues resolved quicker

00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:22,480
so that's kind of the on the secrets

00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:24,319
space and and that's really like part of

00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,799
the value of open source right

00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:28,559
when the code is open you really benefit

00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:29,760
from the wisdom of the crowd and while

00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:32,319
it's a smaller crowd

00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,799
obviously internally you still do get

00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:36,079
people

00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:38,000
finding hey you have a you're not up to

00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:40,240
date with this library or

00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,559
you you might have a hole here and and

00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:43,280
people do actually send pull requests

00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:45,760
things up

00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,680
and if you if you save and memorialize

00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:49,839
those questions then you're showing

00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:51,440
evidence of due diligence that probably

00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:54,160
wasn't happening before

00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:56,799
yes yes right that's true that can help

00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:59,599
advocate for it

00:56:56,799 --> 00:57:00,319
yeah okay i think that we are at the top

00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:03,839
of the hour

00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:06,799
alex i i think that the timing one is is

00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:08,880
just really quick you can basically say

00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:10,000
developers don't necessarily get time to

00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:13,359
work on something

00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,520
but if they really enjoy that work

00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:17,200
they're gonna find time you know how

00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:20,160
developers are right so

00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:21,520
if you make it a pleasant and exciting

00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:24,160
process to contribute

00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:25,839
to that inner source product developers

00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,520
will make time even if their manager

00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:29,760
doesn't give them time

00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,720
yeah and i will also say that you also

00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:34,079
need

00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:35,839
a dedicated like you can't just do

00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:37,520
intersourcing with

00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:39,440
scientists hoping people will contribute

00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:42,240
you also need a team

00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:43,680
that's focused and helps the community

00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,280
make contributions so

00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:47,520
to arthur's one like if you make that

00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:50,799
process really easy

00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:52,559
you will have folks contributing um and

00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:54,000
if you reward them they'll also they'll

00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:57,200
come back and contribute again

00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:59,839
right so this is this constant uh

00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,720
instant incentive to to want to be a

00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:03,280
part of the

00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:06,480
product yeah it's so much better when

00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:09,599
people are happy with their work huh

00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:11,359
yes all right thank you so much again

00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:11,680
for this session and i hope everybody

00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:14,400
that

00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:16,079
enjoyed this will come again to the next

00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,880
one of these that we're committed to

00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:18,720
doing um

00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,920
quite a few of them in this this coming

00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,960
year and

00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,359
also go and check out

00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:25,920
innersourcecommons.org

00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:26,400
you can go there with your with your not

00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,440
work

00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:31,599
email address we don't care it's it's a

00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:34,480
it's a public resource it's a nonprofit

00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:36,640
we just want to give you the information

00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,520
so all right thank you everyone who

00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,920
joined thank you
