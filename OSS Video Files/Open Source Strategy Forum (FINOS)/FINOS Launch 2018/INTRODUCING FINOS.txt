Description: 
	Welcome to FINOS

The Fintech Open Source Foundation (FINOS)—formerly the Symphony Software Foundation—is an independent nonprofit organization promoting open innovation in the financial services industry. 

FINOS hosts collaborative Open Source software projects and working groups focused on standardizing inter-firm interactions. We help our members capture the growth opportunities of Open Source collaboration through our Open Source Readiness Program and Open Developer Platform (ODP), which support effective, compliant participation in open innovation. We also bring technologists and financial services professionals together at our events. Those events include our annual Open Source Strategy Forum (OSSF), which has become the world’s leading event focused on open innovation within the financial services community.
