trusted finis driving innovation

00:01:52,680 --> 00:02:08,709
enabling collaboration well thank you so

00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:15,100
much thank you for being here we created

00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:19,120
penis penis in Italian pronunciation it

00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:21,430
just comes in a way we believe that like

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,120
any other information in centric

00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:27,549
industry is being redefined by digital

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,769
transformation and so we believe that

00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:33,390
this industry being one of the most

00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:36,400
information centric industries out there

00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:39,510
you know it's time has come for

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,470
embracing what we call open innovation

00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:46,019
but what is exactly open innovation I

00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:49,630
you know I hate buzzword I have a

00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:52,329
developer background so let me just sort

00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:54,519
of tell you what I what we as a

00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:59,380
community thing in open innovation is

00:02:54,519 --> 00:03:01,180
it's really a way of collaborating

00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:03,640
across the firewall exchanging

00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,470
information exchanging flows of

00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,620
information with the idea of producing a

00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:11,079
better technology and this is the reason

00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,630
why we created Pinos we believe that

00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:16,120
despite many of the challenges that this

00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:18,310
industry has in collaborating this is

00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,790
the right time to embrace open

00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:24,730
innovation before I get too much into it

00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:28,090
let me send a shout out first of all to

00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:32,350
Mike and Nasdaq it is amazing to be here

00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:35,680
our foundation is focused and it's the

00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:37,840
corner of financial services and

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,840
technology and there couldn't have been

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,819
a better place to host this I mean

00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,790
someone will call you the first FinTech

00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:47,799
so I think it's pretty pertinent to be

00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:50,349

specifically to our members and our

00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:23,979
board of directors that inspired us to

00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:25,590
broaden you know what started two years

00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:28,900
ago as the symphony Software Foundation

00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,490
into something that might you know has

00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,310
the potential to change the way this

00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:36,160
industry build software I have the honor

00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:37,300
of running a board of you know some of

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,490
the most influential people in the

00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:43,210
industry and so I think we have an

00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:45,150
absolute amazing potential here to you

00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:52,270
know adopt the open-source way of

00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:55,539
collaborating as we're talking about you

00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:58,449
know members just a quick shout out I

00:04:55,539 --> 00:05:01,780
mentioned Symphony again we will not be

00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:04,800
here if we didn't have such a strong

00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:07,479
representation of all the industry and

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,729
our board and in our community and you

00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:11,979
know that's something that I inherited

00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:14,050
from the symphony Software Foundation so

00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:16,330
I want to send a shout out to the

00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,220
symphony folks who are a platinum member

00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,599
of our foundation have a program in our

00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,270
foundation and of continuing their

00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:25,470
engagement in our broader sort of a

00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:29,860
bigger Foundation a bigger umbrella

00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:33,909
finally as we announce our new brand

00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:37,120
today I want to you know I'm proud to

00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:39,190
announce that we have many new members

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:43,570
in the room growing our diverse

00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:46,539
community we just in the first quarter

00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:50,590
of the year we have at the UBS Red Hat

00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:54,490
github Thomson Reuters note source to

00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:56,050
our foundation and again for me the most

00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:59,139
important aspect that is that we're

00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:00,880
bringing together you know banks large

00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:02,350
and small fin tech vendors as

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,640
well as now we have a stronger

00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:06,940
representation from the Silicon Valley

00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:09,430
which again over the last two decades

00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:12,460
has leveraged open collaboration and

00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:14,320
open source to produce pretty much any

00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:18,010
of the most exciting pieces of

00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:20,350
innovation that we have seen and so you

00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:23,950
know I want to spend a couple of minutes

00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:26,920
today to discuss why is the right time

00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:28,540
why now why are we creating finis and

00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,900
why it's the right time for you to

00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:35,560
embrace open innovation well I think the

00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:38,110
main point is you know we have we know

00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,700
this industry has a lot of challenges in

00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,980
terms of collaborating across the

00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,900
firewall but we believe that many of the

00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:47,860
you know with many of the regulatory

00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:50,470
headaches behind us it is now you know a

00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:53,290
good time to come back you know at the

00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:55,780
offense and start innovating faster and

00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:57,700
you know what better way than you know

00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:02,200
having a crazy Italian to be offensive

00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:05,500
you know so now I'm not gonna bring up

00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:08,650
you know one of my craziest compatriots

00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:14,760
you know Christopher Columbus that would

00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:19,930
be a little bit too much but you know

00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:21,880
there is certainly something that you

00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:24,340
know is in common between what we're

00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:29,650
doing here and what he did five or six

00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:31,930
hundred years ago about 550 it's really

00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:34,900
about you know the the desire of

00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:38,830
continuous integrity in improvement the

00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:41,620
desire of going out you know we've

00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:43,810
always done it this way you know we all

00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:47,110
know again this is a very highly

00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:48,850
regulated siloed industry but thanks to

00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:50,680
our community and our members we are now

00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:53,950
trying to embrace a better way of

00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:56,380
collaborating and so this is really the

00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:57,880
fundamental spirit the brought us to the

00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:02,290
creation of phenols

00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:04,440
going out of our comfort zone I want to

00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:07,120
let that thing for a little like we're

00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,710
you know I'm let's get it out of the way

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,690
I'm not a financial services guy I just

00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:12,700
joined this industry about two years ago

00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,290
I probably don't have half of your

00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:19,900
pedigree

00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:22,720
in terms of wall street cred but you

00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,640
know I know having worked with companies

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,670
in the industry that five years ago the

00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:30,100
very concept of open sourcing financial

00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:32,290
services open source and financial

00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,570
technology would have been considered

00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:37,570
probably flat as a as a compliance

00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:39,400
violation so you know the very fact that

00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:41,560
we're here with most of the leaders of

00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:44,800
this industry talking about a new way of

00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,720
innovating to me speaks very loudly to

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:53,020
the changes that this industry is

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:55,660
undergoing and so why has financial

00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:59,380
services not embraced open collaboration

00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:01,630
to date that's sort of the answer that

00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:03,960
we want to try and give you today and

00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:07,720
that's the answer the help that Venus

00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:10,060
will give you hopefully over the next

00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:13,270
years to come you know if you think

00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:15,900
about it we know that again the Silicon

00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:18,340
Valley Giants have been collaborating

00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:22,060
incorporating on common platforms over

00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:24,010
at least the last two decades so you

00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:26,110
know this industry is one of the most

00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,430
social quote-unquote industries out

00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:29,950
there is one of the industries that

00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:32,500
could not survive without information

00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:35,890
exchange and so you know Wall Street

00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:38,050
would not be the epicenter of this world

00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:41,470
without a structured way of you know

00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:43,210
exchanging money and services which in

00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:47,350
large part are really represented by

00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:49,360
information nowadays and so you know if

00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:51,010
you think about how and we have a few of

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,870
the Silicon Valley giants here so I'm

00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:55,300
really proud to sort of have the

00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:56,200
cultural mix in our foundation but if

00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,450
you think about it

00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,210
they've been leveraging open source and

00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:04,480
open standards for the last ten years at

00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:08,530
least to build successful thriving

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:11,560
ecosystems think about Google open

00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:14,230
sourcing kubernetes think about Yahoo

00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:18,220
open sourcing Hadoop think about

00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:21,910
Facebook open sourcing Cassandra none of

00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:25,480
these large modern SAS vendors will ever

00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:27,520
want to maintain and develop by

00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,760
themselves what they're most

00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:32,920
components are they want to a mutual

00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,080
eyes the developments are reducing the

00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,060
cost there but also they want to de-risk

00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:39,010
the investment actually open sourcing

00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:42,399
your most critical components is the

00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:44,740
risking your investment the risking the

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:48,180
fact that you might just you know fall

00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:50,830
behind the curve of innovation and so I

00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:53,110
think that's sort of the main reason and

00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:55,810
the main value they were trying to bring

00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:58,660
to this industry that you know in the

00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:01,570
era of SAS in the era of platforms the

00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:03,430
value is not the code the value is the

00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:06,670
ecosystem that you're gonna build around

00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:09,490
your platform and so we hope that you

00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:11,529
know phenols can be a catalyst and sort

00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:14,950
of help solve some of these challenges

00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:18,760
that have prevented this level of open

00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:23,320
collaboration and so you know I want to

00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:25,510
just quickly touch on how well why you

00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:28,140
want to do it now and how we're gonna

00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:31,990
help you you know culturally

00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:33,550
historically I think the main reason why

00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:36,160
this industry has not embraced open

00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:39,130
innovation you know it's mainly twofold

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:43,149
regulatory headaches and you know a very

00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:44,950
highly siloed culture which you know

00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:46,600
makes you fear about a very risk-averse

00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:49,810
culture that makes you fear about IP

00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:52,440
leakage but the question is are those

00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:55,240
really unsurmountable challenges I

00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,550
believe again and that's the challenge

00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,510
that our community is bringing out there

00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:05,050
that they are not they are just a

00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:07,360
cultural limitation that we can easily

00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:10,050
overcome and how do you do that well

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,760
like in any change management process

00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:15,940
you know you need buy-in from your

00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,820
community from your end-users and trust

00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:22,600
me we have the buy-in of the developers

00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:27,070
developers love open-source what we need

00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:28,899
is the top-down buy-in from executives

00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:32,260
in these industries and that's why we're

00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:34,180
here you know you need to see the value

00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:37,720
you need to see the return of investment

00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:40,430
and you know again the reduction of risk

00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:43,100
in certain cases by actually doing

00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:45,589
source and so let me give you just two

00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,870
reasons why and we can talk about more

00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:49,220
at reception we'll probably hear from me

00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:53,300
a lot in the next couple of years

00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:55,640
hopefully but there are two reasons why

00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:58,310
I think you should consider open source

00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:01,700
as open source and open innovation as

00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:04,820
the way as a strategic way to drive your

00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:09,170
technology first of all it's cost

00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:11,089
savings you know there's a lot of known

00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,250
IP generating code that you're producing

00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:15,920
that you're maintaining and there is a

00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:20,209
an item on your bottom line

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:22,700
and if this sounds strange or you are

00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:26,149
already doing that all of you are moving

00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:28,730
in different ways to cloud so you have

00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:31,580
already understood that hardware is not

00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:33,980
a differentiator you are already

00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:36,140
understanding that 11 level playing

00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:38,810
field there it's gonna save you money

00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:40,880
rather than you know truly generating a

00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:42,700
differentiator and so the leap is not

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,980
that far we're talking here about

00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:47,570
sharing common components that are

00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:49,910
infrastructural components there are

00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:54,380
known different shaders just to be clear

00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:56,209
we want you to make money because part

00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:59,390
of that money is going to be reinvested

00:13:56,209 --> 00:14:00,500
in our foundation and in developers

00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:02,900
they're going to work in our foundation

00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:06,940
if you were not profitable we couldn't

00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:09,980
be successful the second point is talent

00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:11,839
you know in in the talent crunch in an

00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,820
industry that again on a daily basis

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,940
competes with other industry for

00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:18,920
industries for talent I think you know

00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:22,370
open source and open collaboration

00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:25,700
provides I think at least two advantages

00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:27,980
well the first one being you know again

00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:30,650
what does it mean developers love open

00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:32,450
source well they love solving complex

00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:35,120
problems that they will not be able to

00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:38,620
solve by themselves that they can not

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:42,380
only solve across the firewall and

00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:45,350
secondly just as an example I would not

00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:47,120
be here if I wasn't an open source

00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:48,529
contributor about ten years ago if I

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,320
hadn't been an open source contributor

00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:53,540
ten years ago and to be fair I would

00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,259
probably not hire a developer without

00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:58,489
saying is good

00:14:54,259 --> 00:15:00,589
account I you know that that's not gonna

00:14:58,489 --> 00:15:04,489
fly for me I need to see what you're

00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:09,350
done so it's an amazing way for making

00:15:04,489 --> 00:15:12,350
your talent stick by being able to you

00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:13,579
know so you know being fulfilled with

00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:17,929
those intrinsic motivators that

00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:20,689
developers have and so I just want to

00:15:17,929 --> 00:15:22,100
spend one or two minutes on how we're

00:15:20,689 --> 00:15:24,769
gonna do it I think we have a massive

00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:27,529
opportunity here but we recognize there

00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:30,499
is not easy this is just the beginning

00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:33,619
you know I'm not here to tell you hey we

00:15:30,499 --> 00:15:36,439
got the Silver Bullet we sold it this is

00:15:33,619 --> 00:15:39,979
the beginning of a journey and this is

00:15:36,439 --> 00:15:42,649
how we're gonna try to help this

00:15:39,979 --> 00:15:44,839
industry we see yourself being an a blur

00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:48,069
for this collaboration to happens to

00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:51,259
happen and so there are at least three

00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:53,989
you know elements that I think brought

00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:56,979
us here the first one is trusts we are

00:15:53,989 --> 00:16:00,619
an independent open-source foundation

00:15:56,979 --> 00:16:03,499
soon-to-be IRS 501 C 6 if you guys are

00:16:00,619 --> 00:16:06,049
familiar with it it's a true stamp of

00:16:03,499 --> 00:16:08,720
trust it doesn't just mean that we won't

00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:12,910
pay taxes which helps but it also means

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:17,929
that we have to operate in a certain

00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:19,879
transparent you know trusted way and so

00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:21,319
I think this is really one of the

00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:23,209
fundamental points you know we've been

00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:25,669
working for two years with these players

00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:28,160
and we gain the trust of the industry I

00:16:25,669 --> 00:16:30,980
think it also helps that again neither

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,389
me nor the team has any Allegiance or

00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,949
previous allegiance with any of these

00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:36,739
verbs we don't come from financial

00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:39,559
services I think that really helped us

00:16:36,739 --> 00:16:42,079
gain the trust of the industry secondly

00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:46,519
as we move from the Symphony Software

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:49,369
Foundation we have created a multi

00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:51,739
program foundation we're having we will

00:16:49,369 --> 00:16:53,809
have multiple separated highly

00:16:51,739 --> 00:16:55,759
independent initiatives that can focus

00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:58,369
on solving different business problems

00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,089
again we are not here to tell you what

00:16:58,369 --> 00:17:02,179
you should be doing

00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:04,839
you should be identifying areas of

00:17:02,179 --> 00:17:07,850
collaboration and we are here to help so

00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:10,189
by creating multiple programs and

00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:12,079
drawing a strong line between our board

00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:14,569
of directors and the technical

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:18,610
governance we're really making sure that

00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:22,339
we keep politics out of developers way

00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:24,319
finally you're probably familiar with

00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:27,890
other open-source foundations but we are

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:31,070
the first solely focused foundation in

00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:34,880
financial services and I think this you

00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:38,120
know has at least two main outcomes

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,820
first of all our projects will be always

00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:43,220
focused on this industry we will always

00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:46,700
be delivering value to the use cases

00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:48,980
that you care secondly as I mentioned

00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,480
before we can address specific

00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:53,960
challenges that these industries have

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,450
you know committing and collaborating on

00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,460
github it's certainly one of the ways

00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:00,799
that we want to enable these people you

00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:03,140
know this industry to actually being

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,580
able to collaborate and so we are

00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,140
putting together an open-source

00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:08,090
readiness program which we will launch

00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:10,159
later in the year we have an open

00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:13,130
developer platform that allows again

00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:14,690
it's an independent third-party instance

00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:16,370
where all of your developers can come

00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:18,950
together and collaborate sort of

00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:21,740
according to the open source way so I

00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:26,990
hope this gives you you know a little

00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:31,909
bit of an initial idea of what the huge

00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:35,330
opportunity that is in front of us time

00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:38,179
is right for open innovation you know in

00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:41,150
the past open banking used to refer to

00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:44,390
you know the hours of operation now our

00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:46,580
industry is really being redefined and

00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:48,740
I'm here to tell you that you know open

00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:52,460
source is good for your health and it's

00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:56,480
good for your career finally in

00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:59,059
conclusion you know we meant we talked a

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,860
lot about our members but our community

00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:03,740
is open to everyone this is an open

00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:06,710
source community so there is no

00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:08,809
membership fee for contributing

00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:12,770
consuming a software come to our

00:19:08,809 --> 00:19:15,289
community download our software see you

00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:17,030
know it is enterprise-grade it is spin

00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:19,210
some great so which you should be able

00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:22,090
to take value right away

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:24,610
and my hope is that then you'll you know

00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:26,860
come back and contribute because that's

00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:29,380
the best way and you know most efficient

00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:31,720
way to do so so now the ball is on your

00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:35,549
court and you are you ready for open

00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,549
innovation thank you

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,050
