thank you very much um we just finished

00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:21,320
hearing about edge X and talking to

00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:27,619
devices is that furnace what runs on

00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:30,739
devices so this comic is from 2016 and

00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:34,850
Zephyr launched in 2016 okay we start

00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:37,129
thinking about in 2015 basically all

00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:40,760
those devices talk via talk with the

00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:45,320
cloud there's a lot of potential

00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:47,539
problems that can occur okay we

00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,960
obviously don't want ransomware

00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:53,629
happening on our devices we don't want

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,780
garbage coming out of them at the AIS

00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:59,569
analyzing and then you're getting silly

00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:04,489
things happening so preventing garbage

00:00:59,569 --> 00:01:07,130
in garbage out we need to pay attention

00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:09,440
to security and we need to make sure

00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:14,330
that we're hitting at something that is

00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:16,430
going to be just you can trust so what's

00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,870
different launched we were looking at

00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:21,770
trying to make sure we have the best

00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:24,110
class our toss out there Zephyr is

00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:29,510
pretty much designed for a where Linux

00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:31,430
is just you know under Linux doesn't get

00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:34,550
images don't get smaller than about too

00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:39,530
many these days Zephyr is like you know

00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:41,450
8k by Paul K that's emphasized so you

00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:44,480
want to have something writing on these

00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:47,720
sensor is very little footprint and just

00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,790
doing what you wanted to do an asset so

00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,930
we built it right from the very start of

00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,790
the view that we want to make sure it's

00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:55,400
secured and we want to be able to take

00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:57,440
it through safety certification and this

00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:02,560
started the word has started in 2015 we

00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:05,650
launched the project in 2016 and we've

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:09,280
been fairly effective at bro

00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:13,390
community what we wanted to do a zephyr

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,550
is it's an artist we wanted to make sure

00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:18,580
that we could actually have an effective

00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:20,230
sustainable project we entered this

00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,970
space with a lot of other our solutions

00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,740
out there

00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:25,690
proprietary as well as open but we

00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:27,670
didn't have that consistent focus going

00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:29,500
on you had to go to proprietor if you

00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:32,830
wanted security we wanted to be able to

00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,180
have security in the Oh resource that

00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:36,880
it's across architectures as Maori

00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,260
textures that involved in it now and we

00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,080
do have the neutral governance and we

00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:43,470
have the Apache licensing on it that was

00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,540
the choice of the initial founders and

00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:49,990
it is very modular so you just compile

00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:52,750
they might need and we actually have it

00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:56,230
ready now for products and I'll go into

00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,700
all the details about that later but we

00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:59,890
followed a lot of the same lessons we

00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:03,070
learned from Linux and one of those is

00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:04,750
using the long term support and so that

00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,920
is what we had me from products and

00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:09,010
we're actually trying to take it to some

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,660
certain certifications it actually has

00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,489
gone through a Bluetooth certification

00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:15,580
already the Martius

00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:18,489
so just to give you a bit of a feel on

00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:20,950
the last presentation we saw Billy

00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:22,720
you've seen TCP you see you didn't see

00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:26,080
can there but that's another protocol

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,489
and continued so forth so this is what

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,630
it connects up to things like Edge has

00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:34,209
two projects like Ajax we've got but we

00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:36,370
also talked right to the hardware so

00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:39,670
there's a variety of systems that are

00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:41,590
available here separates got a very good

00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,820
Bluetooth Low Energy stack let's write

00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,860
that one the best in the industry they

00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:47,140
Bluetooth SIG is using it for developing

00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:51,730
the next generations are pretty much

00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:53,020
currently at there there is a fairly

00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:58,360
wide set of

00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:59,740
read as well as posix support for it so

00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:05,710
it's a pretty complete solution at this

00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:09,070
point back when we started the way been

00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:12,130
working approaching this is we wanted to

00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:14,590
keep the active development going that

00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:16,330
you have saloons community you want to

00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,220
paste quick motivation you want to be

00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:21,190
able to put things out every quarter and

00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,080
around recently release kittens but when

00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,700
we wanted to start to stabilize it like

00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,670
the list Colonel Steve cos melty has

00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:30,550
every year for his ever where every two

00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:32,320
years right now and we're committing to

00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,690
keep it up to date for two years and put

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,790
security updates there and then part of

00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:40,570
that were slowly and surely transforming

00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:43,030
over to be ready for audits so for

00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:45,370
safety service urgently certain

00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:47,830
certifications and being able to go

00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:50,620
through that process so security

00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:53,230
certifications as well as technology

00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,990
certifications and we're basically

00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:58,630
working making sure we get that code

00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:01,150
base robust enough and then things get

00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:02,890
back ported in this diagram was come up

00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:06,340
with in 2015 and we're still executing

00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:07,720
to it which and we finally are actually

00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:16,990
instantiating the first still together

00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:19,240
this year okay thanks so the 114 release

00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:23,320
was our first diltiazem celcius number

00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:25,750
one and we are focused on putting

00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,280
security updates with it as well as

00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,110
making sure that it is compatibles

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,270
Newmar here and the team has committed

00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:34,390
to supporting it for two years however

00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:37,300
so it's not feature based and it's not

00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:39,250
that it's not the cutting edge cutting

00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:45,070
edge you'll be going into the 2.1 frame

00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:47,530
not but with this one

00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:49,600
114 we released in April that was her

00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,510
first LTS and we've released our first

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,390
update to that

00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:54,770
yes now and we have CP fixes in it and

00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:59,030
so you're keeping the security up to

00:05:54,770 --> 00:06:01,730
date with it and reporting any things we

00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:04,460
find as well as here we've gone through

00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:06,110
a certification process for Bluetooth so

00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:10,930
the certifications are available to you

00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:10,930
as you as ever repositories right now

00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,600
and then there's a long list of issues

00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,460
fixed but everything is up there it's

00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:21,620
public and the kid never alone is

00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:22,550
transparently for auditable this is what

00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,010
we're going to keep you can see and

00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,810
that's when we that back port so we're

00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:29,180
doing a bit of work to transform the

00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,560
code base to make it easier and the

00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,870
Safety Committee and the security can be

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,280
here working together they're working

00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,870
with our ticketing steering committee to

00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,120
make sure that everyone can agree on the

00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:40,340
rules so you've got this collaboration

00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,840
with experts working with the

00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,830
development experts trying to make sure

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,230
that everyone can live with what we

00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:49,610
change and the process changes going on

00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:53,240
so we've been going at this journey down

00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:54,920
Republic ears we start put on Security

00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:59,810
Committee right place when the project

00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:03,320
started and then we publicly documented

00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:05,420
our security practices to date the

00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,890
separate project is one a few open

00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:11,870
source projects it's individually

00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:14,480
reference available as CB numbering

00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:19,070
authority or CNA and is publicly as

00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:20,960
mitre site and we have a security team P

00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:22,880
cert team sometimes they're called

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,990
first bind about her abilities and

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,710
working with researchers to find

00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:32,510
vulnerabilities so the fact that we've

00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:34,640
got that sitting in place is something

00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,870
we're rather proud of because very few

00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,930
open source of projects that have that

00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:41,850
out there and promised

00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:43,139
that way we've also this morning you've

00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:46,830
heard the core infrastructure initiative

00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:50,820
the CI badge is effort used the

00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:51,780
guidelines of that CI badge to help make

00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:54,930
sure they were following best practices

00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:56,520
as a team so the security teams are

00:07:54,930 --> 00:08:00,270
working with them and we are one of the

00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:02,639
two only three gold badges right now so

00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:04,229
if you go to see I got that's practice

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,810
the badging all our processes are

00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:08,910
publicly documented they're all visible

00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:10,050
and we're actually told badge and then

00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:12,930
we've also got a lot of automation

00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,520
weekend with misery scans as well as

00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,289
with the Coverity scans to make sure we

00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,360
keep out regressions as well Solyndra's

00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:23,639
and it's memorizing stuff we can work

00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:25,650
reports so on the security stop what

00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:28,349
we're looking at is our processes are

00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:29,639
described in the documentation the

00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:30,660
coding islets are there there's a

00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,719
provision of hundred poor vulnerable

00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:35,190
--'tis and there's a various processes

00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:39,719
risk to your buck and we also have a

00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:42,930
very private repo for our security team

00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:46,200
to access and work on mediations before

00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:47,820
it hits public it's seven cases but then

00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:52,820
we put everything out in public this is

00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:55,680
we got the real results available so

00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:57,390
another thing we're doing is there are

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,920
interpreting random framework that's

00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:01,410
this dense beam area for a lot of

00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:05,010
vulnerabilities and we have some active

00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:06,330
work going on there we've addressed a

00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:09,690
bunch of security issues in this area

00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:13,410
already because some of the mechanisms

00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:15,029
that are used our ward design for larger

00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:18,779
systems for entropy and we want to

00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:20,220
working rates plus systems we do want to

00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:22,589
make sure that we have these therapy

00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:26,880
eyes so it's easier to do everything

00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:29,640
right we're sort of moving it bit by bit

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,190
through and people who are interested

00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,610
this we're happy

00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:35,019
talk more about it we've got some crypto

00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:38,560
drivers and hardware and software

00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:40,870
available and the absolute software our

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,699
open source ones is tiny Krypton embed

00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:46,959
TLS or both integrated well into Zephyr

00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:49,629
right now and you could induce awful at

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:54,189
Hardware too so interfaces for that some

00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:55,420
instances they're one of the

00:09:54,189 --> 00:09:57,250
certifications we were looking at

00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:01,689
strongly the security team for is the

00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:03,850
FIPS 140 probably go around room for us

00:10:01,689 --> 00:10:07,209
three this year that's what the security

00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:08,980
team wants to focus on and we're be

00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:10,959
working with that with the audible so

00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,879
it's a subset of the functionality

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,189
that's in the LTS that we're taking to

00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:22,540
on at home and so this is what the team

00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:24,550
will be working on in 2020 okay and then

00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:27,069
of course as we know the UNIX in other

00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:31,480
systems fuzzing is useful to find

00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:33,160
problems and avoid them we do have a

00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:37,569
native plastic support for the Seco

00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:40,540
system and there's a lot of research

00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:42,759
that's going on here but there is a

00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:44,769
buzzing testing going on and we have

00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:48,100
been working with some researchers in

00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:49,720
this area and then of course we have

00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:53,259
thread walls associated with the

00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,670
security for these systems we actually

00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:56,730
have documented a threat wall and you

00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:59,350
can refer to it from the CNI system

00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:02,819
we've learned a lot since then and we'll

00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:04,689
be doing updates in 2020 about this and

00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:05,910
basically we have to do some

00:11:04,689 --> 00:11:11,280
reorganization

00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:14,270
but the analysis is tiny and then if you

00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:18,600
don't boot securely in a trusted way

00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:20,310
your compromises are possible right now

00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,610
we've got the reference systems using

00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:25,830
MCU building going on and we have ideas

00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:27,420
about there's potential stuff for the

00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:29,430
upgrade story as well as a serum I've

00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,140
been working towards in the project so

00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:33,960
we can get that secure endpoints so you

00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,980
put an image on trust this there sits on

00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,600
your major some think that and

00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,300
potentially the ability to refer it or

00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,220
not but then have an options available

00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:50,490
for people who are deploying out it's

00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:52,200
ever so as you can see from edge X you

00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:56,100
can be talking from devices up to clouds

00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:58,890
into any clouds there are a variety of

00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:03,930
other artists out there today and these

00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:06,180
are some of them and the integration the

00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:07,410
specific clouds is one of the things

00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:10,710
that's been happening in the last couple

00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:12,210
of years when Amazon acquired free are

00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:15,480
toss and then had a connected to its

00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:17,910
cloud mmm a good story there wall weight

00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:21,060
has a story with light OS Alibaba with

00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:22,530
Helios things and the Samsung Tizen so

00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,870
we have these specific cloud stories

00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:28,260
that reversed what we're we're aiming at

00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:29,760
what Zephyr and the others is we wanna

00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:32,570
be able to securely connect to any cloud

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:35,670
we want to have that top nutri story

00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:37,620
I've been there neutral story and then

00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:39,240
probably rides probably in that camp

00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:43,160
based on the fact that they're working

00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:46,410
with the Ajax people too but these are

00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,810
sort of the artists ecosystem that was

00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:50,100
there and then actually has had a few

00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:53,580
things added to it since the project

00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:55,260
launched but we want to make sure that

00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,710
we have separate be able to used all

00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,770
these smart devices and

00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:03,070
and controllers that talks through EDX

00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:05,620
and pray know yourself edge it slips IOT

00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:07,600
projects i'm working with effort - and

00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:10,810
we've got proof of concepts on google's

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,190
cloud and the amazon and then some of

00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:15,880
the other ones are ones we'd like to see

00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:21,970
emerge so this discussions on that so

00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:23,260
that's looking at next year part of what

00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:26,080
makes these sorts of things possible

00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:27,850
it's using standard api's when the

00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:34,090
common set of API is here is classics

00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:36,490
and we've got basically 51 52 MPs T

00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:39,250
sockets if you meant it and available to

00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:42,220
you as ever so we don't have the full

00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:43,420
plastics but we do have some of the key

00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,980
ones that people have wanted and

00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,210
certainly if something's missing that

00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:51,340
someone wants to contribute or certainly

00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:56,290
welcoming it this is about here that's

00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:58,090
what we're working towards so the

00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:59,530
outcome of this is we actually have over

00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:03,010
two hundred boards and how supported in

00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:04,960
its effort its popular and it's growing

00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:06,600
in popularity and that's being shown by

00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,190
the number of board to see the ecosystem

00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:12,370
and in every possible so if you go to

00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:14,530
several on get up and go down under the

00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:16,750
drivers you'll see these boards sitting

00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:17,830
there as that so it's after up tree you

00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:24,310
know looking all the detail and see if

00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:25,780
your favourites there and for a project

00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:28,570
that's four years old just has had their

00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:29,920
first LTS a lot of things has been

00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:32,830
really exciting for me personally

00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,510
partially it's a discovery top is

00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:37,840
finding up the products that are

00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:40,780
actually using Zephyr a couple years ago

00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:44,620
fly tech made these boards for us with

00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:45,020
the project and they've got sensors and

00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,450
there

00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:51,260
a badge so it's a little mobile badge

00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:52,610
the sensors on it and you can write

00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:55,910
Bluetooth metric with that with your

00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:59,360
colleagues we've had that number of two

00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:01,010
years that was sort of the earlier ones

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,180
there's a few other earlier ones at that

00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:09,200
time frame

00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:10,399
pro glove is a love with touch sensor

00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,040
with the glove so that when you're

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,690
scanning barcodes on the factory so they

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,120
know mother's money awards in Europe

00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:19,250
last year and this year and they've got

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:25,580
they came out initially from separ even

00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:27,230
before LTS and they were sort of fun for

00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,899
me to work with and sense it I met them

00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:31,070
first and embedded world and they told

00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:33,380
me they're using their furnace all

00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:35,540
passively cool first product you know up

00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:37,430
there and that's well why you could you

00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:40,399
step upstream and they're good

00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:42,140
oh we're startup we can't about six

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,690
months later someone contributed a

00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:46,160
driver they didn't like and they

00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:47,930
suddenly understood why they should

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,550
contribute upstream so they are now

00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:54,740
contributing into the repo as well but

00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:57,350
they're using some LEDs for godot is an

00:15:54,740 --> 00:16:00,079
IOT gateway that's using multiple cores

00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:03,170
one your budget is running on the big

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:04,520
core but they're using less effort on

00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:07,240
some of the devices to handle the

00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:09,110
Bluetooth stack we communicate that way

00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,570
another one be here

00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:14,209
I brought if you want to talk to me look

00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:16,760
at later it is a Darrell and these are

00:16:14,209 --> 00:16:18,410
smart tags and when you just put a

00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,420
master tag on it you put a little tag

00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:23,000
let's fun things in it helps you with

00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,860
the proximity so you can you know set

00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,240
these very small systems we're seeing a

00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:29,029
fair amount actually of tagging the

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,740
rupee notes are also tagging system any

00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:33,770
caribou hunt we heard about reindeers

00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:35,000
earlier and he cares actually for ear

00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:38,350
tags for reindeers

00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,120
that's using the Mbit long-term you know

00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:41,890
communication and there

00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,560
being used up in Scandinavia for

00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:45,880
tracking the reindeer hurts let's make

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,130
sure that they're still alive moving

00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,210
effectively it's light it's coming down

00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,589
to which its deadly it's great big

00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:53,740
collars and it's much more

00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:55,330
cost-effective we have smart glasses

00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:57,070
they're coming out a friend so there's a

00:16:55,330 --> 00:17:00,460
lot very interesting innovative new

00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:01,540
products coming up because it's open

00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,710
source it's hard to say whether they're

00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:05,650
using enough we only know is they're

00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:08,650
telling us here are the four box for

00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:12,970
instance is from a start-up in Israel

00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:14,470
and I think UK and it's the box that

00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:18,160
gets welded onto the side of a garbage

00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:20,470
truck for six months okay so they have

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,770
this box welded on these cars trucks my

00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:25,959
cigar was a truck to the top the sensors

00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:28,809
basically sends a signal of its position

00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:30,760
and so the battery has to last for six

00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:32,410
months of people don't have it right and

00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,000
that's just to make sure that people are

00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,870
actually dumping into landfills when

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,500
they're claiming they're gonna be done

00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:39,940
in villages so these are sorts of

00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,170
examples of things I've been finding in

00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,880
them what we see a lot working other

00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:48,850
gifts family too I think in the next

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:51,670
year Severn now supported on all of

00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:54,360
these architecture families there's

00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:57,220
ports for M&R I've seen some of the code

00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,650
suggesting an 8-point showing up which I

00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:01,750
was not expecting Italy I was expecting

00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:04,600
this to stay pretty much 32-bit we've

00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:10,059
had a 64-bit RISC five a port added in

00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:13,720
this year we've got x86 64 on Intel's

00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:14,510
IRA got some two new architectures that

00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,450
have been talking

00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,530
publicly on the list there's a spark and

00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:21,500
then there's also the open power

00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:26,540
architecture the open power it's just

00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:28,730
being infidel FPGAs and so as a stepping

00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,160
point for certain other word the spark

00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:36,590
that's right

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:37,549
power I sell his run example so as you

00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:39,350
can see we've been pretty much a very

00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:41,750
diverse community when we started off in

00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:43,970
2060 me and many developers are now 580

00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:47,690
i think but i did this mark this

00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:49,850
afternoon who's 582 they've gone from

00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:53,000
like just under 3,000 commits to well

00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:56,059
over 30,000 commits for boards initially

00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,320
a belch to over 200 so developers seem

00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:59,030
to be liking this code is it's very

00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:02,530
familiar for love that is Linux

00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:05,990
developers using device tree it's using

00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:07,640
okay config so you can just Google some

00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:10,100
of the common mechanisms analytics are

00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,660
available change their here when we

00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:14,809
started it off it was just a couple of

00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:16,370
companies and as you can see we've got a

00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:18,260
pretty wide range of companies in the

00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:24,799
last year participating in this and

00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:26,750
diversifying it out and if you look at

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,280
actually had to commit behaviors there's

00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:32,059
been over 10,000 in the last year our

00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:36,040
off stream is his effort to put some of

00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:40,419
that in context the Linux kernel is

00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:45,799
basically about nine commits per hour

00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:49,429
today if you're the LTS for Linux it's

00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:53,059
about one commits per hour as ever it's

00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:55,669
about one commit browse into its repo

00:19:53,059 --> 00:20:01,190
right now so we're starting to approach

00:19:55,669 --> 00:20:02,960
the philosophy there and that's

00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:03,950
developer Tutsis you know those to all

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,500
those developers are doing things

00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,600
because they need

00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:12,900
to it and those boards are showing up

00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:15,180
and so forth that certs deaths is

00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:17,550
something I've been keeping track of for

00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:19,410
the last year and a half is all of these

00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:21,840
repos that I'll show you over the

00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:27,540
longest run I wouldn't get up with the

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:29,340
exception of that X and this data is I

00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,930
look at total number of you know

00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,000
contributors till number of commits each

00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:36,770
month and what's happening in the last

00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:40,170
month and pretty much all the way along

00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:45,530
this period the most commits in the last

00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:48,540
month has been dominated by zevran

00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:51,060
which means that it was like different

00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:54,600
trend time then a lot of the other

00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:57,120
projects there right now and you know

00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,470
Ryan's also doing really well from the

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:04,860
community perspective internalized as

00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:07,920
his embed this effort start breaking out

00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:09,390
of the curve of the trend down and this

00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,550
also means we're also seeing breaking

00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:13,230
out of the trim time in terms of the

00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:15,030
number of contributors in fact right now

00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,160
I think all those are tosses that were

00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:20,460
out there except for now has the most

00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:23,280
contributors we have nothing like say

00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,720
five maybe two this data here ends in

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:28,140
October that it's been a little more so

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:31,560
the X is terrible

00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:34,680
we've got fairly active website traffic

00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,990
worldwide we've got a variety of

00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,000
different countries actually start

00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:41,740
look at Japan's out there it's in the

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:47,240
top ten and we have a fairly active

00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:49,280
print on social media as well and we

00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,410
have a slot channel like index and

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,429
others so if anyone wants to hop on and

00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:57,320
ask a question you to self invite and

00:21:54,429 --> 00:22:00,020
over the last you know like I took this

00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:03,140
snapshot from our traffic insights on

00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:04,940
the project and you know in a two-week

00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:07,700
period there's over a thousand people

00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:09,860
coming into the repo now so I'm really

00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,960
excited to see what products are next

00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:14,270
year because they're doing something

00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:20,270
with it it's just going to be detective

00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:21,620
work now to figure out what so that is

00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:23,390
pretty much there for what's happening

00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:25,850
whenever in a nutshell and that's we're

00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:27,230
focusing very much on security they're

00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:30,410
trying to make it real and as a security

00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:31,940
and so anyone who's interested in

00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:34,370
learning more about it I'm happy to talk

00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:36,230
to you about it yeah or feel free to

00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:38,750
just go on to the github site or jazz in

00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:41,690
the slack Channel and see it or through

00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:44,800
some of the things you care about with

00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,800
