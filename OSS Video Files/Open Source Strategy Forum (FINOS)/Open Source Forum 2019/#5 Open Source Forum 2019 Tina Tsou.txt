konnichiwa and this is Tina dual

00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:17,849
Enterprise Architect for mom at the same

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,599
time I'm also the a Korean alleges tak

00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:24,240
and his see culture I was the chair

00:00:21,599 --> 00:00:27,990
co-chair last year I just got elected

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:31,650
reenacting different this year 2019 2020

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:35,550
and thank you all supports especially

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:38,790
from the companies like entity and

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:48,539
renesis who are active has been seen in

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:51,120
credo okay so first of all I would like

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:53,579
to talk about a cleaner edges that grow

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,250
between my kids this morning

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:58,710
like Jane increase and all the other

00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,920
speakers have already talked about there

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:04,110
are many open-source projects in its

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,710
foundation and also any other community

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:10,440
but more important to the end users it's

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,610
about the deprival whether this is

00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,990
deployment ready

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:19,880
so in this spirit Rapinoe is more like a

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:23,700
deployment ready and oriented to the

00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:27,659
deployment and production ready so angry

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:30,689
no take the specific use cases like the

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:33,200
enterprise use case IOT use cases and

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:36,960
crown use cases turbo use cases and

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,810
select a specific hardware piece and the

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,920
software the hardware could be based on

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:45,210
like urban edge or specific hardware the

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,520
software is a set

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:53,340
topher Southwest Act or some integration

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,010
of upstream community like whether there

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:59,280
is own app and the other things and

00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:02,610
based on this piece of software and

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:07,500
hardware we do the fully CIC team to do

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:10,619
the integrated integrated the continuous

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:14,040
integration and continuous deployment so

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:16,170
we do have a community lab which is

00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,380
located in your Hampshire University and

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:24,840
we have many that additional across the

00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:25,739
horror in Europe in Japan China and US

00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,150
and Canada

00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:33,660
so those validation lab is corresponding

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:36,930
to some specific programs it connected

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,700
to the CIT wire the drinking's you can

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:42,060
say that the drinking's peers from

00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:45,690
Germany didn't laugh you can also do the

00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:50,820
CD CD makes to push the requirement

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:54,690
relax from your meditation app to Nexis

00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:57,420
locating a cranium so also we provide

00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:00,120
the community life cycle support all the

00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:04,530
project could be at the incubation and

00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:09,650
that becomes mature and core and then it

00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:13,440
becomes the archive projects so the for

00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:16,560
community life cycle support it supports

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,320
a long-term support finally the

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,040
production quality is because all the

00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,790
blueprints

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:26,640
have to be like driven or specific have

00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:29,700
the involvement and engagement from end

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,489
user that's why we can set its

00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:35,220
production quality so what are the

00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:38,130
benefit we bring here benefit number one

00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,680
low cost because from the end-user part

00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,810
of me

00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,150
no matter what in the end of day you

00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:48,209
still need to call other vendors to join

00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:53,140
app or to tire to do the downloading

00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:53,890
integration and testing so if you do in

00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,549
the community

00:03:53,890 --> 00:04:00,099
it saves your paths in animals also it

00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:03,840
could be larger scale deployment because

00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:07,420
like we have the newly small need

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:10,450
preparing proposal we have at least one

00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:12,129
two three hyper scanners and then it's

00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:15,010
the one to two operators are very

00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:17,799
interesting on that it becomes one

00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:21,609
common software stack to be used by

00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:24,490
server and the users this is how you

00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:27,400
have this blueprint as a recipe but it

00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:30,100
can be used like if you have the Nagi

00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:33,160
rice the recipe is unique you can make

00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:35,770
all the quality rice all over the Japan

00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:39,160
all of the word that's my favorite food

00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:43,560
by the way thank you and most of 0 touch

00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:48,010
provisioning because we do the edge cow

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:51,130
zero touch of provisioning here we have

00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:54,130
different blueprints some of the using

00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:56,560
own app or the kubernetes and the other

00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:59,710
operation and controllers to do the zero

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:03,039
touch of provisioning and give you an

00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:05,320
example the rack they use ISO images to

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:08,740
build the binary so you build an ISO

00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:12,539
images as the foundation of the Sun was

00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:16,300
that but then you can do the telecom

00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:18,910
Terkel appliances you have Seba for the

00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:22,830
trip home deployment you have wrapped

00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:27,340
for the radio 5g deployment just like

00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:30,729
slicing of cocoa appliances it's very

00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:36,039
easy to deploy for the industry adoption

00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:40,810
we have a many industries like down we

00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:44,450
have a bank which is more like PayPal in

00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:49,160
China it's very big they bring their use

00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:52,670
we have the industry IOT and we also

00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:55,070
have like insurance company the BNF

00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:58,370
vendors they have different kinds of

00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:00,650
thumb industry in this way we can

00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:04,310
accelerate the industry production of

00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:06,920
his programs and this technology lastly

00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:13,070
i mentioned the hardware

00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:16,220
OCP open edge is toko hardware specs so

00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:20,060
a green hood the telco applies blueprint

00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:23,720
family integrated as upstream hardware

00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:26,720
requirements so all the hardware pieces

00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:29,960
in this blueprint family will need to

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,750
comply with the OSP of an edge of course

00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:36,230
there were more like OCP hardware we

00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:37,910
also have the other OCP rather than

00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:40,250
table CP and the are elegant we have

00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:42,800
open power though i mention here but

00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,720
maybe in the new future somebody say hey

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,910
this is our hardware requirements you

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:51,130
have the comply with so this is a

00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:54,620
concept of the crater before aquino

00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:57,500
after if you know the developers so

00:06:54,620 --> 00:07:00,110
before aquino the developers has to go

00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:02,930
to the upstream community and download

00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:05,180
and test the software integrated them

00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:09,430
but mr. program you already do the work

00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:11,840
in the community there's no concept so

00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:15,170
let's have a look what a cleaner

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:20,180
released one has release this is june

00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:24,110
but today is December 16 we've already

00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:26,360
have our two completed intern

00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,340
the community announcement from the

00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,720
video will be next month in January

00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:35,600
because of the holiday season in the US

00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:37,730
so let's have a look from left to right

00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:41,150
you can see the gateways that will

00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:44,750
include the thinking way or think going

00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:48,800
in it means edge alight ilt there's the

00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:52,340
IOT gateway and the UCP for SD when have

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:55,460
been deployed to think about 10 to1

00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:59,900
operators in horror there is a one more

00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:02,300
which will be released 3 which is led by

00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:04,700
tension they have already deployed in

00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:08,690
tents and buildings in China each engine

00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:11,150
and also they have the plans to deploy

00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:14,900
that in several other tier 1 cities

00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:17,720
saying China the river and cow Karev

00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:21,890
it's located in the industry or the

00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:24,500
telco radio edge applications or HC R so

00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:27,140
this is part of the fighter deployment

00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:31,070
for the configuration and deployment of

00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:33,140
automata science and IEC it's integrated

00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:36,800
air town could be deployed in the mini

00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:40,190
datacenter - top one means the small

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:46,190
port like The Mikado being factored

00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:48,620
means it can runs on the or the edge of

00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:51,530
the enter server there is a time for

00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:54,800
which also part of release 2 that means

00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:57,110
you can do that ARB are they have done

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,630
the virtual classroom very interesting

00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:02,450
if you go to a wiki page you can see the

00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:05,060
teachers and the students are looks like

00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:07,430
in a virtual room the fire and Restonic

00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:09,800
acts provides the integration of

00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:13,430
starting acts to the very far edge

00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:15,650
redistribute account it converts in

00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:19,550
between the mini datacenter and

00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:21,660
on-premise DC edge so the providers

00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:26,580
access edge is led by

00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:29,040
at the OS company they do very good job

00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:33,420
here to work with the operators to

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:36,420
provide the PA he here last oniy not the

00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:39,060
only thing the network platform family

00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:42,540
has about seven blueprints for release

00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:46,230
one we released the unicycle and Rover

00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:50,370
this terms- Rover is the very end fan

00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:52,650
with one seven unicycle has about six to

00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:56,100
seven servers which two to three control

00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:58,530
out and the rest are the pure node this

00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:05,730
is a part of the telco encouraged to

00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:08,580
help operators to defy the 5g so people

00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:11,430
may ask so we have released one that

00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:13,950
however it is true reach two is more

00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:16,530
like industry enabler and also the

00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:18,500
enhancement to the release one or the

00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:23,390
existing blueprint

00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:26,850
besides the enhancement we have a lot of

00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:29,640
community lab and they should have more

00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:34,980
more either for Linux Foundation

00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:39,360
thank you since you offered them also

00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:43,080
the board budget to purchase some hard

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,450
words and pay for the lab staff there

00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:48,320
and also it's very kind

00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:51,240
some companies donate their spare

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,210
Hardware here so we can do more work at

00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,220
the community the mandatory security

00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,960
performance testing it's very

00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,720
interesting

00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:03,960
starting from we to release tube we have

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,970
the security components that makes all

00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:09,510
the code will be scanned by the SONA

00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:12,200
cloud which is a static static a called

00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:14,060
the scamming but also we recommend

00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,430
several

00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:19,870
I'm encode the scanning and security

00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:22,730
mechanism if you want to go through the

00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:25,520
maturity review and the blueprint has to

00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:30,910
go through this more secure mechanism

00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:35,450
and for the conformance testing we have

00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:37,960
the layering mechanism and there's a

00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:41,660
future project called a crane nose

00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:44,150
blueprint validation framework and this

00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:46,850
framework you can have the hardware

00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:49,040
conformance testing operating system

00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:52,130
conformance testing but your Center

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,700
we're about to end cetera and also the

00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:57,200
kubernetes conformance testing we

00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:59,390
selected the strong about from the

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,230
kubernetes the cnc of community and

00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:05,710
testy here so we do set up a laser

00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:10,010
official channel with all men

00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:13,840
O&M own app and our edge and all the

00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:16,310
other communities so maintaining this

00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:20,200
official channel is a very important

00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:23,960
because we do take the OP stream first

00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:26,900
methodology don't fault so we don't take

00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:29,270
any technical deaths and if we do find

00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:31,910
anything we need to add first we go to

00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:34,550
the upstream community as a hey we do

00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:36,950
have this questions can you place at

00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:40,010
this new feature if they say oh this is

00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:41,660
not generic feature it can be developer

00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:44,150
within acronyms so we come back to

00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,860
aquino and create a feature project

00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:49,070
which means that the river and the

00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:51,410
project then now we develop their and

00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:56,720
the future project will be used by

00:12:51,410 --> 00:13:02,480
multiple problems the lastly avi steps

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:04,279
any effects provided API some of them in

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,730
language that America

00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:11,089
standards so we provide an improv

00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:14,180
intention divided into two groups the

00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:17,300
the reverent facing in the eyes and also

00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:19,550
the infrastructure they be honest so we

00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:22,009
have then wiki or the committee lab if

00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:24,740
we are interesting go there and have a

00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:28,399
look you can find out the different lab

00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:31,069
as long as you have your VPN we open

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:35,990
credential for you anyone can use it

00:13:31,069 --> 00:13:38,689
it's open to everyone okay let's have a

00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:42,740
look at example of how we work together

00:13:38,689 --> 00:13:46,779
with our rent so oh when is ran this

00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:50,420
aggregation it has the the being the

00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:53,180
virtualized network elements provide a

00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:56,329
wide box hardware and standardized

00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:59,269
interface for button to up you can see

00:13:56,329 --> 00:14:02,360
in the fine G network if you think about

00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:06,079
the layer 1 layer 2 there are many red

00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:08,959
are you there and then coming up there's

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:11,180
a D you that they complain and there is

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:15,110
up see you for the control controller

00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:17,379
and control plan giving if you're

00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:19,879
looking up there were cell or an

00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:22,100
intelligent 2 controller which is we

00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:25,459
call Rick this is the plot we already

00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:28,180
have a blueprint above it through that

00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:31,279
a1 interface we need to do the design

00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:35,000
inventory policy configuration decision

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:38,800
which is the part of like some set of

00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:43,550
our name so we take the lightweight

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:46,160
language own app there to fulfill this

00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:49,279
functionality so in cradle community

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,879
blueprint can supply and end-to-end and

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,420
staff to support an MB ionic because

00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:57,680
virtualize that

00:14:53,420 --> 00:15:00,590
elements per orang requirements in the

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:04,460
next page you will see for the rent

00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:06,680
which is the first appropriate doing

00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:08,890
this under the top of applying several

00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:11,800
and family we take your each

00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:15,740
recalcitrant intelligent controller as

00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:19,160
upstream community software components

00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:22,010
we integrate it you can see on the right

00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:26,120
hand side the blue part is equal to

00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:32,180
proclaim 11 sites from all red SC or NSC

00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:35,240
is a rank software committee so this

00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:38,750
part everything below the Rick you see

00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:46,910
Rick and apps don't have a pontoon or

00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:52,220
yes in my product that okay okay so this

00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:56,480
part Rick we include them read apps and

00:15:52,220 --> 00:16:01,610
Rick basic Russian and Rick parse and it

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:04,160
communicate with this part is T a telco

00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:06,940
of lines which is the blueprint family

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,850
we have a summons lots of color building

00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:14,290
ISO images and they communicated through

00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:18,290
this gondola no spelling of a lady is

00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:22,160
from here from the middle and I with the

00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:27,410
center of mass and this things are the

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:29,630
fundamental Southwest at 48 red is the

00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:30,530
application as the appliance is running

00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:33,410
on top of there

00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:36,620
we also have something for Seba the

00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:38,900
software in neighbor and broadband

00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:42,170
access can goes around a set of plans

00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:44,290
and own Elevens I can see own app here

00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:46,460
and you see the regional controller

00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:50,960
regional controller is actually

00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:54,290
a future project orbiting within a

00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:56,870
crater and the region kanchana's a

00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:59,870
future project has been used by rack and

00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:02,480
also the other blueprints like the

00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:04,910
unicycle in network our problem family

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,910
all right whether the hardware pieces is

00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:10,280
part of rap it's a discussion point but

00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:13,010
there are five flavors hardware are used

00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,380
for release true only one flavor is

00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:17,959
validated is part of green is true and

00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:20,720
the others may be the release three it's

00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:23,030
like which one has been validated but

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,030
the CRC the pipeline and in the moment

00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:28,820
are happening on all the other flavors

00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:31,400
so I know there are many companies in

00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:33,410
Japan if we want to join this propria or

00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:37,250
this broken family you can bring your

00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:40,730
specific hardware first download the

00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:43,160
software stack and install and integrate

00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:45,980
onto your hard work to see what it works

00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:49,430
if it works perfectly that makes you're

00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:51,440
complying with this brutally if nothing

00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:55,030
you can find out whether there's any

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:58,610
like software patches you wanna serve it

00:17:55,030 --> 00:18:01,850
so the benefits to do all of this rack

00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:04,130
is like we can do the fully integrated

00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:07,190
appliances to address our read

00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:09,680
requirement we can only also do the

00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:11,930
fully automated zero touch provisioning

00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,890
because you can do it all through the

00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:18,860
region event owner and it supports both

00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:21,620
x86 and arm instruction set and support

00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:25,850
the OCP wipeouts in OAM and the other

00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:29,600
hardware's so so far this this one who

00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:37,450
knows where this is a Nokia

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:42,169
friend edge open edge server and h PE

00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:48,320
servers and marvel servers in ampere

00:18:42,169 --> 00:18:51,200
serviced ok ok

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:54,590
so in detail we have with ism is the

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:58,220
other organization rather we provide

00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:59,990
ELISA between Iran and acronym so first

00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:03,919
we take requirements and specifications

00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:06,650
from Thoren working groups and then

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:10,760
input into the mix foundation community

00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:13,400
and wiki and JIRA and then we integrate

00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:16,010
or encode into a trainer committee

00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:19,370
blueprints at the same time we also need

00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:22,010
a kubernetes own app this software and

00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:24,140
the hardware Oh CPOE amps as the

00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:27,710
upstream integration you see these two

00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:30,140
arrows into this program so we do the

00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:33,530
brutal invalidation and lap st and

00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:36,440
deliver is here at the same time this

00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:38,900
additional integration in erectus see

00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:43,789
happens here and they will feel and look

00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:45,350
to hear the integrated additionally was

00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:47,720
sent the input to the internet

00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:54,950
certification finally to the yourself

00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:58,280
which are the all the operators here ok

00:19:54,950 --> 00:20:02,000
let's have a look some of the blueprints

00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:05,870
as an example how to show you how a

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:10,880
cradle works so this is a is see the

00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:14,090
integrated education e ie see cameras as

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,980
an individual edge or individual program

00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:20,490
it can also be used by the other

00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,750
as a component he supports x86 and arm

00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:25,080
instruction set

00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:27,630
it supports cloud native applications so

00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:30,510
it takes the lightweight approach from

00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:33,179
button we can see there are switches in

00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:36,600
gear ways as a network equipments and

00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:40,830
going up we can run the networking and

00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:44,580
platform or enter Serie this FPGA may

00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:48,929
include Xilinx edge of FPGA and the GPU

00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:51,720
from a media and AMD Obama now in

00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:54,630
parallel you can have their different

00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:58,470
flavors as mannix I mentioned we have a

00:20:54,630 --> 00:21:00,929
smarty complain we have a manic obvious

00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:03,830
of love the feature project they are or

00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:08,010
at the blueprint proposal feature probe

00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:12,799
feature project proposal stage this

00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:16,410
monies flavor include procom they

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:19,140
contributed from their stingray software

00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:23,250
stack and also from Mellanox also from

00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:26,160
signings integrated accelerators these

00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:29,730
are the other components within the

00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:32,910
accelerations for hardware this is not

00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:36,590
really the real-time OS it's not a TOS

00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:39,960
it's more like the Ubuntu and set hours

00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:43,380
above it there is the data plan like s

00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:46,040
Iove & D PDK support on top of that

00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:48,000
there are three blocks the infer

00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,669
infrastructure orchestration and

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,940
installer network networking software

00:21:50,669 --> 00:21:57,030
and controllers so communities across

00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:59,400
this most important the opposition like

00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:02,820
many of the blueprints are using

00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:07,200
communities and few texts from the

00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:09,600
openmp from the now - and can pass us

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,900
one of the container rice that is taurah

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,460
is being used here we support different

00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:17,700
kinds of Linux

00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:21,690
system networking and VPP an obvious are

00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:25,259
two alternatives for the warning plan so

00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:28,559
lob s is more than existing one the PPP

00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:31,559
is part of the Fido

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:35,399
because it provides the high performance

00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:38,999
forwarding platform by using the

00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:42,899
mechanism of the batch of a packet for

00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:46,049
them on the controller calico is part of

00:22:42,899 --> 00:22:49,350
the scene self project and network the

00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:52,769
service match is the emerging technology

00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:57,509
and let's connect with the contribution

00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:59,639
from our be aware and then continue EPP

00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:02,879
is already abstracted from final

00:22:59,639 --> 00:23:05,940
Community Oriented minetti's is more to

00:23:02,879 --> 00:23:09,090
how to manage it obvious so we have the

00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:11,999
controller networking software and infra

00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:14,730
a position in installer let's have a

00:23:11,999 --> 00:23:18,330
look what kind of different applications

00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:21,600
we're running or services K native is

00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:24,509
more for service and could be flow for

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,119
machine learning Ajax for IOT services

00:23:24,509 --> 00:23:30,119
which are are either of their mental or

00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:34,769
containers of course we can take some

00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:37,889
language app arbitration on the top then

00:23:34,769 --> 00:23:40,649
we can give an example we talked about

00:23:37,889 --> 00:23:45,240
the ARM architecture support on radio

00:23:40,649 --> 00:23:47,970
aircraft rack you can see from here we

00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:51,720
need to we are it down the remote

00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:56,100
installer providing some on packages for

00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:59,759
remote installer and also on images and

00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:02,340
packages for Center OS also secondary

00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:04,530
the arm solutions for Hardware

00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:12,120
management in this case there

00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:15,360
can support Almaty arch okay this figure

00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:18,600
is only part of the release - but it can

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:21,960
give you an idea how the other group

00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:25,320
rates can use I see as I'm in Nevada

00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:27,240
you can see from here the wreck the

00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,340
Radiological and we talked about this

00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:32,490
it can walk directly on the circle

00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:37,470
appliances and the SEMA it's more for

00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:40,770
the Japan case Iran some ta and also I

00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:44,340
see because odissey Belko is actually

00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:48,180
from oh and half court any changes will

00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:51,180
go there currently abuse of TA can run

00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:54,420
directly and also the simple plot Eliza

00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:56,250
can also wrong you can get today and see

00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:59,930
volunteer are still under development

00:24:56,250 --> 00:25:04,500
from the air sixty four point of view

00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:07,050
micro Mac is interesting this there is a

00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:09,600
project of rock Fignon it's called the

00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:12,150
smartest the five-year-old they build

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:15,810
the smartest five-year-old away all the

00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:19,470
way from Helsinki to the very West city

00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:22,950
in Finland the use case is the first use

00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:25,110
case is to who can guess to avoid the

00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:27,060
collision of reindeers because the

00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:29,370
reindeer is going for the Christmas gift

00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:31,590
they're so busy on the highway you try

00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:32,220
to avoid the reindeers bump into each

00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:34,830
other

00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:37,470
this is struck just one use case the

00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:41,130
other one is it can do the some smart

00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:44,910
navigation and tell the cars it's it's

00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:48,660
very icy in front and weather changes

00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:51,480
please pay attention or some somewhere

00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:53,820
on this block and places select the

00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:56,490
other way something like that they have

00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:59,550
a put summer small boxes in the

00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:01,020
lighthouse in between the base station

00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:05,669
and

00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:09,659
Oh below the lighthouse so in it's more

00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:12,989
very far back from that and then Emmett

00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:18,269
I mentioned already the a the edge like

00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:22,019
IOT previously because it's our time

00:26:18,269 --> 00:26:25,349
fries okay then I see type for a Aria

00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:28,169
edge I meant changes for this version is

00:26:25,349 --> 00:26:32,070
for the edge for the virtual classroom

00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:34,289
and next release our industry by mentor

00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:36,749
for 2020 there will be more of data

00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:39,599
visualization padding and a connecting

00:26:36,749 --> 00:26:43,769
vehicle I'm gonna describe in the next

00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:47,969
page it has been deployed through an

00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:53,369
arts project and in China from peasant

00:26:47,969 --> 00:26:56,489
the energy was powered by Baidu and we

00:26:53,369 --> 00:26:59,820
met and find you maxsize it's more like

00:26:56,489 --> 00:27:02,789
a p2p to see like a China Mobile give

00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:06,269
the b2b fire services to Tenzin and

00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:08,959
Tinson give the b2c services to in the

00:27:06,269 --> 00:27:11,749
user including the cloud gaming

00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:17,359
including the live streaming and

00:27:11,749 --> 00:27:22,019
including the HD video okay this is how

00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:25,289
10-cents connective eco blueprint uses

00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:27,479
it can dude location accuracy so you

00:27:25,289 --> 00:27:29,969
know where it is and this month

00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:32,999
navigation this is similar to micro mac

00:27:29,969 --> 00:27:35,969
and a safe driver improvement telling

00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:38,070
you okay you can attend change the

00:27:35,969 --> 00:27:40,049
length but there is a car there but

00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:42,570
kissing you some has you were blocked by

00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:44,940
the bright coin you can see it as a

00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:47,849
driver and also reduce the traffic

00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:51,359
violation it's all telling you from the

00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:53,639
map platform to the car how can we make

00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:54,899
this happen and this is

00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:59,070
the connectivity or brokering

00:27:54,899 --> 00:28:01,979
architecture my baptism together with in

00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:04,529
Chinese is dolphin group you know it's

00:28:01,979 --> 00:28:08,059
for Easter winning group it's a there's

00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:13,379
a number one biggest the Ottoman

00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:16,129
automotive company in China they

00:28:13,379 --> 00:28:19,169
integrated the edge Club a RBI stack

00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:21,479
it's a similar because it's part of I

00:28:19,169 --> 00:28:26,070
see Brooklyn family you can see it just

00:28:21,479 --> 00:28:29,029
changes or like a light way remove the

00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:37,249
unnecessary part but this party has the

00:28:29,029 --> 00:28:37,249
the GPUs from the MD or the immediate

00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:44,279
okay this says that there are all made

00:28:41,369 --> 00:28:46,349
by IBM all the way from the stage you

00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:49,559
want to collect some signal strengths

00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:52,769
data and then do data collection and

00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:55,589
data aggregation this edge server and

00:28:52,769 --> 00:28:59,249
then you can do the data visualization

00:28:55,589 --> 00:29:02,450
think about we have a Phi G or Wi-Fi in

00:28:59,249 --> 00:29:03,679
this room not a response had a same

00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:07,109
[Music]

00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:09,479
strength of the signal then you can see

00:29:07,109 --> 00:29:12,059
a lot of a green light green yellow

00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:15,570
orange rainbow like a ski talk it's

00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:17,669
American candy if you like it you will

00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:19,169
see another spot you know the green

00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:23,099
power maybe have the strong is the

00:29:19,169 --> 00:29:28,589
signal this is one of the we are down

00:29:23,099 --> 00:29:32,039
here okay so this is a one overview of

00:29:28,589 --> 00:29:33,690
our two groupings we are announcing very

00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:36,509
soon but this is what we complete

00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:41,009
including the connected vehicle ta

00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:43,049
broken family and can I don't work now I

00:29:41,009 --> 00:29:47,129
see and

00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:50,190
I see in okay how to get involved that

00:29:47,129 --> 00:29:52,830
we have a website a wiki and I say my

00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:57,330
slides are already here

00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:59,759
no RS that's page take away so even a

00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:03,210
now is some proudly announcer with stage

00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:07,409
three project because in our edge we

00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:09,929
have different stages only two projects

00:30:07,409 --> 00:30:12,360
and we have seven projects only to reach

00:30:09,929 --> 00:30:15,509
the stage three that means we can end

00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:19,590
the acceleration time to deployment from

00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:22,139
projects to products and production we

00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:24,720
have a temple blueprints including all

00:30:22,139 --> 00:30:27,299
the segments of use cases and the new

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,419
program into the edge AI fight your neck

00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:33,239
and time critical edge and other tours

00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:36,739
and the new connecting lab and the edge

00:30:33,239 --> 00:30:40,309
api's in within the average projects

00:30:36,739 --> 00:30:40,309
