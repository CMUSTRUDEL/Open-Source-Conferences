thank you very much for this opportunity

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,750
to share what we're doing the openness

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:21,239
this project with you guys so that let

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,430
me explain a little about what deal -

00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:26,009
this protein is called it's actually in

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:29,009
a special project there a lot of people

00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:32,340
could okay but so so this I am here to

00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:34,530
talk to you guys and the soda is

00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,539
actually we rebranding of the project or

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,850
Egypt of the transformation on the

00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:40,950
project from puffiness is to soda and

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,770
I'll explain later why we have internet

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,649
and then part of the reason is because

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:51,690
some is final scenes is regarding

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:55,559
monthly pass data a lot of people may

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:59,160
not tell me so future way recycling news

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:03,180
every day and CN NS also mucho is the US

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:05,750
are in the arm of apology so I'm basing

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,750
our silicon

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:15,799
so if you look at this picture this

00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:19,189
shows it all the kinds of popular

00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:21,380
applications they've made everybody runs

00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:25,880
quality is a big beta IOT with Sheila

00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:27,530
Dai and the data that you have usually

00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,720
is I mean you see this potion

00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,429
primates are in the cloud and on the

00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,250
right side your applications will be

00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:39,020
running on containers of virtualization

00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:50,689
cloud edge and in between the data that

00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:52,610
you have needs to be score so the

00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:54,619
probably this picture is that I feel a

00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:58,340
lot of these solutions that you have in

00:01:54,619 --> 00:02:01,250
there are sports lucious so I was giving

00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:04,340
the same talk in Cuba cognoscenti go and

00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:07,130
after this talk a person from uh South

00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:10,190
Carolina came up to me dinner solutions

00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:11,840
occupied the thing this is the exact

00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:15,200
problem and they're having to salvage

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,150
relics so the problem here is that there

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,120
are a lot of spot solutions and with the

00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:22,639
difficulty actually in this picture is

00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,250
not about like how to probably transform

00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:27,620
the data or are you I mean provides the

00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,299
replication for the data the problem

00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,980
here is how you connect all these

00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:34,069
different pieces of solutions together

00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:37,760
okay that's the key bro okay so your

00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:39,440
body's final solutions the so the

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,310
division that we are trying to do is

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,900
sort of is actually to create a seamless

00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,750
integrated framework that connects all

00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,360
these different pieces

00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,430
so you're the data that's on your lap

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,630
and siring where they store game in a

00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:58,990
room it can be I mean protected can be

00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:01,270
replicated can we transform seamlessly

00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:05,380
from the applications they run on the

00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:06,370
right side so and besides that in order

00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,250
to do that actually

00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:11,800
you need things like telemetry things

00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,620
standardized way of collecting data for

00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:19,050
telemetry motivation and orchestration

00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:21,850
to move the data to do to folks

00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:24,430
intelligence and AI to make your

00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:36,700
operations more efficient and multi

00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:40,210
connect so the subdivision I mean

00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:42,730
actually is to allow you to store any

00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:47,890
data anywhere and that's what the

00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:51,880
autonomy is about so thanks for instance

00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:53,710
our opening is the CSI I mean container

00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,250
storage in the face plate tries to do

00:03:53,710 --> 00:04:00,610
there is actually to try to standardize

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:05,490
ways communities are connects to storage

00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:08,890
so we do probably this solution or

00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:10,960
standard is there through this standing

00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:13,470
in the base you see this storage

00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:16,330
developer I mean each storage vendor

00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:18,790
create your own kind of a solution and

00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:21,870
the solution itself is kind of like a

00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:27,520
micro ecosystem you have like your data

00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:29,860
in vendor a bit we've invented a

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:34,140
and you may be able replicate data to

00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:36,790
the clock AWS but the data in the cloud

00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:39,070
can only be recognized by the same

00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,400
vendor solution so similarly I mean

00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,380
Philippines

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,990
see solution I mean easy thank you I

00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:48,620
chase the asylum so it does not solve

00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:51,440
the problem of trying to actually remove

00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:56,960
this cycle kind of a solution I mean I

00:04:51,440 --> 00:05:01,009
don't kind of problem okay what

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:04,639
so that tries to do is that energy since

00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:07,550
in between CSI and story so you kind of

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:11,389
affect the storage from the communities

00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:14,030
all these parts and applications so and

00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:16,220
in a way missus unifying the

00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:18,590
orchestration which allows you to

00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,389
actually move data across the different

00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:23,330
kinds of our metal storage

00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:25,940
it also unified the data as in a cloth

00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:28,160
so that issue is not about each vendor

00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:31,060
putting the data in the clock is well

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,919
all the data that you have are primates

00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:36,770
no matter what who's been I mean where

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,690
where the data's comes problem because

00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:41,479
into this cloud and it can be accessed

00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:44,060
by anybody okay so there's this three

00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:44,900
unit like administration project we try

00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,240
to do there

00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:50,330
besides that the territory intelligence

00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:58,400
and avocado that we have in there so

00:05:50,330 --> 00:06:01,700
sort of tries to make for communities so

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,760
this is the framework for soda so a lot

00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:09,230
of projects this year I mean right has

00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:11,090
the because project not only in

00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,920
escalation is probably to her right now

00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:16,130
so everybody's talking about flower

00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:18,470
Native communities cloud native answer

00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:20,600
but our problem is not just the soft

00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:23,030
quality I mean a lot of a the prices out

00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,640
there that was to using mistake you're

00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:30,140
using VMware using bare metal kind of

00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:32,530
stuff so so so does gold amazed to be

00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:36,140
able again to enable data mobility for

00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:38,510
for any kind of applications so it's a

00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:42,950
data mobility framework and this picture

00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:46,400
itself what you see is that the blue

00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:48,890
parts here are actually projects that

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,760
have been developed by the openness is

00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:57,140
protect so so the analysis project the

00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:59,150
main the main mission initially was just

00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:02,000
to connect the different kinds of

00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:06,170
storage together to I guess a control

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,490
plane to so that it can connect to

00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:13,160
different kinds of storage and allows

00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:15,890
like OpenStack vanity SSO to have to use

00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,930
the different types of storage or again

00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:21,950
the incidence of the go is actually to

00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:24,740
the mobility so so we are I mean we are

00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:29,570
going to be working with like trading in

00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:33,950
product for any age between the journey

00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:36,530
from Minnesota is that these sort of

00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:40,400
Lake is actually in cloud management

00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:45,080
module and the data store project is

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:48,410
subjected with this in preliminary kind

00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:52,210
of a discussion so so I'll talk about

00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:52,210
more about it in the next time

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:59,210
so so the the data store print what

00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:02,660
we're trying to do is actually to create

00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:05,570
the other kind of solution for for data

00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:10,250
streaming for the analytics for machine

00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:13,730
learning idea so the possibility of this

00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:15,620
came together because in the openness

00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:18,590
this project so between must have we

00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:23,870
created a multi kind of data controller

00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:26,360
and China Unicom which is I mean spoke

00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:30,280
with the second biggest telecom company

00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:33,410
in China they have an internal project

00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:37,520
an internal solution that it used for

00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:41,330
object storage the languages of the set

00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:44,870
of storage back-end to a lot of to three

00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:47,420
single interface people skill both

00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:53,620
skilled skilled it back-end using

00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:56,420
multiple kind of set clusters so so

00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:59,570
China Unicom has doing that the big

00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:01,970
project to to solar and what we are

00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:04,760
doing right now is to integrate the this

00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:07,670
interface together with US Open as

00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:12,110
despotic cloud literal project which is

00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:15,640
our gelato project and with this we are

00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:19,420
able to do something this very useful

00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:22,930
users so play does is that you lost to a

00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:25,390
single kind of interface be able to let

00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:27,820
you store your data in either on-premise

00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:30,279
or in the club and you can control it

00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:32,410
through any kind of a data policies okay

00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:35,140
and so many other things the goodness do

00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:37,329
is how that's going to be a search

00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:39,820
engine there's a company that we are

00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:43,540
talking to it has a search engine that

00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:45,220
they are open sourcing so so we also

00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:47,320
very happy for them to be joining

00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,940
joining the scholars so I think but I

00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,730
can mention anything about the company

00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:56,110
yes so with their I mean it's crazy this

00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:58,860
whole soda I see you know did a mobility

00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:05,410
for any kind of any kind of framework

00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:08,260
it's gonna really make it come true so

00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:12,100
the other use cases that we have on our

00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:15,459
like for Yahoo Japan they have like

00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:18,910
fifty two clusters of our OpenStack that

00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:21,970
they use like the cinder and even in the

00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:25,269
project for the fire provisioning and

00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:27,330
then the and also they are appending

00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:29,850
more I mean for companies

00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:32,310
they're starting to deploy to the ladies

00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:35,310
clusters and yeah in fact migrating some

00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:35,700
of the OpenStack clusters to prove

00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:39,420
anything

00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:41,790
it's also the leaders well I mean the

00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,680
solar played us is that they actually

00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:46,320
house validates all these different

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,260
types of are different different cycles

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,450
into one and then with this the

00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:54,180
different open I mean do different

00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:57,120
OpenStack or ethnic clusters can

00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:59,040
actually use the kind of storage as the

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:03,260
unified pool and resources can be

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,260
allocated and reallocated very easily

00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:09,260
this multicom use cases by NTT

00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:13,230
communications the

00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:14,750
this is like the use in obvious I mean

00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:18,150
it of this is a federal entity

00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:21,090
complications and for the support that

00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:24,090
they develop a a cloud the trailer for

00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:27,480
AWS - I didn't move data between that in

00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:30,960
the center - to the AWS tie it up let's

00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:40,770
cut to the Sun some remote sites so but

00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:45,450
the problem so we did everything that

00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:47,910
every single Club primarily that came in

00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:51,060
they have to you know do the same thing

00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:52,560
over and over again and and this I said

00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:55,830
what do you have to do this also like

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,960
uv8 up service to get to like we develop

00:11:55,830 --> 00:12:00,090
things for it so that's why I mean and

00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:02,520
City Communications is actually like

00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:05,760
reviews so let's try to try to solve

00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:08,730
this problem okay so all these use cases

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,470
that talk about there are gun on in

00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:19,560
production yet okay there are things

00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:23,150
that we are doing for for this so not is

00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:25,980
easy so together the data lifecycle

00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:28,140
kind of a deep so what they do is that

00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,540
we autonomous vehicle that you have

00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:32,070
intercessor it's the sense of data that

00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:35,280
they have different trick to the edge

00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:37,500
and they need a way of like moving the

00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:41,100
data between the a student to the data

00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:43,620
center for for primary storage so they

00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:50,370
actually do things like though they may

00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:52,050
do things like in the primary storage

00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:55,230
they do things like machine learning and

00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:57,720
and of stuff and then as the data and

00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:59,940
the data distorted maybe story from like

00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,560
half a year and after you have a gear

00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,530
they wanna move it to that secondary

00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:08,690
storage okay and the secondary storage I

00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:08,690
mean they will be you see for all

00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,490
and this they're gonna start following

00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,050
me

00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:18,430
I came here and remember to to your

00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:20,110
place about two years now the two years

00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,610
that data it's like to all and so they

00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:24,459
all they need to do is to archive it

00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:28,949
either to the local storage or to the

00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:31,660
powers so and then the data detect that

00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:33,670
archivist or retain over there is

00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:43,420
actually like a period of like 50 years

00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:45,519
which is all only expected part so this

00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,540
picture I mean openness this is

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:51,160
supported by all these different

00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:54,519
companies the and as we move from open

00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:57,100
Estes to solar because the original ball

00:13:54,519 --> 00:14:01,600
of openness yes again was just to again

00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:04,240
to define controlling for storage so but

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,660
solar stupids I mean has grown a lot

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,699
more attend us open Isis is doing and

00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,800
that's where we have to attack quickly

00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:14,290
transformation and most of these

00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:18,839
companies that you see here will

00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:18,839
continue on to solve a lot

00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:27,820
so the mission of of soda is to I mean

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,790
fostering our ecosystem open-source data

00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:35,590
management and starship software again

00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:39,750
for a data autonomy create new platform

00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:42,580
for cross-products cuz they see a lot of

00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:45,070
pilot problem out there each day yeah la

00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:47,620
actually a lot of great open source

00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:50,380
projects out there but which is like you

00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:52,060
playing within themselves Andy for

00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,590
instance that set is so if you want

00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:55,600
about to get to some other stuff like

00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:58,300
open ups it does it doesn't work at all

00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,400
so so we wanna I guess eight into

00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:03,310
platform to actually foster develop our

00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,530
collaboration and ultimately what we

00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:07,630
want to do is I take - it's a surviving

00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:13,780
uses to provide quality internet

00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:17,080
solutions because of the source projects

00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:20,710
is reopening the anyway the real again

00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:22,150
the difference within our project in a

00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:24,760
lot of other projects out there instead

00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:27,010
a room apps actually driven by our end

00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:30,010
users I mean the panel's come from them

00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:38,800
and we practice the road map according

00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:40,720
to the end users and ready this part is

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,780
actually about so already this is a

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:48,870
certification program that a lot of our

00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:52,360
users are asking for so in the existing

00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:54,670
world when they want to purchase any

00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:57,010
social data solutions they need to

00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:59,500
specify the treaties of you know specs

00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:02,320
arid climates for you equality solution

00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,430
so so what do you look for it's like in

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,350
future when they will have other

00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:07,660
software in what we get which is all

00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:08,290
about any to specifies it's going to be

00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:11,080
sold already

00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:13,720
so solar eighties well conformance about

00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:16,360
compliance interoperability a sort and

00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,880
then also we will come up with are they

00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:21,430
expects for like publicity by the

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,620
service providers and also to create

00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:26,440
administrators and developers this is no

00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:29,140
different from like any of the other

00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:32,110
women's national certification program

00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:35,530
so this is something that we're both

00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:39,280
Peter and then the government governance

00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:42,970
model this against it's similar to a lot

00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:44,820
of the nearest pollination projects the

00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:47,470
main the main steering committee

00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:49,120
committees the advisory board the

00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:51,490
technical steering committee the

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,430
supporter of a preserve that was very

00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:56,740
committee and the Irish company and then

00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:59,650
the architecture work group that

00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:01,870
oversees the collaboration or a design

00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:03,310
across all the different projects the

00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:07,930
quality work group that will actually

00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:09,850
define a Sardar ad program and the

00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:12,699
different six across the different

00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:14,470
technologies and industries and also the

00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:16,209
regional committees like in Japan

00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:20,070
actually began reading eat healthy

00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:20,070
completely so so we

00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:26,639
so the timeline for for the project I

00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:30,029
mean we we kind of started open STS back

00:17:26,639 --> 00:17:34,200
in 2016 our growth was not a spectacular

00:17:30,029 --> 00:17:37,379
as we hope I mean like like you husband

00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,409
and your project as well so but we do

00:17:37,379 --> 00:17:43,769
hope that this is a new start for us

00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:47,039
the so we do we are having a formation

00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:50,370
meeting and ship tomorrow at the Sony

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:52,559
dish people across across the street and

00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:56,159
everyone I have a soda forum which is

00:17:52,559 --> 00:18:00,240
which is being held Shero 4/6 so if we

00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:03,509
are free and I mean China's and then the

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:06,600
first release of the are so first

00:18:03,509 --> 00:18:09,570
release under the solar which is has

00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:14,070
been developed since the openness this

00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:19,009
project this is our title and actually

00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:23,129
will have the integration between the s3

00:18:19,009 --> 00:18:26,580
mustard self project by China Unicom in

00:18:23,129 --> 00:18:29,490
our well Vanessa stream and I just

00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:32,009
verified before the CTO of the

00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:35,340
cocktail this is actually a project that

00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:39,090
a domestic production and is currently

00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:40,759
storing like four petabytes appear so so

00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:47,100
this is a really reliable

00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:49,129
and in q1 you'll be releasing our second

00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:53,009
release of us so that's okay everybody

00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:56,309
this can be a release so so darling is

00:18:53,009 --> 00:18:58,980
the it's not really fixed protecting you

00:18:56,309 --> 00:19:02,249
but police with attic fell out it was

00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:05,519
start stop working streaming and we have

00:19:02,249 --> 00:19:09,149
been do is sort of a forum in Amsterdam

00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:11,220
what you thought so and then in queue to

00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:13,379
the southeast so they already we expect

00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:18,960
the specifications draft to come

00:19:13,379 --> 00:19:20,759
together and then q3 remain suffer

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,470
really is building up we do we do

00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:28,200
another forum Shanghai took on and then

00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:30,119
the edge so that edge will come in to

00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,009
redeem yourself and then together with

00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:35,009
like the search engine you had a

00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:37,619
subprogram and denied second so of it

00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:39,350
comes together and then finally at the

00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:42,240
end of the year and we're going to do

00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:48,119

to these people so for here I a machine

00:19:52,950 --> 00:20:02,490
and about applications and so this is

00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:06,059
the program for us or the forum you'll

00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:09,649

we welcome you guys to join us I mean to

00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:53,240
help us with this data movement so thank

00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,240
