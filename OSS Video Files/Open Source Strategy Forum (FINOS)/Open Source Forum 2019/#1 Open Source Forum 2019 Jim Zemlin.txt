good memory everyone this year has been

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:21,010
a great year for open source and a very

00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:23,950
good year for the Linux Foundation this

00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:29,560
morning I'm here to give you an update

00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:31,149
on how the Linux Foundation is doing an

00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,399
update on how the Linux Foundation is

00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:35,860
doing and I'm going to be followed by

00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:38,470
Chris and a check from the Linux

00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,700
Foundation who works across many of our

00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:42,010
projects but anything on the cloud

00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:45,820
native computing foundation to show you

00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:48,399
how you can participate bring projects

00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:51,640
to the foundation and what value we

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:55,660
provide as an organization so with that

00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:59,679
I thought I would start by in December

00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:01,769
looking back on 2019 of all the amazing

00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:04,390
things that our organization has

00:01:01,769 --> 00:01:09,820
accomplished today the Linux Foundation

00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:12,670
is home to over 250 open-source projects

00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:15,220
but they're not just any open source

00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:17,740
projects they're some of the most

00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:20,649
important shared technology in the world

00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,720
whether it's the Linux kernel project

00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:24,969
which is the most successful widely

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,939
deployed software in the history of

00:01:24,969 --> 00:01:31,860
computing or newer projects like

00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:35,110
kubernetes which has redefined how cloud

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,750
applications are created deployed and

00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:40,090
managed or things that you'll hear about

00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:42,579
today in the blockchain space I'm Piper

00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:45,820
ledger that's used in financial services

00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:49,210
and supply chain management sefar which

00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:51,490
is increasingly becoming an important

00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:55,329
and major real-time operating system

00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:58,299
covering many many systems worldwide but

00:01:55,329 --> 00:02:01,840
a few statistics that I think are

00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:05,560
interesting this year we're adding a new

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,229
major project every single week whether

00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:11,020
it's a very major umbrella project like

00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:14,920
that continuous development foundation

00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:17,170
if you're about today or just a small

00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:20,080
project that's sort of stand-alone like

00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:22,780
graph QL every single week we're

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,530
introducing a new open source project

00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:30,460
projects that are participated in by

00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:34,320
over 1,600 major corporations and tens

00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:38,440
of thousands of developers worldwide we

00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:40,330
have had a lot of growth in events like

00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:44,500
this this year

00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:47,770
we have now gathered over 40,000

00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:52,630
developers that are over

00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:56,290
I think 157 events worldwide how many

00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:59,980
people were at the coop con event I

00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:02,560
think three four weeks ago so if you cou

00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:08,950
con in San Diego just about a month ago

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:11,920
had over 12,000 attendees it was the

00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:15,250
biggest initiative event we've ever had

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,500
we're on track to go over 50,000

00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:21,790
developers next year globally

00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:26,320
participating in our events today in our

00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:28,990
training program 500 people register for

00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:31,330
Linux Foundation training whether it's

00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:34,990
for kubernetes or Linux or

00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:38,710
nodejs for Hyper literature 500 people

00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:41,950
register every single day for our

00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:45,880
training programs we have we're training

00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:49,000
millions of developers globally on the

00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:52,090
latest open-source technology from

00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,730
massive open online courses all the way

00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:59,160
to skills based testing for kubernetes

00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:02,860
Linux and many other

00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:05,470
technology we introduced new software

00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:09,070
tools this year to help our communities

00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:12,670
grow we introduced a mentoring platform

00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:16,090
that can enable mentors to pair with

00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:18,850
mentees to teach new developers about

00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:22,320
how to participate in projects like

00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:26,050
Linux like kubernetes like those Jacobs

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:30,280
we introduced software security tooling

00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:33,270
this year for our projects that do code

00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:36,550
analysis across projects to show

00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:40,350
vulnerabilities map dependencies and

00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:44,110
alert us for upstream security issues

00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:47,020
before they become downstream security

00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:51,430
issues in any of your products or

00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:53,440
services we also gave away quite a bit

00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:57,220
of funding to bring people from

00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:00,940
underrepresented communities into our

00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:03,070
development worlds women people from

00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:06,100
underrepresented communities people in

00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:09,160
poverty we've given away over 1.4

00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:11,830
million dollars offers hundreds of

00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,750
scholarships to have people come and

00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:17,050
attend our events so that we can create

00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:21,430
a better more diverse community across

00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:24,940
all the next nation projects and we've

00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:29,920
added over 200 I think this is an old

00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:34,650
number almost 300 new members this year

00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:37,900
the Lynx foundation now has over 1,600

00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:41,260
corporate members who participate in the

00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,820
hundreds of projects that we post and I

00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,500
should point out that it hasn't just

00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,140
been a good year for the Linux

00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,460
Foundation it's been a good year for the

00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,290
Eclipse Foundation

00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:53,350
it's been a good year for the Apache

00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:56,470
Software Foundation and many other open

00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:58,270
source organizations because open source

00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:01,030
is now such a

00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:05,020
critical and common part of any modern

00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:07,050
software development our organization

00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:11,950
has also been recognized by the industry

00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:15,340
year after year after year as one of the

00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:19,450
most important organizations that affect

00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:22,960
how people build software the SD times

00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:27,310
in Silicon Valley has recognized us for

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:31,090
being alongside Amazon Microsoft and

00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:33,010
others as an influencer three years in a

00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:36,160
row we've won their influencer award

00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:38,560
which represents the platforms that

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,500
people use and the technology that

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,630
people adopt now and in the future and

00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,430
it's really home it shows that how

00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:49,530
important local source and our

00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:54,100
organization is to the technology sector

00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:56,620
so we started a long time ago with Linux

00:06:54,100 --> 00:07:00,700
but I would like to show you where we're

00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:02,370
going as an organization now and into

00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:06,430
the future

00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:10,060
with Linux we obviously started focusing

00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:13,390
on one platform mainly on the Linux

00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:17,470
kernel project and mainly working many

00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:20,800
years ago to make Linux a ubiquitous

00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:23,800
global computing standards and we have a

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,770
lot of success bringing developers into

00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,810
the Linux ecosystem creating a legal

00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:31,840
framework so that people understood

00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:35,410
open-source software and how reliable it

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:38,260
can be providing that legal defense to

00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:42,430
make sure that people know that the open

00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:45,570
source software is safe and reliable and

00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:49,570
we succeeded beyond our wildest dreams

00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:51,670
but in that process we developed some

00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:55,090
best practices that you're going to hear

00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:57,160
from Chris about how to take everything

00:07:55,090 --> 00:08:02,230
we learned promoting and protecting

00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:04,270
Linux and apply it to other projects we

00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:06,120
started with other projects closely

00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:07,830
related to mass in the

00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,470
telecommunications

00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:14,580
not too long ago some of you may

00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:17,070
remember Sun and spark was a de facto

00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:19,800
platform for many telecommunication

00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:23,550
systems we worked on a project called

00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:28,050
carrier grade Linux to take Linux and

00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:30,420
make it tell code rate hardening to make

00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:33,390
it so that it could support the kind of

00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:36,810
workloads in a telephone environment and

00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:39,200
that has been unbelievably successful it

00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:41,870
was at the time essentially entirely

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,880
displacing Sun Microsystems in the

00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:47,100
telecommunications sector

00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:49,740
arjan third project is a good example of

00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:52,470
where there was a need for a modern

00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:55,560
embedded system a custom build

00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:57,630
environment for Linux were able to work

00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,550
with all of our member companies and

00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:02,160
thousands of developers and now the

00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:05,430
Yocto project really is the de facto

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,620
standard for building custom Linux

00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:12,470
distributions in particular for embedded

00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:15,870
systems we then expanded beyond Linux

00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:24,360
related projects to the networking

00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:27,240
sector in 2000 we started working on the

00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,780
open daylight project this was an open

00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,880
source project for Software Defined

00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:35,430
Networking at a time when the networking

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:39,170
industry was moving from a hardware

00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:42,480
based industry to a software-defined

00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:45,720
industry so the same concept of server

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,070
virtualization was being applied to what

00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,080
we now know as software-defined

00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:52,350
networking today or networking

00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:55,050
virtualization opendaylight quickly

00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:57,900
became a standard software-defined

00:09:55,050 --> 00:10:01,160
networking framework and based on that

00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:04,069
work we expanded into men

00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:07,190
many new areas of collaborative

00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:10,940
development across a lot even wider

00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:13,459
variety of industries and there are too

00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:16,730
many to count so I'm only going to point

00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:18,560
out a few but we have now been taking

00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:22,339
the concept of open source development

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,319
and two entirely new industries one

00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:27,170
example is it having a software

00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:30,379
foundation how many people here know the

00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:32,689
Oscars the Oscar movie award pretty much

00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:34,910
every whatever so the Academy of Motion

00:10:32,689 --> 00:10:38,750
Pictures partnered with the Linux

00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:41,300
Foundation to help Disney lucasfilm's

00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:45,079
Industrial Light and Magic DreamWorks

00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:48,230
open source the software that's used to

00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:52,759
create all the movies that all of us see

00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:56,600
every day Star Wars The Avengers all

00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:59,209
those movies use open source software to

00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,160
create those films and that open source

00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:04,519
software is a part of the Academy

00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:07,430
Software Foundation which is at the

00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:09,199
Linux Foundation itself we spent two

00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:10,910
years working with that industry to

00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:15,079
teach them how to work collaboratively

00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:17,839
in open source and now the vast majority

00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:20,000
of that work is out in the open and

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:24,860
being collaborated on by all the major

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:28,550
film studios worldwide in networking ROP

00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:31,040
nmv project is the de facto Network test

00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:33,199
standard for network function

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,380
virtualization our Linux Foundation

00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:40,639
networking project represents a

00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:43,250
collaboration between roughly 80% of the

00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:47,170
world's telecommunications operators

00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:51,319
think about that the networks that power

00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:54,410
three billion mobile users are running

00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:56,829
on open source software being managed

00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:59,750
and provision using open source software

00:11:56,829 --> 00:12:02,720
that's being created at the Linux

00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:06,499
Foundation our automotive grade Linux

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:09,199
project grew mainly out of here

00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:11,329
Japan in an early partnership with

00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:14,149
Toyota Motor Company and many other

00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:14,839
Japanese automobile makers and supply

00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:18,229
chains

00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:20,509
companies like Renaissance Panasonic and

00:12:18,229 --> 00:12:23,029
participated in creating an open-source

00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:26,499
reference implementation for the in

00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:29,839
vehicle experience the Informatics

00:12:26,499 --> 00:12:32,749
displays and so forth that project is

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:36,079
now in millions of production vehicles

00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:38,389
worldwide you're going to hear about the

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,309
cloud native computing foundation but I

00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:45,309
think how many people here know

00:12:40,309 --> 00:12:49,819
kubernetes is native so our organization

00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:53,239
really promoted that term cloud native

00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:55,879
computing to redefine for the whole

00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:58,429
world how people build modern

00:12:55,879 --> 00:13:02,689
applications and we're doing that today

00:12:58,429 --> 00:13:05,719
in partnership with over 500 companies

00:13:02,689 --> 00:13:07,999
worldwide this is something a lot of

00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:10,219
people don't know that the Linux

00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:14,269
Foundation is also home to the world's

00:13:10,219 --> 00:13:18,919
largest certificate authority our let's

00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:22,809
encrypt project is securing the majority

00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:26,749
of web traffic by giving away for free

00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:30,619
TLS certificates that help improve the

00:13:26,749 --> 00:13:32,989
security and privacy of everyone the

00:13:30,619 --> 00:13:35,119
idea is that creating a secure web

00:13:32,989 --> 00:13:37,399
experience would just be as simple as a

00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:40,129
began with let's encrypt and it's really

00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:42,709
working and dramatically increasing the

00:13:40,129 --> 00:13:45,709
amount of secure and private traffic

00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:48,859
that runs over the global Internet and

00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:51,470
we have many many more but we didn't

00:13:48,859 --> 00:13:52,590
just stop at software this year we've

00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:55,950
seen a dramatic

00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:59,100
increase in specification development

00:13:55,950 --> 00:14:02,450
and standards development at the Linux

00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:05,130
Foundation with projects like graph QL

00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:07,020
with projects like the open container

00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:10,500
initiative which is both a reference

00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:13,230
implementation and a specification and

00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,790
we have a new organization that we

00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:17,700
launched earlier this year called the

00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:22,140
joint development foundation which just

00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:24,390
three weeks ago received past submitter

00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:27,810
status from the international standards

00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:31,830
organization I so what that means is

00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:36,660
that the Linux Foundation can take from

00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:39,200
a github repo all the way through to an

00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:41,430
accredited international standard

00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:44,820
recognized by the international

00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:47,520
standards organization ISO thanks to our

00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:50,190
joint development foundation we've been

00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:53,700
able to bring the world of standards

00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:57,300
setting and open source together for the

00:14:53,700 --> 00:15:00,180
first time finally this year we've seen

00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:03,750
an increase in hardware related

00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:06,510
initiatives at the foundation this year

00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:09,240
we announced the open power foundation

00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:11,790
moving to the Linux Foundation the risk

00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:15,270
5 foundation moving to the Linux

00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:17,700
Foundation we formed chips alliance with

00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:21,600
many of the largest cloud computing

00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:23,760
vendors in the world these Hardware

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,070
related activities are now taking the

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,440
concepts of open source and applying

00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:31,610
them to silicon instruction set

00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:35,640
technology and other Hardware related

00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:38,370
activities and finally we're not just

00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:41,040
stopping at standards and open hardware

00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:45,360
were also doing open data sharing

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:47,850
initiatives our open source data

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,820
licensing initiatives are making it

00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:54,839
easier for people to share large data

00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:57,959
sets to improve outcomes from machine

00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:59,240
learning models we are building open

00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:01,490
data practices

00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:05,180
to teach people how to use data

00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:07,450
effectively and sharing easily we're

00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:10,430
even creating some ethical AI

00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:13,510
initiatives that help teach people how

00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:15,890
to train models in a way that includes

00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:17,750
implications around the ethics of the

00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:20,899
model that their trip up that they are

00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:23,540
actually training and so we have an a

00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:26,270
major new set of open data sharing

00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:29,270
practices and open data vivo programs

00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:32,330
that will really bring in hopefully a

00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:36,770
new frontier of widely shared collective

00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:40,399
data so what do we have in store for

00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:42,860
2020 in 2020 here are some projects that

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,770
you should keep your eye on one the

00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:47,779
Linux Foundation Energy Initiative this

00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:51,230
is an initiative to create an

00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:54,440
open-source platform to Mata to manage

00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:58,310
the modern utility grids in particular

00:16:54,440 --> 00:17:01,700
we're seeing utility operators in Europe

00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:03,950
in France and other parts of Europe open

00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:07,339
sourcing the software that they're using

00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:11,209
to create smart grid technology that

00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:14,800
powers their entire countries we have

00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:18,140
new security initiatives coming in 2020

00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:21,100
we've done a comprehensive analysis of

00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:23,390
the global software supply chain

00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:26,660
starting with open source projects

00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:29,330
moving to package management systems all

00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:33,200
the way to downstream consumption of the

00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:36,620
source to understand how to at every

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:40,309
level improve the security practices of

00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:43,250
the vast global software supply chain

00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:46,190
we're doing that research in partnership

00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:48,140
with Harvard University's lab for

00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:52,100
innovation science and we'll be

00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:54,320
publishing that research next year we

00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,870
also are seeing significant growth in

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,880
our deep learning initiatives today

00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,800
you're going to hear about a project

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,230
that recently

00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,940
came to the Linux Foundation onyx I

00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:07,450
think that's one that's very interesting

00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:10,810
we have some more projects coming in in

00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:14,050
this area our drug encode project is

00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:17,080
starting to really pick up speed

00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:20,020
this project has more flight hours than

00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:24,370
any other unmanned aerial vehicle

00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:27,580
program in the world finally and then my

00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:29,890
last point is if you haven't gone and

00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:32,920
looked at the Linux Foundation's to do

00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:35,590
group this is a group of open-source

00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:39,690
program management professionals from

00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:43,420
companies like Google Amazon Facebook

00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:47,070
Microsoft companies here in Japan that

00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:50,920
teach each other how they manage

00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:54,130
open-source legal framework choosing

00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:55,960
open source projects creating open

00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:59,650
sources and part of their engineering

00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:02,770
process it literally is a how-to guide

00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:05,230
of how to use open source to create

00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:07,660
commercial products and services so

00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:10,150
we're seeing a ton of growth in that

00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:13,870
particular project and many many more

00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:15,910
and with that I'd like to leave you by

00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:18,970
saying if you're going to the computer

00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:21,670
electronics show the second week of

00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:23,560
January we are going to have a huge

00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:26,410
booth there for our automotive grade

00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:29,200
Linux initiative will have several demo

00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:31,750
vehicles and so many many demos of the

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,610
platform and so if any of you are

00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:36,640
attending that event we look forward to

00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:39,430
seeing you there so it's been a great

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:43,030
year for the foundation and I'd like to

00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:46,480
invite Chris Anna check up to talk to

00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:49,960
all of you about how we create value in

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,970
detail and how you can participate in

00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,070
bringing new projects to our

00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:56,620
organization and participate

00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:58,930
the projects we have so with that you

00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:01,870
know my Inori I'd like to bring Chris

00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:04,540
Anna check up on stage to talk about how

00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:06,790
you can participate in the foundation

00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:09,900
and I want to thank you all for coming

00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,900
