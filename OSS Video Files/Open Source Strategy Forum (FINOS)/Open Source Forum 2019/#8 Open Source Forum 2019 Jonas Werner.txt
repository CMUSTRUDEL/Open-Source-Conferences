good job

00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:13,810
somebody hold on hey I thought you had a

00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,810
massive total

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,289
yes forget it

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,609
yeah the girliest card is give them all

00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:23,829
yes oh but they trap solution

00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:33,600
architecture solitaire much dead it's

00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:36,879
about master chemicals get them all so

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,030
before we had a very simple world not

00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:41,530
too long ago say four years ago where we

00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,899
have like a main office in the Hudson

00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:45,699
branch offices and every house life and

00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:47,589
even then we were looking at trying to

00:00:45,699 --> 00:00:49,960
consolidate our data centers into one

00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:51,850
location was a very popular thing at the

00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,190
time and that kind of made sense when we

00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:56,559
only have you know maybe an email server

00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,969
somewhere out at some place and we

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,339
wanted to put that into a single

00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:02,050
centralized location that's fine but it

00:01:00,339 --> 00:01:05,229
makes very little sense today in this

00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:08,440
world where we are adding on the edge

00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:09,700
locations that we have the aggregation

00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,400
points with the edge that we need to

00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:15,180
have and in addition to all that all the

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:19,330
different public cloud service provider

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:22,000
networks the new also hook up to run our

00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:23,860
closing so today's world is way more

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,870
complicated than the one that we used to

00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:29,230
have before and I know that there was

00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:31,510
the reason report by Cisco that suggests

00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:33,460
that I kind of 22 we're going to have

00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:37,630
twenty eight point five billion devices

00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:39,220
and user devices online and networked so

00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,530
that's a staggering number and we have

00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:44,280
to utilize all those lessons that we

00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:47,190
learned on doing device management

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,890
management in the private cloud as well

00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:52,470
as the public cloud arenas and deploy

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,540
those used by utilize those lessons all

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:58,560
Sony on the energy and the poor at

00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:02,790
locations many times when we're talking

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,040
about IOT and the data that we getting

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,659
from all those sensors and devices one

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,940
of the biggest questions is where do we

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,770
put that data do put it into one of

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,810
those big classes provider networks

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,640
directly or we put them somewhere else

00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,830
we can of course put it in her own data

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,209
center but in that case leveraging all

00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,250
those great services that we have

00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:22,590
available at the public cloud service

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,360
provider becomes difficult so one option

00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,890
and something that many people are

00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,840
looking into right now is to do cloud

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:31,290
data collocations which is putting your

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,420
data appearing point where it is close

00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,220
enough to the big cloud service

00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,380
providers without actually being in one

00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,300
of those locations so that for example

00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,730
in clinics is one company doing those

00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,650
type of services in that case you can

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:47,069
put your data there you can mount those

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,720
volumes that you have into the different

00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:50,370
clouds and they can run services against

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,920
all so that you can have full freedom

00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,630
over how would you utilize the data and

00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,660
what cloud services they can leverage to

00:02:54,630 --> 00:03:00,750
analyze that if you're going to look a

00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:03,480
little bit at the entire end-to-end

00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:06,120
layer that we have in here at the Forum

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,750
we've got the edge devices and then we

00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,610
have Micro data center we have Micro

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,230
data center and my creation points for

00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:14,140
that we have our own data centers and

00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,240
network operation

00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:19,000
and then we have various cloud service

00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,110
providers so we've got to manage the old

00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,120
things you need to have a management

00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:23,710
layer it goes across everything this can

00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,330
be quite complicated to put in there

00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:27,400
because it has to span so many different

00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,230
regions and you have to have a data

00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,570
layer which of course then takes the

00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:34,410
data sends it on tote or either to the

00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:36,640
public cloud or some other location

00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:39,160
we've split it up in a few different

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,380
areas here so there's quite a few

00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,240
different challenges when it comes to

00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:45,280
this we won't talk to about all of these

00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:48,430
but generally what we find when it comes

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,140
to IOT is that customers have 30 areas

00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,880
which are the most concerning to them

00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,870
one of them is the actual management of

00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,120
the IOT devices

00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,410
how do you do 0-5 deployment and how do

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,580
you manage turnoff to us how do you

00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:00,790
patch them make sure they are up to date

00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:03,850
the second one is how do you communicate

00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:06,550
with all those edge devices the real

00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:09,160
sensors for example like you put this in

00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:11,260
a factory or included into a warehouse

00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,910
somewhere where you have humidity

00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,370
sensors and temperature sensors and

00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,930
vibration sensors how do you get all

00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,450
that data element how do you communicate

00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,680
those different devices and that is

00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:22,870
another challenge and the third

00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,640
challenge is in many cases is not just

00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,380
getting the data you have to send

00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,570
commands maybe you have to take the

00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,370
camera and swivel it 30 degrees to the

00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,880
left we have to change the RPM of the

00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,710
horn

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,160
how do you send commands those are the

00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:38,050
areas so we're going to focus on a

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,910
couple of these things now which is the

00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,979
dating gesture how do you get data in it

00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:43,990
and then how do you control devices

00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:46,080
edx founder is very good at those two

00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:49,060
things latex boundary is not great

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,040
managing devices is quite wrong actually

00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:56,680
at the moment but it does the other two

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:59,260
very well so an edge X foundry the kind

00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,240
of logo for this is an octopus which is

00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,789
kind of you know it's a good fit because

00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,740
it's got many arms description those are

00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:08,380
both to the edge as well as to the cloud

00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,940
and cover everything but I mean Japan I

00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:16,030
usually see this and I get hungry

00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:17,710
because they have a key so you know we

00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,539
have this store traffic that writes of

00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,190
the most delightful in white and your

00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:23,080
wife had a kitchen and in the kitchen he

00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,400
started making software I don't

00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,110
recommend that use in the kitchen to

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,180
make them software in most cases but it

00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:31,479
worked for him so it started off there a

00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:33,190
few years ago and since taking that

00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:35,440
software may be open source and

00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:37,449
available through the deans foundation

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,560
to everybody to use and now at this

00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:42,039
stage we have quite a few different

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,380
people working on they had actually it

00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:48,009
big release earlier this summer version

00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:50,080
1.0 and 1.0 is the release that made it

00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:52,900
ready for primetime so to speak it was

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,539
more of a project up to that version 1.0

00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:57,789
is like the LTS the long term support

00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:59,470
release where you can kind of rely upon

00:05:57,789 --> 00:06:02,139
and also in production it has better

00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:04,120
support and all that stuff so it's not

00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:05,710
ready to be utilized not just as a fun

00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,479
project to play around with which

00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,759
honestly it is it's pretty fun to work

00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:11,199
work with just for fun but you can now

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,120
deploy it in production you can feel

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,159
that this is a real reliable solution

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:19,840
that you can have every day for real

00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:22,360
outcomes so that's an overview it is

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,639
obvious the open source it can support

00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,770
many different types of protocols and we

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,469
talked before about having devices in

00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:31,330
factories or in warehouses verified

00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:32,590
being in they're given many different

00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,330
types of devices they will speak

00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:37,270
different protocols the relative

00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:39,069
container formats it speaks those right

00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:41,289
so you can hook it up to Anthony it

00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:43,360
promised as a bunch of micro services in

00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:46,270
containers and you can deploy those any

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,979
way you wish and then you can take data

00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:50,080
from essentially anywhere and you can

00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:52,370
send it to anywhere so it has plugins

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,639
time for google for example for

00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:57,919
ever measure or you can send a tour mu2t

00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:59,960
to some random service summers at your

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,000
honor so you have all the freedom in the

00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,280
world to take the data anywhere and send

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,380
it to them EDX foundry does not call

00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,330
home to date the long term it holds on

00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,160
toward for a short period of time but

00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:12,880
generally is it just takes it in and

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:17,900
sends it off right it doesn't a m-- to

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:19,430
store date a long term though it doesn't

00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,620
require an agent and the reason I have

00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,270
this in here is that they have many

00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,620
people well they think about that

00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,970
technologists that think about being

00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,250
where and the think about being where

00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:31,970
and I've to give a talk about VMware IMT

00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:33,260
Center for Policy Center which requires

00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,840
an agent we need to have at the old

00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:38,120
agent in order to communicate with all

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,910
those edge devices if you use pulse edge

00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,070
expounder does not require magic you can

00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:48,830
just ingest data from anywhere which is

00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:50,720
nice now it's just just us doing it

00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:52,820
these days of using the right zone it

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,410
has become quite a popular project and

00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:57,320
it's not as you can see over 80 members

00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:59,240
backing it and in addition to that you

00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,190
have a lot of these people are of course

00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:06,590
contributing code and being active in

00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:09,979
the community and one in particular is a

00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:13,220
change so I am take has taken this and

00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:16,099
they have made this into a ceremony

00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:19,180
where they take you know of course hx4

00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:22,099
is the open source world like Santos and

00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,180
biotech is taking edges foundry and it's

00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:25,560
releasing about

00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:28,080
expert which is kind of like Red Hat

00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,210
Enterprise Linux where you have support

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,950
professional services patching some

00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:34,020
additional goodies that you might want

00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:36,090
to use so you have the option of taking

00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,919
the project that says you can use it if

00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:40,470
you wish you can integrate it into your

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,150
own solutions or you can purchase a

00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:44,400
version that has to support and all the

00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:46,560
other stuff so that is available and

00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,510
many other companies not - or leveraging

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:54,570
Energex foundry to integrate it into

00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:57,060
their products so it's like we discussed

00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:59,190
micro services they are written in

00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:02,070
several different languages so we've got

00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:03,960
Java or C etc and over the only Java

00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:05,730
services being replaced I would go for a

00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:09,050
sample right so they trying to shake the

00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:11,670
little bit over to that direction and

00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:12,930
you essentially collect data and they

00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:15,210
have something called a device service

00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:17,160
and the device service that has all

00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,930
those plugins that I talked about to

00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,240
hook up to different protocols and

00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:24,480
different types of data formats that are

00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,830
used by edge devices the core services

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,020
hold onto it for a short period of time

00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:29,490
like 30 minutes or so and then some well

00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,110
it sends it on in Egypt but you can

00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:35,760
actually have access to the data for a

00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:38,610
short period of time in between and then

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,440
you export it up this is actually the

00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,520
xpac service has kind of been changed

00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,350
over to distribution distribution

00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,900
service as well we're not medication

00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,160
service but the point is you can take

00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,860
that and then you can hook it up to

00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,240
different types of cloud services and if

00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,100
you wish to use those you can send all

00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,870
the data somewhere else and it will

00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,310
change the formatting on so let's say

00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,480
you have different devices that are

00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:00,060
sending you data on different data

00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,760
formats you can change that index I know

00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:05,430
that or Jason you know CSV or whatever

00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,590
you wish to make it easier to parse for

00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:11,850
your applications wherever you want to

00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:13,320
send them I used all those Microsoft is

00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,950
communicating between each other using

00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,290
rests

00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:18,450
it's very standard that makes this very

00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:20,370
easy to torture as well in case you want

00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:23,600
to you know install this you wanna run

00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:26,420
it you can just use postman

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,430
applying for this you can can access all

00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,170
of those microsomes that directly over a

00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:32,209
standard pressed interface it's very

00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:35,240
easy to look at the day time and change

00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:37,399
settings all that stuff at the moment

00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,980
generally it's deployed be a doctor or

00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:41,720
war or not to convulse so you have one

00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,579
yeah me why does the text file which you

00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,889
just run down from course and you know

00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:47,690
off you go it's very easy you can

00:10:45,889 --> 00:10:50,690
actually get started with a fixed

00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:55,790
boundary in under five minutes that's

00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:57,440
pretty cool and so to go back to this a

00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:00,139
little bit you have any different types

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,459
of edge devices right many of this big

00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:02,810
different providers have different

00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:04,610
protocol so you can have back net for

00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:06,470
example in the building or you can have

00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:08,000
OPC UA in some other location rights you

00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:09,259
have many different types of protocols

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,660
being used by all these different

00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:13,970
devices in normal case if you wanted to

00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:16,550
make your own IMT solution you would

00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:19,220
have to overcome this in some way which

00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,690
is a bit of a pain is this bump up

00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,339
correctly a management protocol so you

00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:24,709
have to have support for Hendrix

00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:27,350
boundary has support for that and if

00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:29,329
you've not seen the protocol let's say

00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:31,279
back then for example in there you might

00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:32,899
have many different kinds of vendors and

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,120
those vendors may have different

00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:36,889
nigelball models so even if you have the

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,600
protocol support in there that's not

00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:39,769
going to be enough you also need to

00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,569
understand what devices you're

00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:44,389
communicating with and you need to be

00:11:41,569 --> 00:11:46,189
able to separate to our pre-k is this if

00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:48,860
you get fifty two for a device is that

00:11:46,189 --> 00:11:51,680
52 degrees centigrade or 52 vibrations

00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,910
per second right you have to have some

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,800
way of mapping that out the

00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:56,389
understanding of the underlying data

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,980
that you're getting even though it can

00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:59,389
read it because you understand the

00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:02,240
protocol you have to understand also

00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:03,949
what data format is being used so vetrix

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,230
foundry had take care off of that board

00:12:03,949 --> 00:12:08,329
as well so here are some of the devices

00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:10,350
that edges foundry already supports and

00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:12,820
as

00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:14,920
so the protocols is easy right the order

00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,720
had the moments without but for the

00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,640
different devices they have something

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,080
called device templates which are

00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,900
general files and those yellow files

00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,820
contains they require you know from

00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,770
government the data format they contain

00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:29,050
information about what type of commands

00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:32,020
the device support so that is easy for

00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:34,060
you them to you or this and then you

00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:36,130
know if be different for each device

00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:38,410
obviously we have a few of these already

00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:40,990
done the daughter that are not done I

00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:43,840
would say that the vast majority does

00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:45,610
not have a template but it's the AMA

00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,750
file if you go in there and have a look

00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,930
at it you can probably recreate

00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:52,030
something up of this I've done some for

00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:54,280
for my demonstrations or I use raspberry

00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:57,640
PI's so you can just take it and make

00:12:54,280 --> 00:13:01,060
your own if you like so those are

00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:04,000
available now let's look at the other

00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:05,410
end so on the client side sure we have

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,380
support for all this stuff that's great

00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,430
but how about the export side so you

00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,140
could like we mentioned on your on

00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:12,850
export to your whatever Center given

00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:15,100
things there you can send off to any of

00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:18,250
the big clouds that's great and it

00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:20,530
transfers the v4 line into JSON XML or

00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:22,390
cc or some other one so if you look at

00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:24,820
the device here for example like back

00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:26,470
now that sounds David rejects foundry it

00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,570
just translate that and send down to

00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:30,910
somewhere else

00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:32,920
and something that is pretty cool about

00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:35,350
it is that you don't just take the data

00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:39,100
right you send commands to the devices

00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:41,860
so on the north and south side edge X

00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:44,530
foundry has a REST API which you can hit

00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:47,200
and they can say this device this

00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:49,210
command and it will then execute that

00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,130
for you so for example if you want to

00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:52,960
execute that you send the command beyond

00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:55,769
the REST API that you have not found and

00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,269
then that will be translated

00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:59,550
eunuch eight with some device or some

00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:02,069
problem but the cool thing about this is

00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:03,119
it's kind of like this right it's like

00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:06,300
four Lord of the Rings

00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:08,100
you have the bond ring that controls all

00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,869
the other stuff if you want to

00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:12,299
communicate with all this different age

00:14:09,869 --> 00:14:13,679
devices you don't have to keep in mind

00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:15,119
all the different protocols you don't

00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:17,730
have to combine the different commands

00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:19,379
that those devices support you only have

00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:23,009
to program for that single northbound

00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:24,749
API that HX is provided as long as you

00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:27,660
can communicate with that so as your

00:14:24,749 --> 00:14:29,879
code can talk to that idea agents will

00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:33,299
translate across to all the other stuff

00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:35,610
so that you don't have to do this and

00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:38,309
you can install it really on anything

00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:40,499
however generally will be hidden to do

00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:42,720
is to install it on an English gateway

00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:45,569
or a box PC or some kind of ruggedized

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,689
industrial PC a respirator is fine a

00:14:45,569 --> 00:14:50,519
respiratory if you have a three you you

00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:52,199
know you can get the base running but I

00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:55,049
would definitely recommend a respiratory

00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:57,389
if you want to test it out and whether

00:14:55,049 --> 00:14:59,790
activate all the services otherwise the

00:14:57,389 --> 00:15:01,230
respiratory will choke after you want so

00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:03,259
you saw that there you can run it close

00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:06,600
to the edge so if you're looking at this

00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:08,759
diagram that you had before it flicks

00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,559
generally would be on the south end of

00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:12,089
that diagram you would install it very

00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:14,339
close to the devices that you want to

00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:16,290
control and take metrics from not on the

00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:17,759
other end and that means of course that

00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:21,049
you would be installing edge X on with

00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:24,240
many many times maybe using the apron or

00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:25,889
templates of difference for example it

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,269
could be one way of like we just saw

00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:30,420
previously in one of the presentations

00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:34,110
so that's a way to install HX and then

00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:36,480
run it so it's kind of like blue right

00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:38,970
it glues together F devices use together

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,559
all the cloud stuff right it bindable up

00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:42,929
together and then you have something

00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,699
that actually works the only part that

00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:45,480
is kind of missing is a good device

00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:48,869
management

00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:51,239
I'd look for that little smirk it's kind

00:15:48,869 --> 00:15:52,709
of outside the scope so looking at the

00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:54,329
architecture right this is the actual

00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:55,019
architecture diagram for every song

00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:57,269
today

00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:59,489
the purple part that you have in the

00:15:57,269 --> 00:16:01,799
middle are all the services that are

00:15:59,489 --> 00:16:03,269
required by default and you can't live

00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:04,379
without it wouldn't work without full

00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:06,509
services in the middle

00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:08,160
the other ones are essentially optional

00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:10,679
you don't have to activate them you

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:14,489
don't have to run but if you do but you

00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:16,319
don't have to so yeah core data command

00:16:14,489 --> 00:16:19,199
metadata registry in configuration and

00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:21,600
that's enough to run the whole thing and

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,189
then Lauren day you're here you have all

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,569
those plugins required with protocols

00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:28,259
and here you have all your devices right

00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:29,939
for the southbound plans you have a

00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:32,160
rules engine which you can configure and

00:16:29,939 --> 00:16:36,209
say okay if this data comes in from this

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,619
device take this action or you can just

00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:39,929
do that outside as well you can do

00:16:37,619 --> 00:16:41,429
scheduling so you can say every minute

00:16:39,929 --> 00:16:43,439
to go and check this device or

00:16:41,429 --> 00:16:44,970
information and it's funny right some of

00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:47,309
the devices you need to check if you

00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:50,129
need to get later or something in some

00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:51,720
cases you actually converse to activate

00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:53,459
it so you can be data then you read the

00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,949
data and then you change the second

00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:59,639
packages so one of those you know maybe

00:16:55,949 --> 00:17:01,919
a single data xx will have that in his

00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:03,929
configuration in the yamen file that I

00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:04,409
talked about before that is already in

00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:05,939
there

00:17:04,409 --> 00:17:07,380
so that when you send one command it

00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:10,130
will translate that across to maybe

00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:12,209
three or four commands that are required

00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:14,069
and I'm going to talk about the

00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:18,480
distribution there which will send up

00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:20,669
data so let's just take an example if it

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,500
is windy to get an a value from a sensor

00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:24,360
saying that temperature is over a

00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,909
hundred degrees it comes in via back net

00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,260
goes to correlate stored short-term but

00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:30,029
it's also sent out curricular the

00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:32,039
distribution layer where will be

00:17:30,029 --> 00:17:34,889
translated across to JSON or XML or

00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:38,519
something else and then we send that off

00:17:34,889 --> 00:17:40,750
to some flowers and one crimson

00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:42,250
could be that Wow okay so we get that

00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:44,649
back and say wow that's that's way too

00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:47,200
hot then we send the command to

00:17:44,649 --> 00:17:49,299
northbound API hit the rules engine and

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,690
that we should command which can go out

00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:54,490
over a different protocol and then stop

00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:57,009
a machine or change the European value

00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,840
or something or open event whatever you

00:17:57,009 --> 00:18:03,610
want right you can take an action based

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:05,830
on that data so if you look at some use

00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:08,470
cases some of the things obviously sends

00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:10,779
me probably the first long-term support

00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:12,129
release to be released very recently we

00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:13,649
don't have many customers that are using

00:18:12,129 --> 00:18:17,019
this in production at the moment

00:18:13,649 --> 00:18:22,480
however use cases that we've had here in

00:18:17,019 --> 00:18:24,580
APJ over the last year or 2019 have

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,870
included for example as you can see some

00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:28,450
of the manufacturing customers who have

00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:31,779
had people in India for example will use

00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:34,960
this for their robots painting car parts

00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:37,690
to both get information and to change

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,330
settings and control the robots we've

00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:43,090
had one subway when a contractor that

00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:45,820
does the control of subway access

00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:48,429
hatches and doors to Subway's wanting to

00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:51,669
use edge X to get data and to control

00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:53,139
the locked state of doors a food

00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:55,029
manufacturer wants to control the

00:18:53,139 --> 00:18:56,830
different devices they have so they have

00:18:55,029 --> 00:18:58,269
a huge amount of different types of

00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:00,220
devices and machines they've been around

00:18:58,269 --> 00:19:02,230
for a while and some are newer so

00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:04,809
there's a big mix of devices in there

00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:06,549
they want to be able to essentially take

00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:09,490
a very old system that they've had and

00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:14,289
then automate it if you can utilize

00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:16,269
metrics for it to to do that then we

00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:18,490
have some small composting surveillance

00:19:16,269 --> 00:19:20,379
we have one customer particular for the

00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:23,379
surveillance part that are hooking up

00:19:20,379 --> 00:19:25,269
the cameras to then they are running

00:19:23,379 --> 00:19:27,159
inferencing on the date on the images

00:19:25,269 --> 00:19:29,679
and then they take the metadata and they

00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:31,659
only save the metadata throw away the

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,429
images first then if they have the

00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:35,890
metadata they already know what's on the

00:19:33,429 --> 00:19:39,130
video and then they don't have to sound

00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:40,780
data back over the back wall globally

00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,679
we've also got some building automations

00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,690
where they've been looking at of course

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,690
controlling temperature humidity

00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:48,670
lighting and also room occupancy so they

00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:50,740
define dedicating the user is sort of a

00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:53,230
person is in the room or not so they

00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:55,960
check that plan across this is for a

00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:58,780
water treatment plant treating water

00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:01,570
they waste water and then look at some

00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:03,190
stuff together with the Intel for poor

00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:05,620
retail where they want to find out how

00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:07,330
many people are queuing for a certain

00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:09,309
product or a desk at the same time or

00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:11,260
and what they can check you know how

00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:13,240
much stock you have of certain things

00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:15,309
right those kind of things as well have

00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,630
been utilized globally so we don't use

00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:19,120
cases for that so it is getting much

00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:20,710
more popular we've actually seen now off

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,169
this summary of you have the one point

00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:25,960
on release the the number of downloads

00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:28,000
of the containers have skyrocketed so

00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,650
it's in a ridiculous increase in the

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,230
amount of downloads we've seen so we

00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:36,630
think that this is really now taking off

00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:38,980
in a real sense so that's pretty much it

00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:40,990
there are new good pages here to have a

00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:43,299
look at there's a stock channel where

00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:44,650
all of the developers are generally

00:20:43,299 --> 00:20:47,290
online which you can just invite

00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:49,059
yourself to and ask questions the people

00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:53,679
who made it or are there so you can just

00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:55,000
ask and the many other things quite good

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,980
if your interest to go through the docs

00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,870
and have a look at the API walkthrough

00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,190
which is really good that will introduce

00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,929
you to all the different parts on the

00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:03,910
system you can try yourself

00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:05,650
and it's really installing it like I

00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:08,110
mentioned earlier and if you can't like

00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:10,540
in a Linux machine like a Googler and

00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:12,309
you want to install it literally you

00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:14,470
know five minutes and you're you're gone

00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:17,710
it's very fast very easy to get started

00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:18,580
with and for the recipe if you want to

00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:22,179
run in the respirable

00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:24,309
and just use snaps snap install and then

00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:26,070
you're off it's super easy

00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:28,010
nano download and install those

00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:32,870
those containers that you need for you

00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:32,870
