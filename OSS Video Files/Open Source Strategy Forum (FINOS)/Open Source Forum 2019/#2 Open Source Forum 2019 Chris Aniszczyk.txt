yes so as Jim and Norris on mentioned I

00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,970
want to talk a little bit more

00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,250
you bring projects to the Linux

00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:17,660
Foundation if you were curious to do so

00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,360
and also how we kind of support and

00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,849
sustain these projects within the Linux

00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,250
Foundation Jim did a pretty good job of

00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:27,230
introducing what the elf is but you know

00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,329
in terms of who I am I spend probably

00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,890
most of my day job working on the cloud

00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:33,230
native computing foundation which is the

00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,760
home of kubernetes I also helped start

00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,350
the open container initiative which is

00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,480
standardized a lot of docker container

00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:40,309
standards and I essentially run Deverell

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,780
all throughout the Linux Foundation by

00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:44,059
supporting initiatives like to do group

00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,800
and and so on so in a previous life I

00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:48,440
you know was the person who worked on

00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,870
fedora and Gentoo Linux wrote a lot of

00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,550
the Eclipse parts of Eclipse IDE and

00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,290
spent a lot of time working on

00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,630
engineering I've even read about in

00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:58,280
early days of my career so yeah today

00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,720
I'm going to talk about you know I'll

00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,370
skim a little bit faster about what the

00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,739
Linux Foundation did a pretty good job

00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:05,720
about that I'll talk about how we

00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:07,490
operate as an organization a lot of

00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,619
people still think that the Linux

00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,970
Foundation just supports Linux but we

00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:12,979
support a lot of different types of

00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,780
projects and organizations were

00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:17,060
essentially Foundation as a service

00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,780
which is far left to refer to as any

00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,420
organization

00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:22,520
I will then answer the question of if

00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,409
you have a company organization or

00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,060
project and you want to you know bring

00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:28,400
your code or project to the Linux

00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,950
Foundation how to do that at some

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,090
examples and then I'll kind of end

00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:35,579
things with some basic tips and

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,689
the North QA so what is the Lynx

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:38,340
foundation I think Jim already did a

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:40,320
good job about this covering this I'm

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,450
not going to go to detail but a couple

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,450
of things is we essentially have

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,610
foundations that are either split by

00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:49,200
technical focus area or industry

00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,210
vertical and some of the new ones that

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,039
we've done this year I tried to

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,270
highlight in red actually just Jim

00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:55,649
reminded me that we actually have an

00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,860
energy one that I need to add in this

00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,299
damn tiger or dam down here now but some

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,729
new stuff that we did this year is like

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,229
you know we brought the rs.5 foundation

00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:06,270
and it open power foundation on the

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:09,000
Linux Foundation which give us gives us

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,890
you know kind of a play in the more

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,420
important open you know instruction set

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:14,100
space you know that you know that's

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:17,430
gonna change a whole ship industry in

00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,019
the next decade I was involved in

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,180
setting up the continuous delivery

00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:23,190
foundation which a lot of people I'm

00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,200
sure you have used Jenkins for sure

00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,000
everyone and this probably is not use

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,410
Jenkins once in their life but it serves

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,780
as a neutral home for continuous

00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,880
delivery projects and of course we've

00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,620
kind of rebooted our AI efforts under

00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,540
and if they called LFA I and I think

00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,880
later today we'll hear someone talking

00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,920
about onyx another yeah I think so we're

00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,329
it's a large organization you know

00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,359
there's many many projects and we

00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:47,549
support a huge swath of the of the

00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:49,260
source ecosystem so you know like I say

00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:50,850
we're a Federation of foundations the

00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,670
Lynx foundation does more than just

00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:57,600
Linux or for the for the Star you know

00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:59,340
started anything so yes you know typical

00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,680
thing open sources continue to grow I

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:05,069
think github said something like there's

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,329
50 million or so projects that they have

00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:10,220
that's continually grow it's just

00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:12,299
absolutely bananas you know the LF we

00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,950
we're very different compared to other

00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:16,109
organizations so things like the Apache

00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:18,660
foundation basically Balkans you know

00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:21,380
any project right the elephant we truly

00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:23,549
really care about a small segment of

00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:26,010
projects out there that we really want

00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:28,829
to grow and build sustainable ecosystems

00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:30,359
on we're not a place to just dump open

00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:32,670
source projects we're here to actually

00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:35,220
truly build commercial and you go

00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:37,350
systems around them to sustain them and

00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,140
we kind of have this model what we call

00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:41,770
it

00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:43,960
you know we host projects where fear our

00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:46,990
members associated with those projects

00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:49,360
those members build products that make

00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:51,190
profits and so what happens is you kind

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,690
of have a healthy ecosystem where we're

00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,220
the neutral home the projects we don't

00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,010
do products that's what our members do

00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,510
those products produce profits and it

00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:01,210
gets reinvested back in the ecosystem

00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,830
Sol XT and CF we have 500 plus members

00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:05,140
those members do a lot of kubernetes

00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:07,030
related products those make money those

00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,010
get refunded those get funded back into

00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:12,370
the to the foundation to kind of build

00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:15,070
this nice healthy ecosystem this is

00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:19,239
basically the best way in my opinion to

00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:20,739
sustain open source projects so this is

00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:22,870
type of work of like what the actual

00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:24,669
e.l.f does for projects you know we

00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,470
provide a mutual home which is super

00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:29,790
important we've quite a lot of developer

00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:31,960
tooling to assist our projects

00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:34,300
infrastructure you know sometimes see

00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,820
ICD services security scanning like Jim

00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:39,010
mentioned we do a lot of ecosystem

00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,510
development we're all here today at the

00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,980
open source forum in Japan to learn a

00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:44,350
little bit more about open source but we

00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,750
do this all over the world we do it in

00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:49,270
North America Europe other parts of a

00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,700
pack we just did a crew Nettie's forum

00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:54,850
and synth and Sydney recently so we're

00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:56,229
truly kind of global in what we do and

00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:59,740
of course we provide a lot of IP

00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:01,780
management related tooling and services

00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,270
to ensure that when there are these

00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:07,030
corporations and members build products

00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:09,280
they need to ensure that the IP is clean

00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:11,860
and so on so that's kind of our really

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,410
fundamental job in the organization so

00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:17,260
you know one thing to note about

00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:19,270
sustainability is you know really it's

00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,160
all about how to kind of build an

00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,870
ecosystem that becomes diverse and

00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,150
manage

00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:27,390
over a long term to basically ensure

00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:29,940
that not one company or entity is truly

00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,980
responsible for its success and you know

00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,420
this is a typical diagram you see if you

00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,550
ever you know thought of the product

00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,630
management or you know had a chance to

00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,370
go to business school but essentially

00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,440
all products have a life cycle

00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:42,090
right you go in the beginning you build

00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,460
them out you invest in them to try to

00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,530
grow them and eventually things become

00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,480
stable over time you have some type of

00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:50,310
growth and things kind of sunset over

00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,100
time and the whole goals you invest and

00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,260
then you reap the rewards of overtime

00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,220
and the important thing you know is

00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:58,530
there's no difference between an open

00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,330
source project and really a product per

00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:02,250
se when it comes to this life cycle they

00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:05,700
both share certain thing open source

00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:07,560
projects and eventually they you know

00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,970
get used widely or they die and then

00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,730
things eventually get you know kind of

00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:14,040
sunset are sustained over time and the

00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:15,810
Linux Foundation our goal is to kind of

00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,180
guide these projects and support these

00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:20,280
projects through through this lifecycle

00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,800
so you know there's really different

00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,540
phases here in terms of you know things

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,980
you do at launch things that you do when

00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,440
you commercialize an open source project

00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:30,390
maintained and it's a statement the LFT

00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:33,570
has services for all these different

00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:36,570
types of phases I'm not going to go too

00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:39,090
much into detail but the kind of I have

00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:42,330
here is you know things like you know

00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:44,160
Linux or Nettie's you know all have you

00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:46,050
know different life cycles right you

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,720
know arguably I think Jim stole like

00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,760
Linux is still going up on its on its

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,560
graph that's not an sustain necessary

00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,660
for say but we have other projects that

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,700
may you know kind of in the more mature

00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:00,480
beside the house but the LF we basically

00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:02,730
act as kind of a you know mutual fund or

00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,500
index fund is kind of analogy I look for

00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:06,390
open-source products because what

00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,940
happens is if one of these things

00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:10,650
becomes you know maybe boring or or less

00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,420
relevant to the industry it doesn't mean

00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:14,270
the organization suffers because we have

00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:17,510
different you know kind of play

00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:19,070
that's kind of how how we work you know

00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,600
I'm not gonna die but like you know when

00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:22,910
you launch a project you're all about

00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,430
investing in building a brand trying to

00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:28,130
attract as many companies and

00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:29,870
organizations to the initiative you know

00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,830
recently you know earlier this year we

00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,720
started the continuous delivery

00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,670
foundation which brought you know

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,520
Jenkins spinnaker and Tecton together

00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:39,320
and we invest invested a lot in building

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,540
this brand it's a very you know build

00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:44,000
website we've done conferences we've

00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:46,820
done scene econ and so on so we invest a

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,310
lot to kind of build out community at

00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,230
launch time then we go out commercialize

00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:53,840
things so when me here is basically

00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:55,940
trying to diversify the maintainer base

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,340
you know maybe launching some type of

00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:00,920
like conformance program so I proven a

00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,420
certified maybe some training and then

00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,730
eventually you get to the maintain and

00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:06,800
sustain aspects of the life cycle which

00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:08,360
you know naturally not all projects

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,080
continue to grow forever so you kind of

00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,640
make sure that you know these things are

00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,930
healthy enough that that companies could

00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:18,710
depend on them even though if they're

00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:21,050
not the most you know attract they were

00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:24,039
a popular project these days because you

00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:25,960
know just like products and

00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:28,259
and open-source projects everything has

00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:31,150
a kind of cycle to it at the end of day

00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:33,610
so skip that alright I'll talk a little

00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:36,430
bit about different projects at the

00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:39,729
Linux Foundation I think a lot of people

00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:41,860
don't realize how diverse of a set of

00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:43,870
projects we have so this is kind of like

00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,760
a graph you know that I use or

00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:48,639
diagramming as a better would you know

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:51,279
describe it is I kind of divide it into

00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:53,980
two different acts accesses so the

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,829
y-axis is we have projects that are code

00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,600
based right in a software code and then

00:08:56,829 --> 00:09:00,519
we have just thought that our spec based

00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,860
kind of like standards you kind of think

00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:04,510
of that and then on kind of the x-axis

00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,399
we have what I call single project

00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:08,139
communities and then umbrella project

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,389
communities were essentially are things

00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:12,519
like C and C if we have lots of projects

00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:13,839
part of them and so here's just some

00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:17,139
examples where you know for example

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,639
let's encrypt a kiss nude is kind of no

00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:21,279
longer open J yes but these are kind of

00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:23,649
like singular standalone type projects

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,990
and then we have umbrella projects that

00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:30,279
hosts projects under a particular theme

00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:32,230
and vertical or technology you know

00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:35,470
focus and so we have things like CDF for

00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:38,350
continuous delivery LFO afford AI OpenGL

00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:40,120
JavaScript and the llama spectrum we

00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,290
have a variety of spec projects a lot of

00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,579
people don't realize the Linux

00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:45,310
Foundation hosts

00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:48,100
spec projects we have our singular specs

00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:50,199
things like OCI and open api initiative

00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,029
which is home of a kind there were the

00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:53,949
swagger folks back in the day and then

00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:55,600
we have our new kind of organization

00:09:53,949 --> 00:09:57,970
called the joint development foundation

00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,490
which is really an umbrella project

00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:04,329
umbrella organization for spec related

00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:06,160
projects so the convention you know we

00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:07,300
have you know these kind of code plus

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,190
single community things these are

00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:13,180
generally kind of focused on one

00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:14,780
particular project sometimes we're

00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,980
funded sometimes are unfun

00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:19,700
doesn't really matter but here's some

00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:20,930
examples that we have umbrella this I

00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,760
think this is really kind of where the

00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:26,000
core of the Linux Foundation is we

00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:28,700
prefer to kind of bring organizations

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,290
under one particular focus area it's the

00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,700
best way to kind of raise money and

00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:34,550
sustain things versus kind of having

00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:37,850
just singular things on the side and if

00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:40,550
you look at this we almost have umbrella

00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:42,830
organizations for every kind of major

00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:45,140
technology vertical out there there's

00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:47,470
very few that that are missing so we

00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:52,450
have things for film automotive

00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:55,000
blockchain AI cloud networking

00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:56,900
JavaScript you know these are huge

00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,890
organizations that really make up the

00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:04,240
kind of you know front of the Linux

00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:07,250
Foundation s as an organization so you

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,740
know one example for CN CF that we kind

00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,270
of like the use of like what you know

00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:13,430
what it has the LF kind of done for

00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:16,280
these projects well when I helped start

00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:18,050
CNC Evan you know 2015 it was a very

00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:21,350
similar organization we had less than 30

00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:23,120
members we all met in this it's actually

00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:25,760
it's our fourth year anniversary I

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,670
remember this we met in a small meeting

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,670
room in New York City to kick off her

00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:34,070
first board meeting it was maybe it was

00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:37,600
less than 20 people in error it was very

00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:40,550
tiny and now you know four years later

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,500
it's hard to at least get away from for

00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:44,710
banana this is firm from our perspective

00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:47,030
it's basically you know every cloud

00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:48,650
public-private offers it as a service

00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:50,450
everyone that's building new security

00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:52,970
applications is finding some way to

00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:54,230
support kubernetes you know even like

00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,790
they could do folks are going to be

00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,980
refactoring everything any distributed

00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:00,950
system that has its own way to kind of

00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:03,680
you know do consensus and deploy was all

00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:06,650
were factoring to rebase it on urban

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,820
days so yeah those those are kind of

00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:10,580
results I mean the other kind of thing

00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:12,650
Jim very much likes this diagram is

00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:15,080
Google Trends for what it's worth is

00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:17,570
good at that but you could see you know

00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,529
CN CF when it was founded you know kind

00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:22,279
of December 25

00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:24,740
teen type of time frame you know uh the

00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:26,329
comparison between OpenStack organ EDIUS

00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,980
meso sigh just through lambda in there

00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:30,170
because it's kind of interesting to

00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,699
watch is you know once once we kind of

00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,259
started getting the flywheel of

00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:35,449
supporting the organization building an

00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:36,949
ecosystem convinced any other clouds get

00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:39,920
involved launching conformance program

00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:41,540
you know about two years in is a little

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,990
less than two years at when we notice we

00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:46,970
basically surpassed OpenStack you know

00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:50,089
Lam done all that stuff there and now

00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:52,759
it's just you know quite crazy how how

00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:54,379
different you know things are these days

00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:56,749
and this is truly the role of foundation

00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:59,120
and building the ecosystem build a brand

00:12:56,749 --> 00:13:02,240
build excitement and sustain these

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,490
projects hyper ledger is another example

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,199
I'm not the biggest blockchain person

00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:07,670
but you know there's a huge amount of

00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:09,559
community out there people trying to

00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:11,749
build really interesting products and

00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:13,370
solutions out there puff blockchain you

00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:16,579
know the big issue with blockchain at

00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:18,769
that time was it was inherently tied to

00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:20,749
kind of a lot of the the crypto related

00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:23,000
you know folks and what you really

00:13:20,749 --> 00:13:24,559
needed is a neutral organization to

00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,970
bring together the people on the

00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:27,829
business side of the house looking to

00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:30,050
build serious products and solutions and

00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:31,759
so hyper ledger accomplished that they

00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:33,290
have grown to over think it's got to be

00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,389
close to three hundred something members

00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:37,910
they have three fifty I need to update

00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:40,430
that so yeah Jim Jim knows he's probably

00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:43,040
logged in with Salesforce recently but

00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:46,220
so it's basically has almost every

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,809
financial institution and startup in the

00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,639
blockchain space involved under this

00:13:47,809 --> 00:13:51,079
thing and they're actually building

00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:53,209
serious things that are actually being

00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:55,040
used you know throughout the industry

00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:56,600
I'd give them a hard time one that's to

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,100
use case a blockchain and then you know

00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,870
brian behlendorf or runs it will let go

00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,759
right off some kind of oh it's using the

00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:03,679
manage like the supply chain of you know

00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:06,379
what diamonds and rolling I've got a

00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:07,879
super cool so but these are the type of

00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:10,309
things that you know the Linux

00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:12,949
Foundation helps accomplish in different

00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:14,870
cell foundations here's our kind of

00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:15,980
single spec things we have up like a lot

00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:19,120
of people don't realize we host a lot of

00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:21,680
specs so you know we have opening guy

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,690
there's the graph QL foundation

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,300
launched earlier this year so these are

00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:28,580
just kind of samples of what we have

00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:30,620
built on the spec side of the house and

00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:32,600
of course earlier this year we also

00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,430
announced the chewing development

00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,110
foundation which is kind of our umbrella

00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:39,380
organization for specs so some of these

00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:40,850
specs main potentially well under JDF

00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,980
we're going to interface with JDF in the

00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:45,680
future because as an organization would

00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:50,300
truly prefer umbrella

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:52,399
you know foundations are if we can so

00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:55,100
one interesting the kind of question I

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,320
get a lot from folks is like you know

00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:59,060
what's what's the value of a foundation

00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,620
right you know what do I get out of

00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:03,020
there where I can't just say why can I

00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:05,600
just post my project on github that

00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:07,370
should be good enough well you know I

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,010
think the most important thing you could

00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:13,959
kind of think about is there really is a

00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:17,540
value to neutral of ownership of assets

00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:19,970
you know like transparency and open

00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:21,830
governance helps build trust and if you

00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:23,480
have a lot of partners we work with you

00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:25,310
know they're going to need that in order

00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,830
to actually believe is the reason cover

00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:30,470
days it's easy if have been successful

00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:33,110
is because the organization neutrally

00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:34,459
owns those assets we as a community come

00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,650
together to build a fair

00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:39,820
conformance and certification program

00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:43,760
that everyone agrees to that type of

00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:47,180
mindset of transparent neutral openly

00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:50,000
government organizations you know truly

00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:52,850
enables a positive set positive some

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,400
thinking amongst everyone in my opinion

00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:57,140
no one is fearful that one organization

00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,240
a company will take advantage of them

00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,920
because you kind of have this community

00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,579
of folks working together in a neutral

00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:06,440
fashion so you know earlier this year we

00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:08,510
started to produce these what we call

00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,959
project journey reports which basically

00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:13,339
try to like you know make metrics like a

00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:15,920
minted majors that data-driven approach

00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:18,470
of the value of the foundation and so we

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,839
did this for kubernetes recently and you

00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:22,339
know as you could see when most

00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,040
open-source projects start

00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:26,019
it's almost they almost start orders are

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,819
just single progenitor

00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:29,949
single owner they'd been created right

00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:31,749
and so if you look at kubernetes in the

00:16:29,949 --> 00:16:33,699
beginning it was mostly all triggered by

00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:36,489
google right and if you look if you

00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:38,079
shift from kind of the start in 2014 to

00:16:36,489 --> 00:16:42,480
five-person later

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:44,589
Google now does about 25% of the overall

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,189
contributions to kubernetes and it's a

00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:50,709
fairly diverse healthy ecosystem now

00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:52,329
what is crazy about this is Google

00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,860
actually did not slow down their

00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:55,749
contributions their cumulative

00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:58,029
contributions the product have only

00:16:55,749 --> 00:17:01,899
increased so they've actually done more

00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:03,939
work but the overall slice work is only

00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:05,020
25 percent is which happened is more

00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,640
people showed up

00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:09,370
everyone had started to do more work and

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,520
to me this is like a core value of what

00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:14,589
a foundation helps support and provide

00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:17,350
and we've started to do these project

00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:19,539
journey reports for other projects and

00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:21,490
CNC fr-from the highest level graduated

00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:23,559
projects and this is just an example on

00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:26,380
when we were on when envoy started out

00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:29,830
which is a popular service proxy it was

00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:31,720
all lift right and now it's diversify

00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:33,610
we're sure lyft is doing a lot of the

00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,830
work but people came up out of nowhere

00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:37,360
started to throw a lot of resources into

00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:39,940
it a bunch of other end user companies

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,700
and polyclinics all right so these are

00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:44,889
the types of ecosystems that we intend

00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,600
to build as an organization so I highly

00:17:44,889 --> 00:17:47,529
recommend that you go through these

00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,029
reports because they're very

00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:51,370
entertaining and it provides more

00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:54,549
manthena German approach to how we look

00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:56,260
to things so you know like I mentioned

00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:57,880
you know why bring your stuff to a

00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:00,580
foundation why not just throw it on

00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:03,010
github and let things work so one thing

00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:05,710
that we do that may actually provide a

00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:07,600
high level of services for our projects

00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,830
a lot of people you know don't realize

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,590
that the Linux Foundation we actually

00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:13,480
have professional staff you know outside

00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,429
of just like me we have technical

00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,899
writers and people that work in

00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:19,000
different regions in the world if you

00:18:16,899 --> 00:18:19,560
wanted to open you know or reach out to

00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,710
members

00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:27,030
in in Tokyo and Sydney and I know that

00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:28,800
all truly a global in an organization we

00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:30,330
help them with infrastructure we help

00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,820
them with you know certification and

00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:34,680
training so you know essentially you

00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,290
know I think as a foundation you have to

00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:39,270
offer more than just purely a neutral

00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:41,180
home and you know the Linux Foundation I

00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:43,890
tend to tell people is truly the

00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:45,630
professional you know open source

00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:47,220
organization where we actually provide a

00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:50,070
professional level of services we nearly

00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:51,600
have 200 employees worldwide that work

00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:53,850
for the organization providing support

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,040
for our projects and you can poke around

00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:58,260
we've kind of documented you know what

00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:03,090
CNC of offers there's other projects

00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:04,830
that Li L FAI documents it also so all

00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:06,120
right bringing you want to say you want

00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:08,790
a green open source project Dylan's

00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:11,010
foundation what do you do so generally

00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,270
you know what happens is most projects

00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:14,850
when they start you know they usually

00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:17,160
come to us in life hey we want to like

00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:19,500
add more developers to our projects you

00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,840
know how can you help us do that and so

00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,880
we have a bit of a process process that

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,830
we haven't have in place so you know a

00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,480
couple reasons are you know so there's

00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:29,490
like Edward of elders or hey can you

00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,260
help us post an event so a lot of people

00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:33,600
don't realize Linux Foundation we kind

00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:36,300
of have a an event events as a service

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:39,780
right where if your community like graph

00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:41,730
QL node pesto kubernetes wants an event

00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:44,010
we host an event for you because guess

00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:45,840
what events are some of the best ways to

00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:47,310
kind of build communities you get a

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,560
bunch of developers in the same room

00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:51,060
with with new people that may be

00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,940
interested in the project and kind of

00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:56,430
magic happens q Khan started with you

00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:58,070
know a few hundred people in a room and

00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:00,920
now you know

00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:02,810
a month ago we hosted Q Congress 12,000

00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,370
people that showed up so we you know you

00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:06,830
know building these type of communities

00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:08,600
through events is super useful so and of

00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:12,860
course we were a neutral host for

00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:15,710
intellectual property so this is another

00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:18,470
way another advantage the LF you know

00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:19,910
people from a Tolstoy but essentially

00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:21,320
like what actually for my career I

00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:23,360
realized I've been involved with patchy

00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,250
foundation eclipse foundation Linux

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,980
Foundation of a bunch of these in you

00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:29,990
know the the LF way of doing things is

00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,820
you know I'm a firm believer that like

00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:33,290
each open source project project out

00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:35,420
there is kind of unhappy in their own

00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:38,150
unique way and there's crew truly like

00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:40,550
you can you can't just have one way of

00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:43,550
doing things you have to customize each

00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:45,710
project for what it wants to accomplish

00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:48,200
so and the elif really does that you

00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:50,150
don't have this cookie cutter one

00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:53,120
approach to build a foundation or

00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:56,420
ecosystem we personalize it for each

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,220
proper project so that's kind of might

00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,480
the LFA is that there is no way and we

00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,560
kind of work with each project

00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,520
individually

00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:07,040
I know if Jim relates that but it's a

00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,540
great event classic so what are the

00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,270
basic privacy requirements if you wanted

00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:13,430
to bring your project to the LF one you

00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,680
know you have to have a notice oh s I

00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:17,840
approve license right Stefano on

00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:20,090
supported by the next foundation member

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,700
you know we have 1600 members sure you

00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:25,150
can find someone to support project

00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:27,920
complete neutral ownership of all assets

00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:31,790
things like the trademark github

00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:35,170
accounts CICE services domain these all

00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:37,070
become managed by the LFO IT

00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:40,040
organization right because if you don't

00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:41,720
give that up to a neutral entity you

00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:44,270
could have one company you know for

00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,070
example I don't know if you know Google

00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:48,440
right you know Google owns the SDO

00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:50,450
project right so they get to decide how

00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,980
that trademark is used so if you depend

00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,840
on them you got to be careful so

00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:56,480
trademarks are very important seeing

00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:59,120
with the new community the most

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:03,320
important thing that we kind of stress

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:05,330
is you know we live by the technical

00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,310
receipt model and what I mean here is

00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:09,230
anyone is welcome to contribute to the

00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:11,530
technical projects membership is never

00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:14,540
required all membership is for is to

00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:17,960
raise funds to help sustain the project

00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:20,410
to host events pay for security audits

00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,850
whatever so sir membership is completely

00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:25,550
orthogonal to the technical communities

00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:30,610
and so we require this on every project

00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:32,960
that we ghost so like I mentioned before

00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:35,420
the LF way is that there is one way so

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,700
all of our projects come all shapes of

00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,650
different sizes some are very small you

00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:42,530
know and some are very large like

00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:44,420
kubernetes we don't really dictate one

00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:47,530
size everything is different so we kind

00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:49,970
of customize to kind of work with you

00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:52,640
trademarks like I mentioned is very

00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:54,590
crucial I think a lot of people don't

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,110
understand this fact that you know if

00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:58,730
you don't have the trademarks at a

00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:02,000
neutral organization they could

00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:03,920
basically prevent potential people the

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,780
ecosystem to use that name especially if

00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:08,030
they're building for days as a service

00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:10,430
you know a you know Microsoft assure

00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:12,590
community service if that trademark is

00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:14,510
not owned by C and C F and govern in a

00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:16,670
neutral way Google could just say you

00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:18,320
can't call it that right that's not fair

00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:20,750
that's not a you ability usually the

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,250
system so trademark ownership is good

00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:24,140
and this is something that almost all

00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:26,170
open-source foundations do is do a

00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:28,460
neutral ownership of those trademarks

00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:29,900
you know I'm not gonna dive into this

00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:32,240
kind of detail and you can go look at

00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,500
this either you know by yourself if you

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,850
actually wanted to bring a project to

00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,250
the Linux Foundation like here are

00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:38,810
usually a step of like project

00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:41,120
preparation we require it's like

00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:43,160
identify internal stakeholders ensure

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,960
your i key is clean and then so on so

00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,520
this is just something we work with when

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,020
we kind of work with each project on

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:53,580
Digital bases to figure out what's

00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:56,130
what's right for them like a mention we

00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:58,320
try to push people a lot to move

00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:59,760
projects to umbrella organizations

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,030
because you know think about it if you

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,350
have a a I project you know why do your

00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:06,540
own thing when there's already something

00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:08,820
called El FAI or hey you have something

00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:10,080
for the automotive sector great we have

00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:13,260
the automotive Knights foundation so

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,970
generally we are pushing more of our

00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,320
projects under these umbrella things and

00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:18,390
the way these umbrella organizations

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,580
work is they usually have lots of

00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:22,890
members they all pull their resources on

00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:25,080
earth single thing to support all of our

00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:28,710
projects across that specific top dollar

00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:31,620
organization we have standalone projects

00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:33,270
also don't necessarily go that route but

00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:35,040
you know we work with each community to

00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:36,030
figure out what's best for them they

00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,800
generally have a very lightweight

00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:39,330
structure they just document their

00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:43,080
governance if you a technical charter

00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:45,120
and they kind of go out on on their own

00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,740
the important thing that I mentioned

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,740
that like I have the synthetic correct

00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:51,540
people is you know all other projects

00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:53,610
any one of you technically the

00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:56,220
membership dues are only there to pay

00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:58,200
for you know events security audits

00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:00,870
things to sustain the project so you

00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:03,090
know a lot some people say oh you know

00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:04,950
you have to pay to play to participate a

00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,150
little know you could just contribute

00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:08,250
code there's no one preventing you to

00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:10,430
contribute code to kubernetes you have

00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:13,710
to be a CN CF member I have plenty of

00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:16,350
plenty of members like for example lift

00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:19,200
that diagram I showed you earlier is not

00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:20,760
a CNC a member but envoy is literally

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,140
one of our most projects you know they

00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,540
contribute heavily like where there's no

00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:26,790
membership fee ever to contribute to our

00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:28,710
projects members join to sustain the

00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:30,990
overall ecosystem what I like this

00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:33,869
absolutely but it's not a requirement by

00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:37,049
any means sir for me I say it is a pain

00:25:33,869 --> 00:25:39,749
to sustain model that we employ at the

00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:41,309
Linux Foundation because you're having a

00:25:39,749 --> 00:25:42,799
community project make a dive at details

00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:44,759
about the kind of a process of trying to

00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,470
bootstrap a project where we work with

00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:49,619
internal and external stakeholders to

00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:50,700
make this happen a lot of people ask all

00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:52,649
right Chris you've said a lot of things

00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,149
what is this simple flow chart you could

00:25:52,649 --> 00:25:56,629
show me to like bring a project to the

00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:58,710
Linux Foundation it's basically this so

00:25:56,629 --> 00:26:01,049
if you could already fit under an

00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:03,389
umbrella organization go put your

00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:05,610
project there and try to put it there if

00:26:03,389 --> 00:26:07,289
not come to us and we'll see what we

00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:10,200
could do custom a lot of our

00:26:07,289 --> 00:26:11,850
organizations have these landscapes so I

00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,769
don't know if you saw the CNCs landscape

00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:16,110
or CD of lansky almost every umbrella

00:26:13,769 --> 00:26:19,110
foundation has some form of lens if you

00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:23,100
see your project there already that's

00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:26,519
probably a good natural home for it here

00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:28,619
are some examples of you know to see NCI

00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:30,869
projects work in Helmand came in almost

00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:32,730
all of our umbrella organizations have

00:26:30,869 --> 00:26:34,649
some kind of technical steering

00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:37,139
committee technical oversight committee

00:26:34,649 --> 00:26:38,549
this is a technical board of independent

00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:40,110
people that are responsible for the

00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:40,679
technical direction and which projects

00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:42,749
get it or not

00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:44,519
and so they all have different processes

00:26:42,749 --> 00:26:47,519
but you know and then everyone basically

00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:49,230
submits a project people vote you know

00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:51,809
and eventually gets accepted or rejected

00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:54,029
you know onyx joining el FAI they have a

00:26:51,809 --> 00:26:57,210
very similar process people propose and

00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:59,700
they vote on it open Jas Foundation

00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:02,369
recently had electron join right as a

00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:04,139
whole process and you know people vote

00:27:02,369 --> 00:27:07,440
through some like independent technical

00:27:04,139 --> 00:27:09,450
as are some examples so here's a bunch

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,320
of umbrella organizations as I mentioned

00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:13,330
you could go look this up when I

00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,310
when they give out the slides but you

00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:17,590
know any types of projects for specific

00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:19,900
verticals or technology areas

00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:21,850
please start there versus you know

00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:24,370
trying to do your own thing all right

00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:26,470
some basic tips to kind of it before I

00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:29,500
can end things and open up for any

00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:31,210
questions so very simple choose African

00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,730
you know a reasonable license for your

00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:35,470
project don't use any custom licenses

00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:37,810
there's been a resurgence of these kind

00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:39,640
of open cord licenses out there that

00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:41,980
windows at all cost just use an OSI

00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:45,160
approved license preferably permissive

00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:47,290
in my opinion license scanning use

00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:49,480
things like pathology Fosse's Nick like

00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:52,060
the tools are so much better these days

00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,800
than they used to be please take

00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:57,250
advantage of them anything that helps us

00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:59,170
have more clarity into the licensing of

00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:01,120
your software supply chain makes all of

00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:04,180
our lives significant easier it's so

00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:07,270
much better than it used to be DCOs are

00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:09,220
always good I'm going to go to much of

00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:10,120
detail one of the most important things

00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,500
that I think the Linux Foundation

00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:14,200
provides that a lot of people don't

00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:16,030
realize makes you require this for CN CF

00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,550
is there's something called the best

00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:19,840
practices badging and it's like it's a

00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:21,430
good sharpless I don't know if how many

00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,280
people read this there's great book

00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:26,170
called the checklist manifesto out there

00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,520
where essentially what you know doctors

00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:29,980
and medical professionals do to make

00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,510
sure they don't be like a scalpel and so

00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:34,300
on right this is kind of like a similar

00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:35,650
thing where you have a checklist for

00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,480
like good things that you should have

00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:40,720
for your open source project like a

00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:42,550
mailing list you know clear licensing or

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,860
security issues and so on and you kind

00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:46,570
of go through and and go like a

00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:48,670
checklist right and it works pretty well

00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:51,370
you get a badge we require this for all

00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:53,650
of CNCs projects but we would like to

00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:55,330
see all projects throughout the industry

00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:59,920
use this because this is really good set

00:28:55,330 --> 00:29:01,990
of best practices yeah I mean you know

00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:04,150
it's not just code you need to build

00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:06,220
inclusive communities so you know my

00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:07,120
advice is make sure your communities are

00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:09,130
inclusive to people

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,550
who do community management's host

00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:13,960
speedups do technical writing design

00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:15,490
it's a great ways to contribute to build

00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,140
our community we have some examples in

00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:21,430
CN CF you could learn of in terms of how

00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:23,740
many notes just like the like sensing

00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:25,870
scanning tools out there holy you know

00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:28,360
the security of scanning and disclosure

00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:30,700
tools have greatly improved github even

00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,320
recently announced built-ins security

00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,390
disclosure and advisory mechanisms and

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,730
sign and get up itself please have this

00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:39,910
process for your project is it's like a

00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:41,860
high quality important thing to do on

00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:44,260
your end in it in my opinion

00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:46,090
and then finally Jim mention this I'm

00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:49,060
not gonna go over I spent a lot of my

00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:51,310
time you helped co-found the to the best

00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:53,230
way to learn about open source program

00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:55,540
management is through your peers and we

00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:57,700
have a great peer network a set of

00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:59,770
materials these are even translated into

00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:02,380
Japanese so if you go to a Linux

00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:04,150
Foundation JP slash resources open

00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:07,660
source guides you get the Japanese

00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:12,370
translation of these guides and other

00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:14,620
than that so final thoughts here Linux

00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:16,870
Foundation is more than just Linux you

00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:20,440
know we host so many different projects

00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:23,380
of all sizes from spec to code

00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:26,110
I truly believe there is no one way to

00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:28,270
to build a community for a project it

00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:30,160
has to be very custom based on the needs

00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:32,070
of the organization and the Linux

00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:34,510
Foundation is one of the premier

00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:35,920
open-source foundations that that does

00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:39,340
this type of work there are others but I

00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,820
think we are probably the largest out

00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:43,040
there and most professionally Ron

00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:45,080
in my personal opinion so if you're

00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:47,210
interested in bringing a project to the

00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:49,130
links foundation there's a great URL and

00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:51,230
you can feel free to find me or email me

00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:53,620
and I'm happy to answer any questions so

00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:53,620
