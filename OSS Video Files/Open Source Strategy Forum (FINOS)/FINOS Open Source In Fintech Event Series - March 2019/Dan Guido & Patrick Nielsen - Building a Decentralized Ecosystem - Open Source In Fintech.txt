00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:16,770
so let me just give you a quick

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,710
introduction of who who we've got up

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,810
here so firstly introduce Patrick so

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,960
Patrick is the co-founder and CTO of

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:27,570
clover his focus is on building secure

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,000
software that isn't less usable because

00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,759
it's secure and believes the same as

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,570
possible for decentralized software

00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:35,399
previously Patrick was the head of

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,160
development for JP Morgan's blockchain

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,140
projects including quorum and sat on JP

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,899
Morgan's firm-wide cryptography board

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,320
he's a visiting researcher at Cornell

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,600
University via ic3 a leading consortium

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,059
of researchers looking at solving

00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,770
challenges to blockchain adoption before

00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:55,980
that he was a security researcher and

00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,149
early contributor to the go programming

00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,649
language let's have a big round of

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:00,649
applause for Patrick welcome sorry

00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:07,020
it's it's not oh camel but it'll have to

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,909
do that's okay I'll get at least three

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,790
or four fish and no camel references and

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:14,850
before the end of the night so Dan I'd

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:17,030
like to introduce next dan co-founded

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,409
trail of bits in 2012 to address

00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:22,350
software security challenges with

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:25,200
cutting edge research in his tenure as

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:27,570
CEO dan has grown the team to 40

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,060
engineers led their work on the DARPA

00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,710
cyber grand challenge built an

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,350
industry-leading blockchain security

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:37,290
practice and refined open source tools

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:40,500
in the endpoint security market were by

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:43,020
the way go open-source in addition to

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,899
his work at trail of bits Dan serves as

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,549
a director at hack secure and investment

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:48,869
syndicate focus on seed stage

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,060
cybersecurity firms

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:53,939
he's active on the board of for

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,649
early-stage technology companies Iain

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:59,189
contributes to cybersecurity policy

00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:01,200
papers from ran CNAs and Harvard he runs

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:03,630
Empire hacking a 1,000 member meetup

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,770
group on NYC area cybersecurity

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:10,289
professionals his latest hobby is the

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:13,140
algo VPN project it's the internet's

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:14,100
most recommended self hosted VPN in

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,250
Prior roles

00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,830
dan taught a capstone course on software

00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:22,130
exports exploitation at NYU as a faculty

00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:25,230
member and the hacker and residents

00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:27,390
consulted ISEC partners now the NCC

00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,310
group and worked as an incident response

00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:32,220
analyst for the Federal Reserve System

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:35,190
dan holds a bachelor's in science in

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:42,540
computer science from NYU Tandon welcome

00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:45,180
Dan so maybe starting with Patrick just

00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,620
maybe a little bit of framing of of what

00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,200
you see is the lay of the land for their

00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,700
conversation and then Dan and then we'll

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,130
start to get into some of the

00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:56,280
conversation here so maybe a couple

00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:59,130
words yeah so I mean we're here today as

00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:03,890
part of the decentralized ecosystem

00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:10,200
growth group of Thanos and decentralized

00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:17,730
yet I'm gonna have to shout or if it

00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:19,830
doesn't work well oh did you press on so

00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:22,530
we here's the decentralized ecosystem

00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:24,870
growth group and that does that is a

00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,990
specifically chosen word decentralized

00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,980
it's not the blockchain group

00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:31,710
decentralized means a lot of different

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:34,890
things and it spans back over 30 years

00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:36,630
and we're in kind of a funny period

00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,220
where it's suddenly really interesting

00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:40,590
again but a lot of the things that we're

00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:43,140
talking about have existed for a long

00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,180
time but we have a chance to kind of

00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,010
bring it back to life and use some of

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,460
these tools that were never really used

00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:51,960
but should have been and yeah so be it's

00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:55,350
gonna be exciting to talk about what

00:03:51,960 --> 00:04:05,010
some of those are and yeah how is not

00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:10,440
just do the blockchain cool so I'm happy

00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:13,350
to be here it's a really that we have I

00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:15,690
don't think that anybody can survive in

00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:17,040
this industry unless we all work

00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,510
together to try and solve these

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,790
incredible security challenges in front

00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,979
of us we're in uncharted water in many

00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,140
ways but in others we're dealing with

00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:26,460
the same problems all over again I think

00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,660
Patrick and I are both going to explain

00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,070
ways that

00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,200
the current challenges we're trying to

00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:34,440
solve in blockchain security are highly

00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:38,250
related to other industries and problem

00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,900
sets that were very familiar with so as

00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,090
a business I'm also happy to hear that

00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,820
the finola's folks are invested in

00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:47,600
open-source I am too there's a lot of

00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:50,460
ways that I get value out of using and

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,190
publishing and building community around

00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,870
tools and code that I write that I think

00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,790
makes my business better that makes our

00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,960
clients better and that makes the

00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,790
internet better and I don't think

00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,090
there's any kind of mutual exclusivity

00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:07,050
between let's say making money and

00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:07,350
sharing what you know so happy to be

00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:11,730
here

00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:14,310
great so just to dig right in so so

00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:16,890
Patrick and Ian you were talking about

00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:18,750
how when we think about decentralized we

00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:20,850
so often think of it as being or right

00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,710
now at least the sometimes in the media

00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:24,900
we think of it as being blockchain but

00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:26,700
you were talking you alluded to the fact

00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,380
there's all sorts of decentralized

00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,630
technologies maybe not even new

00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:32,460
technologies what are some examples of

00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:36,350
some other decentralized technologies

00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:39,510
that are out there either new or old

00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:41,070
yeah so I mean blockchain is it's the

00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:43,230
one that is by far the most hyped right

00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:45,870
now and it does there are some new

00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:47,160
properties about proof-of-work and you

00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,710
know a few other of the primitives that

00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:53,520
are employed in this umbrella term that

00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:55,530
is blockchain but there are you know

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,210
there are many forms of decentralized

00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:00,750
technology and some are more subtle than

00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:02,400
others so like you mentioned the go

00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,380
programming language it's package

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,450
manager is fully decentralized but they

00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,030
don't advertise that it's not a selling

00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:10,650
point it just happens to be

00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:14,070
decentralized there's no central and

00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:15,900
p.m. kind of equivalent for a NGO rather

00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,940
it just looks up the package from

00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,680
whatever your import path your github

00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,750
repository or your a bit bucket or

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,130
whatever it finds that and pulls it back

00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,340
and nobody's collecting the information

00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:27,300
and it's just kind of a passive

00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:31,100
side-effect of how the system was

00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,790
designed and that's kind of how we see

00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,590
decentralized technology being

00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:36,960
successful is when it's just kind of a

00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:38,430
property that's not the basic selling

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,110
point if you're trying to sell it to

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,810
people because they want a decentralized

00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,060
thing

00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:45,040
it's not gonna work so that's one

00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,870
example and then there are a bunch of

00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,600
different systems that have I mean

00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:52,360
obviously go is design by kind of a semi

00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,100
decentralized group and this it's really

00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,230
a spectrum and it can apply to different

00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:59,260
parts of the thing that you're building

00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:01,930
so an example is let's encrypt that's

00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:03,910
fully centralized at the point of having

00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:06,430
the kind of God certificate that signs

00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:07,900
things and there is one server in the

00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,870
world there are a couple servers that

00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,160
runs and signs these certificates to

00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,800
give you these certificates but it

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,520
decentralized a huge portion of the CA

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:21,040
system and there's something like

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:25,090
certificate transparency again a a PKI

00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:27,280
tool that was a response to several data

00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:30,419
breaches and mal mal you know

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:34,180
maliciously issued certificates whereby

00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:37,180
people can be the single kind of God

00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:39,700
users and authors of their data feats in

00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,650
those proof I signed this certificate at

00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:44,350
this time I issued this at this time

00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:46,150
sign that and produce a Merkel tree

00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:48,340
which is the basic data structure used

00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:51,130
in the blockchain and have people be

00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,960
able to fetch that and sync it and and

00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:55,720
verify without it being kind of a

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,580
centralized system where where

00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,550
everything has to go in the same feed

00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:03,430
and that is weirdly centralized at each

00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:06,820
point of issue but also decentralized

00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:09,160
because it's about this this plurality

00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:12,460
of parties that each makes their own

00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,720
feed so yeah there's a there's a bunch

00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,370
of different things like this and

00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,250
obviously BitTorrent is an example of a

00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:20,500
hugely popular technology that's also

00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:22,450
fully decentralized but has nothing to

00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,520
do with cryptocurrency or at least

00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:28,810
didn't done till it was so - Tron but

00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:31,180
that's another another issue dan do you

00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:32,770
have any other examples things that what

00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:35,200
do you think of decentralized the kind

00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:36,729
of well I did want to just follow on

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,870
what Patrick said about certificate

00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:40,409
authorities so I think certificate

00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:43,120
authorities is a great kind of mental

00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:45,100
image to use when you're thinking about

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,030
challenges trying to solve trying to

00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,040
solve challenges in the blockchain

00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:50,500
security space like before

00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,880
cryptocurrency was around you know if

00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,200
you store real currency you went to the

00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,130
bank you weren't storing money under

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,740
your Europe

00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:58,210
at your house and trying to hide it from

00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,400
attackers on your own that we're

00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:02,470
breaking into your apartment but today

00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,060
every single one of us is much more

00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:06,070
responsible for the security of the

00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,800
currency that we own and there's this

00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:10,240
push to custody your own assets and be

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,930
individually responsible for the

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,210
security of them so that kind of mode of

00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:17,710
operation is kind of mimics a lot of the

00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:19,690
challenges that certificate authorities

00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:22,450
need to solve for themselves where they

00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:25,420
have an asset as an ultimate level of

00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:28,350
security private key that signs

00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:30,790
certificates for the entire ssl system

00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:33,010
and they need to protect that with their

00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:36,490
lives since even a single failure is

00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:38,590
usually an uncontrolled you know down

00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:39,760
side where you can mint certificates for

00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,710
any web site on the Internet

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,540
so I think we'll be revisiting that

00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:46,270
point a couple of times as we go further

00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:47,770
on through the night since the problem

00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:49,510
certificate authorities have to solve

00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:51,700
are in many ways identical to the ones

00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:53,550
that we now as individuals have to solve

00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,780
to protect our own cryptocurrency

00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:57,220
basically we have to commoditize all the

00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,260
technology that goes into running a

00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,790
certificate authority pretty much yeah

00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:03,370
so does this mean that we're all

00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:06,160
effectively a form of information

00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:08,170
security providers and professionals I

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,090
mean are we all de facto you know

00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,560
whatever we're doing whether it be you

00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:14,530
know working with public crypto

00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,960
currencies like Bitcoin smart contracts

00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:18,670
have we all sort of whether we want to

00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,110
or not become information security

00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:23,590
professionals should I be dusting off my

00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:25,300
old sisa certification let's go that the

00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:29,730
old Caesar certification it's gonna help

00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:39,790
you but we're not securing NT servers

00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:46,840
3.0 3.1 for workgroups no it is sorry

00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:48,400
what was the yeah it's I mean to some

00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:51,340
extent that was always the case right

00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:54,490
we're all always building software that

00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:56,260
has potential to have vulnerabilities it

00:10:54,490 --> 00:11:00,160
was just kind of you're always able to

00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:02,140
kind of move the risk away and not worry

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,329
as much like that ciphers problem and

00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:08,079
that's they'll run Blackduck on that and

00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:10,360
fine but now that we're developing it's

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,879
just never been this directly connected

00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:16,329
to risk that we're building software

00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:18,249
we're about could really cause the

00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:19,689
direct loss of money and because of the

00:11:18,249 --> 00:11:21,759
way these systems are designed like the

00:11:19,689 --> 00:11:23,110
entire point is that you should not have

00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,720
an escape hatch where you can say

00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:28,989
something bad happened roll back and

00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:32,199
start over and so it was hard fork

00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:34,389
everything and I mean depending on how

00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:36,399
large your institution is we could maybe

00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:39,610
do a 51% attack but you wouldn't be very

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,230
popular afterwards yeah I think part of

00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,759
the wait there one of the reasons why

00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:45,249
this field is so exciting to me is

00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:46,959
because the risk is so high as a

00:11:45,249 --> 00:11:48,519
security professional I gravitate

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,939
towards the most challenging problems I

00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:53,829
can solve and in this case of commodify

00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:55,629
commoditizing all of the security

00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:57,459
procedures and security techniques that

00:11:55,629 --> 00:11:59,110
a certificate authority uses to protect

00:11:57,459 --> 00:12:00,009
themselves and make that available to

00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,959
the entire world

00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:03,790
- then custody their own assets their

00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:09,309
own crypto assets is an incredible

00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:12,309
challenge so you know this is fun for me

00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:14,649
scary for everyone else but that's the

00:12:12,309 --> 00:12:16,299
nature of the game today so it seems

00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:19,269
like one of the hardest challenges would

00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:20,860
be for a bank to have to secure you know

00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:22,629
publicly traded tokens in particular is

00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:25,179
there anything have you looked at any

00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:26,649
the security involving that when you

00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:27,999
think about exchanges are there any sort

00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:29,679
of things you have to think about what

00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:31,689
about security operations anything in

00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:33,339
particular that you know either of you

00:12:31,689 --> 00:12:36,610
were seeing maybe you Dan what you're

00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:38,679
seeing yeah let's break this down to its

00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:39,790
concrete parts first so what we're

00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:43,089
talking about here when you want a

00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:45,459
custody a crypto asset is you've got

00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:46,899
these transactions so the transfer of

00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:49,959
money between one account to another

00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:51,730
account is intermediated by signing that

00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:55,449
transaction with a private key from the

00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:57,669
sender and the problem or the challenge

00:12:55,449 --> 00:12:59,439
really of using a lot of these systems

00:12:57,669 --> 00:13:01,689
is that that private key must be

00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:03,839
available on the internet for this

00:13:01,689 --> 00:13:06,220
globally distributed blockchain to work

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,579
that's typically not true for many other

00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:11,739
systems so what people end up having to

00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:15,250
do is protect that private key with a

00:13:11,739 --> 00:13:18,130
variety of ways to you know

00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:20,620
keep it hidden because even access to it

00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:23,320
for an instant means somebody can steal

00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,550
all of the value of your account so the

00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,920
first thing people do is they create

00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:29,020
these hot and cold kind of custody

00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:31,060
systems where you only take a percentage

00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,890
of your assets and keep those on an

00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:35,500
online system and then the online system

00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,760
has access to an offline system where

00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,620
the rest of the value gets stored

00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,950
sometimes that's through a typical

00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:43,750
computer like a set of HSMs a couple of

00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:45,640
servers other times people use a

00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:50,260
hardware cryptocurrency wallet like a

00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:52,180
ledger or you know many of the other

00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,890
product vendors in that space but the

00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,330
fact remains that that online system

00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:57,670
still has access to the offline system

00:13:55,330 --> 00:14:00,190
and there's a variety of ways to bridge

00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,900
that gap you know there are server

00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,970
compromises that happen quite frequently

00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:06,430
that breach access to that offline

00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:09,160
system behind it there's USB removable

00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:11,020
media that can have security issues both

00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:15,340
in terms of the kernel drivers from the

00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:17,230
operating systems that actually enable

00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,970
those devices or just malware on the

00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:21,580
device itself inside the file system

00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:23,380
there's an authentication problem here

00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:25,960
because you need to prove to that

00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:27,820
offline system the cold one that you're

00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,280
actually the right person in order to

00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:32,890
request the money so now you have to

00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:36,610
have security procedures and some kind

00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:38,230
of authentication authorization so what

00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:41,560
ends up naturally occurring next is you

00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:43,330
make these multi-party consensus systems

00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,790
where you split the keys up and make

00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:47,560
sure no single person is in control and

00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:50,350
once you've got that you start involving

00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,600
third parties sometimes people use third

00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:55,330
party authentication providers bit goes

00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,400
a good example or you have a large

00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:59,530
support organization that then has to

00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:02,950
answer phone calls and send out one-time

00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:06,040
passwords via email or use RSA tokens or

00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:09,970
totp authentication so it all kind of

00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:13,210
just spirals out of control from here so

00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:15,700
really like doing custody right is a

00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:18,160
significantly challenging problem that

00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:20,980
today in 2019 very few people are

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,900
prepared to do is it really just people

00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,490
or is it organizations is there anything

00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,980
about organizational structures that you

00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:28,960
see and we talk a lot in Finnis about

00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:31,060
what is it that organizationally has

00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,830
the change at a large investment bank to

00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:35,320
embrace open source in terms of

00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:37,090
cryptocurrency custody is there are you

00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,530
seeing things that are actually having

00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:40,780
to happen in terms of organizational

00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:42,670
structures in order to embrace this new

00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,990
world yeah so if you're a bank and

00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:46,210
you're trying to do custody correctly

00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:48,280
there's a couple of different teams of

00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:50,410
people you're gonna need in order to

00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,020
pull it off well you're probably going

00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:54,160
to need some kind of strategic

00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:55,960
engineering organization that can build

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,490
these systems you're going to need

00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,370
application security you're going to

00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:01,960
need software engineering you're going

00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:03,880
to need some kind of compliance function

00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,530
and then you're going to need operations

00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,810
there's going to be an aspect of

00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:11,950
physical security of security monitoring

00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:13,210
and then user safety user trust since at

00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:15,910
the end of the day especially if you're

00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:18,490
in kind of a retail business users

00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:20,320
authenticate to use somehow and those

00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:23,320
users are going to lose control of their

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,060
accounts frequently a lot of the attacks

00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,010
that we see on custody systems today

00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:29,140
aren't necessarily targeted towards the

00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:30,280
infrastructure that you own as much as

00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:32,770
they are targeted towards your

00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:36,700
individual users things likes importing

00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:39,670
attacks dealing API tokens using shared

00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:41,350
password databases there's a variety of

00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:44,980
ways that people lose access to their

00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:47,350
accounts and all of those like if if

00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:49,300
you're a bank you're gonna need to have

00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,620
some kind of fallback that enables the

00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,380
right people to get access to those

00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:54,760
accounts and not the wrong ones so

00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:58,630
almost sound like phishing attacks

00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:01,300
that's referenced one by the way yeah so

00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:04,330
to shift gears for a second from scary

00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:07,240
public tokens and all of you know sort

00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:08,380
of the a lot of the focus around crypto

00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,820
currency Patrick I know you've been

00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,140
thinking a lot about the changing

00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,390
landscape of data risk for big companies

00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:15,910
of any industry not just financial

00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:17,950
services what does that have to do with

00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,600
any of this and kind of what's the angle

00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:21,820
here for just the overall data risk

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:26,459
perspective from your perspective yeah

00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:29,560
so so beyond beyond kind of payments and

00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:32,670
monetary use cases for decentralized

00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:35,080
technologies what we're seeing kind of

00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:38,080
people build out is really kind of a

00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:40,840
data coordination mechanism and a lot of

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,760
people harp on blockchain use cases

00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,440
saying

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,880
why would you ever try to do that you

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,760
could just do that with a with a

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,440
database and it's a I think the most by

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,770
far the most popular criticism of

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,300
anything blockchain and it kind of it's

00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:57,120
right in a lot of cases and it's

00:17:54,300 --> 00:18:00,390
especially right when it comes to should

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,400
I be using a tenth on kind of full

00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:04,080
blockchain platform or should I just be

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,600
using something that lets me do kind of

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,970
a certificate transparency kind of audit

00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,310
log which something like Trillian does I

00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:12,840
doubt many people who have explored

00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:14,820
blockchain use cases have looked at

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,620
trillion but they could probably satisfy

00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,210
a lot of the use cases that you're

00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,460
considering because it lets you do the

00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:24,270
kind of use case that I was describing

00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:29,700
and have multiple participants but it's

00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:32,040
it's not it's it's not it's not without

00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,930
merit to have a database that can have

00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,180
multiple writers and that is essentially

00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:38,250
what a blockchain database is is a

00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:40,500
database that allows you to have

00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:44,880
multiple kind of semi authoritative

00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:46,230
writers at any given point and the basic

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,000
kind of use case that you need to have

00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:51,090
before blockchain even begins to be

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,530
useful is that you don't you trust each

00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:55,170
other enough to do something together

00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:56,670
but not any farther than that and that's

00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:59,460
where kind of permission block chains

00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:01,050
are not as useful as using a public

00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,690
lecture network but for some use cases

00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:05,250
especially ones where you're you are

00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:07,350
talking about data within different

00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:10,530
organizations and you don't want it to

00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:11,820
live forever and for everyone to be able

00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:14,460
to retrieve it

00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:16,470
that could be be super useful but beyond

00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:20,460
that what the blockchain kind of trend

00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:23,180
has caused is a just a rocket surge in

00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:26,430
funding for distributed systems and

00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:28,620
cryptography research yeah so I remember

00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:31,740
I think it's Emin grancy reform from

00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:34,140
Cornell who said that regardless of what

00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:37,610
happens with the term blockchain what it

00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:42,420
has caused is just an explosion in

00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:44,610
funding for research that has caused new

00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:47,430
kinds of things to be possible that will

00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:50,130
not go away regardless of what happens

00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:51,870
and what's different this time around I

00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:53,820
mean obviously there was a huge

00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:55,590
decentralized and decentralization

00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,840
pushed once before that was the intern

00:19:55,590 --> 00:20:00,750
itself and that didn't really work out

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,429
great everything is centralized now but

00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,200
what's different this time is that we

00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:06,299
really do have technical primitives that

00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,580
lets us do things differently especially

00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:11,340
in the areas of multi-party computation

00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,659
that it really is possible and I'm not

00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,100
just talking about like homomorphic

00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:16,590
encryption which is still kind of a pipe

00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:20,820
dream but it really is possible to run a

00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:22,320
fairly large amount of algorithms in

00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,940
these kinds of multi Rider

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,220
I don't really trust the other person

00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:30,210
but I still want to be get useful data

00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:32,279
out of out of something so my share this

00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:34,350
with you before Patrick my my

00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:37,110
grandfather was a cryptographer for the

00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:38,940
Enigma project during World War two and

00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:41,250
then subsequently was working in the NSA

00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,590
on cryptography it seems like the state

00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:45,270
of the art now is an event consensus

00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:47,909
with Shamir secrets sharing it's that

00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:49,440
sort of where you see the is that the

00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:52,380
state of the art or is that the state of

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,700
the art for March of 2019 do you see

00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,230
that starting to go in a different

00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,919
direction or is that going to be it for

00:20:55,230 --> 00:21:08,100
now and that's that's kind of early 2000

00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:09,210
late 90s I mean I think most people here

00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,610
would note would be familiar with things

00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:14,370
like public key cryptography and PGP and

00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:16,320
like SSH and these were all like the

00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:19,320
most advanced uses of cryptography back

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,929
about 10-15 years ago but the explosion

00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,610
in research and funding in specifically

00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:25,830
the field of cryptography because of

00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:27,539
things like cryptocurrency has resulted

00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:29,190
in some real advances and things like

00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:33,510
multi-party computation zero knowledge

00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:36,179
proof threshold cryptography like these

00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:38,179
are interesting fields that haven't had

00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:40,590
a lot of interest or a lot of work done

00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:42,899
that are now all of a sudden really

00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:44,640
important and have actual use cases and

00:21:42,899 --> 00:21:46,409
shim your secret sharing to your point

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,110
is it's something that's been around for

00:21:46,409 --> 00:21:51,600
a while but nobody uses it and that's

00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:53,850
one of those examples of one of the

00:21:51,600 --> 00:22:00,990
terms that goes under this umbrella of

00:21:53,850 --> 00:22:03,090
you know post 2008 yeah it's it's not a

00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:04,740
new thing but we have a chance now to

00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:08,220
make it actually be

00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:10,830
be used in a in a form where it's usable

00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:12,929
by a normal person and not just somebody

00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:15,600
with deep expertise who can who can

00:22:12,929 --> 00:22:17,669
afford to hire a team of cryptographers

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:21,960
to work on custody for them for example

00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:27,120
yeah sorry do my best to share

00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:29,789
so speaking of technologists and large

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,260
team so the other thing that you know

00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:33,899
we've been hearing about is quantum

00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:36,240
computing and the potential X tential

00:22:33,899 --> 00:22:39,149
threat that quantum computing presents

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:42,090
to blockchain technologies and

00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:44,640
cryptography any observations or

00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:47,159
thoughts like how existential threat is

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,179
is quantum computing going to be is that

00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:50,640
something we're going to see in the next

00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:52,590
two years five years ten years are we

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:56,850
gonna be is climate change gonna be the

00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:59,279
more immediate problem so I have kind of

00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:00,870
a personal pet peeve with with the

00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:03,149
quantum computing hype

00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:05,490
I think quantum computers are extremely

00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:08,190
exciting and that they allow us to solve

00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:09,990
classes of problems with different kinds

00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:11,730
of complexity bounds and that's that's

00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:15,240
for all kinds of algorithms not just

00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:16,710
cryptography it we can do things much

00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,799
more efficiently than we could before

00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:23,580
including reversing the inputs to a

00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:25,200
cryptographic function but and when you

00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:28,649
talk about something like a blockchain

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,929
where if it's a globally distributed and

00:23:28,649 --> 00:23:33,299
data is available publicly then it is a

00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:36,179
concern if you you're just encrypting

00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:38,279
with with today's methods the data that

00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:41,490
you're putting on it if quantum

00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:42,809
computers become real then somebody may

00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:44,789
be able to reverse that in the future

00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:47,580
and so there's a reason not to share

00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:49,380
your data with everyone even though it's

00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:51,570
it's encrypted

00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:54,000
but at the same time I think that the

00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:58,260
threat is is totally overblown in the

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,549
sense that people say that when quantum

00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:01,020
computers come around everything is just

00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:02,700
gonna break it's gonna be hilarious the

00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:05,130
whole world's gonna be selling fire

00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:08,909
basically but I see is much more about

00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:11,309
y2k problem there really was a y2k

00:24:08,909 --> 00:24:12,990
problem it wasn't one of those like oh

00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:13,830
this this is gonna be bad and then

00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:16,080
nothing happened

00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:17,940
no there was a huge response that

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:21,090
happened that cost there to be no

00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:22,470
problems and we're not currently at a

00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:24,809
stage where anyone has anything that

00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:26,129
resembles a real quantum computer like

00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:27,899
everything you see in the news about

00:24:26,129 --> 00:24:29,850
somebody having a quantum computer it's

00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:32,129
a quantum annealing machine which is

00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:34,740
quite different from a quantum computer

00:24:32,129 --> 00:24:36,480
which can run to algorithms that are

00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,700
particularly relevant for cryptography

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,639
Shor's algorithm and Grover's algorithm

00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:47,850
and they allow you to break a AES hash

00:24:41,639 --> 00:24:50,340
functions and RSA cryptography much much

00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:52,889
more efficiently than than regular

00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:55,559
computers I think Dan Bernstein did a

00:24:52,889 --> 00:24:57,870
talk with Daniel on on how big your RSA

00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:59,399
key would need to be to be resistant to

00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:01,740
a quantum computer and it was something

00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:04,470
like I don't know two terabyte private

00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:06,570
key it was it was a large very large

00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:08,970
number but it's possible and the point

00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:11,340
is the work is happening in two space to

00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:13,559
to make a kind of post quantum

00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:16,110
resistance Suites so when that's when

00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:18,899
this becomes an issue we switch over

00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:21,690
it's like any other issue where cipher

00:25:18,899 --> 00:25:23,730
becomes obsolete we switch over and now

00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:26,240
that's the thing we sign with and it's

00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:32,129
not an issue yes somebody could Forge

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:33,809
and or kind of cause an old signature to

00:25:32,129 --> 00:25:35,309
be made but it doesn't matter if we

00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:37,860
agreed we're switching over to this new

00:25:35,309 --> 00:25:40,350
algorithm right so I think the threat is

00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:42,659
is a little bit overblown it's it should

00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:44,700
be not so much a terror thing as it is

00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:46,620
an exciting thing for for what we might

00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,149
be able to do just add my two cents

00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:49,649
there I am in total agreement with

00:25:48,149 --> 00:25:51,179
Patrick on this as a security

00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:53,789
professional working in the space that

00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:56,070
employs a cryptography team the threat

00:25:53,789 --> 00:25:58,409
of quantum computers impacting the

00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:00,899
cryptography that we use is a lot less

00:25:58,409 --> 00:26:03,059
than what people claim there are

00:26:00,899 --> 00:26:05,159
competitions ongoing NIST has one right

00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:07,409
now to develop a post quantum suite of

00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:09,600
cryptographic algorithms if you want to

00:26:07,409 --> 00:26:11,070
see the authoritative write-up on the

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,850
effect of things like Shor's algorithm

00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:16,440
on existing crypto suites as well as the

00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:18,299
status of a lot of the competitors in

00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,190
that challenge you can read a blog on

00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:23,100
the trail of its blog where we walk

00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:26,129
through our introduction to post quantum

00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:29,250
cryptography so if anybody claims to you

00:26:26,129 --> 00:26:30,930
that there is like any kind of downside

00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:33,450
or negative

00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:35,130
impact on the near term horizon related

00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:38,370
to quantum computers take it with a

00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:40,350
grain of salt they they are probably a

00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:42,540
lot more ambitious than I think a

00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:43,980
realist would be and an expert in the

00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:45,600
field would be cool

00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,780
so can I bring this back to open source

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,790
so it sounds like everything that we

00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,780
talked about is all these things are

00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:55,080
going to be mission-critical

00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:58,250
whether it's our our investment banking

00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:00,300
members our data provider members

00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:04,050
organizations like Moody's one of our

00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:05,760
tech members like github or Red Hat all

00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:08,750
the subsequent mission-critical so if

00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:11,900
these tools are so mission-critical and

00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:15,300
doing such critical and sensitive work

00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:17,270
how do you how do we also embrace open

00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,700
source so how do you sort of resolve

00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:22,950
doing all of this sort of in the open

00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:25,140
making the code available and developing

00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:29,130
these really mission-critical tools as

00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:31,220
open source projects yeah sure so

00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:34,380
there's a couple things to note here

00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:37,230
people in this industry there's a

00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:39,600
there's a kind of a commons challenge

00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:41,190
where if there's any one person

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,960
operating the blockchain space that has

00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:45,750
a spectacular failure it impacts

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,570
everyone else I really don't think that

00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:50,790
we want random companies exploding from

00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:52,680
time to time that are using blockchain

00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:54,240
technology or that are using distributed

00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,830
Ledger's or that are using this kind of

00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,110
advanced technology I would much more

00:27:55,830 --> 00:28:01,250
prefer if people competed based on the

00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:07,250
the value their business provides then

00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:09,630
their you know ability to hire me so

00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:11,850
there's this foundational nature to it

00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:14,670
where I don't really see a good reason

00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:18,030
why it should be kept secret from my

00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:21,210
side from a trail of bits kind of profit

00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:23,010
and like isn't a standpoint a lot of

00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:24,780
what we do focus is on software security

00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:26,430
not necessarily custody security

00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,870
although we help with that too I mean I

00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:29,940
can I can actually give a little tangent

00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:31,860
here so in terms of research techniques

00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:33,210
that haven't seen a lot of use but that

00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,470
are now all of a sudden critically

00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:36,510
important and applied perfectly a

00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:39,210
blockchain technology we use one called

00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:42,360
symbolic execution research technique

00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:44,280
came up with in the 60s it's a software

00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,800
analysis method that allows you to get

00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,960
very high

00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:49,690
precision understanding of what a piece

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,430
of code does this technique doesn't

00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:53,050
scale very well it doesn't work on

00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:54,850
Internet Explorer it doesn't work on

00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:56,920
Microsoft Office but it works great on a

00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:59,320
smart contract that's 500 lines long and

00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:01,750
the output of using symbolic execution

00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:04,210
on a smart contract is perfect security

00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:07,150
you know that the code you wrote is safe

00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:09,790
we use that technique on every single

00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:11,830
engagement that people come to us for to

00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:13,660
review their smart contracts and the

00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:15,280
overall framework that we use to do it

00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:17,980
is something that's open-source the

00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:19,480
trail of its maintains the fact that

00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:21,010
it's open-source helps us build a

00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:23,680
community around the tool make sure that

00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:25,030
the most people use it that can and then

00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,340
people still come back to us because

00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:30,940
they need assistance integrating it and

00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:32,920
fitting it into their project we use a

00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:34,330
particular licensing strategy where we

00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:37,030
do license a lot of the code that we

00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:41,050
write so that in public it's usually a

00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:43,330
GPL or some other GPL derivative and

00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:46,180
then privately we can offer commercial

00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:49,060
exceptions this is a well battle-tested

00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:51,400
kind of go to market strategy for open

00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:53,080
source software that reserves a lot of

00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,730
Rights from my perspective but still

00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:57,460
enables the largest number of people to

00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:59,920
use the code we write I think software

00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:02,640
solutions for custody systems are in a

00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:05,130
very similar boat we've seen coinbase

00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,810
Square and a number of other companies

00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:09,490
release a lot of the reference material

00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:11,560
they use to build their custody systems

00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:12,610
and there is absolutely no reason why

00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,730
you shouldn't look at what they've done

00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:17,800
critically and consider using it because

00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:20,440
again I don't think that's how we want

00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,760
to compete in an ideal world we want to

00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:26,200
do it on the strength of your your

00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:28,360
business idea and this stuff should be

00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,280
more of a community effort and I think

00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,140
this is perfectly highlights I think one

00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:34,000
of the most important things in kind of

00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:36,070
deciding your open-source strategy is

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,610
really identifying what it is that makes

00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:41,620
sense to open-source and I see a lot of

00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:44,490
people making the mistake of open

00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:49,240
sourcing kind of large swaths of

00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:53,260
kind of a specific product that it's not

00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:55,690
really the kind of core infrastructure

00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:57,610
if you will that Dan describes a small

00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:59,950
tool that does something extreme

00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:01,840
important and powerful that a lot of

00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:03,280
entities might be able to contribute a

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,530
little bit to and therefore it's better

00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:07,059
for everybody else that makes a lot of

00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:11,710
sense to be open source because she

00:31:07,059 --> 00:31:13,540
can't really lose unless you unless your

00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:16,270
your motor manufacturer is to make other

00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:18,250
people explode but that's a that's a not

00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:21,280
a great long-term strategy because of

00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:24,250
the the multiplying effects of having

00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:26,740
other people contribute now the opposite

00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:29,890
end of that is just open sourcing a huge

00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:33,250
project having nobody really a bunch of

00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:35,440
people start maybe but nobody can really

00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:38,610
understand it without how without hiring

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:41,169
full-time people to work on it and then

00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:42,640
maybe contribute a few pieces here and

00:31:41,169 --> 00:31:44,530
there but what you really did is just

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,660
release your whole project for the world

00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:49,330
and you can say like it's open source

00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:51,610
therefore it's more secure that's not

00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:53,980
true unless people are actually looking

00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:56,049
at it so that that fallacy that because

00:31:53,980 --> 00:32:00,640
there are a lot of eyeballs it it must

00:31:56,049 --> 00:32:02,950
be better rarely actually bears out so

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,690
yeah that the most important thing of

00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:07,210
your of your open source strategies

00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:09,010
should be to identify those kind of core

00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:11,320
components and often those are things

00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:13,390
that you end up building as part of

00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,860
building the product yeah and you

00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:16,150
realize you could abstract some of this

00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:17,890
out and this would be useful for all

00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:20,140
kinds of things but it doesn't give your

00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:21,970
secret sauce away every foundational

00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:23,799
piece of infrastructure that we write we

00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:25,660
open-source that's the way that I I

00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:27,280
describe it if it's foundational in

00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:29,049
nature if it does nothing on its own but

00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,940
provides a basic capability to the

00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:32,650
people that use it that you then have to

00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:34,929
customize somehow or integrate somehow

00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:36,910
that's a candidate for open sourcing it

00:32:34,929 --> 00:32:39,370
so that's what our symbolic execution

00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:40,960
framework is that's what our static

00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:44,820
analysis framework is so lots of

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,990
frameworks and lots of one-off tools

00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:48,309
yeah you don't have to just dump a whole

00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:50,980
product on the Internet that's probably

00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:53,830
not a good strategy great so we're gonna

00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:55,210
take about two five or seven minutes of

00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:57,610
questions from the audience

00:32:55,210 --> 00:33:00,760
where's Aaron Griswold and just don't

00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:02,770
see him right now okay I'll play Phil

00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:04,419
Donahue then for a second that's an old

00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:06,250
reference for any of you who are younger

00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:09,040
than 40 you don't have an idea what I'm

00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:10,980
talking about but I can assure you after

00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,509
you see me demonstrate Phil Donahue

00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:15,869
you will understand what that is all

00:33:12,509 --> 00:33:17,039
about so if anyone has a question raise

00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:22,499
your hand and I'll bring you over the

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:23,940
mic Sam from Google if you're gonna do

00:33:22,499 --> 00:33:26,309
Phil Donahue you have to put the mic

00:33:23,940 --> 00:34:00,779
right very close to Sam's you have to do

00:33:26,309 --> 00:34:02,039
sort of everyone yeah maybe not in the

00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:04,230
way that you're that you're implying

00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:06,330
right but it's not a downside it's an

00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:08,700
upside there's a lot more things that

00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:10,740
are possible now based on the renewed

00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:12,929
interest in cryptography in the last

00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:15,839
five to ten years because of blockchain

00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:18,809
stuff that I think provides enormous

00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:20,010
opportunity for instance this is not

00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:21,960
related to blockchain stuff but

00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:23,520
something that's brand-new is now there

00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,049
are a lot of consumer messaging

00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,780
platforms that are using something

00:34:25,049 --> 00:34:30,659
called noise which is a forward secure

00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:32,609
cryptographic real-time communication

00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:34,579
system that lets you chat with your

00:34:32,609 --> 00:34:38,149
buddy on facebook messenger or whatsapp

00:34:34,579 --> 00:34:43,619
in a way that a central third party

00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:46,919
can't see the systems for designing that

00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:48,510
kind of cryptographic algorithm haven't

00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:51,000
really been super popular in the past

00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:52,859
but today it's like the hottest thing in

00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,629
the universe on the IETF is trying to

00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:57,210
standardize it into something called a

00:34:54,629 --> 00:34:59,760
message layer security or MLS and I

00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:01,790
expect to see a race of almost anybody

00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,690
that's offering a chat platform

00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:05,309
integrating tools like that in the

00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:06,780
future and we're all gonna be better for

00:35:05,309 --> 00:35:09,359
it because the alternative in the past

00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:13,859
was PGP and God knows no one in this

00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:16,470
room uses it so like that's something

00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:19,829
that I'm really positive about that I'm

00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:21,930
looking forward to as time goes on we're

00:35:19,829 --> 00:35:24,119
like two three years ago I couldn't have

00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:24,690
imagined it being the case on the flip

00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:27,319
side you

00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:29,700
got things like zero knowledge proof

00:35:27,319 --> 00:35:31,920
massive renewed interest in that because

00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:34,170
the ability to transact privately on a

00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,119
blockchain is somewhat dependent on this

00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:38,760
one single research technique in zero

00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:40,770
knowledge groups but zero knowledge

00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,240
proof SAR just a mechanism by which I

00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:43,770
have some information I'd like to keep

00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,990
secret but I want to prove to you that I

00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:47,400
have it there's a lot of things that I

00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:50,220
would like to prove like maybe the

00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:51,930
amount of money in my bank account so

00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:54,300
that if I'm trying to apply for a loan I

00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:55,440
don't have to give you access to every

00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,240
single bank account every single

00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,589
investment I've ever made I can do a

00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,869
zero knowledge proof to tell you that

00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:02,940
I've got it and it's math that backs it

00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:05,700
up or if I've got a software

00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:07,410
vulnerability let's say we're disclosing

00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,690
it to you would let you go out and abuse

00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:11,400
it so instead I can make a zero

00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:13,079
knowledge proof that says yes I know how

00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,599
to do the thing I'm claiming and I'm

00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:18,240
using this cryptography to prove to you

00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:20,790
that I can do it the reason why zero

00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,740
knowledge proof SAR at all possible in

00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:24,900
any reasonable amount of computational

00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:26,430
time today are because of investments

00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:29,069
that people like the Z Cash foundation

00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:32,130
have made into math that made them

00:36:29,069 --> 00:36:36,060
faster so that kind of stuff is super

00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:38,099
cool right on the flip side ssh ssl

00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,690
those kind of things they're pretty much

00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:42,810
stuck in time they're gonna be the way

00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:45,569
they are for pretty much ever like they

00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:46,920
are a finished product and the stuff

00:36:45,569 --> 00:36:49,710
that's coming next that might replace

00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:51,060
them is really where I'm interested yeah

00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:54,000
and there's a there's a great blog post

00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:55,800
by the C cache company as well and all

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,050
the work and the research that happened

00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:01,170
to make their latest upgrade called

00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:03,060
sapling produce proofs much much faster

00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:06,869
and that's kind of foundational research

00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:08,640
into ZK snarks and I think to your point

00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:10,920
about kind of core Internet

00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,800
infrastructure it's it's an ironic

00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:16,500
centralizing element that the crypto

00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:20,369
primitives using noise and and what's

00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:22,890
kind of the new hotness in on something

00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:24,540
like the IETF working group is is all

00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:29,579
crypto designed by one person Daniel

00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:31,859
Bernstein but it it it's it that's the

00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:36,650
trend that's moving away from kind of

00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:36,650
hardware optimized all designed by

00:37:37,769 --> 00:37:45,400
all designed by by entities that people

00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:47,499
can't for whatever reason there's always

00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,989
an argument that it's not completely

00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:51,729
trustworthy and for some reason Daniel

00:37:49,989 --> 00:37:54,519
Bernstein is just seen by everyone in

00:37:51,729 --> 00:37:56,680
the world as trustworthy and so not only

00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:58,689
that is also much faster in software and

00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:02,890
on embedded devices so one of the things

00:37:58,689 --> 00:38:04,599
Google just did is to switch the disk

00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:06,519
encryption algorithm over to something

00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:08,859
that uses the Dan Bernstein primitives

00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:11,170
and there if I dare buys saved a bunch

00:38:08,859 --> 00:38:12,219
of power consumption so that kind of

00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:14,619
thing is happening all the time but

00:38:12,219 --> 00:38:17,170
that's not directly because of because

00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:20,199
of the kind of new Renaissance of crypto

00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:22,059
that happened because of blockchain cool

00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:24,130
another project that's interesting in

00:38:22,059 --> 00:38:25,959
that space is handshake to your point

00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:29,019
about core Internet infrastructure they

00:38:25,959 --> 00:38:31,539
kind of said DNS is still a hilariously

00:38:29,019 --> 00:38:33,729
centralized thing let's decentralize it

00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:36,209
and it's not really blockchain based

00:38:33,729 --> 00:38:40,119
it's just trying to make the DNS system

00:38:36,209 --> 00:38:42,939
actually live up to the you know the DB

00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:44,619
decentralized cool so I think will

00:38:42,939 --> 00:38:47,529
probably do two more questions before we

00:38:44,619 --> 00:38:50,619
do that though I just want to mention so

00:38:47,529 --> 00:38:52,779
Sam and Alvin from Morgan Stanley over

00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:54,189
here Sam from Google were two of the

00:38:52,779 --> 00:38:55,209
people who put together our Katie be

00:38:54,189 --> 00:38:57,219
working group and our new data

00:38:55,209 --> 00:38:58,749
technology so they're not necessarily

00:38:57,219 --> 00:39:00,369
directly related to blockchain but if

00:38:58,749 --> 00:39:01,839
you're interested in working Katie be

00:39:00,369 --> 00:39:03,039
talked to either Alvin or sandwich and

00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,559
some great work around the Katie be time

00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:06,900
series database blood yes that's what

00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:09,999
shameless plug that's right that's right

00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:13,650
so two more questions anybody have

00:39:09,999 --> 00:39:15,509
another question for the for the panel

00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:18,039
Alvin

00:39:15,509 --> 00:39:21,070
so yeah Phil Donaghy got to put him

00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:22,560
really uncomfortably close to his face

00:39:21,070 --> 00:40:00,250
[Music]

00:39:22,560 --> 00:40:03,810
easy right it's all fully it's fully

00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:06,130
agile on we're on the record by the way

00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:08,350
no that's that's a great point

00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:11,890
I mean evolution and large enterprises

00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:14,230
is is really difficult and and one

00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:18,370
example of that is also TLS 1.3 versus

00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:21,190
1.2 there's a lot of security software

00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:23,590
and appliances that work up until TLS

00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:25,600
1.2 but after till is 1.3 it breaks

00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:28,900
because the IETF said we won't allow

00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:31,360
middlemen anymore and that's how those

00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:33,970
products work and so there's definitely

00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:35,590
I think there's a couple of things like

00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:37,180
this where it's just gonna have to be a

00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:40,630
scramble and people are gonna have to

00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:43,000
spend time on it but obviously adopting

00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:45,550
a strategy we can change your software

00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,920
faster than kind of a 12-month release

00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:51,250
cycle is a is a good idea I think but

00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:54,100
it's post quantum stuff you're gonna see

00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:55,930
this coming from a mile away like I am I

00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:57,280
am very negative at the physics of a

00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:59,620
quantum computer even gonna work at all

00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,930
there's an information gas that happens

00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:04,000
as the qubits go up and I don't think

00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:06,730
that it's a guarantee that quantum

00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,980
computers are going to be a thing if

00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:10,420
they are the time horizon is pretty long

00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:13,060
and the fact that we're standardizing

00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:15,970
the encryption algorithms today should

00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:17,350
give people the 20-year Head Start that

00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:19,300
makes these things possible to solve

00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:22,150
yeah to the point of quantum computers

00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:23,800
in particular I think we'll have a

00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:26,020
cipher suite where there is a post

00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:29,070
quantum choice and in fact Google Chrome

00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:33,190
already tested a fully post quantum

00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:34,690
cipher suite construction and if

00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,950
somebody builds a quantum computer like

00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:36,900
that

00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:38,040
it's not it's not for sure we'll

00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:40,920
probably know about it

00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:42,359
maybe not but probably but it's not for

00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,609
sure that that computer will actually be

00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:47,280
fast enough to do this yes it's true

00:41:44,609 --> 00:41:49,950
that it allows you to asymptotic ly

00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,990
perform the computation much faster but

00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:54,240
the computer may be hilariously slow and

00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:56,520
so it may take a long time before that

00:41:54,240 --> 00:42:03,210
quantum computer is actually fast enough

00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:05,460
to realize that so I just to beat this

00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:06,810
one more time like there's there are

00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,430
certain cryptographic algorithms that

00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:10,640
aren't affected at all by a quantum

00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:13,349
computer like symmetric key cryptography

00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,790
in general the only thing you have to do

00:42:13,349 --> 00:42:17,190
is double the number of bits that you're

00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:20,820
using so if you were using 128-bit AES

00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:24,210
now you should use 256 you're done shot

00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:25,680
512 if you're using that you're almost

00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:27,540
certainly going to be fine in the wake

00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,280
of a quantum it also won't affect random

00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,869
number generation random number

00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,280
generation is the exact same thing you

00:42:30,869 --> 00:42:33,540
just double the number of random bits

00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:35,550
that you need and then you're done

00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:37,230
they're really the only thing that it

00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:39,210
affects is public key cryptography and

00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:41,460
solutions for those will be available in

00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:44,540
the next couple of years I'm feeling a

00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:46,770
lot better yeah I really have thanks

00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:48,990
let's have one more question and then

00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:50,630
amber is going to come up and give you a

00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:53,099
little bit of an overview of our program

00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:54,500
who would anyone like to do the honors

00:42:53,099 --> 00:43:00,740
to the last question

00:42:54,500 --> 00:43:00,740
yes don't me not yep sure please

00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:06,800
so I get the impression if you feel that

00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:09,440
a blockchain is a bit overhyped do you

00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:13,340
see a decentralized financial ecosystem

00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:16,280
future without lock tape

00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:17,930
I think it's perfectly possible and

00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:20,360
that's one of the goals of this group is

00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:22,430
to compile tools that when used together

00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:24,980
will allow you to actually solve your

00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:26,600
problem instead of just say oh I

00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:29,870
accomplished my objectives this year

00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:31,880
boss give me my bonus because that the

00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:32,990
second thing doesn't really last but

00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,760
you're always gonna have problems that

00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:38,390
you need to solve and so we're gonna

00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:40,280
have hopefully tools that may leverage a

00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:41,960
blockchain or may kind of graduate to

00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,700
blockchain when they need to have

00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,680
multiple parties involved but still

00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,960
solve problems for you as an individual

00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:51,440
organization like that kind of audit log

00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:54,830
example oh yeah I'll avoid answering the

00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:57,890
VAD ifferent take on it so I'll kind of

00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:59,540
answer a question on the side so I think

00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:00,560
over the last year or two people have

00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:02,270
built these very simplistic

00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:05,030
decentralized applications there are

00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:06,380
five hundred lines of code long and they

00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:07,880
don't do a whole lot like usually they

00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:09,140
just raise money or they have some kind

00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,670
of proof of concept functionality

00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:13,880
praising my name is the most important

00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:15,350
that's most important part but you're

00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:17,420
right like 90% of the companies out

00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:19,040
there that raised a bunch of money to do

00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:21,110
decentralized whatever probably didn't

00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,460
need to use any kind of blockchain to

00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:24,620
accomplish what they wanted to do and

00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:26,900
probably went out of business when the

00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:29,870
market started to drop but the companies

00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:32,390
that remained are creating ever more

00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:33,980
complex - centralized applications that

00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:36,200
are actually using the technology to its

00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:38,000
fullest so this is another area where

00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:40,280
I'm kind of positive on the future

00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,400
whereas 2019 continues as we go into

00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:45,040
2020 I think we're gonna see some

00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:48,010
significantly more advanced uses of

00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:51,200
decentralized kind of blockchain stuff

00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:54,080
that makes it clear what the value of

00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,820
the tech really is yeah and I'm not anti

00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,590
blockchain obviously I used to work on

00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:59,630
our platform called quorum which is a

00:44:57,590 --> 00:45:02,540
very end of ethereal

00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:05,690
I'm just anti using blockchain to get

00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:08,000
paid use the blockchain to solve the

00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:10,130
problem if it's the right solution for

00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,790
your problem otherwise don't and we're

00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:15,730
gonna have in this group pieces that fit

00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:19,310
every part of that spectrum but

00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:22,010
absolutely it's I hate the phrase it's

00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:22,910
early days but it really is it's very

00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:26,089
early

00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:27,680
this in the maturity of these kinds of

00:45:26,089 --> 00:45:29,569
technology stacks let alone the

00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:33,319
individual parts when it comes to

00:45:29,569 --> 00:45:35,210
watching cool well speaking of quorum

00:45:33,319 --> 00:45:37,339
we're gonna get have amber come up and

00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:39,080
say a few words so maybe a round of

00:45:37,339 --> 00:45:42,420
applause for our distinguished panel

00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:53,760
[Applause]

00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:53,760
