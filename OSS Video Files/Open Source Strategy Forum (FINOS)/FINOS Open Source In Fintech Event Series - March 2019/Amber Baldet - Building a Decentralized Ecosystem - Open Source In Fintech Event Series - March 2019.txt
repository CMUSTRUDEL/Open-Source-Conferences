From the FINOS Open Source In Fintech Event Series - March 5th 2019

Decentralized technologies have the potential to fundamentally change the landscape of the financial services industry. By providing a level playing field for everyone - from large firms to individual developers - we can accelerate delivery of real-life distributed applications that provide tangible value and solve real world problems.

Amber Baldet, CEO of Clovyr discusses how decentralized technology collaboration is already transforming the industry. She also talks about how the FINOS community, through its Decentralized program, is providing a venue for future collaboration.

00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,809
my name is Amber ball day i'm co-founder

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:19,500
and CEO of clover patrick nielsen here

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:21,660
as my co-founder and our CTO and it was

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,740
fantastic to hear this conversation with

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,150
dan as well I mean we're friends and you

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,769
know it's fun to kind of go out to

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,439
dinner with this group and argue about a

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:32,700
bunch of things so it's it's great that

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,000
you get to hear a bit of that

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:39,660
conversation and I mean how many people

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,899
here have gone to a program or a talk

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:45,629
about enterprise blockchain at some

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:46,950
point this is many hands how many people

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:48,420
are kind of tired of hearing about the

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,190
difference between permission and public

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,190
blockchains and a blockchain 101 and

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,660
when your use case should use blockchain

00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:57,210
many let the record show that's like

00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,949
many people and so I thought that this

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,260
was an interesting conversation to kind

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:03,660
of get help to get shape get shaped

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,000
because we're not just talking about

00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,490
what is the use case that sits on top of

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,450
some theoretical magical protocol but

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,280
we're talking about some of the

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,890
underlying principles that are very

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,150
useful and have challenges each of them

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,869
individually at different layers of the

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,220
stack and what is it when we say and you

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:21,990
know we were all at dinner with Rob and

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,670
Gavin things saying you know like let's

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,220
not call it a blockchain working group

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,080
why is it a decentralized ecosystem

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,689
growth program I know it's a mouthful

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,240
but that's because what we're working on

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:35,189
here is about helping people build

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,770
applications and networks that solve

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:39,630
their challenges whether you are a large

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,570
investment bank whether you are startup

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,590
in the FinTech space increasingly if

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,329
you're building the types of

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,310
decentralized applications that Dan

00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:49,020
mentioned at the end and you know I

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,369
believe hopefully even if you're

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,229
building things that don't sit on top of

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:54,149
a blockchain but are trying to do

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:55,890
something important like challenge some

00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,380
of the centralized business models that

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,270
have made our internet and our commerce

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,009
and our politics start to look the way

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,110
that they have looked it's all connected

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:06,210
in some way and we're solving these kind

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,890
of challenges together so I'm gonna talk

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,920
very briefly today I guess at this point

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,000
but so yeah so welcome to open finance

00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,629
right like let's not talk about

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,209
enterprise blockchain for a second

00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:18,909
but rather let's recognize that

00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:21,010
cryptocurrency is decentralizing the

00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:23,049
issuance storage and safety of things

00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:25,719
that look like money or maybe securities

00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:27,700
or maybe commodities maybe cash but

00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:29,349
cryptocurrency does not automatically

00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,359
give people alternatives to traditional

00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:32,769
financial products or change the

00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:34,750
underlying reasons that they seek out

00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:36,340
financial services so what are the

00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,989
problems that we're addressing here

00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,700
well someone still needs a home loan

00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:40,959
they would like to acquire something and

00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,969
they do not have the full purchase price

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,579
that's a problem that we can solve in

00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:47,560
many different ways perhaps I want to

00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:48,819
sell my art around the world I need to

00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,439
be able to find the people who would

00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:51,879
like my products I need to be able to

00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:53,560
accept payment and I need to get

00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:55,419
something to them and there needs to be

00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,370
some kind of dispute resolution process

00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:59,680
in the case that perhaps some part of

00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:01,810
that supply chain fails or maybe I want

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,419
to invest in early stage companies there

00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,489
are a lot of barriers around that

00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:08,829
globally and even within the US it's

00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:11,889
very hard to find deals normal people

00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:14,409
don't use words like deal flow so how do

00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:16,449
you manage to access and invest in these

00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:18,489
things and really what we're saying is

00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:20,949
that when people talk about open finance

00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:23,919
or kind of its analog a little bit now

00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:25,840
of defy or decentralize finance what

00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,560
they're talking about is increasing

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,859
access and removing gatekeepers to

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,909
financial processes and so on

00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:35,979
institutionally within the retail market

00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:37,959
we're kind of calling this unbundling of

00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:40,419
services for a while but this even goes

00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:42,370
beyond the concept of but unbundling to

00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:45,040
talk about much more really disruptive

00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:47,620
forces where it's not just a new startup

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,109
that's providing a centralized solution

00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:52,150
that unpicked one product from your

00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:53,919
traditional retail bundle but rather

00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:56,139
it's what if we could create this as a

00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,340
collective Commons or even as Dan

00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:59,469
alluded to at the end a fully

00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:02,019
decentralized autonomous organization

00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:03,729
that doesn't necessarily need any of the

00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:05,319
rest of this infrastructure a lot of

00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:06,909
those things are very far reaches and

00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:09,009
the point is we have not solved those

00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:12,069
challenges at the bottom of the stack

00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:14,139
about you know if I want to go get a

00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:16,449
loan it has to be based off of some kind

00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:18,430
of concept of credit there's plenty of

00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:20,259
data saying that people's credit score

00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,210
number is not actually a very good

00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:23,770
indicator of their willingness to repay

00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,539
the loan the problem that we're solving

00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,290
here is not let's get a better credit

00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:28,480
number

00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:31,360
let's find out how we can make sure that

00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,580
this loan is going to get repaid and

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,070
that we don't have defaults right so the

00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,720
rest some new solutions to that

00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:40,090
challenge might be will let's scrape

00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,920
people's social data profiles let's get

00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:44,110
as much data about them as we can from

00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,210
as many different places not just their

00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:48,340
financial dealings and now we're kind of

00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:51,100
moving towards this surveillance

00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:53,230
capitalism kind of stuff that that is is

00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,700
starting to see more we're seeing more

00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:56,920
negative reaction to products based

00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,480
around that in the marketplace and so a

00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,210
lot of what open finance is looking at

00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,190
on the retail side right now is what are

00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:05,440
the the alternatives that we could have

00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:07,510
that foster consent amongst the user

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,300
base that make people happy to want to

00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:11,800
engage and that allow us to challenge

00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,780
some of the status quo business models

00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,610
it's not really something that matters

00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,320
if what you're worried about is you know

00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:20,380
reducing the operational cost of your

00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:23,080
post trade workflows but the technology

00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:26,050
that is coming out of it we can see this

00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,570
kind of bleed up the the ecosystem

00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:31,270
because we really don't want to simply

00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:33,970
have b2b institutional flows and then

00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:35,680
c2c over here but rather there is

00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:38,560
actually a kind of global financial

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,410
network that should be more connected

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,880
and so by learning from what's happening

00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,880
out on the the bleeding edges of

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:49,180
quote-unquote d-phi we can kind of pick

00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,340
up on what's working and see how we can

00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:54,400
be creating some new types of products

00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,750
and new types of types of designs and

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,970
business models on top of this

00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:00,040
technology so it's just a slightly

00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:01,660
different approach from sitting down and

00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,760
saying like you know we've evaluated

00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:06,760
every single line of business that we

00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:08,740
have and here's our our quod graph and

00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,410
these are the areas where we have the

00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,880
most opportunity based on our market

00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,050
penetration and these are the areas

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,270
where we have the most likelihood for

00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,860
impact based on market concentration and

00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:20,530
I did use thrown the blockchain program

00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:22,210
at JP Morgan just to be clear so I I

00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,860
know that it you know there's a lot that

00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:26,980
goes into institutional use case

00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:30,310
discovery but it's very easy to get kind

00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:32,260
of caught into this silo of of thinking

00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,910
that only what we do matters within

00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,320
institutions and there really is this

00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:37,240
kind of other stuff happening and

00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,460
finishes are really interesting organ

00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,680
and that it's bringing together these

00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,690
large institutions but it's also a

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,550
completely open space for a lot of

00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:47,169
startups and even individuals they want

00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:49,120
to contribute to open source to get

00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:51,610
together and have conversations without

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,800
a very heavy legal framework around that

00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:55,930
and so what we'd like to foster here is

00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,900
an ability to kind of learn from each

00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:01,180
other in that way but to to Patrick's

00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:03,849
point earlier create discrete usable

00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:07,750
tools that maybe are applicable both in

00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:10,570
a a small business but also turn out

00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:12,550
that they solve a similar problem in a

00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:15,759
very large enterprise everyone has

00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:17,560
logging challenges you know and it's my

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,560
personal belief that a lot of the early

00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,910
pilots that got you know 10 or 15

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,090
institutions around a table with a bunch

00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:27,699
of lawyers are not actually going to go

00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:29,620
go very far instead we need to start as

00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:32,289
a single organization and then move to

00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:34,840
multiplayer when we can so open

00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:35,919
protocols reduce vendor stickiness open

00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,169
source applications increase

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,639
transparency and even partially open

00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:40,900
source applications let you focus on

00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:42,699
your secret sauce layers I think we've

00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,570
covered pretty much all of this here are

00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:46,060
some of these kind of different

00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:47,949
decentralized elements that help you

00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,539
challenge the status quo so it's not

00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:51,490
about getting to the point of saying

00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:53,169
we're decentralized now but rather

00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:55,509
thinking that decentralization is a

00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:57,000
process and a thing that you can use at

00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:59,139
different pieces of your application

00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,509
architecture where it solves something

00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:03,130
useful okay so you can see the

00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:05,560
multi-party computation over there as

00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:07,120
where as mentioned earlier and this

00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,889
quote was actually in a blog that I read

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,750
today I thought it was a wonderful

00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,949
sentiment that was applicable so we

00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,120
should care less about whether or not

00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,560
something is centralized or

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,780
decentralized and whether or not it is

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,340
accountable an accountable system is

00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:20,680
responsive to both the common good for

00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,520
participants and the needs of minorities

00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,590
in this case we're talking about

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,479
minority shareholders and it sets

00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:27,520
consistent rules and can change them

00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:29,229
when they don't meet users needs so

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,130
again not decentralization for

00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:34,300
decentralization sake and then I think

00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,709
these slides are available if you want

00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,149
to kind of dig into this but this the

00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:40,089
the web or next is what we like to call

00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:42,010
web 3 or slash the decentralized web at

00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:44,350
Clover this is how we think through the

00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:46,150
actual architecture stack and that you

00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:48,279
should be able to map something like

00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,720
BitTorrent on to this as easily as you

00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:51,550
could map something like an enterprise

00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,040
blockchain

00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:55,750
you know and and that's not it's not

00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,910
about selling a particular protocol or a

00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,500
particular vertically integrated stack

00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:03,520
but about letting people build

00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:06,580
applications that do useful things and

00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:08,649
so finally this decentralized ecosystem

00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:11,380
growth program we're focusing on

00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:13,060
building real tools so things that make

00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,649
decentralize finance work for banks

00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:17,140
businesses regulators clients and

00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:18,670
customers thinking differently so

00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,680
identifying some of these challenges

00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:22,420
like we've discussed tonight but not

00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,950
just kind of trying to hit them with the

00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:26,020
same hammer or the same kind of power

00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:28,089
point hopefully getting people that have

00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:30,070
different perspectives in the room and

00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:32,529
again building community around that so

00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:35,520
creating space for diverse perspectives

00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:38,170
and actually release in some code here

00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,660
and then this is on the website

00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:43,510
now which Rob so wonderfully kind of

00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:45,820
helped us get up over the last week but

00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:47,470
we're investigating specific problems

00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,270
feel free to take a look and if you're

00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:51,790
interested in any of these challenges

00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:53,230
there's a listserv you can join but

00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:55,570
looking at the interactions between

00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:57,459
different types of central central bank

00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,930
digital currencies stable coins public

00:09:57,459 --> 00:10:00,160
cryptocurrency traditional banking

00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:03,070
payment rails there's a lot going on

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,600
there but understanding or hoping that

00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:06,100
maybe not one will win but we will have

00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,290
an Internet of value that crosses

00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,510
several understanding again the

00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:13,300
replication of pre on and post trade

00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:15,070
workflows how those might be translated

00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:18,640
into some smart contract things where

00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:19,870
necessary data models and crossing with

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,730
some of the other finish groups working

00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:23,529
on standard data models to make sure

00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:25,120
that you can deliver something into one

00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:27,250
of these new decentralized ecosystems

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,380
just as you could a traditional one data

00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:33,700
confidentiality privacy design zero

00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:35,800
knowledge systems always always fun data

00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:38,500
Oracle's so there's a huge issue with

00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,990
handling replicated data and data

00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,610
Oracle's which are agreed upon

00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,990
you know sources of truth into these

00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:45,880
systems especially when you're pulling

00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:48,640
something from a commercial market data

00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,020
provider that has legal and commercial

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,600
restrictions around the resale of that

00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:54,820
data so working around on authentication

00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,079
and access there and then system

00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,790
migration and integration I think was a

00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,880
great question asked earlier about how

00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:02,470
the heck do we move to this stuff so you

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,080
know working on some of the tooling

00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,269
around

00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:07,279
so that was a very speedy review but

00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:09,990
yeah thank you so much for having us

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:21,299
tonight thank you

00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:21,299
