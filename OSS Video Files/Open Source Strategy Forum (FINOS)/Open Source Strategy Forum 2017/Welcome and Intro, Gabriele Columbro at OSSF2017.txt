just wanted to sort of thank you all for

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,390
showing up today when we sort of thank

00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,350
you

00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:48,290
might be useful when when we set up

00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:50,060
earlier in the year to you know create

00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:52,070
an open source community and financial

00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:55,310
services we knew the challenges they

00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:56,510
came to it came with it but we thought

00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,920
that really creating and putting

00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,630
together a conference like this one

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,760
would cement the community would create

00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:04,489
the identity of the community and we are

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,439
amazed by the turnout that we had we

00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:08,119
were setting up for you know less than a

00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:11,179
hundred people we had four hundred

00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:13,070
registered people you know this is to me

00:01:11,179 --> 00:01:15,799
just yet another sign that this industry

00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:18,380
is ready for open collaboration very

00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:25,759
much like other industries have realized

00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:31,819
and so today we wanted to really focus

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:34,520
on why open innovation is a much sort of

00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:36,950
superior way of driving innovation in

00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,950
this industry and so you know Todd

00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:43,249
already sort of covered it but you know

00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:44,630
two years ago when I joined the symphony

00:01:43,249 --> 00:01:46,609
Software Foundation I mean full

00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:48,880
disclosure I don't come from financial

00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:52,639
services I had to learn a few things

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:56,539
about this business I think my tagline

00:01:52,639 --> 00:01:59,149
when I got the job was that I'm not an

00:01:56,539 --> 00:02:01,310
open-source hippie I think I mentioned

00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:05,209
that to Paul during during my interview

00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:07,219
process and you know full disclosure yes

00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:08,990
I had dreadlocks six years ago so if you

00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:11,300
find the picture on internet you can

00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:13,689
tweet it you can make fun of me come to

00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:18,269
the booth and and tease me with that

00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:20,430
really when I stepped in we realize that

00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:23,459
on one hand we had an industry that was

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:26,310
undergoing a massive change between the

00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:27,719
FinTech wave and you know disruptive

00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,230
platforms

00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:33,000
you know like blockchain very much

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:36,389
open-source in nature I think you know

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,859
we'll hear from amber later on from JP

00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:40,230
Morgan what their experience with

00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:41,489
blockchain but you know to me was you

00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,379
know I think blockchain is a technology

00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:46,049
would basically not make sense if it was

00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:47,159
an open source and therefore you know we

00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:50,939
realized that the industry was changing

00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:52,500
and that I had a lot to sit with some of

00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:55,500
the industry leaders I mean if you look

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:58,470
at you know our foundations they're you

00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,090
know we have some of the most important

00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,129
firms on the street we have some of the

00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,230
most important vendors with us and we

00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:06,569
opened up to you know the FinTech

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,010
players if you sort of look at their

00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:10,409
silver membership we wanted to really

00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:14,639
create a community you know that was

00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:17,010
unprecedented and so as we you know

00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,900
started collaborating on the symphony

00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,840
platform which I'm assuming many of you

00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:24,359
know we realized that the was you know a

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,449
bigger and broader opportunity to

00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:30,120
collaborate in this industry now you

00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:31,590
know clearly is not easy to do open

00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,540
source I don't want to come here and

00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:36,000
just tell you that you know you're gonna

00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:38,669
go tomorrow do the right choices you

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,579
know have your processes together it

00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:44,549
takes you know experience and it takes

00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:46,590
especially as a corporate you know

00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:48,629
having done it a few times to actually

00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,609
get open-source right and so really this

00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:53,849
is the main reason why we put together

00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:55,889
this conference today we wanted to bring

00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:58,259
industry leaders from the open source

00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:00,599
world from financial services world and

00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:03,479
from other industries that over the last

00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:05,970
few years have started collaborating in

00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:08,280
the open to answer really three

00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:10,049
questions one of the main questions

00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,419
especially in these highly regulated

00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:14,280
business that I get is how are we gonna

00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:16,259
do open source we are now ready to do

00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,630
open source and that really means

00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:21,180
sorting out your you know technology

00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:23,880
your devups workflows integrating with

00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:27,000
you know a whole new supply chain that

00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,500
means change in the culture I mean you

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,690
know we live in highly competitive

00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,650
environment we live in an environment

00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:34,710
that is highly

00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:37,080
sigh loads so there's certain an element

00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:39,979
if corporate wants to embrace them and

00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,780
so the certain element of culture change

00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:45,389
but certainly again in a highly

00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,759
regulated business the process the legal

00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:49,949
aspects we'll hear today from many

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,639
expert that have solved this again in

00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:55,650
other industries we felt that we had you

00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:58,830
know to provide also framework a policy

00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:04,380
or governance for this industry to

00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:08,850
thrive and on this note I wanna spend a

00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:10,320
quick second to thank BNY Mellon this

00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,720
event would not have been possible with

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,310
him I want to again tap on what Todd

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:19,860
said BNY Mellon has been an amazing

00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:21,840
platinum member of our foundation it has

00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,490
led some of our working groups and

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,250
obviously is hosting this event so we

00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,810
are absolutely thankful for that and I

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:32,210
want to bring on stage

00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:36,289
Matthew Joseph from the NY for a quick

00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:36,289
introduction thank you Matt

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,370
instead thanks to everyone for being

00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,470
here today it's a pretty momentous

00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,030
occasion for open-source as well as

00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:49,160
financial services to Gabe's point

00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:50,330
there's a lot of change especially from

00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,430
a culture perspective and that's

00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:54,020
something that we've seen a lot of we've

00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:56,000
been very proud to engage in that

00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:59,180
culture change at BNY Mellon so we're

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,070
very proud and happy to be the host here

00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,570
from a physical perspective for this

00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:04,670
event today we're proud to be a member

00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,380
of the symphony foundation proud to be a

00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,780

00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:10,460
as well and we're excited to now be able

00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,320
to participate and share in the

00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,460
open-source community for example

00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,650
putting out our first open-source

00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,880
project a series of educational

00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:18,920
exercises to help folks learn languages

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,020
like Java and Kotlin and we're excited

00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,880
to continue and be able to contribute to

00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,890
the Symphony foundation our experiences

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,570
as a guide for others to follow and

00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:28,610
participate in doing so as part of the

00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,840
working group so again thank you to the

00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,250
sympathia foundation thank you to the

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,360
other symphony members and thanks to

00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,490
everyone for being here today

00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,300
it's a pleasure to host and excited for

00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:40,930
the rest of the event thank you so much

00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:45,230
[Applause]

00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:47,390
and so yes B&Y is part of our

00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:48,740
open-source readiness working group we

00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,930
have a working group that is very much

00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,610
focused again not only around technology

00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,070
not only around the culture but really

00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:58,100
around providing a policy and an

00:06:55,070 --> 00:07:00,050
industry-wide way for collaborating in

00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,630
open-source in a way it's sort of meta

00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:05,030
open source collaboration so the next

00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:08,540
question that I often hear is what

00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:10,190
should I open source again back to the

00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:12,050
I'm not an open source hippie I don't

00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:14,570
think everything should be open source

00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:16,580
guess what we want you to have a

00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:18,860
profitable business model based on open

00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:22,160
source so that in turn you can reinvest

00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:24,110
sweat equity and money in our community

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,390
and in our projects so I'm not gonna

00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:29,690
spend a whole lot of time this morning

00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:31,669
on the how and the what you got much

00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:33,650
smarter people talking about it and how

00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:35,330
they have successfully implemented is

00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:37,220
throughout the whole day so I hope

00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,750
you're gonna be able to you know get

00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:43,070
some valuable information around the

00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:45,620
what and the how but as any change

00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:48,500
management process embracing open source

00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:50,450
requires work requires you to again

00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,129
adapt your process and your culture and

00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:53,749
therefore as anything

00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:56,529
management process you need to be very

00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:59,209
clear as to what is the business value

00:07:56,529 --> 00:08:01,369
again as an individual but also as a

00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:04,610
corporate why should executives why

00:08:01,369 --> 00:08:07,039
should decision-makers go undergo the

00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:09,529
change what is the reason and so I

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,639
wanted this morning and I think the key

00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:13,269
nuts from this morning are going to be

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,800
very much focused on again why should

00:08:13,269 --> 00:08:19,219
financial services whether you are a

00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:22,039
vendor or you are a consumer or producer

00:08:19,219 --> 00:08:25,819
of the financial services technology why

00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:29,749
should you be considering open source I

00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:33,050
think it all comes down to a realization

00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:36,529
that the technology landscape in which

00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:38,829
we live has completely changed over the

00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:43,279
last 10 years between digital

00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:44,689
transformation cloud mobile I think it's

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,740
fair to say that we live in the era of

00:08:44,689 --> 00:08:49,670
platforms if the out of ten reaches

00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:54,110
companies

00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:56,060
six our platform companies you know the

00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:58,220
Amazon the Apple of the world and none

00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:02,300
of them is a bank which is pretty was

00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:05,389
pretty striking for me so what does it

00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:07,819
mean what is a platform well a platform

00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:10,579
is a completely different way not only

00:09:07,819 --> 00:09:14,689
to approach technology but really to

00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:18,439
deliver value so if you consider you

00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:19,939
know what we have seen you know in the

00:09:18,439 --> 00:09:21,620
Silicon Valley and knowing that you know

00:09:19,939 --> 00:09:23,600
most firms here consider themselves

00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,810
technology companies I think it's fair

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:30,069
to say that banking and financial

00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:33,050
services should embrace the idea of

00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:35,180
platform based economies and platform

00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:37,339
thinking and what actually that brings

00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,930
to the table in terms of how you build

00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:42,680
technology and how you deliver value to

00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:45,410
your counterparts just a reassurance how

00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:52,310
many of you would say that they are

00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:57,889
platform vendors good how many of you

00:09:52,310 --> 00:10:00,670
are platform users okay so you know one

00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:03,500
way or another we all are engaged in

00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:05,510
what we call a platform ecosystem and I

00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:08,460
just want to spend a second

00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:11,250
sort of to explain or at least my view

00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:13,050
on how that changes the way we deliver

00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,000
value through technology so if you think

00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:17,730
about traditional business models well

00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,430
that's a one-way street whether you own

00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:22,590
the full production chain or just you're

00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:26,070
part of it in the distribution or in any

00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:28,200
part of it let's say you are delivering

00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:30,120
value one way your value is what you

00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,550
produce and you deliver to your customer

00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:37,100
that's how we've done business for

00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:39,810
centuries what the platform economy and

00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:42,180
platform sort of revolution that I think

00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:43,830
we're living in brings in is a

00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:47,310
completely different way of delivering

00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:50,280
value value is produced by a thriving

00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:52,130
ecosystem that builds and leaves on the

00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,720
platform and is mainly composed by

00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:58,320
consumers of value and producers of

00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:01,290
value all the platform does is creating

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,090
channels is creating a new market a new

00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:06,920
connection between players that

00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:10,620
ultimately were not able to you know

00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:13,380
exchange services or goods before so I

00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:17,730
think this is fundamental and has a

00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:20,670
couple of key implications in terms of

00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:23,610
how we go about building technology the

00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:24,660
first implication is that if you think

00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:28,800
about some of the most successful

00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:31,080
platforms their core intellectual

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,870
property their core value again it's not

00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,310
the software itself is the thriving

00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:39,590
ecosystem then they build on the

00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:43,410
platform Airbnb does not own any houses

00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:46,320
Facebook does not own any content even

00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:49,290
stripe again it's not a bank they just

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,330
provided access to a much broader

00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:53,280
audience in a much broader market to

00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:56,100
vendors and so again I think this is

00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:58,080
fundamental to understand why you should

00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,880
be considering open collaboration your

00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,390
core intellectual property is not the

00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,190
platform

00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:04,800
it's the thriving ecosystem that you're

00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:08,070
gonna build on it and I think the second

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,080
takeaway on this is a common trait to

00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:12,839
all successful platform strategies is to

00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,520
build a truly open ecosystem I think

00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:17,970
these industries realized that we've

00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:19,170
seen the rise of open api's say a few

00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,750
years later than the silicon

00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:23,339
valet that you know when I joined two

00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:27,120
years ago there was the new kid on the

00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:29,220
block and ultimately what does it mean

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,410
to build an open ecosystem well it means

00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:34,079
that when you're building technology you

00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:36,329
need to make sure that you enable not

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:39,690
only sort of you don't only favor your

00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:41,519
goals but actually you allow vehicle

00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:44,550
system to tribe you want the ecosystem

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,320
both could producers and consumers to

00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:48,180
choose you without friction you want to

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,810
be the obvious choice that's how all

00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:54,899
those platforms became what they are and

00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:57,630
so in a way if you're familiar with the

00:12:54,899 --> 00:13:00,660
Nash equilibrium in a way to me building

00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:02,610
an open platform is really you know a

00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:05,639
Nash equilibrium type of approach to

00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:07,500
technology in every stage you need to do

00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:12,930
what's good for you and good for the

00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:15,420
ecosystem in a way these raises grows

00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:17,550
the pie rather than you know growing

00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,410
your slice of the pie this is really

00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:21,449
what platform businesses are about and

00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:26,279
how these you know firms have been

00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:28,380
wildly successful with that now you know

00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:30,839
what does it mean to build an open

00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:32,339
platform and that's what we get to you

00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:34,350
know the main topic of today which is

00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:36,690
open source you know I don't think I'm

00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:41,510
saying anything new the industry has

00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:44,670
collaborated on open standards you know

00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:46,829
for the longest time and I'm balling on

00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:48,630
voluntarily folding actually open API

00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:50,459
and they're open standards there because

00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:53,279
I think that open api's are nothing else

00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:55,649
than standard representation of objects

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:59,070
and actions that you can do on a system

00:13:55,649 --> 00:14:01,649
and so to me again definitely open

00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:04,890
standards and open API can create a

00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:06,930
quasi open ecosystem in which you know

00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:08,519
you provide the building blocks for your

00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:11,430
ecosystem to thrive so there is

00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:13,350
certainly an amazing you know benefit

00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:16,050
and you know we're not dismissing your

00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:19,290
open standards but we think that on top

00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:22,560
of open standards in a platform based

00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:24,560
economy you ought to be considering open

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:29,550
source whether you are a platform

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:32,060
consumer or a producer of value or you

00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:35,030
actually are a vendor that

00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:36,590
you know sells a platform well there are

00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,970
both you know I'm not going to go

00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:39,310
through the details of all of them

00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:41,740
you're gonna hear about it today but

00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:45,470
there are both tactical and strategic

00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:47,450
advantages for your strategy to actually

00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:51,730
collaborate not only on open standards

00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:56,210
but on open source itself and you know

00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:58,730
fundamentally the kicker is if your core

00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:01,630
value is not in the software is not in

00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:03,590
the platform if your core value is what

00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:06,770
ecosystem you're able to create on the

00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:09,050
platform guess what by open sourcing

00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:11,920
your platform you only yield those

00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:14,960
benefits of community building of lower

00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,810
go-to-market cost of lower TCO of a

00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,310
community of contributors that can bring

00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:23,240
your ecosystem to places that you

00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:25,010
haven't even imagined and so all of this

00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,990
without giving out your secret sauce

00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:29,060
your secret sauce is actually the

00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:31,790
ecosystem it's what it's above the value

00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:33,800
line and by all means we want you to

00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:38,410
keep that for yourself we want you to be

00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:41,360
successful in your open source strategy

00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:45,020
couple of I think additional angles here

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:47,780
are in my experience open standards and

00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:50,000
open source by themselves can are

00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:53,570
limited but the combination of the two

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,660
creates a much faster I duration cycle

00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:59,570
on actually achieving what a standard or

00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:01,270
what an open source project should get

00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:05,470
to what the original objectives are and

00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:08,330
secondly I am particularly amazed I

00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:11,150
think I'm out of time I'm particularly

00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:13,490
amazed by how open source and open

00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:16,550
standards can marry the developer level

00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:18,800
again I am a developer at heart probably

00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:24,170
doesn't look like but I have a hoodie

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:26,360
and you know o developers love open

00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:27,650
source developers love the developer

00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,690
experience and the openness of

00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:32,000
collaborating well guess what decision

00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:34,610
makers through open standards can still

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,140
you know ensure connection to the

00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,850
business value connection to sort of the

00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:40,580
higher goals that a company want to

00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:44,270
achieve and so I think the efficient

00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:45,020
combination of these two tools really

00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,600
creates

00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:50,420
you know a thriving community an open

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,960
ecosystem very much you know I think an

00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:55,910
analogy is if open standards you know

00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:59,000
give you our open API is give your

00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:00,980
ecosystem building blocks well open

00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,500
source gives your ecosystem a 3d printer

00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:05,089
to create things that you didn't even

00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:09,890
imagine when you create the platform

00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:12,350
originally now widely over time but I'm

00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:14,690
going to just say something as I said

00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:16,790
before doing open source is not easy

00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:18,140
especially if you want to mix open

00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:21,800
source and open standards and that's

00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:23,860
what we think our foundation can help we

00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:26,450
think our foundation can be the platform

00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:28,820
for you guys to collaborate in the open

00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:30,370
and ultimately drive faster innovation

00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:34,750
in the industry

00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:37,700
how do we do that well there's three key

00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:40,040
roles that we play as a foundation in

00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:43,010
this ecosystem first of all we provide

00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,930
trust don't don't forget we are asking

00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:48,320
competitors to work with each other

00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:50,060
that's the most funding being a trusted

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,500
player for all of you it's probably the

00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,840
most important value that we can offer

00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:56,840
to the community in a way you know we're

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:59,210
Switzerland I guess that Italian canton

00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,610
of Switzerland but you know we want to

00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:03,740
be providing a transparent governance

00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:05,720
cleanliness of our over IP and

00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,890
definitely the trust that the software

00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,840
that we produce is something that you

00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:12,260
can use and the respects your quality

00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,760
standards secondly efficiency we are

00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:15,950
asking you to contribute we are asking

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,710
you to work outside of your day job we

00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:20,510
want to make that as effective as

00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:22,460
possible both from a governance

00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:25,040
decision-making standpoint as well as

00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:27,860
the developer experience and last but

00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:29,450
not least again an ecosystem your

00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:31,910
ecosystem is going to be as powerful as

00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:35,180
it's big and private and so we see our

00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:37,520
objective to be creating and growing

00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:41,170
this ecosystem from membership community

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:44,030
and developer standpoint all of this

00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:47,060
conjugated for this industry we are very

00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:48,800
aware of the limitations in how you guys

00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:51,020
can collaborate across the firewall and

00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:53,630
we are providing policies and

00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:56,290
infrastructure for that to happen and

00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:56,290
security

00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:02,690
as a final note one way that we're

00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:04,340
practically enabling this for the

00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:05,870
industry and evening this collaboration

00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:08,450
for the industries what we call the open

00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:10,970
developer platform the open developer

00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:12,440
platform II is a foundation offering

00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:15,440
that is given to all of our open source

00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:18,230
developers that provides first of all a

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,360
whole developer tool chain for ensuring

00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:22,490
that the code that we produce checks all

00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,380
the boxes as a firm you should be able

00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:27,350
to come to the foundation download

00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:29,120
software get value don't worry about the

00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:30,970
security and IP compliance because we

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,770
have taken care of it for you and that

00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:35,210
also helps the developers your

00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:37,220
developers if they come to our own

00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,950
foundation and work on the open

00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:41,690
developer platform will have a

00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:43,790
liberating developer experience we will

00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:45,830
take care of all the complexity for them

00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:49,310
to just being able to collaborate and

00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:53,210
use API is that we provide for all of

00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:56,990
them to develop and so I'm gonna wrap up

00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:58,970
and leave it to much smarter people than

00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:02,230
me but I think the three key takeaways

00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:04,460
are we are living in a platform economy

00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:06,860
platform economies change the way you

00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,450
deliver value and therefore you ought to

00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:10,310
be considering open source and open

00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:13,070
standard as a way to build open

00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:15,530
ecosystems and as a foundation we are

00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:17,270
here to help so hopefully your comment

00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:20,600
are both hopefully you learn today and

00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:23,180
you leave today by knowing how why and

00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:26,350
what you should be able to open sourced

00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,350
thank you so much

00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:31,120
you

00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,740
