excellent thank you thank you very much

00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,250
for having me I'll take the clicker

00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:13,820
please I have never seen so many

00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:14,090
developers and suits actually that's not

00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,430
true

00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,660
I know where all the developers are

00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:19,279
those are where the empty chairs are so

00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,830
they're like I should be which is still

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,539
sleeping in the hotel but 9 a.m. awesome

00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:26,210
just kidding

00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:28,430
it's ok I know you guys have like really

00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:30,170
strict rigid policies where you work but

00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,310
you can I mean I work at Goldman Sachs I

00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,570
can laugh about it you guys can laugh

00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,030
about it too

00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:37,460
we were gonna go through an incredibly

00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:38,930
complex topic in a very simple way in a

00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,220
very short amount of time because I'm

00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,110
gonna try to keep us on schedule and

00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,430
also because I told him eat up as much

00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,770
of my time as you want so there's no

00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:49,250
room for questions or anything so great

00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:51,050
job basically I'm managing director

00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:53,059
golden Sachs I came to Goldman Sachs to

00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,500
the honest dollar acquisition I'm also

00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:56,629
the chair of the I Tripoli's quantum

00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,370
computing standards workgroup as well as

00:00:56,629 --> 00:01:00,260
I do a lot of other volunteer activities

00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:02,660
in that area and today we're going to

00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,699
talk about quantum computing I love it

00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,560
maybe a little too much it's become an

00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:08,329
obsession of mine everybody at work is

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,560
tired of hearing about it I've been

00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:12,319
dealing with it for about five years

00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,670
I've been making investment of time and

00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:15,799
money and other things for about three

00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:18,499
and for about the last 16 months have

00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:21,529
been really really super on to this but

00:01:18,499 --> 00:01:24,259
warning not Neil deGrasse Tyson so or

00:01:21,529 --> 00:01:26,990
Brian Greene are there any physicists in

00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:29,329
the room just so I have a heads up but

00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:31,520
we're one to you all right are you

00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:33,020
theoretical physicists think about it

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,209
see it says are you really here

00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:38,060
think about it we will not take

00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:39,349
questions from anyone then so here's the

00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,789
deal how do you prepare for a quantum

00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:42,740
world I kind of have a personal

00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:44,419
superposition for this because I feel

00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,579
like my career has both prepared me and

00:01:44,419 --> 00:01:48,139
not prepared me at the same time did

00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:49,520
didn't do a lot of computer science

00:01:48,139 --> 00:01:52,729
didn't do college didn't do a lot of

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,919
physics obviously but it came out of

00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:56,329
Apple Rd came out of IBM research and

00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:58,459
development ran some labs in Haifa and

00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:59,840
Zurich and some things and I felt like

00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:03,200
man I'm really prepared for this but

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,649
turns out is really difficult so I have

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,849
a this is my 21 month old at 17 who

00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:10,369
prepared me for this because he has

00:02:07,849 --> 00:02:11,540
amazing library including this book by

00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:13,540
Chris Ferry which is quantum

00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:16,500
entanglement for babies

00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:20,140
it's a real book it's not Photoshop and

00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,340
basically future parenting problems so

00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,870
when I heard about that I was like I

00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,360
need you to get your team on quantum

00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:27,849
computing for babies immediately which

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,099
he did and so while that joke of his

00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:32,440
cost wrong is a is a thing at South by

00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:34,209
2018 will release two books quantum

00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,340
computing for babies with Chris Ferry

00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:38,019
which sounds I know this sounds

00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,099
offensive it's not meant to be but it

00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:41,519
has turned out to be the best

00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:43,629
explanation of quantum computing ever

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,069
the way that went down is I was like

00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:46,599
Chris sent me the template starts with

00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:49,060
this as a ball in with now you know

00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:50,230
quantum computing I said I'm gonna knock

00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,359
this book out with a rum and coke

00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:54,940
tonight and then six weeks later I was

00:02:52,359 --> 00:02:57,430
like God Ron page 13 because turns out

00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,510
simplification super hard but there's

00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:01,090
three things I want you to get out of

00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:04,000
here three concepts two comparisons okay

00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:05,410
I want you understand quantum tunneling

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,480
at a super high level not like these

00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:09,670
guys I want you understand super

00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,109
position at a high level and I want you

00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,879
understand quantum entanglement and then

00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:15,730
I want you understand some classic

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,959
versus quantum differences most of you

00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,489
probably only work with classical

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,430
computer architectures right now unless

00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:23,230
any hedge funds in the audience know

00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:25,720
there's three of them that are working

00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,739
with quantum but obviously not here so

00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,349
we're gonna start with the brief history

00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:31,349
of computing for those of you who don't

00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:33,940
really geek out on all of the details

00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:36,430
starts with an abacus goes to the ENIAC

00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,959
in 46 then we get to this thing in 65

00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,370
called Moore's Law you're all familiar

00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:40,959
with that and we are all tired of

00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,970
hearing about it but I must throw it

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,950
into the deck because it is important if

00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,510
we're going to talk about its slowing

00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:49,510
down and how fast quantum computer is

00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:52,870
going to be etcetera etc but basically

00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:54,940
after 65 you got to the Altair and the

00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,769
Apple and the IBM personal computer the

00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:59,280
iMac it goes on and on and the J phone

00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:03,129
anybody remember the J phone at all

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,959
coolest people in the room that was your

00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:08,859
original like super smart phone

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:11,109
Softbank put out so and then in 2007 you

00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:13,299
had the iPhone and now you have the

00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:14,680
Google pixel that I got at this year but

00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:17,199
now you also have the Google pixel too

00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:20,289
so let's start with quantum tunneling

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,310
and let's take those devices and kind of

00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:24,490
put it into perspective

00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:26,690
so basically size matters if you look

00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:28,730
inside a chip we got a circuit

00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:30,290
right we've got some modules there's

00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:32,690
some gates we're all familiar with those

00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:35,930
and basically this is how we process

00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:40,070
things now the way we process them is

00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:43,070
simply by stopping a flow or letting it

00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:46,010
go through so that's a 1 we stop it it's

00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:47,930
a zero it's pretty simple the problem is

00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:50,950
is that we're getting smaller and

00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:53,840
smaller and smaller in the technology

00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:56,720
but if you think of a transistor as a

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,220
basic unit of a computer then if I had

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,080
enough Julian's and he could do enough

00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,970
RIA medial math I could calculate

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,510
anything right from astrophysics to

00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:07,280
Zelda doesn't matter but I am getting a

00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:09,380
new pixel to excel and here's the

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,690
interesting thing that has a Snapdragon

00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:15,320
835 processor in it on that processor

00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:16,790
are three billion transistors all right

00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,860
there's a picture of it next to a penny

00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:20,990
but the key takeaway is that we're going

00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:24,110
from 10 nanometers to seven millimeters

00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:26,870
to five nanometers so the question is at

00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,850
what size do we get so small that things

00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:31,220
start to break down in quantum tunneling

00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:33,200
comes into effect so we send that down

00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,370
and it just decides to go right through

00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,350
our gate and appear on the other side

00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:38,120
and computing as we know it potentially

00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:40,220
breaks down depends on whose side of the

00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,180
argument you're on in this but it's

00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,680
obviously going to present some

00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:46,310
challenges on the quantum mechanics

00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,570
level what is the big thing everybody

00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,870
talks about with quantum computing

00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:52,210
quantum superposition ok so it's all

00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:55,220
ones and zeros till somebody gets hurt

00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:57,650
but you have a one or a zero in a bit in

00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:59,690
a classical system you have one and or

00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:02,900
zero that's because you're talking about

00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:05,660
the spin of a particle electron photon

00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:08,000
whatever but as it spins spin up is one

00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,460
spin down as zero and it becomes really

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,080
interesting things computationally take

00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,540
on a new form and the reason that they

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,130
do that is because of the fact that if

00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,650
we look at it it can theoretically

00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:21,140
represent a 1 and or a zero at the same

00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:23,270
time so what are the advantages in a

00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:25,190
classical system we have two bits we add

00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:27,500
two bits we have eight outcomes but in a

00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,940
qubit based system we have two and we

00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,680
add one we have two to the end of the

00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:33,190
classical bits so the computational

00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:36,470
power potentially grows exponentially

00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:38,479
now that also leads to how do we measure

00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,990
this in a system instead of a normal

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,450
classical architecture we

00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:44,610
everything measured by measure by

00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:46,380
measure because of quantum entanglement

00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:49,470
Einstein called it spooky at a distance

00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:50,880
we can potentially measure bits by

00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,770
knowing the state of another bit now

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,750
China is using this to build quantum

00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:56,400
communications right now so there are

00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,170
super encrypted communications they set

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,750
up a satellite called Minkus

00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:03,690
this year they actually sent two

00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:05,070
entangled particles 1200 or 1700

00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,320
kilometers depending on which report you

00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:09,120
read and that is super super exciting

00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,620
for communications it's also super

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,690
excited for computing because it gives

00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,340
us the opportunity to measure something

00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:16,950
without having to go through and measure

00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,540
everything in the system so what I want

00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:21,510
you to remember about entanglement and

00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:22,170
superposition entanglement

00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,730
you know everybody's worried about

00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:25,320
quantum computing and encryption and

00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:27,180
I'll get to that if you're if you're

00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,830
interested but the entanglement is a

00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,540
fascinating part to me and the

00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:32,790
superposition is not as exciting as

00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:35,100
everybody makes it sound it's cool we

00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:36,240
get it you can calculate more stuff but

00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,640
I think the entanglement is going to

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,890
prove to be a bigger advantage remember

00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,840
that you do not get away from a

00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:45,570
classical architecture when you use a

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,180
quantum computer you have to have a

00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:50,370
classical computer that preps the data

00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,320
does the input/output into the quantum

00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,650
system so you're not getting away from

00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,940
that

00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,890
I know Google's been preaching about the

00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,140
quantum supremacy a lot of people been

00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:59,850
talking about that there's not a quantum

00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,890
supremacy to me if you have to attach a

00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:04,320
classical computer like appended on the

00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:06,800
side right it doesn't sound super

00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:11,700
exciting but here are the two things

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:13,770
that I want you to get number one much

00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:16,350
like Facebook statuses it's complicated

00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:18,470
in classical theory you have a state of

00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:21,900
bits let's total multiple bits in

00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:27,210
quantum it is greater than the sum of

00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:30,630
its parts these systems are very small

00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:31,080
right now they're five cubits seven

00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,360
qubits

00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,340
IBM recently did an experiment where

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,920
they broke the theoretical 49 qubit

00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:40,650
simulation and they did 56 qubits and

00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,880
that was super exciting because I think

00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:45,720
we're gonna be simulating for a few more

00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:48,600
years so good for them but the other

00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,250
thing is everything can be copied in a

00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,510
classical computer architecture the main

00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,950
difference people fail to understand

00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,580
about quantum computing architectures in

00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,650
classical

00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:59,280
architecture's is it in a classical

00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:01,980
system you can copy the data that's how

00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,870
we manipulate it in a quantum system we

00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,240
can see the results of processing the

00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:08,700
data but we can't copy the data itself

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,400
so think of it like Schrodinger's cat

00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,840
right a classical computer you can look

00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,360
at we can see the gates we can see it

00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,100
working a quantum computer we put

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,990
everything in and we get a result out

00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,070
the other side and there's two forms of

00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,080
quantum computing

00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:24,210
right now there's quantum annealing and

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,920
there's circuit gate modeling the

00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,120
circuit gate modeling is a little bit

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,280
more like how we traditionally think of

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,610
computers working the annealing gives

00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:35,580
you the best answer most of the time

00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:37,590
that's probably right so an example is

00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:40,830
if you're at Berkeley or somewhere right

00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:45,600
now you can factor 15 and it's 3 times 5

00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:47,310
48 49 percent of the time ok that's ok

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,750
because these machines are used for a

00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,490
lot of probabilistic things so if you

00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,730
look at what are people doing with

00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:55,770
quantum computing in finance right now

00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:57,000
quantum Monte Carlos right doing it you

00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,650
could do some really interesting things

00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,780
with pricing complex derivatives there's

00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:06,440
a lot of things that you could do but

00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:09,210
how is this gonna affect finance so

00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,800
right now there's a few people using it

00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:13,350
there's not enough people I would

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,380
encourage you all to use it but it's

00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:17,970
kinetic finance because if you think

00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,710
back to the days if you read Michael

00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:21,780
Lewis's flash boys or any of those books

00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:25,110
about high-frequency trading there was

00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:26,430
this period this gap where all of a

00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,230
sudden somebody could execute a trade

00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:29,940
faster and there's billions of dollars

00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:32,400
hidden in those little speed advantages

00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,810
that history is just a gonna repeat

00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,880
itself into finance with quantum

00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:37,500
computing somebody's gonna get access to

00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,330
a quantum computer they're gonna be

00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,380
prepared for it when that access becomes

00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:42,240
available and they're gonna take

00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:44,790
advantage of that access financially is

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,270
literally that simple for you guys the

00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:50,790
difference is how big the gap is between

00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:53,100
I can trade really fast and all of a

00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:55,020
sudden I can calculate billions of

00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:58,260
things in the time that it takes you to

00:10:55,020 --> 00:11:00,750
calculate 3 or 4 right so you be a much

00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:02,190
much larger Delta between where we're at

00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:04,290
and where you'll be with the quantum

00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:06,660
computing so let me give you an example

00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,470
that death of a salesperson everybody

00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,660
know this example

00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:12,360
so I have a computer that does ten to

00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:14,220
the ninth operations per second and I

00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,350
have a salesperson I want to send to 14

00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,180
cities pretty simple problem it takes

00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:20,670
that computer it's 10 to the 11th

00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:23,760
problem a thousand seconds to process

00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:27,030
that if I increase the number of cities

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:30,810
from 14 to 22 it takes that same

00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:32,850
computer 1600 years because some

00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:34,590
problems are deceptively done now people

00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:36,840
have argued they found ways around the

00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:38,850
problem just like Moore's Law right this

00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,410
is the Moore's Law of my my area of the

00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,180
industry all right everybody's like oh

00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:44,520
no I found a way around it I found a way

00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,590
but if you went from 22 cities at 28 and

00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,900
we didn't Theory take longer than the

00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:51,810
known universe to come up with the best

00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:54,870
route okay these are problems that have

00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:56,490
hidden complexity finance our math

00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:58,290
problems that have hidden complexities

00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:00,210
this is where something like a quantum

00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:01,560
computer would shine why because let's

00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:03,570
say I'm searching a large database of

00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,980
information I only need the square root

00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,900
of the number of entries to get to the

00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,970
same answer you had to you process

00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,830
everything through so why is Google

00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,180
interested in quantum computing they're

00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,830
a giant database so obvious right

00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,210
there's a bunch of other stuff but

00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:17,430
didn't mean they were obvious technical

00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:19,170
advantages for them to have it Microsoft

00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:21,000
just announced that they're gonna have a

00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:22,830
quantum computing development kit in

00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,060
Visual Studio and that they're doing a

00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:27,600
quantum computer now they're quantum

00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:29,310
computer is different we talked a little

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,560
bit about annealing versus circuit gate

00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:33,270
models the thing to know is that there

00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,400
are multiple ways you can build an

00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:37,610
actual quantum computer we're getting

00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,750
computing as their way iBM has their way

00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:42,330
Microsoft's way is that they are working

00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:44,340
to discover an ante on and when they

00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:46,110
discover that particle then like quantum

00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,790
computing magic it's actually very

00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,050
interesting they're most likely to be

00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:51,360
the ones that win like a Nobel Prize or

00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:53,250
something out of their work and I'm not

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,800
a huge Microsoft fan but kudos to them

00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:57,270
there's amazing work so who's working

00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,190
with it now I mentioned some hedge funds

00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:01,110
let me give you an idea Renaissance

00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:03,630
Technologies deshauan to signal revokes

00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,460
featured in the press this week they are

00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:07,980
using quantum computing to do ways of

00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:10,970
testing investing of testing outcomes of

00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,870
investing of doing these things and then

00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:15,270
you know the big question why are we

00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:17,850
here where's the open source so this is

00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:22,000
the the problem

00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:23,740
it is hard science and a lot of hard

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,050
scientists do not understand open source

00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:27,610
and so I've been spending the last few

00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:29,800
months with the I Triple E working on

00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:31,330
the standard side I've also been trying

00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,000
to help the Linux Foundation and others

00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:36,640
to create an open-source project around

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,320
that I'd like to see Symphony Foundation

00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,529
do an open source project around quantum

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,940
and Finance and so my role right now is

00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:45,070
to try to bring that community together

00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:48,100
now there are open source projects

00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:50,230
Righetti computing has you know forests

00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,970
and several other tools out Google just

00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:54,820
released a compiler that you can use to

00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:56,620
do chemistry there's protein folding

00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:59,050
projects but there's not a lot in the

00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:02,050
area of Finance yet but my warning to

00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:04,360
you is that I think that by this time

00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,529
next year there will already be a lot

00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,050
there'll be open source quantum Monte

00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:10,330
Carlo they'll be open source a lot of

00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:12,910
quantum stuff I know people who are

00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:16,540
working on the projects I think that the

00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:18,160
quantum computing hype cycle is kind of

00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:20,260
went up and kind of leveled off so I

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,089
don't think it's a lot of over hype

00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:24,070
about the doom now when you see the

00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:25,930
speed things one of the projects we're

00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:28,150
working on is a performance benchmark

00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:29,470
right because everybody if you go and

00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:31,960
you study this after you hear me talk

00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:33,190
you're gonna notice that don't make that

00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:36,130
buzzer goes off because I'm on the last

00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:41,230
slide all right they he's still gonna

00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:43,990
make it go off the the speed difference

00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,640
we don't know what it is we just know

00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:48,000
it's potentially exponentially greater

00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,890
and for the most part it's faster right

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,900
it's very difficult you go see d-wave

00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,160
put out a study and I love Bo and the

00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,900
guys at D way but they put out a study

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,520
and then Scott Aaronson who was at UT

00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:59,440
writes a paper that says that math is

00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,060
all wrong and there's some of you that

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,339
will get that math I work with a lot of

00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:05,140
smart math people this if you're not a

00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:06,100
discrete mathematician probably not

00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:08,980
interested in reading any of those

00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:11,170
papers but I think what you're gonna see

00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:13,089
before the end of the year is a massive

00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:16,360
collaboration between these tech giants

00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:18,730
in the space of open-source and what I

00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,160
wanted to end with is two things one if

00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:23,440
you like this t-shirt because apparently

00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,880
not enough of you own t-shirts very

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,040
concerned about this in the financial

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,050
industry I think you only have suit

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,880
jackets insurance then I brought some

00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,270
t-shirts to give away if you go back and

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,300
see

00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:36,670
Jackson this guy here in the shore it's

00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,810
also obviously a developer he'll be

00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,490
happy to give you one we bought some

00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:41,410
ladies t-shirts and we got some men's

00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:43,240
t-shirts I know how many we have we have

00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:44,770
like two or three of each size but if

00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,420
you get a super position calm if you pay

00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:48,160
attention to it that's where I've

00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:50,590
started blogging about this is where I

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,390
started talking about it in very simple

00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:55,240
to understand ways it is not a science

00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:56,470
blog it is simply an information blog

00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,000
where if you're interested in quantum

00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:00,520
computing especially in open standards

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,170
or open source area you can get some

00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,340
resources and with that I'll turn it

00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,270
back over to the crew thank you very

00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:08,940
much for having me

00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:08,940
[Applause]
