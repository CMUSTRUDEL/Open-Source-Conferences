I'm Steven O'Grady I'm the co-founder of

00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,330
red monk red monk for those of you who

00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,640
have not heard of us is a developer

00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,290
focused industry analyst firm which of

00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,119
course begs the question what is a

00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:18,820
developer focused industry analyst firm

00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:19,779
in the first place the answer is exactly

00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,790
what it sounds like

00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:25,000
honestly we're an industry analyst firm

00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:28,210
in the sense that we read research and

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,419
write on technology and technical trends

00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:32,710
directions tools platforms programming

00:00:31,419 --> 00:00:35,260
languages really anything that

00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,519
developers use to build applications

00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:40,000
today are things that we're interested

00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:42,789
in and read and write on and the

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,910
developer portion of that that statement

00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:48,910
is sort of core and critical to what we

00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:51,010
do at red Munk our thesis as long as

00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:54,219
we've been around is that developers are

00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:57,070
what we refer to as the new kingmakers

00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:59,260
so for a variety of reasons which would

00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,370
take too long to go into today there's a

00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,190
whole book on this called the new

00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:05,680
kingmakers if anybody's interested we're

00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:08,170
we are and have been sort of as long as

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,540
we've been around convinced that

00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:12,630
developers are among the most important

00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:15,820
constituencies if not the most important

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:18,010
constituency in technology today and we

00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:20,440
believe that for a couple of reasons in

00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:22,480
part because they are determining in

00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,820
many cases what technologies get used

00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,830
and what technologies don't because

00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:29,380
through open source and through again a

00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:32,310
variety of sort of different shifts in

00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:34,630
the market over the past decade Plus

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,280
developers are in a position to choose

00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:39,220
in ways that they were not able to

00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,870
before so part of this of course is is

00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,580
through open source software none of the

00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,380
reasons that we were presumably all here

00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:47,200
today

00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:49,180
developers in many cases you know just

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,460
have a wealth of software at their

00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,530
fingertips which will you know basically

00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,990
gives them the green light it gives them

00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,700
the green light to go out and build to

00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,920
go out and essentially experiment in

00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,800
ways that they couldn't before because

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,140
for the first time developers didn't

00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,300
need permission so before becoming an

00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,129
analyst in the 90s I was a systems

00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,869
integrator yeah I was out running around

00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:13,720
implementing building different things

00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:15,550
for clients and in experience probably

00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,480
similar to the one that many of you in

00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,519
the room have

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,769
you know if I wanted to build literally

00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:24,310
anything you know a pilot project for

00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:26,590
ourselves you know sort of a toy test

00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,680
for a client you know whatever it might

00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:31,150
be I had to go and ask for permission

00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,739
right I had to secure licenses to

00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,239
everything that I might need that might

00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:36,849
be an operating system that might be a

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,819
database it might be a server it might

00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:41,950
be front-end tools everything I needed

00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:44,170
to construct an application I had to go

00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:47,079
and find budget for or find existing

00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:48,959
licenses for through open source

00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:51,400
software of course this has changed

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:55,209
virtually anything I could possibly want

00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,260
today I can obtain for free and that's

00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:57,910
free isn't beer

00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:01,510
I don't want to get into the whole free

00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:03,940
software sort of free debate here

00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,230
because it's not particularly well let's

00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,090
just say it's not a fun debate in the

00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,680
best of times and certainly we don't

00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,989
have time for here but the net is is

00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,730
that from a developer standpoint I don't

00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:14,620
need to ask for permission I can go out

00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:17,049
and I can experiment I can do whatever

00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,970
it is that I want to do using high

00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:21,280
quality software in software in many

00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:23,440
cases which is the same software to run

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,349
some of the largest and highest scale

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,859
organizations today so that's all great

00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:31,989
you know but at the end of the day that

00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:33,760
software needs somewhere run right I

00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:37,389
need something to run on I need a

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,489
platform and for years you know this was

00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:41,290
you know essentially something that

00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:44,079
developers in a lot of organizations

00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:45,400
stumbled with right hey this is great I

00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:47,440
can go out and get an operating system

00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,209
for free I can go again database for

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,180
free and application server for free an

00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:54,370
IDE for free that's all wonderful and

00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:56,889
that is transformative but at the end of

00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:59,049
the day I have to essentially find

00:03:56,889 --> 00:04:02,440
someplace to run this someplace to host

00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:07,060
my application something to run it on so

00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:10,410
in 2006 as is well known at this point a

00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:12,849
small retailer based out of Seattle a

00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,379
company that in the technology industry

00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:17,650
at least nobody was paying any attention

00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:19,840
to dropped to services in March in

00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:22,389
August of that year the first was simple

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:26,110
storage service s3 the second was the

00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:28,270
Elastic Compute cloud ec2 these formed

00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:30,310
together at the essentially the basis

00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:33,130
for what we today know as Amazon Web

00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:35,290
services so this is interesting for

00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:37,750
several reasons but among them is the

00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,520
fact that developers who already had

00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:42,070
access to this huge wealth of

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,010
open-source software now for the first

00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:47,980
time had essentially an erector set

00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:50,040
which they could build anything they

00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:53,130
wanted and they could build importantly

00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:56,550
at the rate and pace that they wanted

00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:59,830
using financial terms that were

00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:01,120
essentially available to them so you

00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,490
know everybody in this room I'm sure

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,500
understands you know sort of the the cap

00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,900
backs up X shifts so I won't go into

00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,300
detail on that here except to say that

00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,070
you know basically if you look at the

00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,770
numbers you know in this quote

00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:17,560
importantly is from 2011 if I remember

00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,880
right so flip Cromer was a start-up the

00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,480
founder of a start-up based out of

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,310
Austin it was a data start up and these

00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:28,330
economics are transformative for a

00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:30,010
number of reasons but importantly when

00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:33,460
we think about it from the importance on

00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:35,740
an individual level this is enormously

00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,570
transformative so you know on the one

00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,830
hand hey this is great I don't need to

00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,830
essentially come up with a capital

00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:44,380
upfront to purchase you know a 10

00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:46,030
machine cluster for a terabyte instead I

00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:49,150
can do that you know if I have a $10

00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:50,830
bill and most developers particularly

00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,530
given the salaries these days are going

00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:55,330
to have a $10 bill but just as

00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:57,670
importantly I don't need to purchase

00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:00,190
that and then maintain it and host it

00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:01,930
over time I can essentially spin this up

00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:04,930
when I need it and kill it when I don't

00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:06,130
so the economics even on an individual

00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,690
level everybody in the room I'm sure

00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:10,030
understands is from an organizational

00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:11,980
standpoint but this coupled with open

00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:14,530
source software put developers in a

00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:16,390
drivers seat in the sense that they have

00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:18,010
access to this huge library of open

00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:20,500
source software and now for the first

00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:22,840
time they have the ability to take these

00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,790
existing services and put them together

00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:28,300
in ways that we've never seen before

00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:30,070
and the consequences of this shift from

00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,230
an economic perspective again are pretty

00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,970
well understood right you know we all

00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:37,180
understand I think the profound changes

00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:39,190
that the industry is undergoing you know

00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:42,220
driven in part by the cloud and the

00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,689
cloud of course is driven itself in part

00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,419
by the underlying economics

00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:49,059
open-source software but the net is is

00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:51,189
that you know really what do we find you

00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:52,869
know what do we find when you know we

00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:54,339
put all these things together we put the

00:06:52,869 --> 00:06:56,949
cloud together we put open-source

00:06:54,339 --> 00:07:00,610
software together we find a world that

00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:02,379
looks a lot like this and this is a

00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,999
world that is profoundly different from

00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:06,369
the one that certainly I grew up with

00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:07,629
and you know certainly the many of the

00:07:06,369 --> 00:07:09,309
clients that I work with the horizon

00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:10,959
systems integrator and certainly the

00:07:09,309 --> 00:07:14,259
clients you know that we worked with

00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:16,409
early in the formation of red monk this

00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:18,939
is not at all what the world looked like

00:07:16,409 --> 00:07:20,800
so basically what we see is is that

00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,789
whether it's software whether it's

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,249
hardware or whether it's some

00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:26,949
combination of both what ends up getting

00:07:24,249 --> 00:07:28,869
used in most cases is going to be what

00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:31,119
the developers in your organization want

00:07:28,869 --> 00:07:33,219
to use one way another they're going to

00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:34,889
find it and this again this is a trend

00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:37,239
that stretches back well over a decade

00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:39,069
right you know I used to tell audiences

00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:40,779
all the time if you take something like

00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:42,639
Linux which we all take for granted now

00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:44,919
as having been successful and having

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,199
been the backbone of enterprises

00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:49,149
all over the world it didn't get there

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,579
because of analysts like myself it

00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:54,219
didn't get there because of CIOs it got

00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:56,529
there because developers used it it was

00:07:54,219 --> 00:07:58,989
available it was free it did what they

00:07:56,529 --> 00:08:02,439
wanted to do and all of a sudden over

00:07:58,989 --> 00:08:04,239
time developers woke up and said hey

00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:05,709
this is great I'm going to keep using

00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:06,819
this I'm gonna keep building what I want

00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:09,189
to build on the backs of this

00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:10,749
open-source operating system and all of

00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:12,969
a sudden CIOs you know took a look

00:08:10,749 --> 00:08:15,009
around you know their data centers and

00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:16,689
said I don't know what the hell happened

00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:18,429
but I know I'm running a lot of this and

00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:20,019
that's the commercial opportunity that

00:08:18,429 --> 00:08:22,209
created among other things Red Hat and

00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:24,369
this trend is just continued on and on

00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:25,749
and on you know we all I'm sure can

00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:28,149
think of you know example after example

00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:30,309
after example cloud which we talked

00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:33,430
about certainly as one of them in which

00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:36,309
the tools that developers want to pick

00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:38,500
up and use are the ones that ultimately

00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:40,149
get rolled out to production sort of

00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,329
over time I can't tell you how many

00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:45,309
times have been in vendor presentations

00:08:43,329 --> 00:08:47,110
you know and a show of hands says you

00:08:45,309 --> 00:08:48,309
know hey how many people are using the

00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,959
cloud how many people are using things

00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:52,750
like Amazon Web Services or Azure or

00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:54,780
Google and the answer comes back now how

00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,160
you know we're not using any of that

00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,510
and then you go out and talk to the

00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,550
actual developers working for those

00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,320
organizations and they'll quietly pull

00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,430
you aside and say ya know the whole

00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,860
thing runs on that they just they're not

00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:07,770
aware of that so the net is is that you

00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,120
know the world that we see more often

00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:11,750
than not and of course there's

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:16,110
exceptions looks very much like this

00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:18,360
so okay you know cloud is important open

00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:19,710
source is important what does that mean

00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,540
to me from an organizational standpoint

00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:23,430
what do I do with that you know how am I

00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:26,670
supposed to process that what are the

00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:27,930
important takeaways so obviously there

00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:30,600
are any number of different things that

00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:32,520
we could talk about and particularly for

00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,570
somebody who does what I do in my line

00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,700
of work I could talk about this

00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:38,280
literally for weeks we don't have weeks

00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:41,160
we only have probably another 15 or 20

00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:43,140
minutes so what I wanted to do was talk

00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,840
about five things five important

00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,700
takeaways five important shifts that in

00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,710
my view all of you in the room who are

00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,600
consuming leveraging open source

00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:53,490
software incorporating it as part of

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,400
your organization will have the

00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:58,680
opportunity to think about in terms of

00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,720
what it means for you personally so the

00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:04,110
first is what we refer to internally as

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,130
a software paradox so quick show of

00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,500
hands how many of you in the room have

00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:10,230
read the Marc Andreessen op eds oft

00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,510
where is eating the world alright so

00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,470
that's a probably about half of you for

00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,300
those of you haven't

00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:17,640
it's basically summed up pretty easily

00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:20,100
it's summed up in the idea that

00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,690
organizations all of them for the most

00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,730
part would rather be Netflix than

00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:26,700
Blockbuster all right that's ultimately

00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:28,710
what it comes down to and the way that

00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,660
you become Netflix rather than

00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,830
Blockbuster at least in part you know of

00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:34,350
course it's more than this there's a lot

00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:36,120
more strategy that goes into it which is

00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:39,110
one reason why digital transformation to

00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:42,210
me is a tremendously short-sighted term

00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:43,860
that being said when we think about it

00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:46,250
you know the way that you do that is via

00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,540
software the way that you do that is by

00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:51,030
essentially building digital businesses

00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,410
digital experiences for customers and on

00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:54,030
and on and on there's so many buzzwords

00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:56,130
you know sort of surrounding these

00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:58,170
presentations and I'm sure all of you

00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:00,089
have heard them far more often than I

00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:02,010
have so I won't go into detail here

00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:04,620
except to say that you know I don't

00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,760
think it's I don't see as an analyst I

00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,500
don't see how you would build the

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,110
argument these days that software is not

00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,320
more

00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:12,670
portant than it has ever been before so

00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,370
offers the driving forces and

00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:18,010
organizations across the world now

00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:19,920
here's the paradox part the interesting

00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,880
thing is is that while software's

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,760
importance from a strategic standpoint

00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,649
has been going up

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:29,019
it's realizable commercial value for

00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:32,350
most providers has been going down so

00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:35,320
example so on the one hand this is

00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:37,630
Oracle's software revenues and this is

00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,070
only through 2013 this is a figures I

00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:41,649
had available at the time the trend

00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:42,880
since is effectively the same and what

00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:44,890
you see here is is that this is a

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,690
portrait on the one hand of a very

00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:48,370
healthy software business you know the

00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:50,860
exception of a period in the dot in the

00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,630
wake of the dot-com implosion Oracle has

00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:55,600
been able to very consistently grow its

00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:57,070
offer revenue over time so you know you

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,300
probably sit there and think well I

00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:00,040
don't I don't understand where are you

00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,329
going with this you know I thought there

00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,980
was a paradox here I thought it was more

00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:04,630
difficult for organisations to sell

00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,740
software today than it has been in past

00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,420
well

00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,519
Oracle does something very interesting

00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:12,130
and its financial releases something

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:15,220
very interesting relatively unique they

00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:16,690
for reasons that I'm unaware of but

00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,000
certainly from the perspective of an

00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:21,670
analyst I'm very grateful for it they

00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,060
break out as part of their filings the

00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:26,320
portion of licenses that the portion of

00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:29,199
revenue rather that comes from the sale

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:32,350
of a new license versus support service

00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:34,329
or other attendant software revenues so

00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:36,610
the question is while software Oracle

00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:37,839
software revenue is going up what's

00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:41,740
happened to their ability to sell new

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:44,709
licenses to their software that doesn't

00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:47,110
look as good what you find here is is

00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:49,630
that if you parse this chart around the

00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:51,459
year 2000 right around 71 cents of every

00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,470
dollar that Oracle took in came from the

00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:56,380
sale of a new license to one of its

00:12:53,470 --> 00:13:00,279
products as of 2013 that number was

00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:02,800
below 38 cents and this is one of the

00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,269
reasons that when I you know agreed to

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,769
speak here today one of the things that

00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:07,990
I wanted to talk about essentially was

00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:09,790
the intersection of cloud and open

00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:11,910
source because one of the interesting

00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:14,199
things that Oracle has done since 2013

00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:16,149
essentially is amend their filing

00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:18,430
structures so now in addition to

00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:20,020
reporting new sales of new licenses to

00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,380
their software they're essentially

00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:24,620
conflating it

00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:25,790
with their cloud business and that's a

00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:30,430
trend that we're going to see quite a

00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:33,920
bit more of over time so number two

00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:35,840
convenience kills so the funny thing is

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,690
is that on a personal level literally

00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,460
everybody in this room understands this

00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:41,690
right we all understand the importance

00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,700
of convenience from a business

00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:46,220
standpoint you know the example that I

00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,930
usually tried out in those cases the

00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,700
original formation is 7-eleven

00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:51,590
so anybody's been to a 7-eleven

00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,870
understand sort of you know it's one of

00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:55,790
the prototypical convenience stores how

00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:57,680
did that come about well it turns out

00:13:55,790 --> 00:14:00,050
they started as a Southland ice company

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,600
so they sold essentially blocks of ice

00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:04,220
this is pre refrigeration and one of

00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,450
their store owners decided you know hey

00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,640
while people are here getting their ice

00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:10,330
why don't we keep some other things cool

00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:13,760
that maybe they want eggs milk bread

00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:14,740
okay great and oh wow you know while

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,760
they're here there's this new thing

00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:19,430
noticed we're sweeping the country

00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,780
called the automobile what if while they

00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:24,260
were here they could also fill up and

00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:25,820
get some gas and oh by the way what if

00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,830
we stayed open seven days what if we

00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:29,600
stayed open 24 hours a day and on and on

00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:31,430
and on this was essentially the birth of

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,750
modern convenience store and this is

00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:35,600
something particularly in this city with

00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:37,940
bodegas everybody understands right this

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,200
is not a difficult concept to impart the

00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,330
interesting thing is is that from a

00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,470
technology standpoint and I don't know

00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,000
if this is true of any of you in the

00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:45,650
room we spend most of our time you know

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,820
talking to vendors about what they're

00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:48,170
building why they're building and how

00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,880
they're building it more particularly

00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:51,110
from a developer standpoint the

00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,870
interesting thing is is that if you go

00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:55,820
out and talk to vendors and you talk to

00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:57,260
them about hey how many meetings have

00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,540
you had about convenience how many

00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:00,680
meetings have you had about thinking

00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,200
through the implications of your

00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:05,720
products and how convenient it is for

00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,580
developers to access and use the answer

00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,770
in most cases is I've had zero meetings

00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:12,740
on that topic is something we all

00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:14,810
understand we all agree generally that

00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:18,170
convenience is important and yet somehow

00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:20,870
it just gets lost it does not translate

00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:22,850
from a product standpoint and here is

00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:24,140
something that is really important you

00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:26,000
know for open-source communities in

00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:28,490
particular to understand in terms of how

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,520
it plays out one of the arguments

00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:33,620
particularly few talk to the press

00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:35,180
historically about open source if you

00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,890
talk to reporters particularly reporter

00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:39,490
to renew the technology beat did not

00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:41,510
understand open-source particularly well

00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:43,490
one of the things that they always

00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:44,900
assumed it was a fundamental planet some

00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:47,210
planning assumption of every article

00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:49,610
they wrote was it the primary and in

00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:52,100
many cases sole driver for the use of

00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:53,450
open source software where's price was

00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,010
the fact that it was free

00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:56,540
that's the only reason people would use

00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:58,520
these databases and only people that you

00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:01,040
know would use the operating systems on

00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:03,890
on and on and on and one of the things

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,170
that became pretty clear you know

00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:08,240
certainly over time is is that you know

00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:09,950
really one of the driving factors sure

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,500
price is huge as we talked about hey I

00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:14,120
don't need to go talk to somebody to get

00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,800
access to a particular piece of software

00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,350
but at the same time it's the

00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:21,020
convenience factor right it's the fact

00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:23,210
that ok if I if I'm assembling a an

00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,920
application I need a database and I can

00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:26,900
choose to talk to in a core or call

00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:30,140
account rap or I can go download

00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:31,460
Postgres for most developers that's not

00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:34,160
a difficult thing that's not a difficult

00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,630
conversation to have right even going

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,890
internally and saying hey can I get a

00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:39,110
license for this particular piece of

00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:41,750
software right so one of the things that

00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:43,910
that really gets lost when we talk about

00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:47,180
open sources that fundamentally it was

00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:48,560
more convenient to use anybody anybody

00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:52,100
use the package management systems of

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:54,110
Linux okay so again half the room you

00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,420
haven't used these basically you can

00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:58,640
think about it's like an app store for

00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:01,040
your operating system so literally

00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,930
anything you could possibly want you can

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,010
install via one command and the

00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,750
operating system of the package

00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:07,070
management system rather within that

00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:09,470
operating system will keep it updated

00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:11,540
for you this is a fundamentally more

00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:14,810
convenient way to acquire develop and

00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:17,420
use software so that's great right

00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:19,340
that's a sort of win for open-source it

00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,480
is and certainly has been is one of the

00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:23,240
reasons that open source has been as

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,350
successful it has been historically but

00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,240
one of the things that open source

00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:29,120
communities in particular have not

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,270
adjusted to have not adapted to as yet

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,430
is that just as they were more

00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:36,020
convenient and proprietary software the

00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:38,450
cloud is a lot more convenient than open

00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:40,760
source software typically so in other

00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:42,140
words if I have a choice between talking

00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,090
to an account rep and downloading

00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:46,970
Postgres I'm going to choose postgrads

00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:48,590
if I have a choice between downloading

00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:50,980
Postgres finding compute

00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:54,399
network finding storage to back it and

00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:57,169
then finding somebody to hop back up

00:17:54,399 --> 00:18:00,049
maintain it over time protect it or I

00:17:57,169 --> 00:18:01,789
can go over to Amazon Web Services and

00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:04,460
in two or three clicks I have something

00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:06,889
running in 90 seconds that's a lot more

00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:09,470
convenient so again

00:18:06,889 --> 00:18:11,419
does this mean that it's a binary switch

00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:14,360
that hey the most convenient product is

00:18:11,419 --> 00:18:15,830
going to win every time it's not but if

00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,090
you look at the markets if you look at

00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:20,269
how things have played out over the last

00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:23,330
two decades convenience wins more often

00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:25,429
than a dozen so when we think about

00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:28,009
number three when we think about the

00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:29,450
third choice that we want to make you

00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:31,309
know one of the things that we talk

00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:33,590
about you know sort of it's a flip

00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:37,070
comment that I make to developers all

00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:39,799
the time which is choice is good but

00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:42,379
then it's bad all right which seems I

00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:44,240
don't understand choice is good right

00:18:42,379 --> 00:18:45,889
because none of us you know particularly

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,619
those of you in the room who have done

00:18:45,889 --> 00:18:50,869
any negotiation with vendors nobody

00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:52,700
wants to lack choice right you never

00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:55,850
want to have one choice you never want

00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:58,249
to have a single provider that you're

00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:59,749
beholden to because they essentially

00:18:58,249 --> 00:19:02,779
will dictate terms to you because they

00:18:59,749 --> 00:19:04,129
know your Batna sucks so the way that I

00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:06,230
talk about this typically is is that

00:19:04,129 --> 00:19:08,570
choice is something like a parabola it's

00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:11,840
probably more correct to say asymptotic

00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:14,090
ly you know flies out to the right hand

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,519
of the x-axis basically we can think

00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:19,220
about it it's like a parabola I don't

00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:21,200
want one choice that's not good two or

00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:24,259
three choices in many cases is great

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,990
three or four choices okay five or six

00:19:24,259 --> 00:19:28,879
choices now I'm having problem seven

00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:32,629
eight nine ten you can see where this is

00:19:28,879 --> 00:19:35,779
going so the utility and the value of

00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:38,509
having choice decreases as I add choice

00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:40,850
to the mix there's a great book on this

00:19:38,509 --> 00:19:41,299
called the paradox of choice by Barry

00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:44,720
Schwartz

00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:46,190
talks a lot about this but again when we

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,009
talk open-source when we talk

00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:51,320
enterprises today one of the things that

00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:52,850
most of us haven't sort of adapted to is

00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:56,750
the fact that there is so much more

00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:59,090
choice open-source has been a wonderful

00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:00,980
boon to this industry but choices does

00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:02,460
not come without a cost attached to it

00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,440
so consider this

00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,870
I gave a talk to the Apache Software

00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,430
Foundation last year so the Apache

00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:11,070
Software Foundation has done a

00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:13,920
remarkable job over the years of

00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:15,570
assembling an enormous library of

00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,900
open-source software that is

00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:21,690
high-quality and the way that I've tried

00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,860
to value this you know for reporters in

00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:24,210
particular who don't understand

00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,040
essentially what these foundations are

00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:29,160
about what this aggregation or

00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:31,560
accumulation of software is about is

00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,660
that if you took these assets and you

00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,620
gave them to an organization you know 10

00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,050
20 years ago

00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,520
pre open source that organization would

00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:41,370
be worth billions and billions and

00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:44,790
billions of dollars because the value of

00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:46,140
this software is that high so you know

00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:48,600
when we think about the Apache Software

00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:50,940
Foundation you know again and this is

00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:53,010
you know literally a tiny subset of

00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:55,560
everything that's sort of in there quote

00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:57,270
unquote big ten that's an enormous

00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,550
amount of choice that's an enormous

00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:01,440
amount of utility anything I could

00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:03,330
possibly want to do in here I probably

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,630
have two or three different ways to do

00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,520
it

00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:07,290
java application servers there's a

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,860
couple web web servers there's a couple

00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:12,840
databases there's half a dozen right

00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:16,800
anything I could possibly want to do is

00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:18,750
in here so this is option a but again

00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,490
you know when from the standpoint of a

00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:22,050
customer from the standpoint of those of

00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:24,930
you who run enterprises and run

00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:27,390
technology organizations today think

00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:29,490
about the choice think about sort of

00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:31,310
where we are when we think about sort of

00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:34,590
where we are from a choice standpoint I

00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:35,940
can try to sift through you know sort of

00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,410
that wealth of assets and figure out

00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:41,550
which ones are good and figure out which

00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:43,620
ones I want or I can essentially go to a

00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:46,200
place like the Amazon Web Services

00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:48,480
console they've pretty much picked out a

00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,390
service / they more or less integrate

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,980
well together and this is my alternative

00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:54,320
and this is one of the reasons that I

00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:57,600
tell commercial open source

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,010
organizations today all the time they

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,620
tend to regard their competitor as a

00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:03,630
proprietary incumbent frequently in some

00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,920
cases an open source alternative their

00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,960
competitor is not another software

00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:09,540
product their competitor almost every

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,440
case today is a cloud which we'll come

00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:14,429
back to so number four

00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:17,970
this is a quote many of you probably

00:22:14,429 --> 00:22:20,190
seen the movie Ronin this is a quote

00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:22,799
that I think everybody in this room

00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:23,789
probably has thought about quite a bit

00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,320
over the years

00:22:23,789 --> 00:22:29,490
which would you walk into a room that

00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:30,630
you can't walk out of you know so what

00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:32,669
are we talking about of course we're

00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:34,350
talking about lock-in of course we're

00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:36,330
talking about sort of the threat of

00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:38,760
being sort of locked into a particular

00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:40,230
provider and you know the interesting

00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,700
thing for me is is that having have

00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:43,100
conversations with enterprises about

00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,030
this over the you know past twenty years

00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:48,090
one of the things that happens every

00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:49,500
time is is that organizations don't want

00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:51,330
to be locked in and yet they do it all

00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,070
the time all right so I haven't worked I

00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:55,350
have a conversation very regularly that

00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:56,909
goes something like I got locked into

00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:58,919
Windows I got locked into VMware I

00:22:56,909 --> 00:23:02,130
didn't like it it's not happening again

00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:05,039
okay who's your cloud provider Amazon

00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:08,250
okay what services are using Kinesis

00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,900
redshift simple queuing service flexible

00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:11,909
payment service and so on all of which

00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,039
are great services all of which are you

00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:17,309
know valuable services all of which also

00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:19,320
are unique to Amazon so here's the thing

00:23:17,309 --> 00:23:20,940
is that as you think about lock-in it's

00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,500
not for me or for anybody else for that

00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:25,260
matter to tell you that you can't or

00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:27,000
shouldn't be locked in but it is

00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:29,159
important to do three things it's

00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,559
important one to be aware of when you're

00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:33,030
being locked in because most of the open

00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:35,419
sort or most of the cloud platforms

00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:38,370
rather have provided conveniently very

00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:39,780
standard open-source entry points so you

00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:43,350
can come in and use Linux you can come

00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:46,260
in and use MySQL or PostgreSQL open

00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:47,490
source flavors but then hey there's

00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:50,760
these other things these other adjacent

00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:52,620
services which are pretty great and yeah

00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,780
you might want to sort of extend into

00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:57,030
them and all of a sudden you wake up one

00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:59,130
day wait how did I get it locked in what

00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:00,780
does this mean so you need to be aware

00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:03,059
of it every time that you're making a

00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:06,080
decision in terms of what you use open

00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:08,880
source versus a proprietary alternative

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,159
be aware you know be aware of those

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,429
trade-offs number two as you think about

00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:16,559
sort of the possibility of being locked

00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:18,480
in many companies will say you know what

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,950
you know where we are right now this

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,020
makes sense I talk to startups who say

00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:23,429
this all the time sure I don't want to

00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,720
be locked in this doesn't necessarily

00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:25,690
make sense longer term but this makes

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,490
sense for me right

00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:30,380
totally fine but in other words you have

00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:32,660
to sort of understand going in that your

00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:36,650
calculus as far as what is an acceptable

00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:38,630
amount of essentially lock-in to accept

00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:40,700
from a particular vendor is likely to

00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:42,800
change over time so what makes sense

00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:44,060
upfront might not make sense next year

00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,980
two years from now three years from now

00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:48,170
four years from now and in many cases

00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,030
you do what you have to do we all do

00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:51,470
because sometimes we just have to get

00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,510
from point A to point B as quickly as

00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:55,160
possible but again you need to

00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:57,110
understand that and consciously make

00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,910
that trade-off and consciously

00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:00,410
understand you know essentially the the

00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:03,620
level of debt that goes into this and

00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:06,110
then the third thing is is that you know

00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:07,760
as you sort of think about sort of open

00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:10,610
source is a mitigating factor against

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,500
Block in which it absolutely can be and

00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:15,260
in a perfect world that's exactly what

00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:17,230
it serves us you have to understand that

00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:19,850
vendors understand that very very well

00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:23,030
vendors understand you know essentially

00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:26,120
the the calculus that they have to make

00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:27,680
right which is Shapiro invariance eight

00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,360
years ago that the net present value of

00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:32,380
a software company is exactly equal to

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:35,090
the switching cost moving forward so

00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:37,340
given that what is your commercial

00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:38,750
incentive as a supplier even if you're a

00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,640
commercial supplier of open source

00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:42,440
software well I'm going to do everything

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,300
in my power to increase your switching

00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,040
costs over time because guess what

00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,750
that's what feeds my valuation that's

00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:50,900
what feeds in a sort of my business

00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:52,910
moving forward so again when you think

00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:55,130
about lock-in it's never as simple as

00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:57,470
don't get locked in or lock in is fine

00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:58,970
it is a complicated set of calculations

00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:00,110
and a complicated set of decisions that

00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:01,670
you need to think through but

00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:05,330
importantly you need to be conscious of

00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:07,100
when you do that and then lastly number

00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:10,400
five this is a question that we get all

00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:15,350
the time is the cloud good or bad for

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:17,810
open source software an answer is kind

00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:19,580
of a bit of both right there isn't a

00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:22,130
clean answer here because on the one

00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:24,650
hand the cloud is the reason that we

00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:26,900
have so many different pieces of open

00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:28,490
source software the efforts of providers

00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:31,310
to scale their cloud and then release

00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:32,990
that software as open source is the

00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:35,180
reason that we have many of the projects

00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:36,980
that we enjoy today and from a

00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:39,230
commercial open source organization

00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:41,780
standpoint the cloud is an enormous

00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:43,250
boom because many of these organizations

00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,809
were looking at it they're seeing the

00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:46,429
same software paradox that I spoke about

00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:47,720
earlier and saying hey it's getting

00:26:46,429 --> 00:26:49,040
harder and harder and harder for me to

00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,830
charge for software the way that I used

00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,970
to but I can charge as a service you

00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:55,250
know backed by some of these public

00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:57,350
clouds and that actually makes sense so

00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:59,720
in many cases you know the cloud is

00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:01,820
actually empowering and enabling the

00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,440
continual generation the continual

00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:06,049
authoring of new open source software

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,179
whether it comes from big guys or small

00:27:06,049 --> 00:27:10,910
open source startups at the bottom all

00:27:08,179 --> 00:27:13,160
of that is good on the flip side you

00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:15,440
know we have the not surprising you know

00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:17,120
fact as we just discussed that the

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,929
incentives here you know from a provider

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:22,970
standpoint are complicated at best all

00:27:20,929 --> 00:27:25,370
right you know it's not malicious at

00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:27,590
least in most cases it's a fact that

00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:30,500
organizations you know have you know the

00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:32,570
obligation to essentially perpetuate

00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,100
themselves generate cash to keep

00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:36,650
themselves in a sort of as a viable

00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:38,059
going concern and one of the issues that

00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:39,470
they have doing that is is that their

00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:43,190
incentives as far as open source

00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:45,020
software can become skewed right so what

00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:47,929
starts is a vanilla implementation of an

00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:49,790
open source software package can morph

00:27:47,929 --> 00:27:51,620
into something quite different and even

00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:54,410
if you preserve this in a sort of open

00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:55,910
source vanilla implementation and hey

00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:59,270
that's what I come in as a customer and

00:27:55,910 --> 00:28:00,799
use then you know by the way I'm gonna

00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:02,540
try to sell you this thing that you can

00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:05,450
only get from me you know sort of right

00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:07,700
next door so again you know I'd love to

00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:09,799
say hey it's a it's a clean good or bad

00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,900
in terms of you know sort of the clouds

00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:13,370
impact on open source software but the

00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,900
net is is that for everybody in the room

00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:17,330
whether you're a consumer of open source

00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:19,130
software somebody who leverages open

00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:21,770
source software or some combination of

00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:23,690
both the fact is is that you know the

00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:26,030
cloud in combination with open source

00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:27,350
software is going to change profoundly

00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:29,600
the way that your organization's do

00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:33,110
business moving forward and with that

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:35,169
I'm just about out of time thanks so

00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:35,169
much

00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,040
