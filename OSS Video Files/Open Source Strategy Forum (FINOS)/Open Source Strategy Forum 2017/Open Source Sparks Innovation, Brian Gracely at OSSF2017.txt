	00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:13,500
so we've heard from industry leaders we

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,419
heard from a lawyer I think it's time to

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,620
also look at the technology side and so

00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:22,890
I wanna welcome Brian Gaines Lee from

00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:24,869
Red Hat Red Hat is working with us on

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,210
the open developer platform providing

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:28,769
this reference architecture for open

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,390
source collaboration is one or platinum

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:37,020
sponsor so thank you so much for being

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:38,520
here thank you good morning so we want

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,770
to talk a little bit about how do we

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,930
spark innovation out of open source how

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:46,050
do we get new creative ideas out of this

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,280
collaborative process now we know

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,110
technology's everywhere that's a

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,910
fantastic piece for technologists and

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,780
obviously all of you are here today

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,120
because at least you have that

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,129
curiousness DNA you've got a little bit

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,739
of that how do I move ahead of my career

00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:59,910
how do I help my company and we know

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:02,010
it's part of everything as well we know

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,080
technology is now part of it's part of

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,120
banking but it's part of our kids toys

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,910
it's part of how we sort of live work

00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:11,370
and play to borrow a John Chambers

00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:13,110
phrase you know it's part what we do now

00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,970
the challenge of that is it's also

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,560
incredibly disruptive and if you're in

00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,820
financial services you heard amber

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,610
talking this morning about about

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,110
blockchain is it disruptive is it not

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,180
disruptive you sort of fighting those

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,950
battles every day if you're in media

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,780
you're wondering is is Netflix going to

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,520
compete with you if you're in the hotel

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,810
industry and real estate this is you

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,220
know uber and Airbnb you're going to

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,630
compete with you so we know it's

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,510
disruptive but we also know that it's

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:40,650
fantastically powerful and so the

00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:42,240
challenge becomes how do we realize when

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,200
it's disruptive and how do we realize

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,970
when it's going to help us take

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,160
advantage what we want to do right and

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,260
this is always the big question because

00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,570
it's human beings we traditionally we

00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,860
enjoy comfort we like believing that the

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,120
things that we've done in the past are

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,370
going to help us be successful in the

00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,110
future our stock price may be way up so

00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:00,090
why do we have to change and the

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,440
question is always not if will change

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,970
because we're all in technology we sort

00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,650
of know change is the one constant that

00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:07,260
we always have the question is always

00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:09,239
when do you have to invest in order to

00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,790
not be blindsided when that change

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:14,709
happens right if you're nokia you have

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:17,019
300 million phones and in 2007

00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:19,000
Steve Steve Jobs stands on stage and

00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:20,650
talks about a phone a device that's

00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,689
gonna cost ten times as much the thing

00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:25,959
that you have has zero market share and

00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:27,879
you go yeah that's not a problem and now

00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:30,099
we think 10 years later from the iPhone

00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:31,689
announcement you can't imagine your life

00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:33,549
without either an iPhone or an Android

00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:35,829
phone or something disrupting what you

00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:39,370
do and so the question becomes when do I

00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:42,250
make those changes the real question is

00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,209
not if I make those changes we know

00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,950
we're going to make those changes at

00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:46,450
some point but how far behind am I going

00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,519
to get so there's some fantastic data

00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:49,989
that's come out of the group that does a

00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:52,060
lot of the DevOps services these days a

00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:53,319
group called Dora and what they found

00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,590
from their highest performance to the

00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:57,790
highest high highest performance

00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,260
performing companies the ones that are

00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:00,519
developing a lot of software shipping a

00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,200
lot of software since everything we're

00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:04,989
doing nowadays is being driven by

00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,939
software there 200 times as fast in

00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:09,849
terms of shipping software on a daily

00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:11,799
basis making bug fixes collecting data

00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:13,780
from their market places making analysis

00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,299
on that collecting feedback on that and

00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,849
making changes if your competitors are

00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:20,530
200 times as fast as you and you're not

00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:22,989
prepared for that how fast do you think

00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,489
that hockey stick curve takes off and so

00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:26,620
the question becomes what do I do about

00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:28,780
that how do I manage that innovation how

00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,250
do I keep up with everybody else and we

00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,810
all have budgets we all have a fixed

00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,669
number of developers some of those

00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,959
developers are wearing t-shirts some of

00:03:33,669 --> 00:03:36,400
those developers are stuck because

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,540
there's sort of jeans and there's sort

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,359
of coach they're not sure if they're

00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:42,010
allowed to do that themselves the other

00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:44,079
thing that we found quite a bit is the

00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,000
mindset it's not just when do I find

00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:48,430
that innovation change but the mindset

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,900
is also are we open we're all talking

00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,690
about that hearsay but are we also

00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,489
hybrid and hybrid being hybrid in the

00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,319
sense of technology sometimes it's are

00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:58,030
we hybrid cloud are we building some

00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,919
things in-house leverage that we have

00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,690
but also take advantage of the world's

00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,940
greatest computing resources like AWS

00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,979
and Azure and Google and so forth but

00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,959
also are we thinking about hybrid in the

00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:10,030
sense of business models right are we

00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:11,590
breaking down where those supply chains

00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,239
used to be where our distribution models

00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:15,069
used to be we think about the world's

00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:18,190
greatest you know movie theater these

00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:20,049
days it used to be blockbuster it became

00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,150
Netflix and they sent us CDs and we had

00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:23,289
a physical good now we had digital goods

00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,330
but they were passing along somebody

00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:27,250
else's goods and now they're winning

00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,750
Emmy Awards and Oscar Awards for making

00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,580
their own

00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:33,720
they've become a hybrid company and we

00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:35,910
see this all over the place so we

00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,080
believe from a RedHat perspective the

00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,030
way we're gonna go about doing this is

00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,710
through open source not surprisingly

00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:42,090
it's fantastic that you are all here

00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,350
it's great that over the last couple of

00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,730
years people have embraced open source

00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,740
we've been doing this for 20 plus years

00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,970
it's been a little weird to be that

00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,770
person that's out in front of this

00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,540
because for a long time we were those

00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,800
people in the basement with a pizza we

00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,420
were the ones that people are like why

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,060
are you doing that stuff for free why

00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:59,430
are you doing free software and what we

00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,260
found is the puck you know the great

00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,520
phrase of you know Wayne Gretzky skate

00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,590
to where the puck is going the pucks

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,150
kind of come towards us right there's

00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:08,250
now a million plus projects out on

00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,320
github right there's a million plus

00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,760
projects and like amber said some of

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,550
those may be completely abandoned they

00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,770
may be a one-night fantastic idea and

00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:18,390
they got abandoned but a lot of those

00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:21,390
projects are driving what goes on in the

00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:22,950
world right now it's not just code

00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,970
that's driving this it's culture as well

00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,710
and that's one of the things that we

00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,940
find we sort of live this day to day

00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,230
there's really four pillars to that

00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,780
you've got to be willing to collaborate

00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:32,310
internally and externally you've got to

00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,140
be willing to work on shared problems

00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,940
nobody cares about your problems if they

00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,860
only affect you we've got to go find

00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,750
broad horizontal problems to work on

00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,860
you've got to be willing to work on

00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,240
transparency and I know that's a

00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,040
difficult thing sometimes the financial

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,270
services industry but in order to take

00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,710
advantage of those whether you think

00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,419
about him as free resources or great

00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:50,160
ideas you've got to be willing to do

00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:53,340
this in the open and then you've got to

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,950
work towards standardization now there's

00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:58,260
power and participation you only get the

00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:00,090
benefit of this by helping out you don't

00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,200
get it for free all right you don't

00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:03,150
necessarily just get to go I'm going to

00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,250
take that in fact actually you do if you

00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:06,060
want but as amber mentioned and some

00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,410
others have mentioned you don't

00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,030
necessarily get the community that wants

00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,470
to help you down the road right so

00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:12,390
having a mindset that I'm we're going to

00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,590
not only maybe take from the community

00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:16,229
but we're also going to participate it's

00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:17,400
incredibly important now

00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:19,020
I'm going to skip this just from a

00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,669
timing perspective how do we go about

00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,990
doing it it's very important and we

00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:24,419
recommend that a lot of people take a

00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,440
look at this you participate you find

00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:26,580
the things that are interesting do you

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,650
find the things that you're willing to

00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:31,020
participate in they don't all have to be

00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,370
new ideas you can just go and contribute

00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,530
you can contribute Docs you can

00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:35,610
contribute bug fixes but you're hopeful

00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:37,440
you're going to contribute engineering

00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,599
at some point we integrate those we

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,180
decide what does the marketplace want we

00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,949
integrate those with other technology

00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,539
so that the end of the day and Gabriel

00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:46,340
talked about this the beginning your

00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:48,350
value line is that starting point we

00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,580
want to be that starting point for you

00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:51,440
right we want to give you things that

00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,000
you can then go great I can go start and

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,710
go do things I want to take the friction

00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,020
out of it and then finally we stabilize

00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,310
those things because at some point we

00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,630
talking about the mainframe being old

00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,639
and boring and so forth we still do

00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:03,110
billions of transactions on that at some

00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:05,389
point the technology that's cool today

00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:07,009
becomes old and boring but you still

00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:09,680
want it to work we're in that business

00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:10,910
of making sure it's stabilized it looks

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,340
like this from a technology perspective

00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,930
we take a million we will funnel those

00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,729
down into projects that become open

00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,990
source projects and then we turn those

00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:20,120
into technologies it's a fairly

00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:21,229
straightforward process right you can

00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,410
look at this just like you would any

00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:26,330
other technology vendors roadmap and

00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,979
then what we're seeing which is really

00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,990
interesting more and more is we're

00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:31,490
seeing companies contribute right we

00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,620
talked we saw JP Morgan talked about

00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:35,000
this we saw BNY Mellon Capital One is a

00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,030
great example of this but it's also

00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,229
we're seeing companies that are

00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,699
contributing that you may not think of

00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:43,370
as technology companies right

00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:44,990
lyft there they're a taxi company uber

00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,220
they're a taxi company they're

00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:48,740
contributing code that's being used

00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:50,599
every day right we talked about Amadeus

00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:52,849
who's now contributed more code as

00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:54,229
simply they manage transactions for

00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:55,789
airlines and so forth they've

00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:57,289
contributed more code the major vendors

00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:59,150
have around technologies like kubernetes

00:07:57,289 --> 00:08:00,949
we're seeing contributions come from all

00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,840
over the place because every company

00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:04,190
that wants to be a software company or

00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,020
is a software company wants to benefit

00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:09,080
from these and I'm gonna finish real

00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,460
quick with a couple of stories and I

00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,919
want to talk about these in the context

00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,570
of is this applicable to me right we're

00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:15,979
a big bank we have a gigantic building

00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:18,409
is this stuff applicable to me let me

00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:20,599
give you two examples a lot of you are

00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:23,300
trying to figure out how do we start

00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:24,380
something new right and it's cool to be

00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,060
able to go out to github and go I'm just

00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,470
going to jump in but sometimes you want

00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,639
a little bit of help we have an

00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,909
organization that's called the open

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:35,419
innovation labs company called easier

00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:37,310
easier ER AG easier AG basically said we

00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:39,469
have an idea but we need some help and

00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:41,539
in four weeks they took four developers

00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:43,339
one designer and basically reinvented

00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:45,740
the hotel jar the hospital check-in

00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:48,050
system the doctor check-in system right

00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:50,029
there are groups out there like Red Hat

00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:51,500
that have programs in place that aren't

00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,839
massive consulting opportunities they're

00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,990
just three or four weeks we help you get

00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,640
some software in place we

00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,750
you build a Minimum Viable Product we

00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,970
help you build a little bit of culture

00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,950
of what's possible so that you can go to

00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:03,330
your executive team and it's said of

00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,709
presenting them one foil that you're

00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:08,130
going to talk about for four hours you

00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:10,860
go here's an application we could build

00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:12,270
upon this right now that's cool that's

00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,230
Greenfield a lot of you will go well

00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,300
that's not us

00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:17,339
we're not Greenfield we're a huge Bank

00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,050
we're a huge financial institution can

00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,560
depth is that possible yeah it's

00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,720
possible

00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:24,000
Key Bank is a great example of that now

00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,070
he backs a great example because had a

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,930
problem they'd have massive outage one

00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,070
time and I'm not here to highlight their

00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,959
outage I'm here to highlight what they

00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,130
did beyond that what they did is they

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,490
said we're going to take open source

00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:36,839
technologies containers kubernetes they

00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,459
got involved with the DevOps movement

00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,899
they wanted to talk about continuous

00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:42,390
integration and they're in the business

00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:43,920
of acquiring companies right that's

00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:45,060
helps them grow their marketplace it

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,220
could help them grow their footprint

00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:49,200
what they've been able to do is they are

00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,000
now able to leverage that technology

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,170
they don't want to be in the building

00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,240
the platform business they want to

00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:56,490
leverage platforms they now deploy ten

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,589
times a day in the middle of the day for

00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:00,120
new acquisitions ten times a day how

00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:02,490
many people deploy into production ten

00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:05,550
times a day and feel really confident on

00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:07,589
it we've got their CFO and CEO now going

00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,540
on on Kramer's show saying we're a

00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:11,160
software technology company because they

00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,690
take advantage of open source they want

00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,520
to be in the banking business but they

00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:17,490
want to take advantage of that speed and

00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,810
efficiency so with that we look at that

00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:22,050
as that's really the open source way

00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:24,060
contribute get heavily involved look for

00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,980
ways to stabilize it around community

00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,570
around collaboration and so forth and

00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,310
work with the people that are here these

00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:32,060
people want to work with you thank you

00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,060
very much for your time

00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,100
you

00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:44,829
