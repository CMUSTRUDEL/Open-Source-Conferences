okay as people are joining us I just

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,860
wanted to say good morning everyone and

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:17,450
you're probably wondering what Comcast

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:21,509
is doing at a financial services

00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:23,000
conversation but just like you guys we

00:00:21,509 --> 00:00:26,939
started off as a very traditional

00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,849
industry we are highly regulated from an

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:33,239
FCC perspective and then we also deal

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:37,020
with a very unique way of you know

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:39,510
working on our patent strategy and and

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,550
so it seemed to have a lot of relevance

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,320
to what the journey that you guys are

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,660
going through so I'd like to share our

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,640
journey with you

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,930
I'm Mitya ruff and I'll quickly

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:55,739
introduce myself here I started out

00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:58,620
doing open-source in 1998 at Silicon

00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:59,340
Graphics and like many people in

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,540
open-source

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:05,759
I started in Silicon Graphics as a

00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:08,220
proprietary company and you know was

00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:11,360
part of the open-source strategy team to

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,070
take the company to an open-source way

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,909
essentially shipping our servers with

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:21,270
Linux and standard Intel processors

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:23,909
instead of the SGI mips as well as IREX

00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,880
and from there i went to a small company

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:28,680
called tripwire and tripwire was also in

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,940
the process of looking at how can we

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,960
work better with the open-source

00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:36,630
community and we open sourced one of the

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,909
versions of tripwire so that we could

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,310
you know then become ubiquitous through

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,770
a Red Hat distribution and then we up

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:47,610
sold other proprietary versions of

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:49,799
tripwire to customers one of the other

00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,780
interesting areas that I worked in was

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,530
Wind River systems which is a part of

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:58,189
Intel and there we started an

00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,390
open-source embedded Linux distribution

00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:02,570
even though we were a proprietary

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:07,020
company that had a proprietary software

00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:08,970
product called VxWorks we felt that the

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,679
world was moving to open source and we

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,560
needed to provide an open source

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:16,140
alternative to customers and

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,320
the open-source office that I started at

00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:22,290
WD and sandesh was also an indication of

00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,300
how the hardware industry and the memory

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,460
industry was also moving to open-source

00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,520
and they realized that they needed to

00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,770
start an open-source organization inside

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,230
the company so that they could scale

00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:36,480
open-source processes across the company

00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:40,290
I also sit on the board of the Linux

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:43,290
Foundation as a director at large and

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:46,620
what that means is that I get to

00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:49,620
represent community and not a company on

00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:52,290
the foundation board that allows me the

00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:55,680
freedom to represent a lot of the issues

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:58,860
such as diversity of the organization

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,560
diversity of communities in the Linux

00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,570
Foundation board and there are a number

00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,450
of other areas that that are of great

00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:10,080
interest to me so let me get started and

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:12,060
say like many speakers said today we are

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,260
going through a lot of transformation in

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:18,000
many of the industries every single

00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:20,190
industry is being impacted by digital

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,959
transformation just look at Comcast

00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:26,850
alone via we go through a lot of

00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:28,830
transformation because the industry's

00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:32,330
changing there's a tremendous amount of

00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:34,890
competition over the top streaming

00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:36,420
different ways of consuming content

00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:39,269
different ways of getting internet

00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:42,810
services different ways of producing

00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:45,269
content and and so we also realized that

00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:48,269
we needed to transform ourselves if we

00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:51,200
were to move in this world second there

00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:55,200
are lots of new models of creating

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:57,989
content creating communities creating

00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,989
technology and we needed to move to be

00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:03,530
in that new model and adopt that new

00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:07,410
model and last but not the least I feel

00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:08,910
the world is so connected and problems

00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:11,640
are so connected whether it's the

00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:13,890
Internet the blockchain AI machine

00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,810
learning etc and that we need to

00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:18,359
collaborate with other industries with

00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,820
other companies with other developers to

00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:23,870
solve our problems we couldn't in any

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:26,630
way solve problems alone as a company

00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:30,260
and be isolated in an island as a

00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:33,080
company and and I think Karen also

00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:36,350
shared some tremendous numbers we felt

00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:39,050
that there were many many options there

00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:41,300
were many many projects that we could

00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:44,389
source into the company we no longer

00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:46,760
needed to create things ourselves you

00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:49,220
know as as Karen indicated the

00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:53,540
open-source operating system for example

00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:55,910
is game over there's Linux everywhere it

00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:58,610
just doesn't make sense to create Linux

00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:02,570
it doesn't make sense to create you know

00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:06,050
Apache traffic control servers or you

00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:07,789
know the web servers etc so as as you

00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:11,300
can imagine there are 64 million

00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:14,270
repositories out there which have pretty

00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:16,850
bright ecosystems around it and we felt

00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:20,180
that you know open source was abundant

00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,830
and it was very good and we didn't need

00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,900
to create it ourselves anymore

00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:25,220
especially in many many different areas

00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,889
that I'll talk about

00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:31,370
so in whether you look at blockchain

00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:33,830
which the speaker before me spoke about

00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:36,620
or you look at big data or you look at

00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:39,440
i/o T and the edge computing space you

00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:42,260
look at cloud you look at mobile and AI

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,849
in all of these areas there's a

00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,919
tremendous amount of open source

00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:48,470
happening there a tremendous number of

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,780
ecosystems built in this area for

00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:53,000
example on blockchain there's a whole

00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:55,669
foundation around it the hyper ledger

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,340
organization for example you could

00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:59,780
become a part of that and participate in

00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:03,080
collaborative development in the

00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:05,300
blockchain space in AI there is another

00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,120
organization forming at the Linux

00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:11,630
Foundation that is looking at sharing

00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:14,599
data openly across organizations it's

00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:17,300
also looking at machine learning models

00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:19,460
and sharing that across organizations so

00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:22,789
in all of these spaces we felt we could

00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:24,560
just participate in a lot of the

00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:27,169
open-source organizations and

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,479
foundations and projects and benefit

00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:34,010
from that and we didn't need to do all

00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:36,830
the heavy lifting ourselves so this is

00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:39,860
not a new situation

00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:43,159
open-source is a business imperative for

00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:45,050
almost 78 percent of organizations the

00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:47,569
groups of organizations that I work with

00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,460
through the to do group which is a group

00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:52,099
of open-source program managers like

00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:54,319
myself is a who's who in every single

00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:57,289
industry you can look at financial

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,479
services you can look at healthcare you

00:06:57,289 --> 00:07:02,180
can look at the traditional technology

00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:05,150
companies and we're all there including

00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:08,330
people like Microsoft of course who

00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:10,669
famously did not embrace open-source in

00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:14,270
the early days but today is one of the

00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:17,089
model citizens in open source in the to

00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:19,310
do group and only less than 3% of

00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:21,699
companies really are not using any open

00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:24,259
source when I do due diligence for

00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:27,560
acquisitions or mergers and acquisitions

00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:31,129
and also investments I always still I

00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:33,169
can say if a company says I don't use

00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:36,560
open source I really don't believe them

00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:38,770
I feel that they are either not aware

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,379
that they're using open source or

00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:44,930
they're just hiding their head in a sand

00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:46,370
and practically all of our companies are

00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:50,000
using open source it's no longer

00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:53,240
optional so let me get to the Comcast

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,210
journey itself and how we embraced open

00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:59,899
source and why they embraced open source

00:07:55,210 --> 00:08:03,469
so this chart I think really typifies

00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:05,479
what happened I think prior to 2000 we

00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:09,680
grew up through acquisitions we were

00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:13,039
born in about 1963 they're about 54

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,289
years old as a company and through a

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,240
number of acquisitions starting with you

00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:19,699
know Tupelo Mississippi where we started

00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:22,009
we started building a lot of different

00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:25,520
companies and part of the family is also

00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:28,699
NBC you it's also Spectacor which

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:31,580
manages venues and it's Comcast ventures

00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:33,319
and much of the company like a lot of

00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:35,209
our companies would depend upon

00:08:33,319 --> 00:08:38,149
proprietary software vendors and we

00:08:35,209 --> 00:08:40,010
would purchase from software vendors and

00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:42,500
we would depend upon them from a road

00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:44,899
map perspective and most proprietary

00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:47,960
software vendors tend to focus on a

00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:51,290
generic use case on a use case that

00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:54,560
despise most people and not specifically

00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:58,940
your industry or use use case and so we

00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:01,940
felt that as we waited and waited to get

00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:04,690
our particular features included in

00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:07,400
roadmaps and we were so dependent upon

00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:09,440
certain vendors we felt that we needed

00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:13,100
to take destiny into our own hands

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,980
so about 2005 2006 we started looking at

00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,420
how can we create our own software how

00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,030
can we contribute to open source

00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:22,700
software how can we include some of the

00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:24,410
features specific to our industry in

00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,690
these open source software we started

00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:29,060
working with the Apache foundation we

00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:32,210
started contributing to the HTTP project

00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:35,900
in 2006 and then as you'll see in my

00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:38,390
next slide also between 2006 and 2007

00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:41,510
teen we started working on the x1

00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:43,730
platform which is our new set-top-box

00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:47,000
platform and our streaming media

00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:50,380
platform and our voice remote and and

00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,670
that journey really took us into

00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:55,220
transforming from being dependent upon

00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:57,140
vendors we started initially working

00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,090
with consultants and contractors who

00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:01,280
were supplementing our software

00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:03,050
knowledge to a company that now has

00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,750
thousands and thousands of software

00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:09,220
developers working on our particular

00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:12,140
software platform consuming open-source

00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:14,210
creating original open-source projects

00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:17,810
as well as contributing to some of the

00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:19,550
leading open-source projects so as I

00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:22,070
mentioned the transformation really

00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:24,710
began with creating the x1 operating

00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:27,230
system and that's the operating system

00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:29,740
that sits in our set-top boxes that sit

00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:33,310
in people's homes it also sits in our

00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:37,690
broadband routers it sits on other

00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:41,870
components that belong in consumers

00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:43,640
homes and and we started using the Yocto

00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:47,270
project which is an embedded Linux

00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:49,430
distribution as the base and then that

00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:52,700
also helps us work across the supply

00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:55,190
chain if you will from SOC vendors to

00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:58,160
OEMs to ISVs

00:10:55,190 --> 00:11:00,019
so that we can use a common build system

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,929
if you will and a common way to

00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:04,879
elaborate across that supply chain we

00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:07,069
started launching some of the streaming

00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:09,170
apps and other mobile apps on mobile

00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:11,389
phones and we had to work with the

00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:14,149
Android operating system the iOS

00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:17,299
operating system and we needed to start

00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:20,299
also doing disclosure documents for our

00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:24,290
apps on mobile phones and with the

00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:26,420
broadband but with delivering the

00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:28,339
fastest broadband we had to start

00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,589
getting into cloud we started working

00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:32,899
with the OpenStack foundation started

00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:35,779
working with Cloud Foundry we use a lot

00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:37,999
of kubernetes Prometheus and and any of

00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:41,449
these components that you can think of

00:11:37,999 --> 00:11:46,129
that help us manage this multi-platform

00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:48,949
cloud implementation one of the things I

00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:51,019
noticed was the company had been

00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:55,249
consuming and using open source for a

00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:57,679
long time but it was about 2016 which

00:11:55,249 --> 00:12:00,679
was last year that they realized that

00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:02,239
this was so pervasive throughout the

00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:05,240
company and it was such a business

00:12:02,239 --> 00:12:07,519
imperative throughout the company that

00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,709
we needed to establish an open source

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:13,040
office that allowed the company to

00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:16,269
create a culture of innovation open

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,589
innovation in the company create a brand

00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:22,339
externally to the company that allowed

00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:24,439
us to work in technology forums would

00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:26,660
also help us attract the kind of

00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:28,639
development talent into the company and

00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:30,559
we also needed to change some of our

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,839
development practices compliance

00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:36,949
practices and communication practices

00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:39,170
inside the company that's when the open

00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:41,389
source practice office was started and I

00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:43,459
joined the company in the beginning of

00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:45,649
this year to start that open source

00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:48,529
practice and many companies are doing

00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:51,649
this I have many of my colleagues here

00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:53,929
who are who lead their open-source

00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:57,169
practices in their companies what these

00:12:53,929 --> 00:13:00,290
program offices do I call it six C's

00:12:57,169 --> 00:13:02,689
which is they help communicate inside

00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:05,119
and outside the company as to why open

00:13:02,689 --> 00:13:07,160
source is important inside the company

00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:10,370
how to work with open source what are

00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:13,130
our policies etc and then

00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:14,620
the second is helping developers consume

00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:17,420
and contribute to open source

00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:19,550
successfully there are certain safe ways

00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:22,700
to use open source inside the company

00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:26,450
and there are good ways to use open

00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:29,060
source you know a within projects and so

00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:30,740
we advise customers and our developers

00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:33,250
inside the company on consumption and

00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:35,839
contribution the other big ones are

00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:38,480
collaboration and we strongly feel that

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,520
we cannot do it alone and that we need

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,950
to collaborate with other companies or

00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:45,500
the communities are the foundations in

00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:47,900
how to work in open source and solve

00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:50,270
common problems together so if there's a

00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:53,630
blockchain problem I draw the work in

00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:56,450
the hyper ledger project in order to

00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:59,210
work across technology vendors to

00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:02,000
influence how that problem gets solved

00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:03,950
for my industry and we wanted to create

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,560
competencies inside the company

00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:09,140
developer competencies on working in

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,540
open source it was legal competencies

00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:14,900
its community competencies and that's

00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:17,480
part of my project as well or what I do

00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:19,820
inside the company and the last but very

00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:22,190
very important piece and I know Ibrahim

00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:24,320
we'll cover this later today is

00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:26,779
compliance because open-source comes

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,150
with a lot of privileges it also comes

00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:32,029
with a lot of obligations and so making

00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:34,490
sure that we understood our obligations

00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:37,459
and worked successfully with our legal

00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:39,680
team with our patins team and made sure

00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:41,990
that any contribution was successfully

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,089
approved that we were complying in terms

00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:46,550
of any products that we ship to our

00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:48,830
customers and that we were knowledgeable

00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:52,959
about how to use open source inside the

00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:56,240
company was a big part of my job and

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:58,190
many companies come into open source and

00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,000
come in to starting an open source

00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:04,910
office for various reasons one of the

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,250
first ones is compliance I think the

00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:09,410
legal team tends to discover that the

00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:12,140
company is using open source and they

00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:14,779
immediately start saying we need to have

00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:17,330
an open source Advisory Council we need

00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:19,910
to have guidelines we need to have

00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:21,690
compliance around open source and that's

00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:23,820
one of the drivers that

00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:25,920
that starts an open-source office inside

00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,810
a company and the lawyers get

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,210
overwhelmed with the amount of open

00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:31,860
source they need to do and the number of

00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:34,140
requests they're getting directly from

00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,690
developers and an open source office

00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:39,600
acts as an advocate if you will between

00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:42,270
lawyers and developers the second thing

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,070
is as we discovered open source becomes

00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:46,860
very critical to the company you start

00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:50,100
realizing you have dependencies on so

00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,960
many many key open source projects and

00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,540
if you're not engaged with those

00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:57,600
projects the project could one day go

00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:59,460
away or the project could be led by

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,120
someone who's in a competitive industry

00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:04,770
or a competitive company and it could go

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,770
a different direction than what you're

00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:09,390
depending upon that project to go so you

00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:11,070
need to make sure you sustain those

00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:13,350
projects through being present and

00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:16,680
through contribution but also through

00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:19,950
any kind of direction that you want to

00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,660
add to that project the third very very

00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:25,140
important reason that we're discovering

00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:27,930
is Comcast is not known as a technology

00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:30,330
company or as an open source friendly

00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:33,120
company at least it wasn't and so how do

00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:35,010
I attract the best developers into the

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,950
company how do I attract the best

00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:40,430
kubernetes developers if I'm competing

00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:42,930
with Google or I'm competing with

00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:45,720
Facebook or other you know known

00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:47,760
technology brands if you will and so it

00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:51,410
was important for us to communicate that

00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:54,000
to the world and and we had outgrown our

00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:56,250
compliance processes our development

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,290
processes inside the company and we

00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:00,780
needed a process that could scale across

00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:03,180
the company and having a focused

00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:05,430
open-source office allowed us to help

00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:08,069
scale that process across the companies

00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:10,319
and last but not the least it really is

00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:12,810
about culture change as many speakers

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:17,250
talked about today and so how do you

00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:19,949
create change in the executive arena how

00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:21,689
do you change culture in the legal team

00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:24,300
and the patent team how do you change

00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:26,760
culture among developers in the business

00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:28,620
it involves a lot of culture change

00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,929
across the company a lot of

00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,860
communication across the company and

00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:36,940
that's a huge part of

00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:39,070
my role inside the company so one of the

00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:43,029
first philosophies we adopted when we

00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:45,610
did this was not to be an end-of-line

00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:47,289
inspection for open-source where

00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:49,510
developers would do all their work and

00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:51,190
then they'd come to us and say hey can

00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:54,250
you bless this and make sure that this

00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:56,649
is open-source ready I've complied with

00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:59,730
everything and and it's okay to go

00:17:56,649 --> 00:18:02,620
instead we said no we need to educate

00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:04,659
create awareness create culture change

00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:07,179
among the developers so that they do the

00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:09,700
right thing in their workflow in their

00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:12,970
process and not be the end-of-line

00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:16,090
inspection so we've really spent a lot

00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:18,279
of time as an open-source office with

00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:20,139
different engineering teams we meet with

00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:22,840
one or two engineering teams every week

00:18:20,139 --> 00:18:24,880
to really talk to them about what

00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:27,519
open-source do you use what are your

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:30,130
dependencies how are you complying with

00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:32,769
open-source and we help them build it

00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:36,789
into their workflow rather than become

00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:39,399
this end of line inspection the other

00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:42,399
thing is we collaborate very very

00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:45,399
closely with our security team inside

00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:48,549
Comcast as with sorry as with the

00:18:45,399 --> 00:18:52,059
financial industry we are also the

00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:54,610
keepers of very safe information from

00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:56,799
our consumers and it's important to

00:18:54,610 --> 00:19:00,220
protect that information it's protect a

00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:03,309
lot of privacy is an important element

00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:05,799
and also customers depend upon us for

00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:07,899
their broadband and we cannot let them

00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:10,690
down from reliability and security

00:19:07,899 --> 00:19:13,000
perspective so we work very very hard in

00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:15,100
the open source process to work with the

00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,019
security teams to make sure that

00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,480
security and open source goes

00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:22,539
hand-in-hand through the process of

00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,610
workflow but also in our contributions

00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:28,269
to make sure that the security team is

00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:30,010
with us when we open sourced something

00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:31,899
that it's secure it's gone through an

00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:36,760
audit and it's gone through an open

00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:40,029
source audit one of the areas that

00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:43,120
became very very crucial as I mentioned

00:19:40,029 --> 00:19:45,090
before is you start auditing your

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,800
company and you start realizing

00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:48,990
that there are some very crucial

00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:52,800
software's that you're dependent upon as

00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:55,560
a company and we decided to very

00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:58,800
purposefully work on community building

00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:01,230
aligned with our dependencies so

00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:03,990
essentially if I'm very dependent upon

00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:06,590
OpenStack as a community for example for

00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:09,300
my cloud if I'm very dependent upon

00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:11,910
kubernetes or if I'm dependent upon

00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:13,860
Yocto it became important that our

00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,930
community strategy matched our

00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:17,640
dependency strategy and this is

00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:20,730
something that I learned from Ibrahim as

00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:24,090
well they do it very very well we're at

00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:27,090
Samsung and so we started kind of saying

00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:29,790
look if these communities are such an

00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:31,260
important part of what we do then we

00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:33,960
need to make sure we are present in

00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:37,970
those communities we are sponsorship

00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:40,680
budget our developers our presence our

00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:42,930
evangelization supports the communities

00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:45,300
we work with and that's really what we

00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:46,800
also did with the Apache foundation we

00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:50,070
found that we were using a tremendous

00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,670
number of Apache components inside the

00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:53,850
company

00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:55,770
Cassandra Hadoop etc and we have an

00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:57,810
Apache incubation project and we

00:20:55,770 --> 00:21:01,290
realized that we needed to match our

00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:03,570
support for Apache to the dependency

00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:05,520
that we have and the consumption on

00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:09,240
Apache and we wanted to be part of those

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:13,350
communities as I mentioned recruiting

00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:15,420
talent has become a very key war that

00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:17,750
all of us are involved in right we're

00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:20,760
all looking for some great talent and

00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:23,250
from a talent perspective it's it's a

00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:26,520
number of things it's your brand as a

00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:29,790
company needs to match an innovation

00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:32,040
brand more developers than ever want to

00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:34,350
know what kind of projects are you guys

00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,900
involved in so when you're open source a

00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:38,670
project then developers actually get to

00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:41,010
be involved in those projects look at

00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:43,530
those projects know the cool work that

00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:45,560
you're doing and that often attracts a

00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:47,910
lot of developers into the company

00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,480
knowing that this is the kind of work

00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:50,970
you're doing

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,400
often in proprietary situations they

00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:55,560
absolutely know know the kind of work

00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,330
that you do so it's hard for them to get

00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,309
involved in your company

00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:02,039
frankly a lot of developers are also

00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:04,139
saying to us what did what is your open

00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:06,419
source policy can I contribute to open

00:22:04,139 --> 00:22:08,190
source if I'm part of your company do

00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:10,440
you make it easy for me to work with

00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:12,480
open source communities and I'm already

00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,389
working on this community can I bring it

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,330
into the company and so that becomes

00:22:15,389 --> 00:22:21,179
almost a litmus test to joining a

00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:24,720
company these days when you are

00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:26,879
recruiting and so we often work hand in

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,179
hand with our talent acquisition team to

00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:32,279
make sure that we are both showcasing

00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:35,100
some of the cool work we're doing our

00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:38,720
policies and open source our presence in

00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:41,749
communities with our development as well

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,730
this is our portal that we created

00:22:41,749 --> 00:22:47,220
basically to showcase all of our project

00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:50,369
work and also to showcase any open

00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:52,379
source opportunities that we have also

00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:55,649
any investment we do in open source

00:22:52,379 --> 00:22:57,809
communities and and to be an really

00:22:55,649 --> 00:23:00,570
simple and easy way for people to

00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:04,009
contact us as a company should there be

00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:07,259
an issue should there be any kind of

00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:10,200
compliance or other opportunities that

00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:12,710
people want to communicate to us on so I

00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:15,359
just want to wrap up and say that

00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:17,850
digital transformation really includes

00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:20,970
or involves a cultural transformation

00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:24,359
and we are on that journey we started in

00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:26,190
2006 and then with the installation of

00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:29,609
the open source office we're taking it

00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:32,039
and scaling it across the company and it

00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:34,889
allows us to be innovative it allows us

00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:37,139
to be reliable and secure and deliver

00:23:34,889 --> 00:23:40,169
solutions to our customers in a much

00:23:37,139 --> 00:23:43,649
more innovative way and collaborative

00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:47,220
way so thank you so much for listening

00:23:43,649 --> 00:23:50,070
to our story and you can always follow

00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:52,580
