thank you so much Karen koppenhaver I'll

00:00:07,149 --> 00:00:18,550
leave you to death I there are so many

00:00:13,389 --> 00:00:20,710
things that you just said that freesias

00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,390
to what I want to say but I'm going back

00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:25,360
to appease 301

00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:27,190
I'm 101 I am a lawyer I have been

00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,950
working in the technology industry since

00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:32,649
1979 when I was with IBM I've been doing

00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,700
open-source since about 1996 and I've

00:00:32,649 --> 00:00:37,720
been working with a Linux Foundation

00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:40,120
since 2006 and it has been a wonderful

00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:42,250
ride and what I was asked to come today

00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,810
and tell you a little bit about is what

00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,740
we've learned along the way and to do

00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:51,450
that very quickly but the first thing

00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:53,680
we'll see we may have a little problem

00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,570
but the first thing I want to start with

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,810
is just this word enlightened

00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:01,270
self-interest and you know I'm a girl

00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:03,190
have to say I'm a girl when I talk about

00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:05,079
the fact that I'm an open-source many

00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:07,299
people like to conclude that that's

00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:10,210
because I like things that are very

00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:13,240
kumbaya moment you know this is open

00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:15,340
source it's about being nice generous

00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,350
it's it's a wonderful thing to do and

00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:20,109
sometimes that is the reason to do it

00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:23,079
but for people who haven't been through

00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:25,840
the process that most of you have been

00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:28,630
in they have to realize that this is

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,030
about in life there we go so that was so

00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:33,490
I wanted to make that that first piece

00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:35,829
we're talking here about enlightened

00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:38,639
self-interest why companies do this is

00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:42,880
because it is in their best interest

00:01:38,639 --> 00:01:44,950
so the LF is for the Linux Foundation is

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:50,170
this corporate collaboration but it's a

00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:53,340
very rich tech ecosystem all these

00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:58,060
numbers are pretty amazing

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:59,799
yes hunt 80% of the Fortune 100 tech and

00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:03,340
telecom and we have a hundred

00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:05,679
open-source projects so here's the

00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,479
growth in Linux Foundation open source

00:02:05,679 --> 00:02:09,280
projects you know we started out and

00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:09,819
we're down at zero because we didn't

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,219
grow B

00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:15,010
because we had Linux but what we were

00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:17,469
doing when we were building Linux in all

00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:20,439
those early years is allowing that to

00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:21,519
the developers to figure out how this

00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:25,060
should work

00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:29,319
and when Linux became so successful and

00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:32,530
it is amazingly successful people said I

00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:36,549
want to build this the way you built

00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:38,620
that I want to learn from all the things

00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:41,139
that went right and all the things that

00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,510
those developers figured out to figure

00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:45,730
out how to build this next generation of

00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:49,239
technology and look at that look at that

00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:51,699
take off a hundred projects that have

00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:53,680
come now I want to go way back in time

00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:56,739
because somebody in the beginning

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,780
actually made this leap and there

00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:00,879
probably were people across the industry

00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:04,540
but one of the big leaps that occurred

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:06,159
was in the IBM executive suite and if

00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,829
you haven't heard this story it's sort

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,180
of an interesting one so at that at this

00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:12,250
point in time I want to take a little

00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,079
bit of a context for something else that

00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,209
was going on there was a wonderful

00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:18,129
wonder professor at a Harvard Business

00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:22,569
School named CK Prahalad

00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:24,729
and he was teaching and it was the

00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:26,470
person that was published and spoke the

00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:28,810
most often from that school at the time

00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:31,540
and he was teaching this idea of do you

00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:33,790
know why your your customers buy your

00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:36,340
products do you know what they actually

00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:38,500
pay you for what are your

00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,509
differentiators because there's a large

00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,209
part of your product that your customers

00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:45,549
don't actually care about and then

00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:49,030
there's a differentiator that makes them

00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:51,729
decide to buy from you do you know what

00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:54,099
that is and are you putting your

00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:56,409
resources and your talents behind that

00:03:54,099 --> 00:04:00,009
thing that your customer cares about

00:03:56,409 --> 00:04:02,259
right it seems pretty obvious the

00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:04,060
example that that was a sort of a joke

00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:06,099
at the time was the car there were these

00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,079
two cars very similar coming from

00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:10,989
Germany they came to the United States

00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:13,359
one was very successful why not so much

00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:15,099
so the other one was very successful in

00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:20,739
Europe you know what the difference was

00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:21,820
there was a cupholder united states they

00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:22,560
didn't want to buy a car that didn't

00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,180
have a couple

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:29,500
you know what was the differentiator

00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:31,780
it's a cupholder what what they were

00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,300
talking about at the time was what is

00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:36,250
your core infrastructure you know what

00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,139
is your core in four sections so a

00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,690
fellow named Irving wall danske Berger

00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:43,389
walked into the room and had one slide

00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:45,430
one at that time we called them foils

00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:48,400
overhead he put it up and he talked

00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:51,159
about it for four hours in front of the

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,610
executives and he showed them a suite of

00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:57,009
operating systems there were 37 that IBM

00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:59,530
supported at the time operating systems

00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:01,900
are very hard to build particularly then

00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:05,139
the resources that knew how to build an

00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:07,720
operating system were very rare IBM had

00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:09,639
many of their developers focused on

00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,830
building these operating systems and

00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:15,190
there were 37 different operating

00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:17,800
systems what he wanted to say is if you

00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:20,979
built one and you built it with

00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,409
everybody else here's the thing that you

00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:26,919
could focus your resources on because do

00:05:23,409 --> 00:05:29,919
you know what your customers don't care

00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:31,840
about the operating system and they

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,150
don't particularly want to pay you for

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,789
it the customers care about the

00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:38,949
solutions that come on top but you have

00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:41,889
your best in your brightest devoted of

00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:44,020
building those operating systems what

00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:46,330
could you do if you had an external

00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:48,789
development force that was helping you

00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:51,669
build and maintain and extend that

00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:55,719
operating system and what could you do

00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:58,300
if you had one if you had one and here's

00:05:55,719 --> 00:06:00,330
what's amazing is he had on the chart he

00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:05,319
had something called pervasive computing

00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:07,180
this was 1999 nobody knew about cell

00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:08,979
phones at that time he said pervasive

00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:11,080
computing all the way up to

00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:13,930
supercomputers what could you do if you

00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:16,300
had one and at that time that was sort

00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:18,279
of a ridiculous statement if you look if

00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,229
I could bring you my charts about Linux

00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:22,479
you would know that 97% of the

00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:24,430
supercomputers are now Linux and a large

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:27,039
percentage of your cell phones are

00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:30,880
running Linux as well and everything in

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:33,070
between so that focus on what is the

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,849
core infrastructure and what are your

00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:37,520
differentiators was a big

00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:39,439
piece of devoting resources to Linux now

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,599
there also is a story about the Apache

00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,639
web server where IBM at the same time

00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:45,709
was developing a web server brian

00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:48,139
behlendorf was really one of the unsung

00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:50,089
heroes of the of the computer industry

00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:52,819
was you know was building this little

00:06:50,089 --> 00:06:55,639
thing called Apache and IBM had spent an

00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:57,469
enormous amount researching their web

00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:59,479
server and at one point they looked up

00:06:57,469 --> 00:07:01,550
and said can we go look at what what the

00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:03,379
kids are building and they found out it

00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,629
was better it wasn't a little better it

00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:10,459
was a lot better and that became Apache

00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:12,649
so these same dynamics operate across

00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:14,479
different industries but executives who

00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:17,569
have never been through the process of

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:19,490
understanding this are cut when you come

00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:21,619
in often do think you're looking for the

00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,990
kumbaya moment and what you have to do

00:07:21,619 --> 00:07:25,849
exactly as we've just heard is to turn

00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:28,369
it into a discussion of enlightened

00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:31,639
self-interest the other thing that I

00:07:28,369 --> 00:07:34,699
want to talk about is is is that the

00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,800
security and the safety comes from the

00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:39,409
shared vulnerability this is very

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,839
important is when you have a lot of

00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:44,839
companies all dependent upon the same

00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:47,629
base all of those companies have some

00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:50,719
sense of assurance that if anything goes

00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:53,329
wrong that all of those companies are at

00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:55,219
risk all of those companies resources

00:07:53,329 --> 00:07:58,249
are going to be available to make sure

00:07:55,219 --> 00:08:00,139
that whatever it is gets fixed it isn't

00:07:58,249 --> 00:08:02,629
a question of the license the license

00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:04,729
can be important mildly interesting the

00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:07,069
community around the code and the

00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:09,619
resources that are backing it up is what

00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:11,929
makes it important is what makes it

00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:15,279
commercially reasonable is what makes it

00:08:11,929 --> 00:08:17,899
long-term viable so it's that shared

00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:20,029
dependability the other thing I want to

00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:22,219
tell you about is a story I got from a

00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:24,319
developer which helps me understand open

00:08:22,219 --> 00:08:26,209
source a lot you know we originally

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,099
thought of these developers as you know

00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:29,719
these these guys eating pizza in the

00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:31,490
basement which I've always said is so

00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:34,039
silly because the most organized people

00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:36,500
on earth are developers I mean you know

00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,909
they're not they're not chaotic but we

00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,009
were thinking about these people you

00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:42,050
know they went to work all day and then

00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:44,360
they went home at night right and they

00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:46,610
would code and people say why

00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,680
you do that why did it make any sense

00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,720
for you to code at night and one

00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,209
developer said to me no no you don't

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,089
understand what didn't make any sense is

00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:58,700
what I was doing doing during the day

00:08:56,089 --> 00:09:01,130
because you see during the day I had

00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,690
somebody come in from marketing and tell

00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:04,240
me here's what we're going to develop

00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:08,390
and we're going to release it on Tuesday

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:10,100
and I'd say oh that's a stupid idea

00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:12,200
first of all it doesn't work like that

00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,570
and second of all if we'd release it on

00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,890
Tuesday it's gonna be garbage so no no

00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,740
we got a tradeshow we got to release it

00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:20,959
on Tuesday so we spend our time writing

00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:23,060
and releasing this code that's full of

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,220
bugs he said how else do you think we

00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:27,680
convinced an entire industry the

00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:31,190
releasing code full of bugs was normal

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,680
and necessary now at night I got to go

00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:36,620
home and pick a problem that I thought

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,769
was really challenging and work on it

00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:42,140
and work on it hard until I was really

00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:46,550
proud of it and then submit it to a

00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:49,040
community that would accept it and value

00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:51,320
it and appreciate the work that went

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,320
into it now what doesn't make sense

00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,899
about that you see the most important

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,160
thing that we need to learn about

00:09:55,899 --> 00:10:00,589
open-source communities from my point of

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,320
view is that they took the developers

00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:05,660
these rare and wonderful individuals in

00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,279
all fields not just software who

00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:10,640
actually understand how these

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:13,510
technologies work and we put them back

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:16,070
in the driver's seat we're all

00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:18,529
incredibly not only indebted but

00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:21,589
vulnerable to those very few people

00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:23,930
around the globe who understand how the

00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:27,199
technologies that we're all dependent

00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:29,750
upon actually work and one of the things

00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:32,360
that you're all involved in is creating

00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:34,519
an architecture of participation where

00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,579
the places where those people reside

00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:41,829
which are corporations are learning how

00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:45,320
to come together to defend us and then

00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:47,510
their technologies and us as citizens as

00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:50,810
global citizens it is not a small thing

00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:53,899
it is an important thing when you think

00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:55,850
about that where are these technical

00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:58,220
resources to respond to critical

00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:00,440
situations there in your company

00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,540
there in other companies companies need

00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,730
to know how to make them available when

00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:06,680
they're needed to defend these platforms

00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,620
that we're all dependent upon thank you

00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:13,350
very much

00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:13,350
[Applause]

00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:20,339
