the next speaker that I want to bring on

00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:14,420
stage is amber bull day from JPMorgan

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,880
she's gonna talk about how blockchain is

00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:24,919
becoming a sexist story at JPMorgan so

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:27,320
thank you for being here amber there we

00:00:24,919 --> 00:00:28,849
go good morning I want to reserve one of

00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:33,230
the super position shirts in the ladies

00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:35,289
small please so hi my name is Amber ball

00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,250
day and I lead I need the clicky

00:00:35,289 --> 00:00:41,269
blockchain product and strategy at

00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:43,309
JPMorgan and I have not very much time

00:00:41,269 --> 00:00:45,589
today to tell you about very very many

00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:48,199
things but one thing I can tell you the

00:00:45,589 --> 00:00:49,879
tag off of what Worley was saying so

00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:53,059
blockchain is kind of the exact opposite

00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:54,260
thing from quantum computing so instead

00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:55,789
of dealing with anything that's

00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,749
probabilistic what we're trying to deal

00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:58,730
with is something that is incredibly

00:00:56,749 --> 00:01:00,769
deterministic you want to get the same

00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,179
thing over and over and over you want to

00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,920
get a lot of people to get the same

00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:06,350
thing over and over you want an

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,000
immutable audit log of something that is

00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:11,990
incredibly consistent and it is

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,600
relatively slow at the same time we're

00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:16,939
looking at using this across finance to

00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,310
solve problems instead of talking about

00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:20,960
quantum computing adding all this new

00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:24,619
kind of secret sauce to the way that you

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,390
are generating alpha in in trading we're

00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:27,890
looking at right now and how you perform

00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:30,920
post trade settlements in a very

00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:32,210
consistent kind of way I will continue

00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,219
clicking the button until we see what

00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:35,090
happens who wants to take the clicky and

00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:41,479
then make it happen

00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:42,979
cool thanks I delegate so I don't have

00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:45,289
that much time to tell you about what

00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:46,460
blockchain is and how we're using it so

00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:49,880
much is what I'm going to talk to you

00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:51,590
about today is how JPMorgan released a

00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,659
blockchain platform and how it's

00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,609
becoming a bit of a success story for us

00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:57,770
and hopefully not just us but for the

00:01:55,609 --> 00:01:59,929
industry and hopefully even beyond that

00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:03,289
specific industry

00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:05,840
so I guess rewind two years ago and you

00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:08,840
probably first heard about blockchain as

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,340
a but I don't have the clicky in my hand

00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,070
anymore there we go there's no such

00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:15,270
thing as the blockchain okay tada thank

00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:17,520
you

00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,770
so the first thing there we go there's

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,200
no such thing as the blockchain

00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:23,550
mind-blown right so this is uh this is

00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,230
something I harp on right now when

00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,690
everybody says oh we're gonna put it on

00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:31,080
the blockchain there is no such thing as

00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:33,300
blockchain however there are lots of

00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,940
different block chains and they are all

00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,290
architected very differently some people

00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,320
now say oh we're not using a blockchain

00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,850
we're using a distributed ledger some of

00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,110
these block chains are public some of

00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,240
them are meant to run in a permissions

00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,070
environment but there are very real

00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,800
differences between them and so if you

00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:52,710
were wind about two years when JP Morgan

00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,020
was looking at various block chains that

00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:56,430
were available we said none of these

00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,980
really meet our business requirements

00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,440
and this hearing comes to the first part

00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,600
of where you get involved in building a

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,210
project or you know rolling your own as

00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,530
someone would often call it right and

00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,850
that's because what you find in the

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:12,540
marketplace doesn't meet your specific

00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:13,740
needs this is where the industry and in

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,910
this case I'm talking about the finance

00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:17,040
industry but you could apply this

00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:19,350
broadly to any industry really is

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,170
incentivized to get involved in building

00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,430
platforms collaboratively that's because

00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:25,380
we understand our own business

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,850
requirements and as threatened as we

00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,760
want to be by what's happening out in

00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:31,440
the startup space or with tech vendors

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,150
that want to you know solve all of your

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,010
problems for you and promise you the

00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,810
moon the people that really understand

00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:39,360
your day to day business problems are

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,460
probably you so when we look at

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,900
distributed Ledger's and we say cool you

00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,360
have anonymous participants in

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,310
completely visible transactions well

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,770
that doesn't mean really any financial

00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,540
regulatory requirements right so we want

00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:53,130
to have a blockchain that has known

00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,960
participants but with completely

00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:57,090
confidential transactions and

00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,010
confidential information so that was

00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,000
where we started and then we said well

00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,680
wouldn't it be great if there was

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,420
something out there already that we

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,130
could tag off of and it turned out that

00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,080
there was an open source project called

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:09,030
aetherium we were able to fork that and

00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,950
start seeing if we could solve some of

00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,080
the challenges there and if we had not

00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,250
been able to address them as there are

00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,049
certainly others who had looked at

00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,640
aetherium earlier and tried to do the

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:19,799
same thing I probably wouldn't be

00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:22,020
standing here so all kudos to some

00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:24,900
wonderful engineers who helped figure it

00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:27,370
out so different architectures very

00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,990
different experiences and

00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,340
this is what I mean I say there's

00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:33,460
absolutely no such thing as the

00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,990
blockchain moving forward so with quorum

00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,780
what are we trying to do we're trying to

00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,949
take a distributed ledger or it really

00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,660
is a blockchain it's not just a

00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:42,639
distributed ledger but we want to be

00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,860
able to provide an opportunity to have

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,010
real world governance on top of that so

00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:50,530
the idea that code is law is really

00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:52,210
really fascinating it's extra

00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:53,979
fascinating if you accidentally lock up

00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,350
ninety million of your own dollars in

00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:57,310
your own smart contract as may or may

00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:00,340
not have happened on the public

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,289
blockchain yesterday but in general when

00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:04,270
people say blockchain is just a database

00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:06,280
I challenge anybody to think of a time

00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,960
when previously a database kind of

00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,340
production roll that happened wherein

00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,289
somebody lost a bunch of their own money

00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,820
and could not get it back right there's

00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:14,830
always a way to rollback there's always

00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,419
a higher authority to appeal to there's

00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,350
always a way there's someone who holds

00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:19,240
the liability

00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:21,250
there's even possibly someone to sue if

00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,510
something goes awry so the first thing

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,610
that we need if we're going to move real

00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:27,160
core banking systems onto a distributed

00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:29,440
ledger world is a way to fold in with

00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,080
our existing legal and regulatory

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,120
frameworks that doesn't necessarily mean

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,919
that you have a centralized entity that

00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,960
says this is what's real and this is

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,180
isn't what's real it simply means that

00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,320
there's somewhere to appeal and possibly

00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,139
if you're talking about a permission

00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,970
network so a network of non participants

00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:47,200
other banks and/or counterparties or

00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,300
supply chain or whoever you're working

00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,840
with that there's somebody who says who

00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,770
should be in and who should be out okay

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,870
confidentiality I already mentioned we

00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,940
really can't do business we have a

00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:00,250
fiduciary obligation to keep client data

00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,900
private you simply can't be broadcasting

00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,400
out Twitter for your bank account which

00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,349
is what something like Bitcoin becomes

00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,169
when wallets are D anonymized and

00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:10,449
finally security so we're not assuming

00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:11,889
trust between participants sometimes you

00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:13,510
hear the phrase trust but verify

00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:16,050
especially with relation relation to

00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:18,729
open source code I would say don't trust

00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:20,680
verify right we do not trust our

00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:22,330
counterparties if we did we wouldn't be

00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,960
doing all this blockchain mumbo-jumbo in

00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:27,550
the first place okay so as God mentioned

00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,430
in his initial keynote blockchain is

00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:31,630
perfect for open source why is that well

00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:33,220
the first three bullets that you see

00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:35,469
here I think apply to almost any

00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,780
software project you want to foster

00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:39,729
community innovation and acceleration so

00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,840
you want to bring people together you

00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:43,300
want to allow different

00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:45,820
vendors to implement and approach the

00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:48,310
problem in different ways and you want

00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:50,560
to foster a diversity of approaches let

00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:52,690
people solve things in different kind of

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,010
branches let's see what works and then

00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:57,430
pull back together the various

00:06:54,010 --> 00:07:00,370
successful outcomes the last three I

00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:02,260
think broadly apply to general software

00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:04,360
but also when you talk about distributed

00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:07,030
ledger or blockchain systems they become

00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,620
really really prescient so especially in

00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:11,949
banking the first is access to a

00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:14,190
developer pool beyond just employees now

00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:17,320
when I was trying to initially sell

00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:20,229
releasing a GPL code base to senior

00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:21,610
management at JP Morgan which is the

00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:24,100
first time such a thing has ever been

00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:27,310
done quorum is our first project that

00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:29,530
has a github presence they were really

00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:31,900
enamored with this idea of like free

00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:33,610
labor so that was great

00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,440
the more developers that you can get to

00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:37,570
contribute the more free resources you

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,210
have we can talk about how that becomes

00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:42,210
a challenge in a minute but what's more

00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:45,130
important I think is the type of

00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:46,750
developer resources that you get to come

00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:48,220
work with you especially when you're

00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,289
talking about something like blockchain

00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,940
you might get people who don't

00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:53,740
necessarily want to work full-time at a

00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,150
bank you might get people that want to

00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,610
burn the banking infrastructure to the

00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:59,080
ground they happen to be the best SMEs

00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,840
on how to build a blockchain right now

00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:05,139
so how do you get these people excited

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,389
to want to work with you I've spent

00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:09,669
about two years doing that and we've had

00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:12,370
a lot of success so on quorum which is

00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:14,080
the the blockchain that I was mentioned

00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:16,090
before this is the one we released for

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,120
example we partnered with the Z cash

00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:21,220
foundation or the Z cash company to

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,260
implement the world's first zero

00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:25,030
knowledge settlement layer on top of an

00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:28,270
enterprise blockchain it's completely

00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:29,229
open-source it's on our github and for

00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:31,000
those of you who aren't familiar with

00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:32,620
what zero knowledge proof SAR it's a

00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,440
mathematical way for two parties to

00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:37,479
prove something absolutely objectively

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,070
happen to a third party without that

00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:42,430
third party knowing either of those two

00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:43,750
inputs it's kind of interesting to talk

00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:45,100
right after quantum computing because

00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,380
again it's kind of the opposite of that

00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,089
thing but what we're doing is is we're

00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,640
providing mathematical proofs that

00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:53,560
follow information through its lifecycle

00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:56,020
right so the more provable

00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,420
things become the less you have to rely

00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,470
on trusting and intermediary

00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:03,790
historically those intermediaries have

00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:05,650
been banks so to keep going here we want

00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:08,800
fully auditable code because that builds

00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:11,440
systemic trust by auditable code I mean

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,810
open source code when you start talking

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,360
about something like mathematical proofs

00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:17,890
it would be really good if other people

00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,200
can look at them and prove that they

00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,730
function as designed especially when you

00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,950
talk about things that rely heavily on

00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:26,290
cryptography or crypto primitives you

00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:28,990
really really want to make sure that the

00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:30,520
system's function as designed I think at

00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:32,440
their heart black chains are really an

00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,870
information security product and the

00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,029
more open-source information security

00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:40,960
products can be the more we can again

00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:42,880
not trust them but verify them so for

00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,980
distributed ledger it just absolutely

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,540
makes sense from the beginning that if

00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:49,000
you're going to want to trust this kind

00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:52,060
of a system don't trust it have someone

00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
audit the code and then you can begin

00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,680
using the system without having to you

00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,140
know place inherent trust in how the

00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:03,190
tech works and finally monetization of

00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:04,900
applications not protocols so like this

00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:08,020
is akin to give away the operating

00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:10,930
system charge for the apps okay so at

00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:13,690
JPMorgan are we going to try to monetize

00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:15,880
a the blockchain no I think that's kind

00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:18,220
of silly right it is kind of like that

00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:21,010
ecosystem platform thing the more people

00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:23,490
that use the ecosystem the more you can

00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:26,920
release products into that ecosystem

00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:29,470
that are you know commercial products

00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:31,089
the the generate revenue no when it

00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:33,460
comes to something like quorum it's an

00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:36,010
it's a it's a general platform just like

00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:38,560
the etherium blockchain in that it's

00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:40,270
really just a distributed decentralized

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,550
virtual machine you can put anything on

00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:44,500
top of that right now we're focusing on

00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:48,070
building financial applications but for

00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:50,050
example Genentech and Pfizer picked up

00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:53,529
the same platform and they built a drug

00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:55,480
provenance tracking mechanism on it with

00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:56,860
a startup called chronicled that was

00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,720
really cool we found out about it in the

00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:01,150
press right so that's how you start to

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,580
know that your ideas are catching on so

00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:05,920
it takes it takes a village to build an

00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,769
open-source community I think we already

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,459
asked how many people

00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:11,839
your work for actual like a tech company

00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:14,209
okay show of hands who works for a tech

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,040
tech company okay now who works for a

00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:20,149
non tech company whose CEO has said

00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:23,089
you're now a tech company awesome okay

00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:26,540
so many many hands right well unless you

00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:28,670
really have unless you really have

00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,980
somebody who picks up the phone and does

00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:33,319
customer support for platforms that you

00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,279
are supporting and goes out and makes

00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:37,489
sure that your stuff is getting

00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:39,529
certified on various Linux distros and

00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:41,149
is available in hazard and all these

00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:43,429
other things you kind of aren't

00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:45,619
necessarily running a core tech platform

00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:48,439
product it is hard and it takes a lot of

00:11:45,619 --> 00:11:50,269
work and in that sense it's really hard

00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:53,299
to run an open-source project from

00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:54,709
within a bank or any corporate really

00:11:53,299 --> 00:11:56,449
because what a corporates care about

00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:58,459
their bottom line so what does a

00:11:56,449 --> 00:12:01,689
successful open source project looks

00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:03,920
like well definitely there's a diverse

00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:05,929
membership or a diverse community that's

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,420
contributing code so it's not just

00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:10,009
coming from one entity you can open

00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,629
source code all you want it doesn't have

00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:13,459
to be good you know and it doesn't have

00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:14,959
to be well supported you can just put it

00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:16,220
out there and then have your own

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,139
employees work on it and say

00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:20,240
congratulations you know we have an open

00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:22,339
source project but what you really need

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,049
to be doing is pulling in people from

00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:25,699
around the world that see their own

00:12:24,049 --> 00:12:27,829
incentive and why they want to

00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:29,869
contribute and you get some cool stuff

00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:32,149
out of that so for example this slide is

00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:34,399
from the recent aetherium Developers

00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:37,429
Conference which was held in Cancun as

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,110
another benefit of having open source

00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:42,649
projects your dev team gets to go hang

00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:44,029
out in Cancun and the company who

00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:45,920
presented this was called ami their

00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:47,509
startup out of Taiwan so this is their

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,129
slide I didn't tell them to put JP

00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:51,499
Morgan as cool for a bank on it they did

00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:53,419
that all of their own accord and it's

00:12:51,499 --> 00:12:55,279
that's what we we really want right

00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:56,779
that's what we want out of this if open

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,369
source is a recruiting tool for people

00:12:56,779 --> 00:13:01,189
who don't necessarily want to work for a

00:12:58,369 --> 00:13:03,589
bank when they spontaneously say well JP

00:13:01,189 --> 00:13:05,419
Morgan's cool for a bank or people tweet

00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:08,449
at me like I don't hate JP Morgan

00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:11,209
anymore this is this is like a win this

00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:14,629
is a huge win for for both the company

00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:16,129
and the community and the industry but

00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:17,899
they won't do that it's not just about

00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,759
winning hearts and minds you need to

00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:20,089
have people who want to use or bury the

00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:21,050
plat

00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:22,550
for him because they're going to get

00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,959
something out of it they can build

00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:25,730
something on it that they want to

00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:27,470
monetize or they can access their

00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:29,600
consumers better right

00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:30,680
so blockchain in that way it's a little

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,350
bit different than some other

00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:37,069
open-source projects I think it's closer

00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:39,439
to an open API so if you think about if

00:13:37,069 --> 00:13:41,660
you're a corporate not a tech corporate

00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:44,689
but like a bank for example and you want

00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:46,910
to open-source something the the the

00:13:44,689 --> 00:13:49,279
story that's going to get going to gain

00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:51,199
the most traction is not will people

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:54,079
like us more because we put this generic

00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:56,660
tech out there but it's more like can we

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,490
drive business through this open source

00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:00,680
product that is a really tough question

00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:02,930
to answer so look at Netflix for example

00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,249
they open sourced chaos monkey lets you

00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:06,379
kind of do a whole bunch of network

00:14:04,249 --> 00:14:09,290
resiliency testing does that make people

00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:11,509
watch more movies arguably not right

00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:13,160
with blockchain you put this kind of

00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:15,649
general platform out there what do

00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,240
people build on it marketplaces what are

00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:20,629
those marketplaces need financial

00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:22,220
products all right so as a successful

00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:24,949
open source project what is something

00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:27,079
start to look like for example we have a

00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:29,059
quote from market in here that simply

00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:30,620
says anybody who's not open sourcing

00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:32,899
their software is doing a Mis service

00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:35,300
and you know they also like JPM good

00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:36,860
stuff and then finally Big Pharma

00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,990
turning to blockchain that's the the

00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,339
other projects I just mentioned so

00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:42,439
having people that you didn't

00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:44,329
incentivize you didn't mark it - you

00:14:42,439 --> 00:14:45,649
didn't ask to work with it pick it up

00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:47,689
and use it because it was their best

00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:50,059
choice that means that you're really

00:14:47,689 --> 00:14:52,730
doing something revolutionary but it's a

00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:53,720
challenge within a bank or a highly

00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,579
regulated entity

00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:59,179
I can't run a slack channel for the

00:14:55,579 --> 00:15:00,769
public right that's a problem you know

00:14:59,179 --> 00:15:04,149
you get a central bank that wants to

00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:04,149
make a pull request because they've

00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:11,029
contributors have to get involved it's a

00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,220
challenge so I think specifically within

00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:15,230
banking this has always held us back how

00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:17,089
do we collaborate with our competitors

00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,100
to build a platform that we all benefit

00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:21,519
from a rising tide may lift all boats

00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:25,189
until it looks like some sort of like

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,540
collusion antitrust problem so how do

00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:28,220
you create a pricing model off that

00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,809
right these are challenges and they're

00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,040
things that we need to be aware of and

00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:31,850
kind of find this delicate balance

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,769
that's where

00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:35,750
something like the Symphony foundation

00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:38,569
can really be helpful in providing a

00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:41,240
kind of arm's length or kind of you know

00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:43,250
oversight or collaboration space where

00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:46,069
we all get together and can discuss and

00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:47,839
move forward collectively right and then

00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:50,660
finally like you're not going to get a

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,009
benefit tomorrow necessarily just

00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,350
throwing code out to the world

00:15:52,009 --> 00:15:55,670
is it a long-term hiring play do people

00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:57,350
have to build these apps before the

00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:00,230
platform is worth something it's really

00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:02,060
a much longer-term gain than just can

00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,829
you show me the ROI and getting

00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:06,740
management to want to buy into that

00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:07,910
vision can certainly be challenging and

00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:10,600
I already mentioned the tech support

00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:13,610
questions so many tech support questions

00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:16,670
so you know we balance that you know

00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:17,930
it's a balance between you know what is

00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:20,269
the business get out of it today

00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:21,740
where are you going and making sure that

00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:23,690
you're delivering the right solutions in

00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:26,810
the right time hopefully to address real

00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:29,329
client concerns and here's our long

00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:32,120
journey open source is not simply

00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:34,850
Congrats you drop some code it's can you

00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,170
support it can it grow can it move

00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:39,380
towards being a real enterprise

00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:41,779
production product and where is it going

00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:43,759
to be in five years I think I recently

00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:46,490
read a statistic from a Deloitte white

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:49,160
paper that I want to say it was almost

00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:51,439
90 percent of open source projects or

00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:53,990
initial repos are abandoned within the

00:16:51,439 --> 00:16:55,490
first 24 months right

00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:57,050
you don't want especially if that's a

00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,699
year at a corporate it becomes

00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:00,560
reputational risk you don't want to be

00:16:58,699 --> 00:17:02,089
that right so you have to have a long

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,750
term strategy for how you're going to

00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:08,230
support these projects set up good

00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,230
Thanks

00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:15,670
okay I don't know five times question

00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:17,590
before you before you leave I mean thank

00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:19,810
you so much that was amazing

00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:21,640
you touch both instead of selling it to

00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:23,740
the upper management and sort of some of

00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,170
the actual technical challenges to do

00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:30,220
open sourcing banks which one was the

00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:33,670
most difficult one to solve I definitely

00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:35,950
I think the probably selling it to

00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:37,540
management were difficult right but in

00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:39,850
the same way when we're creating use

00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:42,490
cases or building business applications

00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:44,500
on top of blockchain I say we don't

00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:47,230
build tomorrow's software to today's

00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:49,870
technical limitations because between

00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:51,820
the time for example I know one specific

00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:53,950
use case that comes to mind where when

00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:56,620
we started talking with the lawyers

00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:58,630
about it the the transactional

00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:01,630
throughput time of the system was a

00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:03,250
dozen transactions per second by the

00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:05,080
time and it was it was holding us back

00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:07,750
from wanting to do the project by the

00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:10,120
time the lawyers said yes we should go

00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:12,130
ahead and do this or no we shouldn't we

00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,210
had actually increased the factor of

00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:16,930
throughput through the system by a

00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:19,330
factor of 100 well so it's it's

00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:21,340
definitely the tech will get there it's

00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:23,530
the network coordination problems and

00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:24,970
the the people in the collaboration that

00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:27,400
will hold us as an industry back

00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,620
absolutely Thank You amber thank you so

00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,500
much

00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:31,500
[Applause]

00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:38,870
