00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,639
so

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,440
today before i leave the stage to

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,839
much smarter folks than i am i wanted to

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,440
give you all an update on our community

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,600
and more broadly the state of open

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,240
source and financial services

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,439
and spoiler alert the state of our

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,800
community is as strong as it's ever been

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,880
we've seen a record amount of

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,039
contributions this year

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,800
and i'm glad to report that the vast

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,120
majority of these contributions are

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,680
coming from financial institutions

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,360
something completely unheard of even a

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,920
little over two years ago when we

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,920
started finance

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,000
this is an important milestone for us

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,120
but before we look ahead

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,760
at the opportunities that we think

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,039
this opens up for the industry uh let's

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,640
take a quick trip down

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,440
memory lane in fact

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,480
we started finnos two years ago or even

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,559
further when we

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,559
started the symphonies after foundation

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,400
four years ago

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,560
as i pitched the idea of open source

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,600
collaboration in the industry

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,760
a highly siloed and regulated industry

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,000
let's just say that the reaction was you

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,680
know less than lukewarm

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,159
you know and that's understandable it's

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,479
an industry that not only has to abide

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,200
in strict regulations but that it

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,240
culturally

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,680
can be very competitive not just across

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,840
firm but also within

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,240
firms not only there were several myths

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,079
that uh you know about open source that

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,520
needed to be debunked

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,680
but there were concrete legal technical

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,600
and strategic reason to prevent even

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,159
internal collaboration models like for

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,640
example

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,759
inner source let alone open source

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,720
collaboration across

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,079
firms so that's when we started our open

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,040
source readiness initiative

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,040
which paired uh you know if you pair

00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,719
that with the changing nature of this

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,520
industry and the forces

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,840
that we'll touch upon a little later

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,600
that has delivered major progress in how

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,879
financial services can now

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,720
collaborate through open source

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,080
and since we started we've seen an

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,720
amazing progressions

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,720
i mean just take a look um when we

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,720
started in 2016

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,840
we were focused on collaborating on a

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,560
single platform

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,239
symphony the platform was originally

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,599
born out of an investment

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,760
out of the largest financial

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:31,040
institutions pretty much all the

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,040
polish bracket banks out there

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,040
and based on a contribution from goldman

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,000
sachs their internal collaboration

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,360
platform called

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,560
live current and the idea behind that

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,319
was

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,680
that an open source foundation could be

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,920
the neutral place

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,800
to build an ecosystem on symphony and

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,720
the inherent transparency of open source

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,720
would increase adoption and acceptance

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,760
by other financial institutions

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,440
fintechs and regulators so you see even

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,000
four years ago

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,760
there was a spark of this idea of open

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,120
source collaboration

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,959
but then it was 2017 when

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,120
our platinum member deutsche bank

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,159
contributed plexus

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,440
a battle tested messaging bus used

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:18,319
in the autobahn single dealer platform

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,480
that effectively that was the spark that

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,879
made us realize that maybe

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,680
you know just maybe we could leverage

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,360
the trust

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,720
and the network that we built in our

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,519
community to collaborate

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,640
not just on symphony but to leverage

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,640
open source

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,720
to address really long-standing

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,519
technology challenges and collaboration

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,840
challenges across the industry

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,440
you know and that's when we hosted our

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,400
inaugural ossf

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,239
and there we heard loud and clear the

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,720
message from the industry

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:52,799
over 400 folks validating this idea

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,360
and pushing us to you know expand

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,360
agreement

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,879
and so that's when we launched finos in

00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,720
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,319
the steampunk software foundation became

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,959
venus we added

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,799
amazing representation from other

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,439
financial institutions

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,319
from technology firms and we also

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,439
started seeing

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,320
you know quickly uh the power of this

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,919
collaboration model uh in for example

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,199
standards like fdc3

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:23,199
our interoperability standard moving

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,360
quickly to deliver releases

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,479
this was a really early sign that we

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:32,880
were you know on the right track

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:37,040
but then 2019 was really pivotal for us

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,600
um we received what you know to date

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,560
is still our most stared project on

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,800
github

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,400
um you know perspective this was a

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,960
real-time visualization library

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,199
contributed by jp morgan

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,240
and we continued to bring you know the

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,280
industry along

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,040
with our open source readiness program

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,040
and we culminated the year with the

00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,240
largest ossf to date

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,039
last year um you know everyone i spoke

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,080
with

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:07,520
uh felt a unique energy last year

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,960
of a community being born very much

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,240
looking forward to what we could do

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,720
together

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:17,680
well and then 2020 stroke um

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,000
you know the silver lining is uh this

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,120
has

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,160
actually massively accelerated uh you

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,759
know if you think

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,880
uh how much now firms are comfortable

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,880
uh with remote and distributed teams

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,720
very much you know the open source

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,759
default mode of operation

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,400
um this has really resulted in

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,080
a strong membership growth our project

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,199
portfolio has grown

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,800
uh drastically this year in 2020 with

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,400
contributions from

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:51,039
you know goldman sachs cd jp morgan

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,240
morgan stanley nomura pretty much all of

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,320
our

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,600
platinum members and financial

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,639
institutions are now

00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,199
actively engaged in contributions

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,440
and let's not forget we joined the linux

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,400
foundation this has been an amazing year

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,360
for us

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,520
as we partner with the bigger family the

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,280
larger family of the linux foundation

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,880
which is also by the way helping us

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,880
produce this event today this

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,960
has been an amazing partnership and we

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,120
look forward to what this can bring to

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,840
the industry and beyond over the next

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,840
years

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,360
before we talk about our projects and

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,280

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,600

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,960
been possible without you

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,280
without your support without your

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,160
funding without the sweat equity you put

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,319

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,479
today through the different

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,599
collaboration channels that we have

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:58,000
available at this conference

00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,560
but that's not all today finance is also

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,440
announcing the creation of free

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,879
of the free of charge uh associate

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,039
membership program

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,560
uh it's targeted for non-profits

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,120
industry consortia

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,879
governmental and academic institutions

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,800
and we're actually welcoming our

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,080
inaugural free associate members to

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,000
phoenix

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,560
i'm very proud to announce that air the

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,680
alliance for innovative regulation

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,680
is partnering us

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,240
to involve regulators in our open source

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:32,000
endeavors

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:36,000
um and uh you're gonna hear about it

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
much more tomorrow

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:44,080
um you know from our ceo tasha ellison

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,080
and and the air team uh we're also

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,200
welcoming today the interwork allow

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,880
irons to our community um excuse me

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,800
interwork alliance

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,440
to ensure that our standardization

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,560
efforts can span across the world

00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,519
of decentralized technologies finally

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,360
last but not least we also formalize our

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,279
associate membership with isda the

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,320
international swaps and derivatives

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,000
association

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,920
with whom we already partnered

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,320
throughout 2020

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,440
on the legend pilots formerly known as

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,279
alloy

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,360
to make changes to their common domain

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,440
model and successfully hosted

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,200
uh collaboration on this powerful

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,720
modeling platform

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,959
so what's the common thread here um

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,320
finance and the experience we built is

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,279
now recognized

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,519
as enabler for other institutions for

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,160
other non-profits and consortium in the

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,920
industry

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,680
that are maybe less familiar with open

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,760
source and we think we can help

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,200
accelerate their progress

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,040
you know we're here to help to

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,040
consolidate not to fragment

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,560
now i just mentioned legend um

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,959
and so if you haven't followed the news

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,440
lately let me give you a quick reminder

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,839
uh and again spoiler alert this was a

00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,640
huge deal for us at venus for our

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,760
community

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,880
and for the industry at large um if you

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,480
were here last year

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,000
you remember that goldman sachs

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,959
announced the intent to

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,160
open source their alloy modeling

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,000
platform

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,440
and the underpinning language called

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,120
pure

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,640
so i'm really happy to report that this

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,959
process of open sourcing

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,880
completed in october with the

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:24,160
contribution of the platform which is

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,240
now referred to as legend

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,079
this is a huge step for goldman for our

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,079
community for the industry at large

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,240
not only we expect you know other

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,480
financial institutions to start adopting

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,680
the platform that goldman uses for all

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,120
sort of modeling

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,040
from regulatory pricing um but we have

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,519
seen a great potential in finance

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,399
actually

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,360
hosting a legend instance which has been

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,480
already but

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,680
used by over a hundred uh modelers to

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,640
collaborate

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,640
uh on common pan industry um

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,200
standardization efforts

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,839
so check it out download it contribute

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,480
to it

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,560
and if you like to try it uh we are

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,079
hosting our legend sandbox so go to

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,680
finos.org

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,680
legend and we can get you set up

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,200
but it's not just about legend you know

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,040
as i mentioned over the last two years

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,600
our project portfolio has grown to

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,279
include so many high value

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,680
and high quality projects for this

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,200
industry after all financial

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,200
institutions you know should be no

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,839
surprise financial institutions have

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,839
massive technology organizations and

00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,279
amazing software components that when

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,120
contributed

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,720
can deliver immediate value to the

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,480
industry

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,360
so we talked about legend from goldman

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,279
sachs we touched on the perspective

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,200
visualization library originally

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:46,399
contributed by j.p morgan

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,120
but while i won't be able to discuss

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,160
here uh the over 40 projects in the

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,920
landscape

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,160
there's a couple of projects i wanted to

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,320
highlight to showcase the depth and the

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,279
breadth of our community

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,040
waltz for example uh was contributed

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,079
this year by deutsche bank

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,320
it's a very mature active project

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:09,120
that allows you to visualize and define

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,279
your organization technology landscape

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,360
when you think about the sheer size of

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,760
these financial institutions

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,839
well you can easily see how this project

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,560
has a massive potential to be used

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,680
across the industry

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,000
i also wanted to send out a shout out to

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,240
the

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,320
morpher team a project that was

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,079
contributed earlier this year by morgan

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,320
stanley

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,200
this project aims to represent your

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,519
domain model

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,120
and your business logic in a technology

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,600
agnostic fashion

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,839
and we can see great potential here for

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,399
standardizing some of the common

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,200
challenges required across the industry

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,800
for example in

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,360
area where we're seeing very high

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,160
potential is the regulatory angle

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,600
where morphe could be used to define

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:58,240
common regulatory

00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:01,120
implementations last but not least

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,760
just a shout out we quickly talked about

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,480
our

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,560
fdc3 standard which stands for financial

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,839
desktop collaboration and connectivity

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,440
consortium

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,079
this is probably the most mature

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,160
standard we have in finos

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,519
in case you don't know yes we do also

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,519
open standards not just

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:21,440
open source projects this standard has

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,200
reached this 1.1 version it's very

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,040
mature and it's being increasingly

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,120
implemented by both vendors

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,880
and financial institutions developing

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,600
applications internally

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,480
to harmonize the ecosystem of these

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,560
applications

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,760
not only on the you know front office on

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,519
the trader's desktop

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,760
but also in the mid office and back

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,720
office so it's a very powerful standard

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,959
and we think

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,440
is going to help bring together uh you

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:48,320
know a previously largely disconnected

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,360
ecosystem of applications

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,440
and make sure again i couldn't cover all

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,320
the 40 projects here but make sure you

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,959
check out the

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,600
landscape the over 40 projects in the

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,279
phenox landscape at

00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,360
landscape.finos.org if you are

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,880
engaged in other linux foundation

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,839
projects you probably are familiar with

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,800
the landscape

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,399
uh so please check it out and we're

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,120
hopefully gonna see you contributing to

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,199
some of these projects

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,199
so given the growth that we've had this

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:21,120
year it should be no surprise

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:23,199
that in october 2020 uh in october 2020

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,959
has marked the all-time high

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,560
in number of commits to the phoenix

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:30,000
community

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,320
not only that but in 2020 over 70

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,040
percent of our projects contributed came

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,360
from financial institutions

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,519
i'll stop a second to let that one sink

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,519
in

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,639
i mean this is an industry that has

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,000
historically struggled to collaborate

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,320
and we think this is an amazing

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,480
achievement

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,560
but as much as i'd love to credit the

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,880
the finance community and our team

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,880
for the relentless work done with our

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,600
open source readiness initiative

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,199
and trust me that has massively helped

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,000
several of our members to get through

00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,120
the hump

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,720
and start contributing the truth is

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:11,199
the industry is leaving a seismic shift

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,360
and the context we're moving in in 2020

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:16,560
makes open source in this industry

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:19,120
not only strategic but almost a foregone

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,120
conclusion

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,880
so let's have a look at some of these

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,639
forces why

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,720
is this industry now seemingly suddenly

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,920
embracing open source contribution and

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,120
collaboration

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,360
well first and foremost

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,360
the business context we are moving in

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,120
has drastically changed over the last 10

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,120
years

00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,880
not only you know the advent of

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,519
electronic training

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,360
uh uh and just generally very highly

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,839
competitive market has driven

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,800
spreads and margins to their historical

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,160
lows

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,160
um impacting the top line uh but

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,360
if you look at the bottom line the

00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,839
regulatory span

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,720
has steadily increased over the last 10

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,759
years

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,519
so there simply is no longer a cosy

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,560
infinite amount of money

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,880
to be thrown at the problem and if you

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,440
pair that with a mandate

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,600
to become technology companies more

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,480
generally to deliver customer-centric

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,320
solution

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,920
for the digitally native new generation

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,240
well then you can see that the business

00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,880
imperatives points to a much

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,759
stronger need for efficiency and a tech

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,600
native approach

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,959
on the other side of the equation the

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,120
technology landscape

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,399
has drastically evolved over the last 10

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,000
years and

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:42,560
presenting really new opportunities

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,040
cloud first and foremost which by the

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,600
way

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,199
itself i believe wouldn't exist without

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,040
open source

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,639
and the advent of the centralized

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,800
technologies which are in a way

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,759
threatening the very notion of these

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,920
large centralized financial institutions

00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,600
and if you add to that equation the

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,519
increased talent crunch

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,680
the industry is experiencing for both

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,199
older technologies like mainframe

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,360
and most importantly for new

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,039
technologies you realize

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,760
why the industry is looking very

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,520
seriously now to tap it into the ocean

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,360
of talent that exists in open source

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,439
communities

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,880
if you pair that the business and

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,679
technology drivers

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,799
with the tensions of an ecosystem a

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,280
landscape

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,160
that is still largely divided between

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,799
the

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,240
up and coming fintechs on one hand

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,640
really target to deliver

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,160
drastically new user experience as their

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,880
differentiator

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,799
and on the other hand incumbent vendors

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,919
still having a dominant position in the

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:43,120
market

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,480
and continue to leverage in that again

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,799
if you pair that

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,799
with the growing number of new

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:51,039
generation technologies who are called

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,240
in senior and executive positions

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,760
in banks coming with a strong open

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,720
source experience

00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,000
um you know grown in years of delivering

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,360
technology quote unquote

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:08,320
on the west coast then you realize that

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,320
really open source is here to stay

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,559
but make no mistake this is just the

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,720
beginning

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,600
i want to draw a parallel uh of course

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,160
as an italian

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,440
to a love relationship i think that

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,160
where we are now

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,840
is you know being happily married after

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,840
years of dating

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,320
in a way through large consumption of

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:32,080
open source but limited contribution

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:34,160
and so what now well like any marriage

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,400
now the goal is to nurture this

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,640
relationship it's not going to be easy

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,440
each side will have to give something up

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:45,200
but the reward will be able to

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:47,200
will be to be able to collaborate

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,039
to create solutions for some of the

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,840
long-standing challenges in this

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,840
industry

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,600
this is the imperative this is just the

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,799
beginning and it behooves on us as a

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,640
community

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:59,360
to leverage this amazing community that

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,440
we've built and go after higher order

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:05,120
challenges

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,360
so that brings me to to the road ahead

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,960
i think first of all as i said we have

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,240
an opportunity to seize

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,320
and by far i don't expect this to

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,720
us to only make an impact in financial

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,600
services it's no longer a mirage to

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,200
think that

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,200
you know with this community that we

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,880
have and the representation from the

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,520
largest financial institutions in the

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,360
world

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,520
we can make an impact beyond our

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,720
business problems into areas like

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:33,600
sustainability financial inclusion

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,679
diversity which continue to be massive

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,480
problems

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,880
in order to do that we need to build a

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,919
commercial ecosystem around the open

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,400
source

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,240
projects that we have and we think there

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,039
is a huge first mover advantage

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,679
there for fintechs that are gonna jump

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,400
in

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,880
and repeat what we have seen happening

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,160
in pretty much any other industry

00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,400
commercializing open source

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,480
but in order to do that we need to

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,000
continue nurturing our projects in the

00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,240
open

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,159
you know as you all well know it doesn't

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,840
just take to throw code and get up to

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,919
make a project successful

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,840
and so it is our imperative to work

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,720
together with our contributors

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:19,440
to make our projects wildly adopted and

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,600
contributed to

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,720
and the way we're going to do that is to

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,799
really embrace all

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,039
constituents in our community we are a

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:30,480
global and inclusive community

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:32,320
and as you hear a lot tomorrow

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,240
we are doing a lot of work to include

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,200
the regulators to include

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,480
you know the global uh financial

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,320
institutions

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,159
all the other industry consortia as

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,679
you've heard today so

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:48,000
so much work ahead but we see a major

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:51,360
opportunity here

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,080
and finally i want to close with this

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,840
open source in financial services is a

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,120
positive sum game

00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:02,159
let's be clear nobody will have

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,440
the time the attention the resources or

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,240
the goodwill

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,840
to just do open source for the public

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,679
and see it through

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,360
but the good news is that there are

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,039
massive opportunities

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,720
commercial opportunities for each

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,840
individual constituent

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,919
whether you're a bank a fintech a big

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,679
tech or cloud service provider or even a

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,440
regulator

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,000
because as you go after those

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,880
opportunities the open source way

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,400
enables all of us together to create

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,760
faster innovation

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,080
better interoperability data

00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,720
standardization

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,919
a truly open fintech ecosystem and

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,880
definitely

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,600
mitigate the risk market-wise i think

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,440
these are all

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:47,679
very worthy goals we think

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,360
and so we do hope you'll enjoy the next

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,120
two days and after that

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:59,440
you'll join our community and contribute

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:59,440
