hello and welcome to the role of

00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,200
customer

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,960
partner and vendor collaboration in

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,600
enterprise open source strategy

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,600
my name is jose miguel parrella i am

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,400
with the open source ecosystem team at

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,640
microsoft

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,560
you know over the next half an hour i'd

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,279
like to share with you how microsoft's

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,679
approach

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,119
to collaboration and partnerships has

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,360
transformed with open source

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,399
and some of our learnings are on the way

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,320
hoping that

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,000
it can help you and your program engage

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,399
with your value chain and the open

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,719
source community at large

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,640
i have been working with open source at

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,640
microsoft for over a decade

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,480
have had the opportunity to contribute

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,960
to many of the milestones that you see

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,280
here

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,000
some of these are product related some

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,760
of these

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,440
were announcements that signal more

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,520
strategic investments

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,680
some were contributions to third-party

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,399
projects and others involve releasing

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,719
of microsoft's ip as open source but

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,320
these

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,320
these are all representative of

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,960
microsoft's open source transformation

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,080
where today over 30 000 employees use

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,520
github for work

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,840
and over 150 000 open source components

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,680
are used to deliver value to customers

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,600
and people around the globe in millions

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,439
of different ways

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,360
but something that particularly struck

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,600
me when i joined microsoft was the power

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,920
of

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,280
partnerships it was clear to me that

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,439
partners were going to play

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,799
a critical role in microsoft's open

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,479
source journey

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,560
that microsoft wasn't going to do this

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,320
alone and was willing to stand on the

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,040
shoulders of giants

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,079
now this man changing many things how we

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,200
engage with partners

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,040
and even who we engage with

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,200
one of the most important examples of

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,520
this today remains how we work

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,040
with open source foundations and other

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,200
governance bodies

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,600
this represents a shift from work that

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,320
used to focus mostly on standards

00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,719
and it requires developing a mindset a

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,880
skill set and a cultural affinity

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,079
that spans the large and growing numbers

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,840
of organizations

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,160
that influence several aspects of

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,000
microsoft business today

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,400
now this is important work that we

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,239
continue doing you can visit open source

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,879
at microsoft.com if you want to learn

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,200
more

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,120
but i thought i'd describe some specific

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,840
collaboration models that we're seeing

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,400
more of today

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,319
example cross-industry collaboration

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,560
where we see a group of

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,599
somehow unlikely partners are

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,400
increasingly happening

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,360
powered by open source examples range

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,599
from tackling

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,680
problems like separation of concerns in

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,519
cloud native application model

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,720
like what we do with alibaba and others

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,440
you know open apple

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,720
model or constructions like confidential

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,319
computing consortium

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,080
that brings together from hardware

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,640
vendors to cloud providers

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,480
and end users as well now this

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,319
cross-industry collaboration is also

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,120
seen at a more granular level

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:59,280
in certain technology ecosystems i could

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,640
mention perhaps onyx run time

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,400
in the machine learning space or yarn

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,840
in the apache software foundation

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,239
analytics space

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,720
or our partnership with openai the

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,800
reality is that the harder the problem

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,840
and the more impact it has in both

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,640
society and people

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,000
the more often it means like open source

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,280
is helping bring participants

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,920
together across industries two examples

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,760
here include differential privacy open

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,640
dp in particular

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,000
open data through not only this open

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,080
data initiative but also

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,400
several other work the microsoft has

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:38,000
been doing around licensing

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:41,200
for data sets through open source

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,360
licenses that are on github there's also

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,599
healthcare environmental sustainability

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,760
and we participate in several of this

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,879
directly as microsoft as well as through

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,319
github

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:54,239
if i had to pick one such challenge from

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,319
the top of my head i would say

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,480
that be our joint responsibility to

00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,280
secure the open source software supply

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,200
chain

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,680
it's something that no single company no

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,840
single provider no single linux disco

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,879
a single foundation or project can't

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,080
tackle alone

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,080
and when it comes to identifying threats

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,120
rethinking disclosure and developing

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,200
security tooling

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,479
and best practices the open source

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,239
security foundation

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,320
reflects this cross-industry

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,120
collaboration with participants that

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,600
include

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,639
jpmorgan chase for example now in

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,639
addition to

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,800
actively participating in governance

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,400
forums like linux foundation or the

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,479
cloud native computing foundation

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,639
coinciding with industry peers in

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,440
certain contribution spaces like

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,320
yarn and engaging in cross-industry

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,160
collaboration

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,639
for broad impact problems like

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,080
differential privacy i'd like to talk a

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,759
little bit more about our work with

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,440
commercial partners

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,520
because it best reflects the open source

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,680
transformation of microsoft

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,240
highlights this different mindset that

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,800
this type of partnership requires

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,479
now sonic stands for software for open

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,440
networking in the cloud it's an open

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,080
source project released by microsoft in

00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:06,400
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:09,600
it comprises code base as well as specs

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,160
um it was originally designed to help

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,000
with flood service provider software

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,880
defined networking needs

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,039
in the cloud every packet that comes in

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,280
or out of a microsoft data center today

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,960
goes through a top of rec switch running

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,840
sonic

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,720
and it has a modularity that allows uh

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,120
different

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,479
partners to plug their hardware

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,800
offerings

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,000
as a result there are about a hundred

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,199
supported platforms

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,360
in sonic from a dozen different vendors

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,199
and some of the things that we've been

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,280
doing with sonic include

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,680
the fact that github issues and pull

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,440
requests are the place where

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,680
the development of the project happens

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,400
in the open with contributions

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,919
from many people that are not microsoft

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,600
employees

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,600
also something else that we've done with

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,600
sonic uh was the

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,759
give everyone the chance to grow the

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,800
sonic brand by establishing a

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,199
quality bar both in technical as well as

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,319
in

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,319
general end user experience standpoint

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,800
on what really makes a great sonic

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,840
derivative or sonic distribution

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,319
a great customer experience so as you

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,160
can see

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,840
this type of collaboration this partner

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,360
industry collaboration not only creates

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,039
opportunities for a lot of the hardwood

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,639
vendors that can use sonic to go to

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,240
market and today there are

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,319
sonic distributions out there as

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,280
commercial offerings from

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,240
several of these partners but it also

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,160
requires a different

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,880
approach a different mindset a different

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,440
uh thinking about governance

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,639
and it's still a long-term investment it

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,840
still

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,240
requires every single bit of help and

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,360
and time and resource investment as any

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,280
other kind of project

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,400
but it has an interesting commercial

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,880
implication

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,479
that again is a reflection on the

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,720
transformation and how these type of

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,440
collaborations are happening

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,080
now one other collaboration i'd like to

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,919
highlight

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,639
is how we work with partners to build

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,319
solutions in azure to build things in

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,800
our platform it's not about

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,800
keeping unarmed length from a lot of

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,199
these different collaboration forums but

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,759
in

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,840
many cases like with the commercial open

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,440
source companies that you see here

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,680
is that joint engineering joint

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,560
operations and joint support

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,240
that materializes in different ways

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,960
depending on the nature of the service

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,880
but

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,639
results in an integrated experience for

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,400
customers with integrated identity

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,280
integrated security and integrated

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,240
billing is

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,680
what we really call uh jointly built

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,599
these are solutions

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,120
you can buy from the microsoft price

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,400
list these are joint skus

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,520
join solutions join go to market joint

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,919
services

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,680
uh in the case for example of azure red

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,400
hat openshift not only has red hat

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,000
products

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,960
openshift which is an open source

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,800
project but microsoft and red hat

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,879
have open source the control plane of

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,120
the service which is the azure

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,160
red hat openshift research provided or

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,039
rorp

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,240
open sourced on github today and these

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,680
are all great examples

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,199
of how we can partner that cultural

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,720
affinity between microsoft and the

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,680
commercial partners commercial open

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,280
source partners

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,960
can translate benefits for the open

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,160
source ecosystem because all of these

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,400
companies

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,840
handle communities handle their project

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,919
and that they understand upstream and

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,280
downstream product and product

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:29,520
and whether it's innovation or simply

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,360
fixing experience you know patching

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,440
security issues or whatnot

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,479
where one more participant that knows

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,360
and is in

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,000
at in the long term to bring all of this

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,599
uh

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,839
learnings from going into production and

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,320
going into market back to the

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,000
open source projects now one more

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,480
example i'd like to

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,240
provide on a particular type of

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,080
community industry collaboration comes

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,120
from our prosperous team

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,040
there's a significant password

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,040
investment at microsoft we have several

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,240
core contributors to the postgres

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,320
uh project uh working with microsoft and

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,680
we offer a managed phosphorus service

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,959
uh it is every extension and every

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,680
contribution we've made

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,120
is open source and we continue

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,480
innovating in this space with things

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,240
like pj cron which basically helps with

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,760
scaling background workers in

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,760
phosphorous scenarios

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,959
in a more idiomatic or better integrated

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,200
way

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,120
and the case with pj kron which again is

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,640
an open source collaboration

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,240
is that it was not just the brainchild

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,560
of microsoft it was actually the

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,120
collaboration between microsoft

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,640
amazon a competitor that offers also

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,200
offers a managed phosphorus

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,200
service and salando a retailer a

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,440
customer that uses phosphorus

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,399
and it's this type of collaboration that

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,480
we also see in

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,640
some of the scenarios that i described

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,480
like onyx runtime or

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,320
in the cloud native computing foundation

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,200
space where

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,320
more and more we coincide with others

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,040
oftentimes

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,720
competitors other industry participants

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,200
industry peers

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,079
and customers that are doing this

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,920
contribution

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,000
in the open which is quite amazing and

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,480
again another example of the type of

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,519
collaborative flavors of collaboration

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,480
that we are often finding again

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,880
a lot of this is not only commercial

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,640
it's

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,399
not only about creating opportunities

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,320
which we still do

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,760
uh it's not just about being an active

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:28,079
participant and the governance bodies of

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,240
things that influence you know the

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:33,519
business interests of microsoft or

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,880
of your company but it's also tackling

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,880
big problems

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,399
uh and coming together to offer

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,240
solutions that customers and the

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,880
community at large really want like in

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,120
this case

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,640
um this particular prosperous extension

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,320
if i had to paint a little bit of a

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,519
framework i would say that

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,000
working together in open source starts

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,920
with

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,920
collaborating with the industry starts

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,279
with being present in all the governance

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,200
bodies

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:03,839
it involves the building of our platform

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,360
uh with others oftentimes that means you

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,440
know bringing publishers into our

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,200
marketplace establishing

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,959
you know partner relationships partner

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,959
programs partner channels

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,480
but also going above and beyond and

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,200
building with partners

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,480
which is something that we uniquely do

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,160
through this joint

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,480
engineering joint operations joint

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,959
support and the integrated experience

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,160
and that long-term commitment to go

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,240
through the

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,160
upstream open source communities uh

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,399
through and with our partners

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,000
there are two uh customer related

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,519
examples here that i have at the bottom

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,079
and i'd like to talk about one of these

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,839
two

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,200
a little bit of depth of course

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,720
microsoft does have

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,560
like many software companies a

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,200
consulting function this is what i'm

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,440
calling here coding for customers

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,480
in this consulting function uh because

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,279
we work with

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,639
enterprise uh companies these you know

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:56,480
of course

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:58,720
there's a lot of open source uh usage

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,760
whether it's office dynamics of

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,839
front-end solutions around asp.net.net

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,320
core itself being open source

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,519
helper solution server on sql server

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,279
running on linux

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,720
containerized solutions these are all

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,040
spaces where our

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,200
traditional consulting customers keep

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,519
asking for more and more open source

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,560
but i wanted to focus on coding with

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,160
customers

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,079
which is something that microsoft that

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,120
we do through our commercial software

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,519
engineering

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,880
organization and it's in this coding

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,000
with customers where we see some

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,040
reflection

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,959
of the motivations around the broader

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,519
collaboration both with commercial and

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,200
non-commercial entities

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,760
in this code with engagements we're

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,839
seeing we could just open source usage

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,839
that includes languages like python and

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,519
go solutions like kafka

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,480
often times all of those running in

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:51,440
linux containers pulling the oci stack

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,519
pulling the linux operating system in

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,160
this engagements we use a standard legal

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,720
framework

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,399
that describes jointly owned ip with

00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,920
focus on reusability

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,760
and respect for the open source

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,120
licensing of anything that's brought

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,839
into the engagement

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,680
which is the result of joint decisions

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,120
and joint discussions with

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,399
our customers and like i said it's

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:16,480
something that we see very often

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:18,240
we find that we we might be improving on

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,920
a particular way of doing something and

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,160
that results in joint upstream

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:26,240
contributions as well

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:28,720
and a whole motivation behind this is

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,160
the ability for microsoft to understand

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,399
how open source

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,480
is being used in different industries

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,800
commercial software engineering engages

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,320
in

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,639
industry friendliness from healthcare to

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,800
public sector uh some of the customers

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:45,040
we engage with include alliance axa

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,360
ubs hsvc so that is critical for us and

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,279
we

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,519
see the same thing that you see in terms

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,079
of open source underpinning a lot of

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,360
trends

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:55,920
around digital transformation as well as

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,480
you know entire categories of technology

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,279
being particularly or basically defined

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,720
by

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,199
open source now one of the big learnings

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,160
here

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,639
is that long-term sustainability is as

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,279
much

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,279
as a concern in this type of code with

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,360
engagements of being a vendor in this

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:17,040
case cloud service provider and

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,760
and user as it is for any industry peers

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,560
or any cross

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,959
industry collaboration no one really

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,240
wants to be in the business of

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:28,000
you know rolling out code no matter how

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,760
good the code is

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,279
no matter how helpful we think it might

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,600
be for someone else

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,639
and then failing to create a community

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,279
or failing to

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,959
care about its long-term sustainability

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,360
so this is an aspect

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:44,720
we've learned from particularly in the

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,720
early stages of our work here with some

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,000
kubernetes and cloud native related

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,600
projects

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,160
around best practice frameworks for

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,519
example where

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,680
the it's always hard to start this

00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,160
engagement thinking how do i decouple

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,279
this how do i design this

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,440
in a way that others can

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,839
naturally come that naturally attracts

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,160
contributors and future maintainers

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,600
that requires understanding having some

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,000
product understanding what's going to be

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,000
the value

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,600
proposition uh who's going to be the

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,959
audience of this product

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,720
of this repo that i'm going to be

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,240
standing up and of course

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,839
much more than that what's the

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,279
governance of this

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,959
what infrastructure is going to be

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:28,079
necessary and

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:30,399
and oftentimes also requires um

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,720
you know recruiting some critical base

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,759
do we want to talk to others in our same

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,800
industry

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,480
in the case for example let's say

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,800
banks you know are there other banks are

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,480
there other peers i can talk to

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:46,560
and see if there's any uh you know cross

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,079
sorry industry peer collaboration we can

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,720
put together around this uh

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,000
this project now interestingly some of

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,079
this

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,759
comes from perhaps underestimating

00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:01,839
non-code artifacts when we focus mostly

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,680
on code then this concern is

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,920
it almost brings everything to a stall

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,240
it's a it's a real blocker

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,040
when we consider non-code artifacts like

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,399
specs

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,560
like architects and other

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,519
deliverables then things get a little

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,360
bit interesting

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,199
because we can make meaningful open

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,279
source contributions

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,800
even though it's not necessarily a

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,720
software framework

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,399
or you know something that resembles a

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,480
software product

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,440
so this is an area we want to explore

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,560
more uh

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,440
more on in fact i would say that the

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,360
internal training at microsoft that we

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,680
have for all of this organization that

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,279
performs the code with engagement

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,880
internally we call this open hack this

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,519
is actually open source

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,160
so the entire training materials for all

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,680
of this

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,199
type of engagements are open source

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,240
already as you know

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:54,720
at microsoft like it's a normal in

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,839
in the cloud all documentation sdks

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,000
client libraries etc

00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,279
are also open source but there are so

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,639
many artifacts that

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:06,240
you know don't require necessarily that

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,919
um you know that cognitive aspect of

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,839
you need to bind to this framework or

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,079
this particular piece of technology

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,280
which can be a little bit of a limiting

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,959
uh factor

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,839
when considering another option of a lot

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:20,640
of this so this is an interesting uh

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,480
finding for us that uh you know how even

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,959
in this type of engagements which are

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,000
um you know there's there's that sorry

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,679
these are non-bill of

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,120
non-billable type of engagements not

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,520
prescriptive type of

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,720
of engagements we find many of the same

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,039
motivations and

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,120
and challenges that drive this

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,559
cross-industry collaboration

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,240
of which we have many examples that i've

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,400
talked about today

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,440
we find that long-term sustainability

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,720
remains a

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,880
a big topic we find that that cross

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,720
talking to industry peers is an aspect

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,799
that could potentially help here

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,640
that that matchmaking across industries

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,360
is also another aspect that could help

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,440
here

00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,480
and certainly there are forums like this

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,200
forum

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,960
where we can uh talk about several of

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,440
these problems and find common ground

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,640
and this is something we truly believe

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,000
there's more investment

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,400
and more that we can be doing in this

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,559
space in fact i am very interested in

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,280
your learnings uh working with others

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:17,120
in open source particularly working with

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,280
others in your value chain

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,760
and particularly working with the

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,600
ecosystem and the community at large

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,600
we are seeing again an increase like you

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,000
are uh here today we're seeing an

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,880
increase of end user participation

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,360
in several of these governance bodies

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,880
and

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,480
trying to understand what else can we do

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,880
as trusted advisors

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,840
and cloud service providers and software

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,760
companies

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,360
to ensure the maximum impact and the

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,440
maximum value for the open source

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,760
community at large

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,720
to summarize here are five of the models

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,799
that i've talked about

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,720
today in terms of collaboration with

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,720
others in open source that collaboration

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,200
with industry and active participation

00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,120
in governance the development of

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,440
you know the basic partner ecosystems to

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,320
build our platform but also

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,520
going uh with commercial open source uh

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,640
software companies

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,280
building with them services in our

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,120
platform

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,360
that they allow us to deliver more value

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,919
to the open source ecosystem

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,799
and uh obviously working with customers

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,120
including

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:21,440
that coding with motion for us that has

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:25,039
yielded some interesting learnings into

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:28,080
uh reusability and what uh you know what

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:31,360
role uh what things must be considered

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,039
beyond just licenses and technical

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,880
other technical factors and the code

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,520
itself to ensure that these are

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,320
successful and impactful contributions

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,280
for everyone else as well like i said

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,080
i'm really into

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,440
your input i'm more than happy to get in

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,240
touch via open source

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,320
at microsoft.com we'll also open it up

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,559
for a few questions in just a minute

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,080
if you'd like to learn more about how we

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,360
do open source at microsoft and the kind

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,320
of things we do with open source at

00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,559
microsoft you can visit

00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,960
opensource.microsoft.com

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,559
i'm particularly interested in any

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,000
follow-up conversations you want to have

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,240
with your team

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,280
with others in your industry i'd be

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,799
delighted to share

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,120
a little bit more details about some of

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,159
these engagements but for now let's open

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,720
it up for a few

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:21,840
questions and again thank you for making

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:21,840
the time and enjoy the rest of the forum

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,120
