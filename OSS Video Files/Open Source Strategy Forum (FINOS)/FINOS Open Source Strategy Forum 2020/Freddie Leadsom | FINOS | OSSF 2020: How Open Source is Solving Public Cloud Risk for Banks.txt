How Open Source is Solving Public Cloud Risk for Banks - OSSF 2020

To keep up with the pace of change and computational acceleration across Technologically involved industries, many companies have adopted the Public Cloud to exponentially increase their scalability, flexibility and cost efficiency. Banks are no exception, but coupled with the challenges of regulation and stability within Financial Services, the world’s largest Financial Institutions have an enormous task ahead to adopt an infrastructure model that allows them to keep up with the smallest and nimblest of Tech companies.

Deutsche Bank have been working with The Fintech OpenSource Foundation for around 18 months on a project to multilaterally accelerate the transformation of banking Infrastructure from self hosted to Public Cloud technology. Some of the largest investment banks in the world including JP Morgan and Deutsche bank as well as Red Hat, Microsoft and a consortium of tech pioneers have come together to demonstrate that banks can be included in the Public Cloud revolution, and provide solutions that will extend the concept to more of the Financial Industry.
