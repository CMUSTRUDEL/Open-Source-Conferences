James McLeod's BIO

James is the Director of Community at FINOS and wholeheartedly believes the transformation of Financial Services can only be fulfilled if Open Source is embraced under the three pillars of Contribution, Consumption, and Community.

James has a twenty-year career in software engineering having worked for telecommunication startups, the gaming industry, digital streaming platforms, and financial services. Prior to joining FINOS James worked at Lloyds Banking Group where he focused on building engineering communities for Lloyds Bank, Halifax, Bank of Scotland, Scottish Widows and other LBG banks. While at Lloyds Banking Group, James also drove the adoption of Inner Source and Open Source partly through the creation of engineering guilds providing in-person and remote educational sessions and large hackathon events. James also spent a number of years consulting on software engineering projects for RBS, NatWest and Barclays.

As a member of the FINOS team, James’ ambition is to bring his extensive experience building communities to grow Financial Services into a powerhouse of Open Source. James is a true open source advocate and founded the “React London – Bring Your Own Project” meetup to provide an interactive forum for ReactJS and Javascript developers to come together. In the last two years it has grown to a membership of over 1500 individuals.

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,080

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,159
dan it's an absolute pleasure to have

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,640
you here today to answer questions

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,640
from the finnos community but before we

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,400
start can you introduce yourself

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,040
for those who aren't familiar with the

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,000
work you do within the wider javascript

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,520
or facebook open source community

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,720
sure thank you for the introduction

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,600
so i um i guess i'm only

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,040
uh i mostly work on react itself so

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,119
react is a

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,520
javascript library for building user

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:45,119
interfaces

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,119
so i i was like you used to react a lot

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,520
before i got the job at facebook and i

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,720
work on the reaccore themes so

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,200
that involves mostly uh

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,479
fixing box maintenance uh helping

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,600
develop new features

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:02,000
writing documentation and

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,320
talking to the community which is what

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
i'm doing now

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,000
that's awesome so firstly what are your

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,920
thoughts on the funding of open source

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,080
projects in sustainability

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,120
would a project like react work without

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,440
the backing from facebook

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,480
yeah that's uh that is an interesting

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,760
question um

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,879
i think there is uh

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,080
um it is definitely possible that

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,080
projects uh like work without uh like a

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,319
specific like a single corporate

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,000
i mean obviously they do need some

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,440
sponsors right and like usually those

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,640
would be corporate

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,360
um but like i think like view is a

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,560
uh there is a um kind of like a

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,680
competition library

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,239
called view that is uh fairly popular

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,760
and vu doesn't have a single corporate

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,239
sponsor so it's

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,440
uh it's multiple sponsors they change

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,800
over time

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,200
um so it is funded by by the community

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,200
and

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,840
the users so i think it's it's

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,080
definitely true that this model can be

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,720
successful

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,480
it's it's not very easy to like

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,720
replicate it you need a

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,480
critical mass of users so i think it

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,239
mostly works for

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,920
already established like pretty big

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,200
projects

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,760
but it is it is definitely possible as

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,840
for

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:26,879
react itself i think there is a um

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:30,840
like it's hard to say like what if

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:33,760
like i don't know uh i think there is a

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,879
uh there are definitely

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:40,720
differences in like how we would work

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,640
um and i think like one particular area

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,000
that i think people

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:49,200
um underestimate the value

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,319
of of like a company that is

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,200
that is the stable that uh that

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,760
that is not like a startup but like a

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,239
stable corporate sponsor is the ability

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,480
to do

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:05,680
long-term research so um

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:09,120
because for for a lot of at least in my

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,920
experience and like i'm not like

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,280
i don't want to offend anyone but i

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,720
think

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,280
it is true that when uh like for

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,079
smaller companies the return on

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,440
investment

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:26,720
is uh like it needs to be very concrete

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,080
uh like it's it's support it's

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,680
developing like particular

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,520
features that they ask for um and

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,600
while that by itself is obviously

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,400
valuable and that's fine

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,360
um i think sometimes this uh this comes

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,800
at the expense

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:46,160
of um like not being able to do

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,639
kind of moonshot projects where like you

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,800
might

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,400
uh whereas like a bigger company might

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,440
be able to fund like

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,160
uh three years working on some idea that

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,639
is

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,560
uh that is maybe more ambitious than the

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,560
usual and not all of them pan out

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,600
and i think that that is what i i

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,160
appreciate about

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,680
facebook back in react is that we have

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,919
the ability to go

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,320
for like really big ideas even if they

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,080
take time

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,360
so from what i understand when you're

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,199
developing redux

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,639
you had to get multiple different

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,080
sponsors in order to

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:23,440
keep your work going um is that true

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:26,880
um so redox was

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,919
this kind of a uh unusual case because

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,080
it is

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,160
it was developed as a proof of concept

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,120
for a conference talk it was not meant

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,840
to be

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,199
this like heavily used library in

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,039
production

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,240
uh but people started using it they

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,600
liked it and then

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,360
for a few months uh like i i didn't have

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,000
a job at the time because like my

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,759
previous

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,919
uh the company when i where i was

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,120
working it has folded

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:56,240
um and so i did um i

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,319
did have the community funded for like

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,360
maybe three to five months something

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,120
like this

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,720
uh but i was primarily focused on

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,520
documentation and

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,120
uh and like examples so i was not even

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,080
coding that much

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,720
and i would say that redux hasn't really

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,360
changed

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,720
since like that was like five four or

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,919
five years ago

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,600
like it's it's a very uh it's a very

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,080
unusual library in that it doesn't

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,160
really do

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,919
anything uh and it's just like a pattern

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,240
and i would say like even like maybe an

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:31,360
overused uh pattern

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,120
um but it is what it is yeah it

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,199
certainly has its competitors now

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,720
and so you've sparked some inspiration

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,319
in the rest of the open source community

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,319
with her

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,919
so um last month i actually noticed that

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,600
there are various different tweets about

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,600
um hacktoberfest and

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,120
you know the value that hacktopervest

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,160
actually brings to the open source

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,440
community and the

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:54,080
the value of the contributions um now

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,840
oktoberfest has ended did the react team

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,720
actually see an uplift in bogus

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,400
contributions

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,120
or did the situation address the

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,160
community concerns

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,039
yeah i i think it was a complete mess in

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,680
the beginning

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:11,840
and in part i i think like the

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,880
from what i gathered it was just like

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,759
that there was a produce

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,400
like a youtube uh person who like

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,479
uploaded the video that said basically

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,599
here's how you can get like free

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,360
t-shirts

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,639
and so people got carried away i don't

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,720
think like a lot of them were

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,720
even familiar with like open source um

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,840
so that that was a bit strange uh but

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,080
that lasted for like

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,280
three or four days and then uh i think

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,520
like digital

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,319
ocean changed it to be often awesome

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,599
like this

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:44,800
uh we did not often um so

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:47,599
it's it's hard for me to say if like

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,039
aside from those early uh like noisy

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,840
aprs if there was like

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,360
actual uptick in contributions uh but

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,160
that's mostly because it's just

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,960
like i'm doing a pretty bad job of like

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,319
actually

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:03,199
checking those um because we're

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,840
like we're in a um kind of a final

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,400
stretch

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,160
of like a few multi-year projects that

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,520
we're just trying to wrap up

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:15,039
and get to completion and so we

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:19,280
have intentionally de-emphasized uh like

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:21,759
looking at contributions and um

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,599
and like communicative pull requests so

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,680
i haven't really been keeping track and

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:29,039
like i don't expect to you until

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,520
like several months after now

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,560
yeah because i i suppose um the reacting

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,000
would have to label

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,680
um some of the issues that they're

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,640
inviting out to the hacktoberfest

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,159
community

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,000
and so it kind of puts a bit of um

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,039
pressure on the team to

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,360
review and then accept yeah and i think

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,480
for

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,279
especially for react's case uh it's

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,160
pretty tough

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,760
because like it's not a new project

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,160
there aren't many

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,000
uh you know like simple bugs you can

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,279
just go ahead and fix

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,160
um so it's like

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,800
there are issues we do want to work out

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,920
but they

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,920
require like multiple months of

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,440
like just gaining context on like what

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,560
the problem is

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,440
so it's not particularly like amenable

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,720
to

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,399
uh just like drive by contributions yeah

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,240
uh whereas and i think like that's

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,880
that's fine i think like a lot of people

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,720
who

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,160
think about oh like i want to contribute

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,000
the open source

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,800
like they think about big projects but

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,399
it's really like i would encourage to go

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,880
beyond them and instead just

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,519
like fix something that you use it's

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,440
often like

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,560
small components small libraries that

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,760
would appreciate

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,640
the uh you know like the actual like bug

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,680
fixes and

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,680
like there's plenty like opportunities

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,720
for like performance improvements and

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,399
stuff

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:53,680
um so i would say just focus on the

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:56,880
uh you know on the uh long tail uh

00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:00,640
not on the uh like

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,440
like on the uh just a few highly visible

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,360
projects

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,200
absolutely i know you i'm from a

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,480
financial services point of view

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,519
um having react in open source it means

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,200
that you know

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,279
engineering leads can actually take a

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,399
look under the hood at the code that's

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,839
there and so

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,920
it gives you reassurance about the

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,279
quality of the product rather than you

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,440
know the odds of you being able to

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,600
contribute into the project

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,120
um so from that point of view you know

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,079
open source you know does increase

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,839
quality

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,600
and it keeps the engineers accountable

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,480
for the work they're doing

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,120
um so if people actually follow you on

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,279
twitter

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,560
and you know uh look at all of the

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,519
tutorials that you've been putting

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,839
online

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,680
you actually spend a lot of time on

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,519
community engagement

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,360
would you say that's essential for

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,320
project success

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,959
and what works best for building that

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,959
community

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:58,399
um yeah i i think i i don't actually do

00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,560
as much of that now and it's kind of a

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,880
tough balance like i wish i

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,760
i had a good answer but like i'm just

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,959
learning

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:10,480
um because i think like early on

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:14,560
uh it really helped to react that

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,880
uh there was a uh like

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,800
i think react in that sense was unusual

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,880
because uh

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,200
like usually you would have dedicated

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:27,680
people like developer advocates

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,360
uh actually uh um like

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,279
helping people understand the project

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,480
and like documenting and so on

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,800
and i think react from like from very

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,480
intentionally from early days it was

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,160
like most of that work was done by

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:46,000
engineers working on it

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:49,600
and so the downside of this is that uh

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,360
the um so the upside of this

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,360
is that it's uh

00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,800
like the vision uh of

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,839
the the people promoting the product is

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,000
this like it

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,279
it is guaranteed to be the same as the

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,920
vision of the people actually

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,240
like working on it so there is no like

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,240
chance of miscommunication or like

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,279
framing something that is like not

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,720
entirely

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,079
correct uh so it is very uh like it is

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,680
very honest

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:24,959
uh but the the downside of that is that

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,920
um as the project grows it doesn't

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,920
really scale

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,959
so like you can't keep responding to

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,760
everyone

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,320
and also i think like one thing that i'm

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,680
kind of

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,880
uh trying to figure out now is like

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:41,120
i think uh like

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,880
a few team members like including myself

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,240
become kind of the center of attention

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,360
where like all this energy is

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,600
concentrated

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,360
and that actually makes it harder for

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,959
like newer people to break out

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,519
into the like in the ecosystem because

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,959
um like they're not the ones being asked

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,240
questions like they don't get the same

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,000
opportunities

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,519
so it becomes this very top-down

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
structure uh even like unintentionally

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,920
um and i think that that's something

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,920
that uh like that's why i feel like like

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,320
i don't really have advice because like

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,800
i i want to figure out how to

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,360
uh like decentralize it a little bit and

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,720
maybe

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:21,200
not not have to be as involved yeah

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,200
actually that is a really good well

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,959
that's an unintentional consequence of

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,320
you know that momentum that your

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,600
own personal brand has built um so how

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,839
do you actually invite

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,079
um other engineers from you know the

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,160
open source community or facebook

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,519
into that you know how do you delegate

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,360
you know all of that

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,880
focus that you have outwards so it

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,720
becomes more federated and less

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,279
centralized

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,480
yeah and like i feel like some teams are

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,560
better at this

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,600
uh than us like i think view team is a

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,639
good example

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,440
uh like they even though there is a uh

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,720
small

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,000
kind of um like the project itself is

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,720
driven by a

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,720
a small number of people they do a

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,519
pretty good job at

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,240
distributing knowledge even like um

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,320
things that do

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,160
that are top down like there is uh

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,279
there's a particular like direction that

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,600
the team wants to

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:18,720
to take um they do kind of find ways to

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,199
distribute it across uh like educators

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,320
and and like so that it's it doesn't

00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,360
seem like it's coming

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,000
from like just a single source so i

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,760
think that

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,399
that that helps um but

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,600
another part of this is just um better

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,360
documentation

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,199
for sure like uh because like the reason

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,560
people ask me questions is just because

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,760
like something is not

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:46,399
plainly stated in the docs

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,160
and that's like also partially like like

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:52,000
our fault because

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,480
uh for some things like for example like

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,120
uh

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,800
react hooks right like it's a it's a

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,800
it's a pretty big shift in how you think

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,560
about react components uh it's like in

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,040
the api we introduced

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,639
two years ago almost i think it's almost

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,959
two years ago by now

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:12,000
um and actually a bit over two years

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:14,320
and it's

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,120
like at the time we didn't know how to

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,000
use them

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,279
like sure we wrote the docs but like we

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,800
didn't have two years of

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,480
like nobody had the experience it's a

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,680
novel concept it's like

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,800
nobody like wrote code quite the same

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,399
way before

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,160
and so of course we didn't document a

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,160
lot of things and we're just

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,839
because we are just finding them out and

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,839
like we are finding them out through

00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,199
those conversations and through those

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,600
questions

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,199
but it's it's like you know you need to

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,959
take time to kind of

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,800
gather things and then you need to like

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,639
consolidate them and i think that's

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,079
that's the phase we're in now is like

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,519
we've learned all of those things from

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,240
those conversations

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,920
and now we need to put them in a like in

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,839
the reference so that other people can

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,720
refer to them without asking us

00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,959
yeah so we were talking about um

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,240
federation versus centralization

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:06,160
so with um reactors being an example

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,079
did the requirements or the idea for

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,880
that come from the community or did it

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:13,759
come from the react team

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,759
yeah um

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,160
it's an interesting question i think

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:22,160
it's uh like there is a broader

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:24,240
question here of like

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,199
the where does the division of react

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,720
come from

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,800
i think it's it's actually something

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,920
that is quite misunderstood

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,399
uh in the community uh so like there are

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,720
people

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,720
who think that like facebook sets uh the

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,720
direction of react

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,759
and i think like maybe we have said

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,680
something

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,759
to that point that like that's the

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:47,199
reason people are saying that is that we

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:50,240
we have miscommunicated earlier um

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:53,199
but i think it's it's really neither

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,519
it's uh it's neither facebook nor the

00:16:53,199 --> 00:17:00,160
open source community

00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,160
um i think the

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:07,600
so like um the

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:10,640
the way i see it happening is that we

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,360
um we look at different problems

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,000
and like people bring problems to us

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,039
right so

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,000
and that happens both facebook and

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,039
externally and like there are different

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,319
characteristics

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:27,120
of like how that happens so like um

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,319
externally we get a larger volume of

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,640
problems

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,679
but slightly lower quality because the

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,000
barrier

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,720
like to like file an issue is so low

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,080
that

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:41,440
people can just like fix my code so it's

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,679
uh you don't

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,280
like this signal to noise ratio is is

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,240
not very effective

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,360
uh but the volume is so large that you

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,039
pick up on

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,960
like you notice things that you wouldn't

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:56,160
like have you wouldn't have thought of

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,720
otherwise uh that like people run into

00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,559
so that gives you breath and then i

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:04,000
think at facebook it's more about

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,440
depth so facebook we also

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,360
like people also come to us with

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,720
problems and

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,320
we can spend much longer time kind of

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,240
because like we have access to the

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,720
product we don't just take their word

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,160
for it

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,640
that it's a problem we can like

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,640
literally run that code and see oh like

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,720
i see what they're saying i see how that

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:26,240
influences the product

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,480
um so we get a lot of like

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,120
much more depth from those conversations

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,919
and though those investigations

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,799
um but the solutions don't come from

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,160
that either

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:40,080
like that's just inputs and um

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,440
i can't really say where solutions come

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,039
from because like i'm not

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,880
the primary person who comes up with

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:48,400
them uh is mostly

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,240
like sebastian or jack lead

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,600
but the way he works is more like a

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,480
scientist

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,960
in the sense that he accumulates all

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,440
these problems

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,960
but then he kind of takes you know like

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,640
how you need to take a step

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:07,200
back and see like how how

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,160
like how did we how did we end up in

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,600
this situation

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,280
and like what are other different things

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,960
we could do um

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,880
but i think what is unique about

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,280
sebastian from like my perspective

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,400
like compared to people i worked with is

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,520
that he takes like

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:24,559
10 steps back or like 15 steps back

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,720
and he he discovers

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,120
like pathways that like other people

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,799
didn't take for whatever reason

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,160
uh that are actually like pretty

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,480
interesting

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,720
and so and like i think he's his

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,799
thinking is shaped by first principles

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,480
which means that like it's not about

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,600
facebook not about open source it's

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,880
about

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:48,160
what is a user interface

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,120
how does a computer work how do we make

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,799
those things

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:56,160
work together and it sounds really vague

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:57,760
but uh i think like if he finds those

00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,919
solutions and he's inspired like

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,559
obviously he takes a lot of inspiration

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,520
from

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,200
things happening elsewhere right um so

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,240
it could be like compact competitor

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,520
frameworks

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,000
but also again like his uh like he looks

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,600
at

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,720
uh like things in programming language

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,000
research

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,600
or like low level graphics or

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,679
like all of those things that he would

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,200
usually not necessarily connect

00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,720
to front end but like he finds

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,880
inspiration there as well

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,880
and i think it's just this work like the

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,400
way he comes up with solutions is just

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,400
this synthesis

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,720
of different things that he learned from

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,039
like different places

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,799
that's um an amazing observation because

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,640
it's very easy to get caught in

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,840
you know delivering features or doing

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,640
what a business analyst

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,159
asks you to do you know and you know

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,039
computer science is actually very

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,720
creative and

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,559
it's a good opportunity to go back to

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,240
the science and explore you know

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,480
our roots and what we need to do in

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,880
order to further things

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,039
so within financial services um inner

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,720
source is actually a really big um

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,360
topic and that's all about the

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,200
collaboration inside teams and inside

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,960
firewalls before you even get to open

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,640
source so

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,400
what is the strategy at facebook

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,880
regarding in a sourcing

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,000
and open sourcing projects how does each

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,120
team decide which

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,240
project to open source

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,159
yeah um i think this really comes down

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:26,240
to individual engineers

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:29,280
um because like you can't force

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,520
somebody to open source a project and

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,520
i think uh projects that have been open

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,159
source have always had

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,360
somebody who like felt really passionate

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,000
about it

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,200
and kind of convinced uh like other

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,280
people that it's

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,840
it's the right thing to do but then even

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:49,440
if you open source it right there's like

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,960
um there's different ways to do it and

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,400
a lot of teams like they might open

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,080
source something and then they don't

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,360
know

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,799
well they just threw something over the

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,520
wall but they don't work with the

00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:02,320
community

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:05,039
or they like they don't really explain

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,440
what it is or they stop maintaining it

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,679
so

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,679
like in that case it's it's it's better

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,760
not to open source than to open source

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,679
poorly

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,159
because that that just creates like a

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,240
burden for your users or you need to be

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:21,200
very clear in expectations

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,039
so we do have a process like we have a

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,600
open source team that supports

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,880
open source efforts um that is there

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,799
like if you want to open source

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,320
something you send them a request

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,919
and they like follow up with you just to

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,720
check that you understand

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,200
that like open source is a commitment uh

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,799
that

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,480
like it's it's not just throwing things

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,320
over the wall um

00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,159
like what this thing is how is it

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,600
different from what we already open

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,520
source because like we have a large

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,080
portfolio project

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,559
um and we also they like they have a

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,520
stage

00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:53,360
process so we start in like uh something

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,600
called like facebook incubator

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,120
which is just a home to like all experts

00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,039
and i think like facebook experimental

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,679
maybe that's what it's called

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,159
but it's like a home to all the projects

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,320
that

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,320
we don't really know if like they're

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,840
going to work out as open source

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,679
and then if there is like if there is

00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,200
adoption and the team is still

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,960
interested like eventually they kind of

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,000
graduate

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,960
um but there are plenty uh there are

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,360
plenty of libraries and solutions that

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,080
um like the authors are just not

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,559
interested

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,559
or they just feel that they bring more

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:30,480
value to the company by focusing

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,799
on uh on like internal integrations and

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,039
so

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,559
they they explicitly decide against open

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:38,640
sourcing

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:43,200
and i think like that's also a

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:45,840
that's also a way of doing things um

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,360
i think just my kind of mantra there is

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,840
just that it

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,039
it's better not to open source than to

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,120
open source poorly

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,159
so you you need to really know like why

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,320
you're doing it and

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,760
what what you're hoping to get from it

00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,440
because

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,279
like you're probably not going to get

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,039
contributions like that's

00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,760
that's not the i think like a lot of

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:07,279
people think that

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,039
that's like oh facebook is getting so

00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,840
many contributions that's why the open

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,640
source

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,679
uh for react we actually get sure we

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,679
have a lot of

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:20,880
small contributions but uh

00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:23,440
the vast majority of the work is done by

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,120
uh like folks uh employer facebook or

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,480
our partners like companies that we

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,640
partner with

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,559
um it's not like just like drive-by

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,799
fixes uh

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,000
that are like really making the big

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,640
difference

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,600
so open source is not about like getting

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,919
something

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,159
it's more about like if you feel that

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,400
you want to influence the industry

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,640
you want to share what you learned and

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,919
you want to put your approach under the

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,360
scrutiny

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,360
uh like i think that that's one of the

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,960
most positive things about big company

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,279
open source is that

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,279
it keeps you honest uh because

00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:59,520
internally it's easy to stagnate

00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:01,919
there's like there's a solution everyone

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,840
uses it too hard to migrate away from

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:07,440
and it just

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:09,039
it's just like uh it just

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,440
dominates within the company because

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:13,360
there's nothing better

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,360
but in the open source you're forced to

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,960
confront that there are other solutions

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,320
and they have different characteristics

00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,400
and now you have to compete

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,080
and so that makes your product better

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,120
because you have those like

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,720
uh abstraction boundaries uh that

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,400
that they can check that those actually

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,480
make sense yeah

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,679
so i think that it's it's a good like

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,559
self-check

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,159
if your code is actually like good yeah

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,120
that's amazing thank you very much for

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,159
that advice

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:42,559
um so the final question

00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,200
so taking a look at your own um personal

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,080
projects

00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,840
uh within your own um personal uh repo

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,000
we noticed that you have a project there

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,840
called done so this is the acronym so

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,360
i know this not actually called this but

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,919
it's um called by some wider name but

00:25:54,360 --> 00:26:00,400
wtf is so so what is that and and what's

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:03,679
the motivation behind it

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:05,840
yeah so um it's kind of like a slide

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,000
project i actually forgot about it so i

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,679
i need to add a few a few more

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,120
definitions but

00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:15,520
it's uh it's a glossary of

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,880
uh of like terms you might encounter in

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,080
javascript

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:22,400
um like closure hydration

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,120
you know like things that sound like uh

00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,799
something

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,320
computer science concepts like

00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:29,039
memorization

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,840
uh some of them are just like uh some

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,120
tooling

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,640
or uh like just concepts that don't

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,720
really make sense but that

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:42,400
people kind of like that made their way

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,159
into javascript developer vocabulary um

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,320
but the point of that glossary was i

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:49,600
just can't find anything quite

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,200
like if i wanted to explain like one of

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,440
those words to somebody i couldn't find

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:57,120
like a place to link them to you

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,679
because uh wikipedia is just impossible

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,400
to read

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,200
it's like uh on computer science if you

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,200
open something

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:08,240
it's just i don't know there's

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:11,760
they assume so much existing knowledge

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:15,200
and like existing context and like

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:17,440
uh they're over complicating things

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,960
and then if you if you just search for

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,520
like simple definitions

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,720
uh on like blogs and articles a lot of

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,279
them are playing wrong

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,559
or misleading uh like the person

00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,399
misunderstood something

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,919
and then and then like wrote an article

00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,320
about it that's super calm and i mean

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,120
like

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,760
like i i can follow the same thing as

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,919
well

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,600
hopefully because like my material gets

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,320
a lot of circulation people will point

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,320
out the mistakes

00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:46,240
that's kind of the motivation is just to

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,880
have something that is worth it in the

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,240
way i would explain a concept to someone

00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,799
over lunch

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,960
yeah yeah and what i was thinking so

00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,720
earlier in the interview you said

00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,640
people should actually be contributing

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,440
to the smaller libraries and the more

00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,039
long tail kind of solutions and so this

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,440
could actually be a perfect

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,279
um you know project for people within

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,640
the finos community to raise pool

00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:11,840
requests against

00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,559
to help you maybe flesh it out yeah i i

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,000
don't think

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:19,440
this one is a good example because uh

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,520
it is also intentionally um it has a

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:25,600
very kind of

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:28,159
um well-defined voice

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,200
so it's it's like my writing it is very

00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,559
intentionally

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,640
um i don't think like uh anyone would

00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,279
write in exactly the same way and like i

00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,360
wanted to be

00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,640
written with my particular voice that

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,720
that's kind of like

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,919
an aspect of this project but similar

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,559
projects sure

00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,480
like they would sure and like especially

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,200
because people don't contribute as much

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,039
to

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,159
like they want to contribute code they

00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,840
don't want to like contribute

00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,600
documentation as much

00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,279
but that's actually like documentation

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,760
is one of the things that

00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,840
uh can be like really really difficult

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:03,039
especially writing good one

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:05,120
um so so maybe one way people could

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,559
actually help you is by racing an issue

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,960
you know something that they found that

00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:12,159
you might want to consider for inclusion

00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,120
in the glossary but sir yeah that's

00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,120
awesome so

00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,120
thank you dan for joining me today but

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,240
before we leave how can people follow

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,000
the work that you're doing

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,440
in the open source community and

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,600
potentially leverage it

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:29,520
for their own projects um

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:32,720
yeah um i i don't i don't know

00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:36,000
uh because i i have a twitter but i

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,559
i mostly just like uh post random things

00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,600
there

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:42,799
um in part because like

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,080
especially lately i feel like twitter

00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,799
has gotten so

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,919
uh like i mean technical twitter has

00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:51,520
gotten very

00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:54,559
kind of polarized uh in terms of like

00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,679
oh like this library like it's bad this

00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,679
library is like but

00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,760
it's it's just it's very emotionally

00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:02,320
taxing so i

00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,679
kind of stepped away from like technical

00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,720
discussions on twitter

00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:10,320
um and i prefer to have them on github

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,880
so but if i think like if we release

00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,960
anything

00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,039
important like if you're interested in

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,440
react just follow the react.js

00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:19,760
twitter account that's uh anything

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,559
important will be there for sure

00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,000
and on the rear js blog so again like we

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,520
post anything that's on the blog

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,480
that's going to be cross-posted on

00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,240
twitter uh so you can follow react.js

00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,840
as for my personal work uh you can

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,120
definitely follow me like

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:39,360
twitter.com slash dan underscore

00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:41,039
abramov but just be prepared that it's a

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,399
lot of random stuff and then somewhere

00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,799
in the middle maybe i

00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,760
post something about a project i work on

00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,600
that's amazing

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,480
thank you once again dan for joining us

00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:53,600
today and i really appreciate your time

00:30:50,480 --> 00:31:02,799
thank you have a good day ut

00:30:53,600 --> 00:31:02,799
