James McLeod's BIO

James is the Director of Community at FINOS and wholeheartedly believes the transformation of Financial Services can only be fulfilled if Open Source is embraced under the three pillars of Contribution, Consumption, and Community.

James has a twenty-year career in software engineering having worked for telecommunication startups, the gaming industry, digital streaming platforms, and financial services. Prior to joining FINOS James worked at Lloyds Banking Group where he focused on building engineering communities for Lloyds Bank, Halifax, Bank of Scotland, Scottish Widows and other LBG banks. While at Lloyds Banking Group, James also drove the adoption of Inner Source and Open Source partly through the creation of engineering guilds providing in-person and remote educational sessions and large hackathon events. James also spent a number of years consulting on software engineering projects for RBS, NatWest and Barclays.

As a member of the FINOS team, James’ ambition is to bring his extensive experience building communities to grow Financial Services into a powerhouse of Open Source. James is a true open source advocate and founded the “React London – Bring Your Own Project” meetup to provide an interactive forum for ReactJS and Javascript developers to come together. In the last two years it has grown to a membership of over 1500 individuals.
