hi

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,160
i'm keith burgelt i want to thank

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,519
everyone for

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,599
joining that was able to join today and

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,599
today we'll be talking about the

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,520
management of patent risk in open source

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,560
software particularly focused on

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,439
on banking and financial services uh

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,080
i want to thank the finos and uh and the

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,560
lf

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,000
for the opportunity to present today and

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,960
to be able to talk about

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,960
uh how open invention network is working

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,320
to be able to support freedom of action

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,800
freedom to operate

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,879
and increase the level of comfort that

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,239
uh banking financial services companies

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,719
in particular

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:47,840
uh feel in adopting open source uh code

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,079
uh and uh the uh

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,079
making good choices about about

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,000
innovative technologies that come out of

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,039
uh various projects

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,600
uh from uh the lf and uh

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,719
and other organizations aware that are

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,719
producing active code

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,720
i think it's probably no secret for

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,720
anyone who

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,000
has been active in the open source world

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,000
for some time

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
that every electronic touch that we have

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,600
today uh

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,040
is uh linux and or open source

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:24,400
software enabled and uh you

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,759
uh even if you're utilizing a uh ios

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,520
platform uh the

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,920
even though it doesn't run on the linux

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,720
kernel there's a significant amount of

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,840
open source

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,560
and linux code that's in in that's

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,600
running the

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,400
ios platform but obviously amazon

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,479
services

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,479
google searches and pretty much every

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,600
search platform that exists is utilizing

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,479
open source

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,720
the lights that we cross at the uh air

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,119
traffic control systems that we rely on

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,479
when

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:57,040
uh when we're flying uh

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,680
every social media platform whether it's

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,960
uh

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,600
in in asia based in asia or uh

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,560
or in the us uh is or in europe is

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,200
running on

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,800
open source software every atm

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,720
transaction that we have

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,239
every mobile payments transaction in

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,000
china uh

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,360
or wherever else in the world we're

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,640
utilizing that uh

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,400
functionality uh the autonomous driving

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,879
platforms that are being developed

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,040
whether it be by daimler or by the

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,160
apollo platform of baidu

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,760
or anyone else in the world those

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,640
platforms are being developed and open

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,360
source

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,560
chromebooks android obviously are

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,519
fundamental

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,280
uh open source platforms uh that are

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:43,440
built on top of the kernel

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:46,560
and so it's all around us in a way that

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,200
that few people uh that are

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,360
uh general consumers that are not in the

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,640
industry would truly understand

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,040
um uh while open source and linux are

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,239
not

00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,920
particularly well branded in products uh

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:05,040
they are nonetheless uh the engines

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,640
the platforms that drive innovation

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,680
uh and rapid cycle times and uh

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,680
a level of uh inventiveness

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,120
uh that would not be possible without

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,640
the whole idea of collaborative

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,440
development

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,319
i think you know we obviously see that

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,599
over the last

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:26,799
uh 15 years in particular

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,799
uh software has become

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,400
something that everyone kind of aspires

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,360
to incorporate in their products to make

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,480
them more

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,360
useful more beneficial to users uh

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,560
and to allow the products to be more

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,840
functional

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,239
and very few companies five years from

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,080
now will be defining themselves as

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:51,360
uh as hardware companies um we look at

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:55,920
uh the adoption of open source at

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:58,840
companies like kamatsu john deere uh

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,560
machine machining companies from germany

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:06,720
japan elsewhere in the world

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:11,280
companies that make lighting equipment

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:14,000
companies that make video equipment

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,879
all manner of companies across the world

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,959
whether they be

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,440
companies that have lived and been very

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,600
much identified with hardware

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,960
or companies that have grown a software

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,919
are increasingly

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,880
increasing the software centricity in

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,600
their products

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,000
and again uh no longer defining

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,600
themselves by hardware but rather by

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,160
software the

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,759
the nature of how this this works and

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,960
how the open source community works is

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,800
so important

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,120
to the output that we get the modality

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,800
of open source the idea that that

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,320
people come together collaborate and

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,240
produce something that would otherwise

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,160
not have been possible to produce

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,280
a level of innovativeness invent in

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,199
inventiveness

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,880
that's otherwise not possible through

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,880
siloed invention i think is where the

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,280
true power of open source is

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,400
because at some level it's an it's a

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,919
social movement

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:11,360
it just happens to produce uh technology

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:13,039
and code that can be used and reused by

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,560
literally millions of companies around

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,440
the world millions of entities around

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,960
the world

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:21,759
um but the reality is that this

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,759
this social movement is is so impactful

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,759
that it's truly transformative

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,600
because one plus one plus one doesn't

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,240
equal three it equals six or ten or

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,000
twenty

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,440
when we bring smart people together and

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,880
allow them to engage

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:38,000
around uh uh technical challenges uh

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:41,440
and with this we get more diversity

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,919
we get people from all around the world

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,560
it's

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,280
it's not race dependent or religion

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,280
dependent

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,639
or geographically dependent you don't

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,440
have to come to

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,720
silicon valley as you did during the dot

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,960
com era

00:05:52,720 --> 00:06:00,720
uh of the uh of the 90s to be able to

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,720
participate in uh in in open source

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,880
you can participate in situ from

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,840
wherever you find yourself in the world

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,400
and not just during covid but anytime uh

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,280
and that's

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,080
part of this great melting pot of

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,280
individual

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,360
capabilities and and uh and competence

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,800
to be able to create this new novelty

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,039
that's so valuable

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,039
to the products that we come to rely on

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,440
and the services that we use

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,520
so what we ultimately get are higher

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,680
levels of innovation

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,240
and we do it through this isn't talked

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,680
about a lot as a concept but

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,440
uh for me when when i think 12 years ago

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,479
i first had a conversation with jim

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,840
zemlin

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:44,080
about the notion of uh of

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,240
really project-based innovation

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,800
project-based collaboration that

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,080
projects were increasingly in his view

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,639
going to become

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,840
uh the foundation for innovative

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,280
platforms

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,919
uh and so as a result um at that point

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,919
linux was was clearly the the main

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,000
charge of jim zumlin and the others at

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,400
the linux foundation at that time

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,599
uh but since then we've seen all manner

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,000
of of uh

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,319
innovative projects rise up literally

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,199
hundreds of projects managed just by the

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,319
lf

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:19,440
uh the networking projects like opnfv

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:23,039
and onap opendaylight

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:26,960
the virtualization alliance

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:30,560
the risc-5 open hardware project

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,840
which is the risc-5 international which

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,599
is based in

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:38,960
in switzerland automotive grade linux

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:42,000
developing the digital dna of vehicles

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,800
out into the future and

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,240
not just supporting uh what we have in

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,960
the cabin of the vehicle

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,800
uh but uh ultimately supporting all

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,879
mission critical functionality

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,080
on a on a linux based platform

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,520
hyperledger

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,199
uh that supports the the development of

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,520
ledgering technology

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,240
uh and blockchain to be able to support

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,720
uh

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,560
lower fraud in in back banking and

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,840
financial services but also

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,160
uh many many other applications for uh

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,360
for this uh the code that's coming out

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,199
of hyperledger

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,360
the open container initiative there's so

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,960
many projects that are producing

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,759
incredibly uh uh significant amounts of

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,440
code

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:28,720
uh and we think about kubernetes and

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:32,399
it's clearly one of the most uh

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:35,360
significant uh innovations in terms of

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,279
containers over the last uh last ten

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,080
years

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,560
uh and so a lot of things were talked

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,080
about

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,920
that that really in in the 90s and 97

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,519
actually that that really are brought to

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,720
bear in the

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:54,640
uh in the in the modern era of uh

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,959
where open sources uh is becoming so

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,720
uh so significant and proliferating at

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,160
such a high rate across many many

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,640
different sectors

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,360
is that the idea of coopetation it's

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,279
it's very much

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,160
part and parcel of what open source is

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:11,120
about we cooperate

00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:14,320
cross-organizationally cross-culturally

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,880
across geography to be able to create

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,640
something

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,480
different to be able to innovate at a

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,399
higher level and then

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,640
the core code that comes out of that

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:26,000
innovation process is then available

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,640
to be used and reused adopted uh by

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,200
anyone who chooses to do so so long as

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,440
they

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,560
adhere to the rules associated with the

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,000
individual

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:38,320
uh licenses that the code is

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,600
actually produced under and so it's a

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,640
it's a very

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,839
uh elegant way of

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,320
of partnering and collaborating

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,000
that allows us to kind of get to a

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,040
realization of a notion that was

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,920
discussed

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,600
um in the in the 90s and really comes

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,640
out of game theory the idea that we

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,440
cooperate

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,080
to compete more effectively and it's

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,000
really

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,240
never been more prominently featured

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,839
than through the open source platforms

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,160
that we currently use and through open

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,519
source project collaboration

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,880
um i think a lot of people look at open

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,600
source and they think

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:21,200
uh especially people who are new to it

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:24,800
think that it represents some kind of

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:28,240
departure from traditional innovation

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:31,200
associated with uh

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,920
associated with inventive activities and

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,760
codification of those inventions

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,959
i think what we see from many many many

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,040
companies some of the largest

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:42,320
patent-holding companies in the world

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,200
are some of the greatest participants

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,000
in terms of number of projects they

00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,839
participate in the number

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,200
the amount of code that they contribute

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,720
back uh

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,720
the amount of code that they incorporate

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,279
in their products uh

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,800
and uh they also are some of the as i

00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,680
said some of the largest patent holders

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,160
in the world

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,680
and so this duality that that's really

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,440
designed into

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,800
their existence is something that i

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,040
think many in

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,000
in new in new industries or segments or

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,920
sectors

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,079
that are just beginning to adopt open

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,600
source code and understand

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:18,240
um it is a community activity it's a

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,120
it's something that that ties to

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,600
opportunity

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,519
great opportunity for innovation uh to

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,399
reduce cost and to be accelerate

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,200
innovation

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,560
while at the same time it also provides

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,480
some obligations

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,200
and those obligations are usually around

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,600
comportment how we behave how we utilize

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,120
uh how we comply with license

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,600
requirements and how we

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,399
uh create governance programs inside our

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,600
companies

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,440
to also how we support the use of

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,959
patents what is appropriate in terms of

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,680
how patents are used

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,360
on the basic concept that oin has

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,839
promulgated is that

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,200
uh where we collaborate where we rely on

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,880
each other to produce core

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,480
to where we want to be able to use and

00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,600
build on core code and build on each

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,839
other's ideas

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,880
we shouldn't be suing each other uh if

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,680
we want to maintain

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,480
patents that create differentiation and

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,560
support

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,680
innovation and that's what you know

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,240
there's so much diversity in the

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,920
community

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,639
some companies are incredibly supportive

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,959
of the patent system some companies not

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,200
whatever flavor of approach you take

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:22,240
whatever predisposition you have

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:25,360
uh there is very much room for

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,519
this duality of open and closed to exist

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:31,040
and open and proprietary to exist

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,399
and so um this form of practice duality

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,040
is something that more and more

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,680
companies are coming to and recognizing

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,320
that

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,680
uh that community solutions for patent

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,560
risk mitigation exist

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,000
like oin but also there's an obligation

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,399
a responsibility

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,440
to be able to support kind of defending

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,279
yourself

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,839
uh through the relationships you form

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,600
with multi-party entities like oin and

00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,600
what you do independently

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,040
whether it's making pledges or promises

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,519
of patents do you have

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,200
like red hat has done good dating back

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,279
now almost 20 years

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:08,480
uh microsoft is sorry mike

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:10,079
ibm has done dating back 15 years and

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,120
many many other companies

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,880
uh have uh have expressed kind of an

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,600
independent leadership

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,560
uh and a sense of responsibility to the

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,920
community by

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:25,760
by articulating uh a

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,639
a pledge or a promise or a a mode of of

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,720
conduct

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,600
that they're committing themselves to

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:35,040
related to their patent portfolio

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,360
there are many different uh

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,880
patent non-aggression initiatives

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,279
defensive patent management

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,720
organizations oin is the first and the

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,800
oldest it's

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,959
just reaching its 15th year in operation

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,079
but you have allied security trust which

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,120
is an anti-troll

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:56,240
mechanism rpx which largely uh

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,800
uh is a is it our anti-troll activity as

00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,920
well

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,040
unified patents which uh allows poor

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,040
quality patents

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,480
that have already been granted to be

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,600
attacked and to be

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,839
uh invalidated uh

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,680
and then lot network which is the newest

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,600
of these entities which started about

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,160
six years ago

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,880
and has actually had incredible growth

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,920
uh

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:22,480
in f and is focused on anti-privateering

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,240
uh to prevent companies from conveying

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,639
patents to third parties

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,440
uh and having those third parties then

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,000
sue

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,440
uh a plethora of other companies and so

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
that's a community that's now

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,800
i think a thousand members and quite

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,199
significant

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,160
in terms of reducing risk these are all

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:42,240
complementary

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:45,279
programs for the most part uh and oin

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:49,120
established as i said 15 years ago in oi

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:51,600
you know five with the original

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,240
six companies ibm red hat at that time

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,120
nobel

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,720
but now suse philip sony and nec and

00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,160
then google and toyota

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:03,519
joined a bit later in this decade to

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,839
support uh projects and platforms that

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,560
they

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,920
are they're very much responsible for

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,160
advancing

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,839
whether it be chrome or android or in

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,440
the case of toyota automotive great

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,720
linux

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,720
oin has 3 300 companies

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,560
that are participating in its community

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,680
they own over 3 million patents and

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,839
applications

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:27,519
worldwide that are subject to the cross

00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:31,440
license

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:33,279
our portfolio of owned patents is 1300

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,199
these are patents that read on many

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,240
different

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:41,759
technologies and provide clearance

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,759
for companies and projects uh as uh

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,959
as more and more open source code is

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,279
adopted

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,000
uh and we've spent over 100 million

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,959
dollars

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,040
acquiring uh defensive patents some of

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,360
which we've conveyed to companies

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,519
more forward deployed to them to allow

00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,560
them to

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:04,000
to manage risk more effectively

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,000
and we've

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,800
essentially served as a warehouse of

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,440
patents that read on companies that

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,320
uh were had set themselves up as patent

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,720
aggressors

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,800
i think it's no secret that oin one of

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,440
the major motivating factors 15 years

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,720
ago

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:24,800
for the formation of oin was the the

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:28,240
rhetoric and the uh uh the aggressive

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,759
uh behaviors of microsoft as a

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,480
monolithic threat

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,120
i think threat has morphed dramatically

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,399
uh

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,440
those of you who have been uh we'll see

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,800
that microsoft

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,800
is now a member of oin

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,720
for the last two years almost two years

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,680
to the day it's been a participant in

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,920
our community

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,399
and a participant in many other

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,560
communities such as linux foundation

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,240
and others and has been very very active

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,440
in supporting open source

00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:01,120
uh and uh and has become

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,800
a some an entity that recognizes exactly

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,039
what i described earlier

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,240
uh the twin elements of opportunity and

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,199
obligation

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,240
and it is uh been working very hard uh

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,839
with oin

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,919
on some of the projects we're involved

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,720
in to reduce risk from patents

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,000
uh as well as with github and and other

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,959
ventures to be able to

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,360
show uh that it is willing to and ready

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,480
to meet uh its obligations so

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,160
uh so oin has really piv is pivoting

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,000
and i'll talk more about that pivot in a

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,120
little while but uh

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,919
as a result of microsoft's participation

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,360
and a result

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,640
as a result of the uh the participation

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,000
and the reliance

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,240
uh and the recognition of

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,559
interdependence that so many companies

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,280
so many operating companies have formed

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,840
uh

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,679
um and the connection that they now have

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,720
with uh with open source

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:56,240
which makes uh uh the

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,960
potential of of risk associated with

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:02,000
operating companies uh to open source

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:05,919
uh lower but

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,440
but not exit not non-existent and so

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:13,280
uh we we have

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,520
developed a model where companies agree

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,160
through the oan cross license that where

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:21,440
they own patents that read on

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,919
core open source functionality uh

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,520
core linux functionality that they won't

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,360
use those patents to sue

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,440
and that they will share those patents

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,000
through through cross license which oin

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,000
manages

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,720
and that's essentially the linux system

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,120
and i'll talk again more about that in a

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,919
little bit

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,559
the just to give you a sense of the fact

00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,919
that

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:49,440
very in a very purposeful way uh oin

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:52,400
is a global organization it is uh

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,360
uh largely if we look at the largest

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,440
percentage it's

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,400
it's in east in europe middle east

00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,200
africa

00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,760
uh the us is obviously very significant

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,600
but

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,600
quite importantly asia pacific

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,600
represents 22

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,160
uh percent uh actually it's a little bit

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:11,039
more than that now it's almost 24

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,440
of our uh our total uh community

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:16,799
membership of 3 300 companies

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:20,160
uh and so uh as i said the

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:23,600
asia pacific is at 23 actually

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,440
um south and central america at 18

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,960
which is also very important to us to

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,559
ensure that the

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:33,200
uh the uptake of uh by companies uh

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:35,360
by governments in of open source in

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,720
latin america is recognized by having

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,760
representation

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:43,760
from companies uh from argentina

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:46,320
uh chile uh peru uh brazil obviously and

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,880
and many others uh north america

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,799
represents

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:53,760
24 and europe middle east africa 35

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,120
uh we like this kind of mix and we hope

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,600
that asia pacific and

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,360
and latin america continue to rise in

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,320
terms of percentage as more and more

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,640
companies

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,400
come to open source and come to rely on

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,640
it and come to participate in open

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,039
source projects

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,440
this is just a representative sample of

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,840
some of the community participants

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,360
from different sectors uh some of the

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,120
most sophisticated

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,840
network telecom companies and the

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,400
networking and telecom companies in the

00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,760
world uh

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,559
rakuten and geo are two of the the

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,440
most modern 5g networks to be launched

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,320
uh

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,440
uh one in geo is in india rakuten in

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,480
japan

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,679
uh a t obviously uh

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,720
a driving force uh behind uh

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:43,600
open source uh option adoption and

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,520
technology development uh through its

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,640
active participation

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,480
uh and support for own app opn fv

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,559
open daylight and other of the

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,600
networking projects the linux foundation

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,240
manages

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,840
uh you know most some of the the most

00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,720
significant internet companies in the

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,240
world

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:05,520
uh alibaba baidu tencent

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,600
uh uh huawei uh these are

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,360
an incredible group of companies and

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,880
again some of the largest patent holding

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,880
companies in the world

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,720
uh and some of the most successful

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,240
licensing companies in the world

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,000
recognizing again that that the fact

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,280
that you have a licensing program

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,120
and you're uh out uh utilizing your

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,000
patent portfolio in that way doesn't

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,080
exclude you

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,440
and you doesn't create this sense of

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,799
mutual exclusion

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,280
from actively participating in oin and

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,200
agreeing to reduce risk by sharing

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,679
patents that relate to core

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,360
open source functionality um the

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,080
automotive sector

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,080
automotive grade linux has created a a

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,640
sea change in how companies are are

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,919
participating in developing technology

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,880
uh and uh and as i said we can expect

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,919
that the

00:21:52,880 --> 00:22:00,080
increasingly uh platforms uh

00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:02,640
that uh on on com on which functionality

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,159
uh resides and applications reside for

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,440
automotive use will be

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:10,559
uh open source based whether it be agl

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,679
android for auto or otherwise

00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,000
um again another group of kind of who's

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,919
who

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,360
of large patent-holding companies but

00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,880
again some of the companies that i

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,760
mentioned like the industrials like

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,240
caterpillar

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,600
komatsu and others johnson controls

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,360
these are companies that you would have

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,159
never expected 10 years ago

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,840
even five years ago to be uh to be

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,760
moving and transitioning to being

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,520
increasingly software centric

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:38,400
but clearly that's that's their focus uh

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,000
the energy sector i think lf energy is a

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,799
is a stake in the ground

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,600
uh to indicate that that uh whether it

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:48,480
be general power generation distribution

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,240
uh grid management that uh that energy

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,480
companies are increasingly coming to

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,320
look to re-architect their networks

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,240
to be able to be more efficient and

00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,919
effective and serve their customers

00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,679
more effectively the fintech side

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,280
which we'll talk more about obviously

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,720
today uh

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,440
the two largest uh platforms in the

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,760
world

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,120
one is managed by ant financial which is

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,679
wechat pay

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,679
and then uh or alipay rather and then 10

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,919
cents wechat pay platform

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,520
these are uh these account for more

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,480
transactions in

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,760
uh in a day than most uh other uh

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,120
countries experience

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:29,360
in a month uh and uh software

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,880
sumitomo mitsui bank corporation one of

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,679
the hyper banks there are three hyper

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,120
banks

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:38,080
in japan uh ethereum blocko

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,799
union pay does all the clearances for

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,080
the

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:44,880
wechat pay and the alipay transactions

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,279
uh again these are massive platforms

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:51,120
doing billions of transactions a day

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:54,400
uh on mobile mobile device transactions

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,320
and uh so uh this is a

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,760
this it's not unusual that these kinds

00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,960
of companies would join

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,880
oin because it's usually the edge where

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,039
you have the most innovative companies

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,840
and uh and they're they're these

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:10,159
non-bank financial institutions are very

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,919
uh very passionate and aggressive about

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:15,200
utilizing technology

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,880
to be able to make uh payments uh easier

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,240
and more secure

00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,320
and financial i should also mention uh

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,559
which is a spin out of alibaba will be

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,279
going public in the near future

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:29,039
uh and uh ant is also the largest

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,440
microlender in the world which is

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,679
very significant uh because they they're

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:37,120
they're distributing capital to

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:39,039
many countries in africa uh and to india

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,200
where traditional banking

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,799
uh systems will not serve uh

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,279
microlending needs

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,880
uh but ant is out there i think setting

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,039
it being a trailblazer

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,039
in this uh this important area to be

00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,720
able to ensure that capital is available

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,960
to support entrepreneurship

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,080
of all of all stripes in in many

00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,919
different parts of the world that are

00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:01,600
typically unserved

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:05,279
by in terms of capital needs

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,960
uh one thing that i wanted to now

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,120
introduce is this

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,679
the where we are kind of in financial

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:15,600
services and banking and

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:19,840
and the uh the

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:22,640
uh what we try to do is monitor

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,360
uh where patents are that are being used

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,799
that are

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,559
potentially threatening to the open

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,279
source community that read on open

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,559
source

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:32,880
functionality and understand

00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,880
and support companies that are at risk

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,880
or in litigation

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,400
in financial services and across

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:43,039
technology sectors

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:45,679
um and so um over the the last uh

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,960
year and a half we've started to see a

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,960
rise in pae

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,640
so patent assertion entity these are

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,600
non-practicing entities

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:56,400
that own patents and that often acquire

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:59,039
them from operating companies

00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,520
how their activities are shifting to

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,159
focus

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,520
more attention on uh open source

00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,000
functionality

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,080
uh in either litigation or

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,360
pre-litigation assertions

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:13,360
uh and uh and also how operating

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:16,480
companies are becoming involved

00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:19,760
uh in uh in asserting patents

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:22,799
um and uh wells fargo pnc

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:25,200
adp uh these are all entities and

00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:28,960
financial services that have

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,000
experienced litigation uh in uh in the

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,600
recent past

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,720
and uh in the case of wells fargo

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:40,559
they were sued by usaa

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:43,840
and uh usa is also sued pnc

00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:46,799
um and this is uh not necessarily

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,720
a purely open source functionality issue

00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,919
but it's indicative of the fact that

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,559
litigation

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,799
in in an arena that's not that doesn't

00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,880
often have a lot of litigation

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,320
especially since the alice ruling which

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,440
is really limited the

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,720
the opportunity space for uh patent

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,000
assertion entities to

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:08,799
sue uh uh financial services

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,120
companies in particular uh usaa is an

00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:14,320
operating company largely in insurance

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:17,840
uh that uh has some patents that

00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:21,520
read on uh the functionality related to

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:23,679
the image capture of a uh of a check

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,679
and then the remote deposit via

00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:29,679
electronic networks

00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:31,840
the internet and uh

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,559
and this is pretty broad-based

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:38,159
functionality in terms of its use and so

00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:40,240
we can expect usaa will be suing

00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,320
a number of other financial institutions

00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:46,159
after it uh moves beyond

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,480
uh its pnc suit uh but it's indicative

00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,440
that

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,080
this is a community that we can expect

00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,120
more

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,799
activity and uh and more kind of

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,120
squarely focused

00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,159
open source uh functionality being

00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,520
targeted

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:03,360
um even though this is this is a i use

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,919
this as an indicative sign

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,760
of the future and it's not squarely open

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,080
source related at this point

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,399
um what we see from intellectual

00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,399
ventures and sound view innovations

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,080
to patent insertion entities

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,880
intellectual ventures perhaps one of the

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,360
best funded

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,880
patent assertion entities and sound view

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,360
one of the most active

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,720
uh litigants in the market these are

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,039
these are entities

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,720
sound view has a series of patents

00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,640
that's used over the years

00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,600
against financial services community and

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,799
beyond uh that read on hadoop

00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,960
uh functionality and uh or claim to read

00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:42,240
on hadoop functionality

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,159
and and so uh you know we obviously

00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,200
understand that hadoop is incredibly

00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,480
important to

00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:51,600
uh cloud providers um and uh

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,559
oin has included it in its linux system

00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,840
definition

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,799
quite recently uh along with additional

00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,080
kubernetes

00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:02,720
and kafka functionality and uh and so

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:05,200
we're very concerned about uh

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,960
about ensuring that the patents that are

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,240
held by sound view

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,480
have a minimal impact on

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,600
on open source uh choice and

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,480
functionality

00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,120
uh uh implementation intellectual

00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,320
ventures

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:23,840
has a series of patents that are claimed

00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:26,960
to read on uh on hadoop on kafka

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:30,080
and also on kubernetes so the this area

00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:33,440
is one that i think uh uh

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:36,240
uh that we can expect uh uh you know

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,600
these these significant players to be

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,039
more active in

00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,919
um and uh we have this early warning

00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,760
stein now

00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,080
but we can expect that companies that

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,360
own uh blockchain patents

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,760
because there are many small to

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:52,240
medium-sized companies as well as

00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,760
groups of aggregators that are for being

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,640
formed now

00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,919
to try to bring together uh critical

00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,080
massive patents

00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:02,320
we can expect that these entities and

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,080
potentially operating companies

00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,919
here and there that own blockchain

00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,840
patents can be

00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,279
uh potential patent threateners

00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,399
aggressors

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:16,000
and be involved in actual litigation uh

00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:19,039
beyond just pre-litigation assertion

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,120
uh oin is as i described earlier is in a

00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:25,039
the middle of a pivot right now

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:26,960
um we co-founded uh we recognized that

00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,960
we were largely set up to focus on

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,960
operating on operating company risk

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,279
as i said this monolithic threat that

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,960
existed but now microsoft has

00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,720
recognized this these levels of

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,600
interdependency and

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,480
need is a great driver toward pragmatism

00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,799
and uh

00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,399
and so it's behaving as i said in an

00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:47,520
exemplary fashion

00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:49,279
as a citizen of open source uh and we're

00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,720
hopeful that that continues and they

00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,880
understand that that's something that's

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,880
measured by time not by one event or two

00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,840
events or ten events even

00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,919
but anyway with microsoft being part of

00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,080
the community the oin community and

00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:06,320
agreeing to neutralize the risk from

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:09,039
its patents against open source um

00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,240
as defined by the oi analytics system

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:13,120
definition

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,640
they are actively and there are many

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,840
many companies that are

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:20,159
um that are

00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,240
selling patents to non-practicing

00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,880
entities having those patents utilized

00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,960
as i said this is privateering

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,159
and so patent assertion entities have

00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,080
lots of

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,600
patents some of which read on open

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,399
source functionality

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,080
and if they have them their goal is not

00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:37,519
to use them to support products because

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,279
they don't have products

00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,519
their activities are designed to

00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,640
generate a maximization of return on the

00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,320
investment they made

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,720
in acquiring those patents so they're

00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,279
out suing or trying to get licenses

00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,640
short of

00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:51,279
short of having to sue um what we are

00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,679
doing

00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,720
is recognizing that we need to be

00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,760
functional

00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,679
against paes and not just focus our

00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,000
attention on operating company risk

00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,399
because

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,360
operating company risk is declining

00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,240
although

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,440
still exists um what we want to

00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,559
recognize is this

00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,279
reality of pae activity and as part of

00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:15,039
this

00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:17,519
last november uh we entered into

00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:18,399
an agreement to co-found the open source

00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,279
zone

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:22,640
uh that unified patents maintains to

00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:25,120
challenge open source

00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,000
focused patents held by patent assertion

00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,640
entities

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,240
through iprs uh as well as the

00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,600
collection of information

00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,240
and uh crowdsourcing to identify prior

00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,080
art through

00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,240
unified so a number of things that

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,080
unified does and in doing so we

00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,720
partnered with linux foundation

00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,640
ibm and microsoft uh and i think it's

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,760
very important that ibm and microsoft

00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,080
came together

00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,679
uh to support this as well as the as the

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,840
lf recognizing

00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,039
all three recognizing the importance of

00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,080
neutralizing

00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:58,880
uh non-practicing entity risk

00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,720
and so we are funding that and

00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,080
supporting that together

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,679
um we also at oin have an active

00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,720
pre-issuance program

00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:10,399
uh it's uh quite likely these done these

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,600
are done anonymously but it's quite

00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:14,720
likely that we're

00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:17,200
among the top five if not the highest

00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,120
filer of pre-issue and submissions over

00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,640
the the last five years

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,799
uh and uh what it does is allow us to

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,080
reduce claim scope or encourage a patent

00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:28,960
examiner to reject

00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,559
out of out of hand a poor quality patent

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,720
application we look

00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,919
every week at new patent applications

00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,480
when they're published

00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,120
and then identify prior art from the

00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,559
community

00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,720
work with the open source community to

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:42,640
identify prior art to make sure it's

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,200
available to the patent examiner

00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,000
so that that he or she can can again

00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,240
reject

00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,440
or we did at the very least reduce the

00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,760
claim scope

00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,480
of patents that read on open source

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,640
functionality in some form or fashion

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,480
we also source prior art on a regular

00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,760
basis to provide to

00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,279
uh open source entities uh that are at

00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:07,120
risk or in litigation

00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:09,839
uh those of you uh who saw

00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,240
last year about this time there was a

00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:13,119
little

00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,960
earlier as october of last year that uh

00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:18,320
a patent assertion entity

00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:20,879
uh called rothschild sued gnome we

00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,399
started working with gnome uh just days

00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:25,679
after the filing

00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:27,280
uh and uh and were uh fortunate to be

00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,599
working with a great team

00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,800
uh gnome put together a great council

00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:34,879
relationship

00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:37,520
uh to be able to support uh the uh

00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:39,280
the negotiation of a very effective

00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,000
community-based settlement

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,679
uh with no fees being exchanged and so i

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,200
think that was a great win

00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:51,119
uh we were we provided a uh the

00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:52,800
content to counsel uh to be able to

00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,720
ensure that they can defend gadom in the

00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,760
most effective way possible

00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:00,800
regarding uh prior art uh

00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,599
and uh and help help to be able to be a

00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,800
part

00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:07,839
of the uh of the the the the

00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,760
uh the ultimate outcome uh but again uh

00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,440
the leadership at gnome deserves a

00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,599
tremendous amount of credit as does

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,520
external counsel for being able to get

00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,079
to the result that they got to

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,440
for the community we've also forward

00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,760
deployed patents

00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,280
i use this term before we put patents in

00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,440
the hands of companies that were being

00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,760
sued by patent aggressors

00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,440
uh several years ago we sold patents to

00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,160
salesforce to allow them to counter

00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,599
claim

00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:36,560
and to limit the damage from uh

00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,920
patent assertion by a company that was

00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,560
seeking to prey upon

00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,000
sales force's lack of patents at that

00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,480
particular time

00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,520
um and it's in its perceived inability

00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,680
to defend itself

00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,800
we allowed them to defend themselves as

00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,880
an equal in that

00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,480
uh that litigation that it was rapidly

00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,680
settled after we conveyed

00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:58,240
patents to salesforce we also uh

00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,560
have been involved and more recently

00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:03,520
involved in the use of cipher

00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:05,680
which is an ai tool for patent uh

00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:09,200
portfolio analysis

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:12,480
um that allows us to map open source

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:16,240
patent holder holdings

00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:19,280
uh to see who who owns pat who owns

00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,520
open source related patents and uh

00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,960
whether they represent what level of

00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,720
threat they represent

00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,839
uh to key projects and we do this on a

00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:29,200
project-by-project basis we started with

00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:32,000
linux we then go to

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,119
aglonapp and many many other projects to

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,240
look at risk

00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:38,839
uh to those projects of patents held by

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,640
non-practicing entities and operating

00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:43,359
companies

00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,480
the linux system uh definition the cross

00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:48,000
license scope

00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:51,040
the way this generally works is that we

00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,839
uh we look at foundations like the linux

00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,839
foundation eclipse apache openstack

00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:57,680
open atom eventually which is the

00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,960
chinese foundation that was announced a

00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,200
few months ago

00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,000
um we look at projects that are managed

00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,200
under those

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,920
by those those foundations organizations

00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,200
uh and we look at the core code that's

00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,599
produced

00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:16,640
in releases and we evaluate that

00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,520
through our from a legal standpoint we

00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,960
look at the

00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:23,680
the importance of it we look at the

00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,599
utilization of it so from a product

00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,640
standpoint where is it being used how is

00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:30,480
it being used

00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:33,200
uh and then we uh um we include

00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,480
uh that which is being used which is

00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,480
deemed to be core

00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,560
in the linux system definition and that

00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:42,160
helps us to develop a

00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:45,520
um a patent no-fly zone

00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:48,000
and it helps us to stay up with where

00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,359
where linux and other open source

00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,200
projects are going

00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:53,040
and ensure that we're neutralizing risk

00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,359
related to those projects

00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,640
and this collaboration we the

00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,079
collaboration that occurs on the

00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,760
technical side

00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,160
is paralleled with what happens on the

00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,480
legal side we work with the open source

00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,000
uh legal community on a regular basis to

00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,359
make sure we're up to date

00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,760
uh on uh on you know what should go into

00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,359
the

00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,920
what the issues are who's having

00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:16,000
problems with potential antagonists

00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,000
uh and uh make sure that we can

00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,160
intervene to be able to

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,920
neutralize risk but also it's very

00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,040
important that we have this open line of

00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,520
communication

00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,599
to identify what's core open source code

00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,800
and then to have it evaluated by

00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,079
our eight member uh oan uh technical

00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,960
committee and then our

00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:36,720
12-member uh technical advisory council

00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,119
which is made up of companies

00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,400
that are ordinary licensees that give us

00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,359
a broader view

00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,320
and help us vet more effectively we look

00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:46,880
at

00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,320
linux and open source projects and and

00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,839
these are some of the key ones that we

00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,760
follow and protect but there are many

00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:53,520
many others that we also protect

00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,960
and we look at the trajectory of these

00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,839
projects and when they're really

00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,560
producing

00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:59,280
very significant amounts of code and

00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,680
when

00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,400
when we need to be engaged to be able to

00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,320
support

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,320
the protection of not patent on

00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,880
aggression in those areas

00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:11,280
this just gives you an example of of the

00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,280
origins of some of these packages i mean

00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,119
the various projects that i mentioned

00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,520
but many others that beyond the ones

00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:20,560
that i highlighted that we're protecting

00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:22,240
uh this is kind of functionally where

00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,560
the packages come from

00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,520
there's a lot of reuse in open source

00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,680
obviously

00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,200
and so common base packages represent

00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,520
the most significant component

00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,320
but over time we've moved beyond just

00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,440
networking

00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:37,119
and to include mobility uh we've moved

00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,880
beyond the enterprise to include

00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,560
networking security mobility cloud

00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:44,640
computing the web

00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:47,839
and are continuing to evolve uh

00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,240
the the reasons people join uh oin it's

00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,839
free

00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,440
so it's one of the key components

00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:54,160
there's no no cost

00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,640
for to anyone other than the obligation

00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,720
to

00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,760
be able to engage in the effective cross

00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:01,280
license

00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:04,160
uh that uh that we require and to

00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,960
practice uh non-aggression against

00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,920
others on

00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,400
code that is core uh from major projects

00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,079
so

00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:14,720
we we reduce risk we we

00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:16,800
we look at what's being adopted um and

00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,119
ensure that what's important to

00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,839
you as a company is what's important to

00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,800
us

00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:25,119
uh as i said no monetary cost we do this

00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,359
defensive support work that i described

00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:29,680
what we did for gnome and we've done for

00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:31,599
many many other companies over the years

00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,280
uh and at the bot as a bottom line and

00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,400
this is something that that was very

00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,480
resonant with

00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,880
with microsoft when they approached us

00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,880
about signing the license is that

00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,760
it's there's a sense of authenticity or

00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,839
litmus test with 3 300 plus members

00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,440
uh in our community and some of the

00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,720
largest patent holding companies in the

00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,480
world as well as some of the most

00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,440
innovative and creative small companies

00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,560
in the world

00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,480
um the oins participate orient

00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,400
participation is really a litmus test of

00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,040
authenticity and it's something that

00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,760
aids in in very many ways in being able

00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,040
to hire

00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:07,040
and retain the best the best talent uh

00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,800
that really are people want to work for

00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,680
authentic companies in this community

00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,680
they have a

00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:15,680
a a moral compass that leads them to

00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,280
a place where uh where they want to be

00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,920
and where they want to work because

00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,880
talented people have choice and uh and i

00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,200
think uh

00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,359
you know everybody wants those uh the

00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,800
the talented most talented coders to be

00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:28,640
part of their team

00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,960
uh ultimately the only companies that

00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:34,000
don't sign the oan license and agree to

00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,839
to participate in the community are

00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,560
those that wish to reserve the right to

00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:39,359
sue on

00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,720
core linux and open source functionality

00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:42,480
now some companies are

00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,160
have not joined because they're they're

00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,839
on they want to understand the license

00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,440
and that's a normal process

00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:49,599
but for people who've looked at the

00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,440
license we've been around 15 years

00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:53,520
most people in open source where open

00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,480
sources has had its foundations in the

00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,960
enterprise

00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,119
and then in mobility and networking

00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,560
understand by now what oan is they

00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,160
understand it's free they understand

00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,400
it's a community service

00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:06,720
and they also understand that it's part

00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,040
of a of a set of norms

00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,960
that you adhere to when you're doing

00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,520
what's appropriate within this

00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,319
the social fabric of this community and

00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,760
so i want to thank

00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:19,760
uh again the lf and finals for

00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:22,160
my uh the opportunity to come in here

00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,960
today and to uh to speak

00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,680
and uh and i look forward to answering

00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,960
any uh

00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:32,880
any questions that uh that might exist

00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,880
from the participant

00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:45,839
viewers

00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,880
seeing that there are there appear to be

00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:05,119
no questions

00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:09,680
unless i'm missing them uh

00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:13,839
i will uh there are

00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,839
there are questions

00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,640
what are the advantages to non-patented

00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:21,440
work how do you convince companies

00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:24,079
to not add patents to work that they are

00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,280
doing how's that conversation go

00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,119
for companies that don't have a

00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:30,160
significant amount of money

00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:32,640
uh to be able to do a to publish

00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,440
a disclosure to essentially to file a

00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,240
patent

00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,839
and then they can always uh not go

00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,200
through with the actual registration if

00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:41,520
it gets granted

00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,119
for companies that that that don't have

00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,960
the money to kind of go through that

00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:47,760
process of actually having the patent

00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,839
drafted professionally and filed

00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,800
there are other other approaches that

00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:52,480
can be taken

00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,000
the key is to create patent or

00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,240
non-patent literature

00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,440
um that can serve as a source of prior

00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,280
art prius

00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,280
uh the the notion of defensive

00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,319
publications which uh

00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:08,480
uh ibm is probably

00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:11,119
the leader in this by far over history

00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,240
ibm produces thousands of defensive

00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,880
publications

00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,920
that it hosts on a site that's managed

00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,760
elsewhere

00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:23,119
uh uh that it's ip.com

00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:26,880
and that's a very good way because that

00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:30,560
that uh repository sits on the desktop

00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:33,200
of uh of patent trademark office

00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,240
examiners and so they when they do their

00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,240
searches

00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,359
patent literature is always the most

00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,800
important thing

00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:41,760
but then they start they look at

00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:44,400
non-practice non-patent literature

00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,520
as well and so that can be uh

00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,480
influential

00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,359
so it's not only um patenting is not the

00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,079
only way

00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:53,280
to get at this and and uh defensive

00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:56,240
publications are

00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,520
very inexpensive in relative terms to

00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,440
pursuing a patent

00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,200
uh program but there are many many

00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,480
companies now that come to us that

00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,880
that tell us that they want to have a

00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,720
defensive portfolio i think red hat's a

00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,240
perfect example this is a company that

00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,920
that's pledged its patents it would

00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,119
never use its patents against the open

00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,280
source community

00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:15,520
um but nonetheless it has a very

00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,599
significant and important portfolio

00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:19,440
to allow it to defend itself and its

00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,760
customers and so i think there are

00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,319
examples of companies that have done it

00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,359
uh that way that have had the resources

00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:27,359
to do it that way

00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:28,880
and they're examples of companies that

00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:31,760
that will publish

00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,520
uh through defensive publication means

00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:36,079
it's essentially a patent

00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,440
the summary of an invention without any

00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:40,240
patent claims

00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,359
uh and that's what a it's a much briefer

00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,040
briefer document

00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:45,760
but again it serves as a statement of

00:45:43,040 --> 00:46:00,880
prior art as well

00:45:45,760 --> 00:46:02,800
any other questions

00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,480
okay well thank you very much it's been

00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,599
a pleasure to be here with you today and
