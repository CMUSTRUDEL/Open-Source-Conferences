uh

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:13,360
i would like to invite our first

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:17,039

kim prado our vice chair from rbc

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:31,840
dove kim take it away

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,960
the finnos governing board includes

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,399
representatives from the many type of

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,840
companies that make up the financial

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,239
service industry

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,280
this includes buy-side and sell-side

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,520
financial firms

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,360
fintech companies and open source

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,440
technology and service funds

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,440
this diversity is essential in shaping

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,800
strategy and direction

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,320
representatives from these companies

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,239
come from both technology and business

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,600
areas and this is key in shaping

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,840
views and understanding how different

00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,199
projects will provide different value

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,480
some technical projects

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,480
for example include the cloud

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,159
certification and assurance effort

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,360
which ensure that infrastructure that we

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,920
set up in the cloud has all the

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,320
appropriate

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,920
controls applied data transformation

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,880
efforts with goldman sachs legend

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,400
ecosystem

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,080
and synthetic data management with

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,080
cities data projects are two other

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,520
examples of tech projects going on

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,840
foundation the finding standards to

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,840
share

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,280
financial objects between desktop

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,320
applications

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,040
regulatory technology in the finnos

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,840
open reg tech initiative expressing

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,840
business

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,000
logic in a way that can generate code in

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,720
projects like morgan stanley's warfare

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,159
or just more examples board members

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,000
perform the dual role

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,759
of driving interest within their own

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,479
firms and working closely with the

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,640
foundation

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,159
staff and other board members to

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,680
identify and share

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,640
industry challenges that can be

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,880
addressed by open source solutions

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,000
with real potential to impact the

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,280
industry in a great

00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,399
way the diversity of views

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,799
and the trust to speak openly with peers

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,799
who may also be your competitors like

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,560
joe for example

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,239
is a critical factor in driving the

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,319
direction of the foundation

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,840
in our last governing board meeting we

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,160
took a step further

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,520
and established a finnos diversity and

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,440
inclusion committee

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,280
ali will talk more about this later this

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,599
morning

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,560
last year when ali and i were on stage

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,520
gap mentioned

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,200
that we had reached the chasm 2020 has

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,599
been a blockbuster year for thanos

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,519
and we've definitely crossed that chasm

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,959
validating our several years of hard

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,560
work and partnership

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,080
we finally hit the tipping point where

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,440
financial institutions make up the

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,040
majority of code in the project

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,400
contributions

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,239
our relevance in the industry was

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,160
validated when we joined forces this

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,160
year with the linux foundation

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,599
and code contributions reached a record

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,160
high of 1500

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,599
last month we had about an order of

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,560
magnitude less last year and this

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,080
shattered our previous record by 40

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,680
we are really excited to have joined the

00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,360
linux foundation as their financial

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,280
services umbrella

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,040
binos has always approached accelerating

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,760
open source and financial services

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,959
from multiple angles supporting firms as

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,239
they establish their policies and

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,440
procedures about open source

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,680
contribution

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,120
providing a trusted neutral platform

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,120
from a technical view

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,840
as well as a cultural and strategic one

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,280
sharing experiences and up

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,239
and providing a home for open source

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,280
projects and standards of that

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,640
particular relevance

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,319
to the financial services industry

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,080
as joe mentioned we're seeing this

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,799
approach pay off with increased

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,080
contributions and engagement from banks

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,239
some banks making their first

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,239
contribution as they find that tipping

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,000
point that they did last year

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,440
while others are making their third

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,480
fourth and beyond

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,640
and are becoming more streamlined

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,680
firms are recognizing the benefits of

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,560
leveraging

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,319
finno's projects later today i'll be

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,120
speaking about perspective which was

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,040
originally contributed by jp morgan

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,680
others are getting the internal buy-in

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,439
to take the next steps

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,680
this increased visibility is also

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,680
driving interest

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,200
innovation and devops sigs are two

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,360
examples where we're drawing both wide

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,200
interest and new participants

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,959
new participants and partnerships and

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,560
collaboration with organizations who

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,000
recognize finno's potential to help

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,400
further common cause

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,759
such as is the and air collaborations

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,600
that are on the table

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,799
and partnerships emerging at home within

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,400
the linux foundation

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,960
where there is now a more devoted focus

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,880
on the financial services industry

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,000
open source in financial services is a

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,960
reality because it's good for

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,639
individuals

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,479
and it's good for companies it's good

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,560
for business

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,759
we're pleased to be involved with finnos

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,639
and this conference

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,720
and hope it gives you some idea of what

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,040
open source and financial services can

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,800
do

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,840
as well as some of the exciting things

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,199
that are happening within the foundation

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,280
if you're not already involved in a

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,440
fitness project then please do ask us

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:56,970
or any of the venos team or check online

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:58,560
