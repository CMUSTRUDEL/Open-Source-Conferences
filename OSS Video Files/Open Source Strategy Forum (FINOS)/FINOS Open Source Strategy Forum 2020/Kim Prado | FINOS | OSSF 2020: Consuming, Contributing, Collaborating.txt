[Music]

00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,679
thank you all for being here

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,400
my name is kim prado and i run client

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,799
banking

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,880
and digital technology across capital

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,600
markets at rbc

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,000
what what does this mean i manage all

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,720
technology that pertains to client

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,359
all the touch points all the trades all

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,760
the data

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,400
as well as our external properties

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,000
websites

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,440
etc my main focus is to enhance the

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,239
customer experience

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,040
for our users through our tools and

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,520
applications as well as to assist

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,559
them a deepening of their relationships

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,320
with external

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,960
clients as you can imagine this is very

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,760
challenging

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,280
and can take many avenues to achieve

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,520
this goal

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,640
we have built applications from the

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,800
ground up

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,840
we have purchased new software that

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,120
we've integrated

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,600
into our ecosystem we have hired experts

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,680
in the field of big data and analytics

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,000
we have hired data scientists

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,880
we have partnered with universities and

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,080
our own

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,560
internal innovation labs but perhaps

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,119
the one thing that has stood out over

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,159
the last

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,960
few years has been our partnership with

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,920
the finnos

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,560
and linux foundation and the success we

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,840
have had

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,880
in the open source community so i am

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,200
here today

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,960
to talk to you about our journey the

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,360
challenges we face

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,079
how we overcame those challenges our

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,960
focus

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,439
on the customer experience and how we

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,040
have benefited from our partnership

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,040
with the open source community

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,640
so i always like to start with our

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:54,000
strategy which is one two three

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,960
first we go and we collect all the data

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,840
we take we we bring it all together the

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,799
trades

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,479
the missed trades the crm information

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,920
the structured information the

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,640
unstructured data

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,960
you name the data set the first thing we

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,080
do

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,160
is bring that data together then we

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,200
layer intelligence on top

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:18,480
what does that mean well alexa

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,440
who covers pimco that's what i mean we

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,560
want

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,440
to take the data and make it smart right

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,680
serve up those customized experiences

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,319
but in a way that is so seamless to our

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,760
user

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:34,480
hence number three the client experience

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,599
serving our data up in a way that is

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,959
proactive

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:41,680
actionable and leads to

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,720
leads to true revenue lifts is our main

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,480
goal

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,840
so how do we do this well let me take

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,400
you back in time

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,120
as you can see we're having a vintage

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,680
user experience right now

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,680
so this is our application called sales

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,680
book that we started

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:04,720
years ago in built it out in wpf

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,280
but what this did was lay the foundation

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,159
for us to collect the data the

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,840
e-commerce

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,000
all the electronic trades all the

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,640
inquiries all the executed trades

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,840
the missed trades all the holdings all

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,560
the market data

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,120
all the pricing you need the data set we

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,959
laid

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,519
the pipes from 2014 till even till now

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,720
to collect this information right but

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:31,040
this is where we were

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,040
in 2014 through 2018

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:38,319
fast forward to 2018

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,920
2017 2018 our journey is still

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,799
vintage however we tried we made an

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,400
attempt at

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,360
using html5 ourselves so the evolution

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,120
was

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,159
dotnet wpf html5

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,799
but we learned very quickly that in the

00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:58,159
html5 space

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,799
we needed help so that brought us to

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,200
here

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,439
and at this point we integrated with

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,840
open fin and they helped us

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,120
really take our html5 strategy to the

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,319
next level

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,560
but this is where we got to by creating

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,599
the rbc ecosystem

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,680
so using workflow interop

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,880
all those good things we've been able to

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,799
bring together

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,000
all our different analytics and data

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,919
sets

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,360
so from this screen you can see our

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,639
client analytics

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:33,040
our client flow our client 360

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,040
and our notifications on the bottom

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,320
and then leveraging all of that and all

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,680
the additional data sets in the

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,680
ecosystem

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,720
we've been able to continue to integrate

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,720
the community

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,000
and as you can see from our client flow

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,680
blotter you'll see

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,560
all the all of the third-party idbs

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,759
trading systems integrated right

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,000
we'll move on that sets up all up for

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,040
our

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,880
partnership with bloomberg which enabled

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,600
us to integrate our own

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,479
bulletin platform in with the bloomberg

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,759
windows

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:10,720
and then our flow aura blotter

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,639
with the bloomberg windows and on in our

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,199
bloomberg chat integration with our

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,520
system through interop

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,360
and then our bulletin but you can see

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,880
these are the old windows right

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,039
well these are the old windows that were

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,880
slowly migrated to the new windows

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,320
but we were able to do this in a phased

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,120
approach that did

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,880
that enabled us to buy time and train

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,600
our users and get exactly what they

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,199
needed

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,400
but that wasn't enough so that led us to

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,880
open source

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,520
so if you can't build it and you can't

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,240
buy it

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,400
then you want to open source it right so

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,560
this is the evolution of how

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,600
we were able to sell the idea of open

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:54,000
source within the rv within rbc

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:56,160
so in the 1899 everybody was building

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,120
build build built then we had the rise

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,560
of the vendors

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:04,720
and it was built in and buy and now

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:07,919
open source so the fitness organization

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,160
has led us to the to the point where

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,759
we've been able to integrate with many

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,800
of the projects that are going

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,680
on specifically i'm going to speak to

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,840
perspective

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,479
which was originally contributed by j.p

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,440
morgan

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,039
and if you go to fitness.org and github

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,800
slash videos slash

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,880
you can see the perspective libraries

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,360
are there they're easy to download

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,960
and they're easy to use but why am i

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,319
such a prospective fan

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,960
well let me show you why so here's an

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,639
example

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,800
of one of the screens that we were able

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,160
to integrate into perspective

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,840
integrate using perspective so

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,080
this data that you're looking at here

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,280
has

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:54,720
millions of rows associated with it it's

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:57,919
slow it was hard to bring into a screen

00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,080
it took forever for me to get our

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,039
developers to make one simple little pie

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,440
chart

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,639
well what perspective has given us is

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,000
the ability

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,400
to actually provide visualization

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,319
on top of our data sets in a

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,360
configurable way

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,840
so underneath here you'll see okay this

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,319
is a neat heat map and a chart

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,080
but within the perspective ecosystem

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,000
there's probably another

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,800
30 plus visualizations that are

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,880
available so once you plug your data set

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,639
into the prospective libraries

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,960
you very quickly are able to deliver

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,560
really interesting information about

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,599
your data

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,479
so for example here in arsenal higher

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,800
spend

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,960
again this is all dummy data you can

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,000
quickly see how much we're spending with

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,360
that company

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,199
right and across what lines of business

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:56,960
and what sectors etc but the key here is

00:07:53,199 --> 00:08:00,639
nobody had to code so

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:04,080
it's configuration through the supply

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:06,720
through the prospective libraries anyone

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,120
and i mean anyone in the organization

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,919
can

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,080
can set it up themselves so what we've

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,000
what we've had to do is put governance

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,479
around who's allowed to do this

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,280
and entitlements and so on but through

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,160
that

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,039
we've been able to deliver faster

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,879
cheaper

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:28,000
and so much more advanced features

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,680
in such a short period of time that um

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,599
that it's enabled our business to just

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,479
be able to make decisions

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,440
so much easier it's also enabled our

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,640
quant teams

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,959
to be able to visual see visualizations

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,880
of data quickly so as they're working

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,599
through new models they can very easily

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,839
see

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:49,279
you know how is this working right what

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:52,880
if analysis and so on

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,080
so that leads me here so the pandemic

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,120
strikes

00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:00,480
right everybody's shifting all so

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,360
this leads us to this which is one of my

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,560
favorite

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,399
ways of looking at open source versus

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,519
build versus buy

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,480
so if you think about an asset light

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,680
economy

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,279
what does that mean well uber let's look

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,720
at uber for a second

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,959
uber doesn't have cars right they don't

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,560
they don't have a lot of people right

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,880
they don't pay for that

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,440
it's asset light they have third party

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,120
people who drive their own car

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,440
to deliver people where they want to

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:35,040
come same with doordash

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:38,160
uber eats etc it's an acid

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,120
light economy and i like to think of

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,399
open source

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,279
in the same way it's asset light i don't

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,959
have to go

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:49,600
hire developers to build visualizations

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,080
i can leverage the open source community

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,360
for that

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:56,000
feature i don't have to go by you know

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,000
hire developers to build interop i can

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,880
leverage the open source community for

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,240
that

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,560
so by thinking asset light you're able

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,680
to

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,959
think what can i do without adding

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:12,000
more cost and overhead to the overall

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:14,160
program so if you look here

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,240
this article is saying the emergence and

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,680
growth of virtual businesses

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:23,440
provide right i can't stress this

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,440
this enough like the amount of times

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,040
i have sat in meeting rooms and the

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,399
business needs something

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,560
and my it department my it team says

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,760
well i'm gonna need to add three bodies

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,519
to deliver that

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,360
if i had a dollar for every time that

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,839
work that that ass came

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,959
up i wouldn't need to be working anymore

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,959
right

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,640
so the more we can look to the open

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,440
source community

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,680
for things or software or solutions that

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,079
are

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,000
part of the way there we are then in

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:55,680
turn saving our business

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,920
money we're buying time you know we're

00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,640
our time to market goes up and we're not

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,800
spending as much money so

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,079
let me walk you through why i'm so well

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,600
i'm such a believer

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:10,240
of this and the asset light model

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,600
again just focusing on perspective which

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,000
again i just want to repeat

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,360
was originally contributed by jp morgan

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,040
so thank you jp morgan

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:23,279
for doing this um so perspectives code

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:26,240
base currently sits at approximately 170

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,640
000 lines of code today in the open

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,760
source

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:33,920
iteration rate divided up 40

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,040
javascript 30 c plus plus and 20 percent

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,000
python

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,959
30 000 lines of this was developed

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,000
internally as proprietary software

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,440
before open sourcing so over its

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,640
lifetime

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,040
as open source the code base has seen

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,320
well

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:55,600
over a million lines of code committed

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:59,200
or altered that is

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:03,279
the poster child for open source right

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:09,200
that is why that is why i am such a fan

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:12,720
that's just one example 4191 commits

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,200
to the open source repo with 500 coming

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,720
in

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:20,000
outside of jp morgan chase

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:23,440
come on that in itself is just

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,560
mind-blowing right so

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:29,200
with this you know perspective has over

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,720
6 000 test scenarios which we run

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,680
on 15 separate os hardware

00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:37,360
configurations

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:40,880
so i mean why not try it right

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,880
what's your downside and so what we've

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,399
been able to see at rbc

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:49,440
is time savings head count savings

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,760
cost savings but most but

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,600
really really the biggest one is the

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,959
reputational savings

00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:00,240
we are using software that

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:03,920
right out of the gate is adopted

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,639
and really really appreciated

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,200
and has taken our business to another

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,680
level

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,959
right because they are not the first

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,639
ones to use it

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,800
they don't have to live through the fact

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,040
that we delivered something oh and the

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,320
qa oh we miss that will come back

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:23,360
right the quality factor is

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,800
way higher in fact by doing this it has

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,320
raised the bar

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,000
on my development team so high that

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,440
they're looking to use as much open

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,040
source as possible

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:37,279
across now

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,399
so where are we heading with all of this

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,360
right

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,639
so we are building out our next

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,800
generation of tooling

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,920
again using perspective using open

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,600
source

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,920
by and using you know the content

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,959
the concept of searching across the data

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,519
set

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,839
called the cortex so right here you're

00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,160
looking at a filtered view of one of our

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,360
one of our accounts granted this is all

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,800
development data so

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:07,360
nobody worried it's all qa data

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,120
but what we're showing here is being

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,199
able to filter down

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,399
and then quickly visualize the

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,440
information

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,880
right so if you filter on one client you

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,920
get their live stream

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,720
but you also get neat visualizations

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,199
that tell you

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,600
what your next step is or what your next

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,920
action is

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,360
that tied in with our concept of a smart

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,000
chat window it's not really a chat

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,839
window it's

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,720
a smart just question window

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,360
right so what is the month to date you

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,480
know

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,959
uh revenue for rock inc right and that

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,920
gives you

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,199
a search window of all the data sets so

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,240
if you think about it

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,120
we're enabling searching but we're also

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,880
enabling

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:55,279
a smart question window so

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,880
really i don't want to call it a chatbot

00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,320
but i want to call it

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,880
a smart answer window so

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,639
for example right now you have to go to

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,240
multiple places you'd have to go to

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,120
multiple places to ask multiple

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,360
questions

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,639
what the cortex does is it ties it all

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,959
together

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,480
right it's one window where you can ask

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,600
it any question you want

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,079
and it will bring you back an answer but

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,880
more important than that what this does

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:26,720
is it ties together the whole strategy

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,000
it's showing it exposes all the data we

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,920
collected in one

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,040
it exposes all the analytics we're

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,480
putting into

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,639
and then it's serving it up in a

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,680
customized client experience

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,680
for our end users

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,240
thank you all for taking the time to

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:51,519
attend my presentation

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:51,519
