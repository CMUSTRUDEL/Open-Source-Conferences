opportunity

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,079
no really it will only be this once so

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,670
please welcome neil power

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:03,329
and gab columbro

00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:03,329
[Music]

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:12,479
hey neil it's great to have you here

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,520
not only because i'm really looking

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,920
forward to here

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,080
uh you know to hearing from you about

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,560
the financial services landscape but i

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,960
know

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,920
you have pretty strong views on open

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,159
source as well

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,560
so um just just as an anecdote i i

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,079
came across neil uh as i was listening

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,960
to a podcast once

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:35,680
uh called power to the people which i

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,759
think it was a pretty clever name

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,920
uh but that's what i you know for the

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,920
first time i came across neil and i you

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,159
know i heard these

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,600
very senior technologies talking about

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,840
open source and that was

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,680
you know a few years ago very different

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,640
time so

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,040
neil uh we we've been collaborating now

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,200
for

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,119
you know a couple of years as you are

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,240
cto where you are and then

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,560
in your role as cio at deutsche bank

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,360
um you know it was about two years ago

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,880
i'm i'm

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,600
a little bit scared of asking the

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,840
question given you know 2020 but how's

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,239
2020 been treating you

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,000
well first of all thanks for having me

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,959
dav it's great to be here

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,760
and uh look i'm i'm very fortunate that

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,480
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,000
um has been good for me and my family in

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,959
the context of things i mean we've

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
managed to stay

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,239
safe and relatively sane during

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,720
uh you know what can only be described

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,120
as an incredibly challenging time

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,280
um it's been sort of interesting right

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,720
i'm i'm a i'm a mountain biker

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,640
and i bike in new york city as well

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,480
which is where i live i'm i'm

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,000
i'm in my basement in brooklyn as we

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,280
speak and

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,200
you know one of the things i've noticed

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,480
in new york and my my family in london

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,000
tells me the same is that

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,400
you know we're seeing a lot more

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,760
creation of bike lanes and pedestrian

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,680
zones and so

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,360
for all of the negative things obviously

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,879
um that have come out of cove but it's

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,159
also really interesting to see some of

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,319
the positive things

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,840
that have come out of it as well and i

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,040
you know when i think about it i think

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,599
that the same can

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,720
can can hold true for finance you know

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,159
um

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,959
but covet has accelerated the importance

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,120
of digital transformation for sure and

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,440
if you think about us living in a time

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,519
where budgets are smaller and

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,959
spreads are tighter and fees are being

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,080
compressed and margins are being

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,200
compressed

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,200
um you know that's really challenging to

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,640
come and transform your technology into

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,959
a digital world

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,000
uh on a budget and so i think there's

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,480
some really interesting

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,239
sort of challenges ahead of us and

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:41,040
kobet's only going to accelerate them

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,599
well that's that's fascinating but let

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,959
me drill down a little bit into this

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:49,920
sometimes somewhat amorphous concept of

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,760
of digital transformation um i just want

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,080
to try to unpack it for a second

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,360
uh you know just to split the the

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,680
buzzword from the actual substance there

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,720
um you know there's no doubt as you say

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,879
that that

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,920
um the industry is undergoing a major

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,560
change and you know

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,680
we certainly have seen uh kovit

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,080
accelerating the

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,760
you know this process in many respects

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,400
uh many respects i mean

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,079
on our side you know we've seen firms

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,639
being much more comfortable of course

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,120
with remote working we distributed teams

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,880
which

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,479
you know of course is really how open

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,199
source is made

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,400
uh and you know that has turned into a

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,800
major uptake

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,479
of open source contributions from banks

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,800
in our community but

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,080
you know how do you think the industry

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,800
is doing more broadly

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,280
with this you know digitalization in

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,520
achieving this digitalization

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,400
it's an interesting word digitization

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,800
because i

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,400
i've asked a lot of senior executives

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,520
across the industry what it means to

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,680
them

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,280
and i get very different answers and so

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,600
i decided to sort of

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,199
think about it for myself for a bit and

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,639
you know ultimately the way i've been

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,639
trying to explain visualization to

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,080
people is that really it's doing things

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,840
with data

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,199
and so i think one of the side effects

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,600
of of wanting to

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,199
you know be more digital forcing firms

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,759
to think about their data strategy and

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,400
how they

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,240
address data internally now obviously

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,160
there's a i think a super important

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,000
element of digitization that also has a

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,720
lot to do with operations and

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,280
and process but i think getting the data

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,840
right

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,360
is key and so if you if you sort of

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,360
couple that with

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,960
you know we want to get our data right

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,160
we also want to start moving off some of

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,720
our legacy

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,199
infrastructures like mainframes and

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,919
moving to more modern things like cloud

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,280
it really tells you that uh we can't

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,680
just do this by

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,320
by reaching in and sort of fixing our

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,120
data

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,120
in the um you know in the legacy system

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,560
there'll be many places where we need to

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,000
re-engineer

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,560
and i think when you think about

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,240
re-engineering in the year 2020

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,680
you really have to ask yourself you know

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,800
the sort of the question that we've

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,440
asked ourselves

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,199
in the past around buy versus build um

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,800
but i stopped using the phrase by versus

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,120
bill because i feel like first of all it

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,919
doesn't necessarily include open source

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,960
uh and so i've been using the phrase um

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,080
leverage versus

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,000
event and i think that if you're opposed

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,759
with this challenge if i want to

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,240
start to get out of the world i've been

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,759
in and i want to be more data oriented

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,000
and more digital

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,840
uh i've got to change something and if

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,840
i'm going to change things

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,639
do i want to reinvent everything myself

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,600
or do i want to reuse wherever i can

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,880
and i think that teases up for a really

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,160
interesting you know

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,039
next three to five years um you know i

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,759
was really

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,600
encouraged to see what goldman's done

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,160
through the open sourcing of legends i

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,639
think that's

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,560
that's phenomenal and just reading about

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,520
how that's starting to be used now

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,960
by other uh members of finos i think is

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,440
is really cool so

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,800
you know there's no doubt that um you

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,160
know the incumbents by

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,039
by contributing things that they've

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,800
built to the open source community

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,199
it's gonna be a much better way than all

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,360
of us sitting down with a blank slate

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,039
and trying to by committee design what

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,120
the future looks like and so

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,560
i think there's a lot of very promising

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,960
things happening

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,440
but uh but there's a lot of work to be

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,440
done as well

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,240
that's so true and you know thanks

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,800
thanks for calling out

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,919
the legend contribution from goldman

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,199
sachs it's been

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,560
you know hard work for us uh and for the

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,720
goldman team which i

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,240
you know of course i send the biggest

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,599
shout out to but

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,000
um you know i just wanted to point out

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,639
there

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,639
i think we are absolutely on the same

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,520
page when it comes to

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,520
a you know contribution from banks let's

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,000
not reinvent the wheel that's really the

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,240
ethos

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,080
of open source but what we have seen as

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,199
well is that

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,199
you know it's not only the value of you

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,840
know taking software being able to adopt

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,120
it you know

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,120
software that becomes more and more

00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,800
commoditized

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,840
but we were pretty encouraged by hosting

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,160
athena's an instance of legend which

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,039
allowed actually our banks to

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,960
not just banks but regulators and uh

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,199
other pretty much any constituents to be

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,639
invited and participate and collaborate

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,440
directly on the model

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,479
themselves which uh you know i think

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,080
opens up

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,840
pretty pretty interesting uh um

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,280
you know opportunities even for those

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,000
firms that are maybe not necessarily

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,960
ready

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
uh you know to do full-blown open source

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,560
um but

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,360
you know how do you why do you think

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,440
we're seeing

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,919
so that so much sort of readiness at

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,320
this point for for the industry

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,240
um you know to have this industry wide

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,040
collaboration through open source

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,360
yeah i mean it's it's still in its early

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,080
um

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,440
stages but i think first of all i i have

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,200
to commend what what

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,800
what all of you have been up to at finos

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,880
over the last you know

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,640
four or five years now i think you've

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,680
taken the term open source and made it

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,399
less

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,959
scary to incumbents particularly to sort

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,760
of

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:06,320
you know um legal and compliance

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,519
functions that obviously had a a hurdle

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,160
to get over in terms of

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,720
understanding how it's done and how to

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,040
do it in

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,800
in a way that protects the intellectual

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,640
property of the firms that they're there

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,080
to uh to represent so

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,920
i think first of all there's a there's a

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,920
much better foundation now than perhaps

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,120
there was five years ago to even try out

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,120
some of these things

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,519
but i think also there's a reality

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,640
sinking in which is the opportunity cost

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,040
of engineers

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,839
is incredibly high and so if you have a

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,760
limited

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,959
number of engineers to solve a problem

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,640
you want to focus them

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,959
on the the parts that most differentiate

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,040
you

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,440
and so you know i think what we're

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,760
starting to see is a lot more services

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,959
pop

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,880
up that um that we've solved ourselves

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,240
over the last 25 years right so if you

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,760
think about

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,760
you know i'll throw some examples out

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,080
there but like fund administration

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,920
in a pre-bernie madoff world um

00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,920
everybody did it themselves for the most

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,680
part in the post-bony made-up world you

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,720
you needed to use a third-party fund

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,560
administrator

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,560
now there there was the catalyst of the

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,000
the madoff ponzi scheme but

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,519
but the same is true when you think

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,880
about fund accounting when you think

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,200
about kyc

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,880
i mean there's many parts of the

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,680
post-trade world

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,240
um of a bank or an asset manager that

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,760
now

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,240
vendors have something to offer not just

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,200
software but the entire service and so i

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,200
think again

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,920
to use that that phrase leverage versus

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,720
intent i think we're starting to see

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,000
um people more willing to whether it's

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,320
for cost reasons

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
or for reducing the friction that you

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,920
know in the straight through processing

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,640
they're more open to that

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,000
um and so i think that you know when you

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,000
couple that

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,920
with the fact that you know as an

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,399
engineer and there's a technologist last

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,399
last

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,079
you know a couple decades one thing i'm

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,200
embarrassed about

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:55,839
is that we you know the the cost of

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,279
migrating off of a platform and onto a

00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,600
new one whether you've built it or

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:02,640
you've bought it or it's open source

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,519
is incredibly high it takes a long time

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,360
it's very risky and as a result a lot of

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,279
leaders choose not to do it because they

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,600
frankly don't want to carry that risk

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,519
and i

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,120
don't blame them i mean given how how

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,040
often those things fail

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,560
so i think that there's you know work

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,600
that needs to be done to make those

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:22,000
migration costs and risks you know lower

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,880
and that's where i think data standards

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,079
protocols

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,399
semantics become super important and

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,279
um you know this is where i'm i'm really

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,600
hopeful that

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,560
uh the open source community can come

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,959
together and

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,959
and and really drive some of those

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,320
standards like i said not inventing them

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,720
from the ground up but

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,800
but potentially taking what others have

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,120
out there that they're contributing

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,279
to uh to the open source platform and

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,279
and building around that so

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,720
um that was rather a mouthful let me

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,200
pause and see if uh

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,920
if that makes sense oh it makes a lot of

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,079
sense i

00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:01,279
i i think i'm you know

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:05,440
i've seen a lot of um

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:06,240
i would say new strategic approaches to

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,480
open source

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:13,600
that kind of you know pair up the

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,959
data strategy with their sort of search

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,519
for efficiency

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,240
you know definitely uh you know i can

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,680
ego

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:24,639
the thought that um i think we're past

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,079
those hurdles of legal and compliance

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:30,079
again

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:31,519
not in the you know 100 of constituents

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,360
of this industry but certainly

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,600
most of the incumbents we've seen sort

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,440
of going through that

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,120
and now you know there's much more

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,240
strategic thinking around

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,440
how do we leverage this to again

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,079
have a better data strategy

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,680
interoperability efficiency so

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:53,040
um yeah i i couldn't have said it in in

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:55,680
a better way um

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,800
as as i think about the constituents in

00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,120
in this industry

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,959
uh you know we talked about you know

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,880
banks contributing and sort of the

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,399
the reasons and the drivers that they

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,079
are uh

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,360
you know looking at open source as part

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:12,530
of the the digital transformation but

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,240
um how about fintechs um

00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:17,200
[Music]

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,959
i think you know through open source we

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,480
think we're we're creating a level

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,760
playing field here

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,240
um how do you think you know

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,519
the fintechs can sort of leverage and

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,000
participate

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,560
um to this community yeah i mean look i

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,279
think that

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,720
um the fintechs have a big part to play

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:38,399
because when you think about

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,800
it if you buy the argument that the

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,079
continued commoditization of the core

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,680
things that

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,279
financial service firms do that they're

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,040
not differentiating

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,399
right so let's put aside alpha

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,000
generation and

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,600
market making and the core businesses

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,360
and let's think about all the other

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,519
things you need to do to comply and run

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,240
in a regulated environment

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,680
um you know the pentax offer a lot of

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,279
those whether they offer the software

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,160
around that or whether they offer

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,480
services around that and so for them to

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,199
be

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,720
more widely adopted to the extent that

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,519
you know i mean i think they have an

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,279
incentive to adopt standards uh in the

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,040
open source community as well

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,800
because as those standards actually

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,560
become more predominant

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,160
the ability to get to this point in the

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,120
future where you could say i've

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,399
outsourced

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,440
kyc to vendor x but tomorrow vendor y

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,440
comes along and says

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,240
i think we've got a better platform

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,800
better ai better ability to find the the

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,760
the needle in the haystack you say well

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,399
if i can just

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,959
turn my pipes to that other vendor and

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,600
get that feedback loop and compare it

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,279
um it's kind of a no-brainer to try that

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,440
out the problem is today you can't just

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:48,000
turn the pipes that's a massive

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,519
implementation project and so i think

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,320
you know there's a there's an aligned

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,639
set of incentives between

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,639
the fintechs the incumbents the

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,279
regulators and the open source community

00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,800
that kind of

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,399
glues a lot of that together and uh

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,000
you know i'm really hopeful that we're

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,000
at a point now in the

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,639
sort of maturity of open source within

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,720
financial services combined with the

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,800
you know the imperative to do something

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,040
about it quickly

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,079
that the alignment of incentives across

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,639
the different players

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:22,000
may be at the best point it's been in

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:24,399
the last 20 30 years

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,639
that's really encouraging coming from

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,680
you neil um

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,040
i i yeah i definitely see a major

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,560
opportunity here for

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,079
the fintechs um there's there's

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,240
you know if i think about other

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,480
industries and how they have

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,959
you know there's massive you know

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,440
commercial open source ecosystems built

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:47,279
around

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:50,800
i don't know big data cloud itself um

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:52,079
you know if you pair that up with a

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,000
you know an industry that is still

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,160
largely pretty siloed

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,279
in terms of the vendors and the vendors

00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,839
relationship

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,399
i feel there's there's major opportunity

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,600
here

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,880
um you know as we sort of create a level

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,399
playing field create

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:10,639
a game reduce the barriers sometimes to

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,519
to access this industry actually on this

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,839
note uh

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,320
you know tasha announced this morning uh

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:19,279
uh our open rec tech initiative

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,920
i don't know if you uh uh you know got a

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,720
chance to

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,160
to take a peek at it we're certainly

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,720
pretty excited because we think

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,880
involving regulators uh you know now

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,560
also with a special interest group

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:35,600
you know early on in the idea

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,399
that you know you could use open source

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,680
and even

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:42,800
common standards uh you know to

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,120
simplify if you want the the whole

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,320
uh regulatory process it's certainly a

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,519
powerful one kind of

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,519
again to what we just said about

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,079
fintechs it definitely

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,519
sort of reduces the barrier of entry

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,120
what's what's your feedback on that

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,000
what's your what's your thought on

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,480
uh open source regulation yeah you know

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,680
i

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,320
i was looking recently at um lei the

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,520
legal

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,039
entity identifier and this is um sort of

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,120
a standard that's been

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,559
driven by the financial stability board

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,079
the fsb

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,919
which as most of you know is sort of

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,240
endorsed by the g20 and

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,600
a really legitimate body around this and

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,120
um

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,120
it's fascinating right i mean as

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,919
somebody who over the years has seen

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,079
legal entity masters come and go and the

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,640
mapping and the challenge of knowing you

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,120
know

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,799
which entity is this you know there were

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,919
days when we used to book trades where

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,960
we would say the

00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,640
counterparty was golden you know or

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,640
lehman and then when something like

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,360
lehman actually happens when they blew

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,520
up

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,120
um the ability to figure out which legal

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,640
entity had you actually traded with and

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,120
is it one that's gone bankrupt or what

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,280
was incredibly hard to do in 2000

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,120
and so the idea of having sort of a

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,039
global standard around legal entity

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,039
identifier a global database

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,880
that you can actually query that is one

00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,520
of the definitive sources

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,160
and the key to all of that being that in

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,240
europe now you are required

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,520
which is such an important catalyst you

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,039
know we'd love to see that in other

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,200
parts of the world as well

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,559
because all of these standards reduce

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,400
the friction

00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,160
of straight through processing

00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,400
transactions across the financial

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,520
system so i think that it's phenomenal

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,520
news that

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,600
that there's a regulatory angle between

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,200
us and i think that there's good

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,000
examples already out there

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,520
of where bodies have helped drive some

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,080
of that standardization and then the

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,880
reduction

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,480
of friction off the back of that um and

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,559
this will give us an opportunity to get

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,640
the right people in the room to build on

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,240
that

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,160
yeah we're really we're really hopeful

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,720
and we've seen such an early momentum

00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,039
that

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,840
you know it seems we're on to something

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:47,840
here

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,480
um so neil this this has been really

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,240
interesting

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,640
um before i let you go um

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,160
you know we were really proud of what we

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,400
achieved

00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,160
as an industry in having so many

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,360
contributions from banks

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:06,559
we we sort of think this as a you know

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:10,799
an important stepping stone for us um

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:11,600
but definitely by far not the end of the

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,240
road

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,880
uh and so you know in your eyes where

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,720
where do we go from here

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,240
well i i think there's people a lot more

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,720
qualified than me to answer that

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,080
question

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,280
uh here at this conference but my two

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,200
cents would be look

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,559
while i think we're in the early innings

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,559
uh i think we have an amazing

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,280
opportunity to really go for it

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:35,039
i think that you know just from the

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,080
vantage point i've had over the last

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,360
couple decades

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,919
you can see the financial system has

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,000
less money than it did to invest in

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,080
upgrading and differentiating

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
and so if we're going to do it we've got

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,960
to be really careful and thoughtful in

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,799
how we do it

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,400
and that means basically using the

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,480
opportunity to

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,360
to collaborate on the things that we

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,880
don't necessarily compete on

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,280
and i think you know as you say the

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,120
silos that have existed not just

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,240
across the industry but frankly even

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,400
within incumbent firms in the industry

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,640
you know breaking those down and using

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,960
the sort of catalyst of data

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,240
and migration to a new way of compute

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,640
and storage

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,360
as ways of now while we're doing that

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,000
let's not

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,559
bring some of the mistakes that we made

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,039
when we were digitalizing in the 90s

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,559
into 2020 and by the way i don't think

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,240
they were mistakes made in the 90s

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,080
because we were silly or we weren't

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,320
clever enough i think it was

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,159
you know it was brand new finance was

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,919
one of the first industries to really

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,480
digitalize if you think about it

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,480
and we're so digital that 30 years later

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,120
we have a ton of legacy digital lying

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,960
around

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,400
that we want to upgrade to modern

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,080
digital and so

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,240
i think that's an imperative that

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,720
everyone's facing at this point and

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,679
um there's clearly parts of that

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,520
ecosystem

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,960
that none of us need to own and in fact

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,640
if we can actually get it to the point

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,320
where none of us own it

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,159
then it really starts to open up that

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,600
ecosystem to a different level of

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,960
competition a different level of

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,640
switching costs

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,960
uh and i think that'll put all of us in

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,320
a in a better place so uh

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,000
so i'm really excited about the

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,600
conference i'm really excited about how

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,360
you've organized it and just

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,039
more importantly just really

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,919
appreciative of everybody that

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,200
that participates in this because it's

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,799
what's going to allow us
