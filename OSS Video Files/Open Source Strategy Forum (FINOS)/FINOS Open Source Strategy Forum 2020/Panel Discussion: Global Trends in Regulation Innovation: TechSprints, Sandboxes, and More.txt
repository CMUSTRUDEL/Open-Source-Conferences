great you know first of all i want to

00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,359
thank uh

00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,600
finos for hosting this session we're

00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,080
very excited to be here my name is david

00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,160
eric and i'm the executive director of

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,200
air which is the alliance for innovative

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,360
regulation

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,440
uh and i'm here with my good friend and

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,880
colleague ian holobred from ing

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,800
ian do you want to just give yourself a

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,000
quick intro yeah

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,119
hi hi everyone i'm ian hola bread and i

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,800
head up um

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,320
i regtecher ing labs and it's initiative

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,840
which we started

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:37,280
roughly a year and a half ago to really

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,719
develop and emerging technologies to

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,640
solve

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,680
and promote emerging technologies to

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,000
solve real business problems

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,120
and we progress in uh these technologies

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,680
across the industry

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,760
and very much internally within our

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,600
organization as well

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:58,800
that's great and um uh we're here today

00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,480
and uh and ian in particular

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,840
uh you know one of the areas that we

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,879
both work on very closely

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,000
is this notion of regulation innovation

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,040
which many people

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,439
think is an oxymoron and uh

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,200
together we've been trying to uh really

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,759
uncover the ways in which

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,360
regulation and the regulators across the

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,920
united states and

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,360
jurisdictions around the world are

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,759
beginning to innovate

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,799
uh and i wonder if you could say a few

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,960
words ian on

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,119
on what you see is the kind of global

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,759
trends in innovation today

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,479
yeah i think as an industry obviously we

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,200
all struggle

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,439
to meet the consistent change in demands

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,600
of regulation for an organization

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:44,399
like ing we operate in 40 plus markets

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,720
um and it ca global regulations

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,479
constantly changing in those markets and

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,960
it's how do we address

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,840
those changes and how do we ensure we

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,960
are compliant

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,880
with those changes together and

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,040
i think what we've seen in the past is

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,280
is we've seen regulators take a

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,560
a very proactive approach in terms of

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,600
innovation we've seen financial

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,479
institutions

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,280
take a proactive approach in terms of

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,080
innovation

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,959
um and we've seen startups and red techs

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,599
imagine which

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,920
which solve fundamental problems but but

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,480
it's a very fragmented environment

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,440
and and we think actually it's an

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,160
environment where

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,040
we believe that open source can really

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,200
help drive

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,319
and and promote sustainability in the

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,360
industry

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,080
and really it's one place where we can

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,280
access

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,680
all together rather than these kind of

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,239
point

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,120
and isolated approaches from different

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,519
regions and

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,640
different geographies um open source by

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,760
its nature

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,000
allows everyone um to participate and

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:50,800
everyone to benefit from this so

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,680
this really our hope that this group and

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,080
we hope that uh people joining us on on

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,519
this journey to really promote

00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,440
the great work that's already going on

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,040
in open source in the industry

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,480
and new work that we can potentially

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,040
build upon

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,920
so for those of you who are just joining

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,200
uh ian

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,360
and i have been uh the co-leads for

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,239
the new special interest group the new

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,640
sig on

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,640
regtech uh and we're really excited to

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,400
share that with you and we hope that

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,319
you'll come and join us at our next

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,319
meeting which is going to be on

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,920
tuesday november 24th and you can get

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,840
the information in

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,360
the github but as a context for the

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,000
conversation that we want to have today

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,200
we have

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,760
uh two guest regulators with us uh or at

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,440
least we

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,840
are hoping to have two guest regulators

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,280
with us uh and both of these regulators

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,239
are regulators that

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,080
uh have really established uh regulation

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,560
innovation as a primary

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,440
uh priority for their agencies and they

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,519
have

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,480
been really forward thinking and have

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,920
been

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,239
exercising new tools to try to help

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,720
regulators and regulatory agencies

00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,840
really engage with new technologies and

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,360
some of those tools that we're going to

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,640
be touching on today include

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,280
uh sandboxes and tech sprints

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,760
um and and other topics that we're going

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,159
to be

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,879
uh that we're going to be looking at uh

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,879
you know matt

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,720
lowe i want to kind of just uh pass the

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,639
baton over to you as a representative

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,199
from the financial conduct authority

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,040
in the uk i think the fca has really

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,320
been recognized as a thought leader

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,919
in uh regulation innovation and i wonder

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,639
if you could share with us a little bit

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,639
about uh

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,400
how you think about your uh regulation

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,280
innovation strategy and the tools that

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,440
you have been

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,680
pioneering and using to to drive

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,720
regulation innovation

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,240
yeah sure um so so where i come from

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,160
uh within the whole innovation

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,680
department within the fca i

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,280
sit within what's called the regtech and

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,000
advanced analytics

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,280
team which we look at innovation in

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,680
terms of what we call

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,639
subtech which is like your internal uh

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,919
development and

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,000
the tools that you might create for the

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:59,280
regulator to use and we also uh

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,759
look at regtech and part of the the um

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,600
the program for the reg tech team is we

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,199
host these things called hackathon tech

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,880
sprints which is essentially just a

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,360
fancy word for a hackathon

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,560
um they are sorry that the dogs are

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,240
going to go off in a minute so

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,919
we might have a bit of noise in the

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,520
background but um

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,479
but anyway that the whole point of a

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,680
hackathon is to try and bring together

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:24,560
some industry experts who um who work

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,720
on on a particular problem or solution

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,520
that we might want to try and build out

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,080
over a period of say two to three days

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,440
um

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,680
our journey has been one that's probably

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,199
taken around about five years to get to

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,039
where we are now

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,880
uh and when we first started this

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,280
program we started off with

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,800
like smaller events we had maybe 20 to

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,360
40 individuals

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,120
uh they were that they were quite open

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,560
in terms of like the participants we'd

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,479
bring in but we'd only

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,240
would we'd be a little bit more free in

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,720
terms of like um

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,560
what what problem we're trying to solve

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,600
as we've gone through that journey and

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,280
we've now done seven tech sprints

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,960
it's got more complicated and it's got

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,880
bigger so um

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,919
if i was to give you an example of the

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,080
one we did on money laundering and

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:14,560
finance crime which we worked with air

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,840
last year on um we had approximately 180

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,440
participants

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,440
and that was during the actual duration

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,199
of the tech sprint went for three days

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,880
and then the final day we had a further

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,319
c suite of another probably 200

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,520
uh participants who are actually seeing

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,400
some of the solutions that are being

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,319
developed

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,840
now the whole objective there was to try

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,919
and look at how we could

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,280
open up data sharing between different

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,199
institutions using something called

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,600
privacy enhancing technologies

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,440
and um and what we wanted to do is see

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,160
if we could unlock those technologies to

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,919
try and

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,759
you know combat money laundering and

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,840
financial crime

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,000
um sorry gone david no i was just gonna

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,120
say that event in the u.s was a

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,479
watershed event the uh tech sprint on

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,319
any money laundering which was really

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,400
focused on human trafficking

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,479
was the first time that uh u.s

00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,840
regulators had an opportunity to see a

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,880
tech sprint firsthand uh

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,800
in the u.s so uh the alliance for

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,759
innovative regulation my organization

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,000
partnered with

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,520
with the fca with you guys uh to

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,440
actually deliver that tech sprint in the

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,160
us and it was an extraordinary moment

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,440
because

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,759
the regulators get to see firsthand

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,759
the kind of collaboration that takes

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,319
place when you bring together

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,000
a technologist with technology expertise

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,880
and a subject matter expert the subject

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,199
matter expert

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,880
doesn't have visibility or awareness of

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,039
what technology can provide

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,800
and technology doesn't have visibility

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,039
onto the kinds of challenges that

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,720
regulators are facing so when you bring

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,479
them together and sit them down at the

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,199
same table and provide them with an

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,840
intensive problem-solving uh opportunity

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,199
over a

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,919
short period of time where you're

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,800
required to deliver a particular

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,800
prototype what happens is explosive it's

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,879
really exciting and really uh

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,240
engaging for the participants and it's

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,360
an incredible tool to build

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,960
collaboration

00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,319
and to build uh to break down the silos

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,400
between different stakeholders that

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,240
really don't spend enough time together

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,639
yeah absolutely and and that's something

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,080
that we've um we've noticed that

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,160
and that's why i think they get so big

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,479
and because the the industry see that

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,639
you know

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,000
this is a great way to convene to try

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,199
and solve those problems and you know

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,680
those private public

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,120
uh partnerships start to form so um so

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,400
yeah they've been really useful for us

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,280
as a regulator to try and

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,680
tackle some of those bigger problems um

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,840
we

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,039
obviously we in a different world now

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,720
with covert and

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,039
uh doing something in a physical

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,560
location is not not possible

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,839
at the current point in time so you know

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,800
we're exploring ways of doing things

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,880
virtually and

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,560
um and i guess the latest thing that

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,719
we've done which is virtual in the sense

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,959
of trying to innovate is uh what we did

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,560
with the data sprint earlier this year

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:45,760
but had a slightly different objective

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,600
where we're trying to create some data

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,040
sets for the the digital sandbox but

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,720
we can talk about that a little bit

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,480
later well

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,120
why don't we spend a minute talking

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,800
about what uh the key learnings have

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,279
been from text prints i mean

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,560
the fca has done seven or eight text

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,160
prints did you say

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,640
yeah so we've done seven text sprints

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,160
and one data sprint i guess so

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,080
style events we've probably done eight

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,360
just slightly different models

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,760
what are the key learnings so i guess uh

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,440
well

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,959
you can actually go to our website and

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,080
there's uh there's a paper that's called

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,560
fostering innovation

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,760
through uh collaboration and that that

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,720
goes through some of the key learnings

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,360
that we've got from

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,640
from the tech sprint model and talks

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,080
about like some of the issues that we

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,880
face in terms of trying to bring

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,680
together

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,200
uh the environments like the data uh

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,959
trying to get together the right people

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,080
into the room setting up like industry

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,920
working groups to

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,399
to help being that subject matter

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,080
expertise throughout the event

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,519
um and also i guess some of the

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,440
learnings that we have found this

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,120
will play somewhat into the digital

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,320
sandbox and there might be a bit of flow

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,080
here but

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,760
essentially what we found is that we do

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,720
this really good event that goes for two

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,480
to three days

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,240
it's fantastic you get a lot of buzz you

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,800
get a lot of energy and then

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,760
like on the last day we almost shut down

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,360
the whole environment

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,720
so all the all the participants lose

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,720
access to the data

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,040
they lose access to the environment and

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,800
then it's i mean we do have play some

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,160
role in observing some of the proof of

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,760
concepts that come out of it

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,760
but what we find is that we can lose

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,680
some of that momentum so what we're

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,440
looking to do is explore other ways that

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,360
we can keep the infrastructure up

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,120
and keep the data there and and then you

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,079
can continue to develop going forward

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,800
so it's like working sorry man i think

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,959
it's a great

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,399
way to like kind of segue into the work

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,079
that we're trying to achieve

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:34,079
in finos because actually that those

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,040
that learnings and outcomes we believe

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,360
some of that can

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,200
can move into an open source kind of

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,120
approach and an open source model and

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,959
and and where we're looking to take

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,160
it um is so there's a continuous work

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,839
and continuous development

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,279
in some of these initiatives which may

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,200
have been proved out by

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,040
by some of your your excellent work

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,680
within the tech sprints and i think like

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,240
some of the

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,600
aspects you talk about around getting

00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,839
the communities together and the

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,279
collaboration together like that then

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,320
there suddenly becomes a

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:06,240
a pla landing spot across the globe that

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,440
allows these these projects if they're

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,760
open by nature

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,800
to to really be put the boundaries to be

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,519
pushed and

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,240
asked to continuous work along these

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,079
these

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,600
these initiatives because i've

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,120
experienced the learnings from

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,640
the tech sprints that you've done and i

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,399
think they're great but

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,079
obviously we need to continue like you

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,440
say that momentum

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,120
yeah and we need we need to have the

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,519
right tools to be able to

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,279
you know continue that work and you know

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,480
if that's finos or if it's the digital

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,440
sandbox environment that we're looking

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,440
to create

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,600
then there needs to be the tools for

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,040
innovators to come in and continue

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,720
some of that really good work to go from

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,040
proof of concept to proof of value

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,480
so they they're actually developing

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,560
something and then they're able to

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,360
demonstrate and further develop beyond

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,360
the the boundaries of a text script

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,040
i think i see our other guest here we

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,360
have a guest regulator from

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,720
the consumer finance protection bureau

00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:02,079
and jennifer lassiter is that you

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,000
hi i'm here i'm alive that's great and

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,320
we can hear you that's perfect

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,200
so um jennifer we were just talking

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,920
about uh

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,680
tech sprints and how regulators have

00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,160
been using techsprint as an innovation

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,160
tool

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,320
and uh the consumer finance protection

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,680
bureau in the us has just been

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,839
working on uh creating a tech sprint

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,600
strategy and just last month in october

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,680
you launched your first tech sprint

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,880
particularly on consumer disclosures and

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,200
i was wondering if you could share with

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,040
us

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,240
about that experience and what some of

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,240
your key learnings were from that

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:38,399
oh sure um so i i first must say

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,920
it's such an honor to be on the panel

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,440
with these folks

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,440
and the reason that that's relevant is

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,079
because a lot of the tech sprint work

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,040
that the bureau did in preparation and

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:51,279
execution in october was because of the

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,600
pioneering that the fca did their

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:56,639
publishing of their tech sprint paper

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,279
and then also the toolkit and tech

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,920
sprint manual that air

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,560
published following fca's paper and is

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,440
available

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,320
on air's website so thank you to both of

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,480
those

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,880
organizations for really giving us a

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,920
great road map to follow

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:16,000
i would say in terms of

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,760
additional boxes that needed to be

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,440
checked before we could embark on the

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,480
tech sprint

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,120
really getting the buy-in from senior

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,399
leadership

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:29,600
at the bureau and what i mean by buy-in

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,680
is agreement and understanding and the

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,399
potential value for text prints as a

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,760
model

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,639
for interacting with regulated

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,720
institutions

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,000
and industry and other audiences that

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,120
the bureau serves

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,199
um and that was a big list and i have to

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,040
applaud director craninger

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,480
because it really was signing off on

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,160
something that didn't have

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,160
a very neatly predicted outcome

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,000
and signing off on something with an

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,279
unpredicted outcome that would have a

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,120
very public facing

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:02,160
impact um so we received permission from

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,480
her to move forward

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,199
in january of this year and we have

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,480
three goals

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,920
for our program one is to

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,920
and i'm going to read these to be

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,760
accurate develop actionable

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,680
technology-focused solutions to a

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,519
variety of regulatory and consumer

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,920
protection challenges

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,839
to harness technology to reduce burden

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,000
improve results and create greater

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,120
efficiencies across financial markets

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,120
and three

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,480
explore how technology can reshape

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,639
compliance and speed

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,199
effective interaction between regulators

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,360
and financial institutions

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,480
so in many ways the bureau was really

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,480
set up to run

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,800
fast and hard towards these goals we

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,760
have an open source by default

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,079
strategy in place and it has been for a

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,120
long

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:49,760
time thankful thankful to a um

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,760
very innovative development team led by

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,199
our development lead adam scott

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,880
um so we started up and i will just say

00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,600
we got the sign off from the director in

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,120
january we used the summer

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,639
in june we announced the problem

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,240
statement we used the summer for

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,720
recruitment and to refine the problem

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:10,800
statement and do the logistical planning

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:14,560
and then we executed in october

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:17,120
and we ended up with 13 teams and 82

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,760
participants which was far beyond

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,959
what we anticipated when we started off

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,199
on this initial journey

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,800
um we thought start small don't fight

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:28,240
off more than we can chew

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:31,199
um but the appetite was so strong

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,560
in terms of our external audiences

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,240
wanting to interact

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,560
with a regulator in this way and it

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,680
really was promising

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:42,480
and then after we executed in october

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,839
there's a couple uh we had a couple

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,920
goals that we were looking for

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,279
one just execute the week make it

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,399
through the week no technical

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,800
difficulties

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,720
um two we wanted to push industry to

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,720
innovate on adverse action notices

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,279
um give them an incentive to pay

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,920
attention to this topic

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,680
and three we wanted to modernize we

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,920
wanted to demonstrate and strengthen

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,160
this model of collaboration

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,079
we wanted to spur application to our

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,360
office of innovation trial disclosure

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,759
program and which is near and dear to my

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,000
heart

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,279
we wanted to prove that there's value in

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,560
this process

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:21,440
that we could be creative with

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,880
industry and then we could pay that

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,399
creativity forward

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,000
into data for policy making purposes

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,360
i'm happy to talk about how we've

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,480
achieved those goals but i don't want to

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,279
be a time hog

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,639
so david you tell me what's best for

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,800
this discussion

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,480
well you know i think to highlight some

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,959
of the points that you were making

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,079
is uh how powerful the collaboration was

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,160
you know i got a

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,079
an email from one of the participants in

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,959
the the cfpb tech sprint

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,600
where he uh opened up with i am a tech

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,160
sprint

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,160
convert

00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:57,199
of uh how fun and creative these

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,959
environments are and how they really

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,720
unleash people's problem solving and

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,360
creative juices and it's a

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,240
it's really a remarkable uh process if

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,720
you have not been

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,919
involved in a hackathon or a tech sprint

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,319
i highly recommend it

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,240
um but one of the things what what's the

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,120
great thing is the other great thing is

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,039
that is

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,480
is beginning to demonstrate like real

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:19,360
impacts as well like

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,199
and it's actually actionable um actions

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,760
coming out of these like if you look at

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,120
the fca and matt's work there is

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,199
actually a sandbox now

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,440
environment that firms can really

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,960
participate on so whereas before like

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,280
you mentioned they closed down

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,080
like with jennifer's work like there is

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,440
an action

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,760
like of an open source nature coming out

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,360
from it so that we can all learn and

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,880
benefit from it so there's really

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:47,919
actions um and we're moving away from

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,240
those talking points to actually what

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,240
what

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,160
can the industry benefit from this and

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,120
what can financial institutions what can

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,600
regulators

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,120
and what can the startup communities

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,840
benefit and i think

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,880
that's that's the big difference as

00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,960
we've gone through the

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,880
the evolution and the innovation journey

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,880
um today

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,400
and matt you have i don't know if this

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,200
is public information but you've

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,000
launched the

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,039
application process for uh the digi

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,960
sandbox and

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,080
um i understand that you've been

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,039
overwhelmed with

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,840
uh with uh requests for participation

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,760
yeah um

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,760
i can go one step further david we've

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,679
launched the application process we've

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,080
closed the application process down

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,600
uh we actually received 94 applications

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,520
which is um

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,039
we had a little running bets within the

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,919
office about how many we would get i

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:37,840
said 75 is off by about 20 so i lost but

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,760
um but essentially yeah it was a big

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,120
success in terms of like how many

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,120
that shows that the industry are looking

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,160
for something like this we can

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,679
only accept 30 in and we've just decided

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,880
who they are and they will get notified

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,200
on monday

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,360
uh and then from there we give them

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,320
access to the environment from the 23rd

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,400
of this month and what what that gives

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,240
them access to is a series of features

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,240
in terms of similar to what you provide

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,559
in a in a tech sprint

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,280
uh synthetic data assets which we went

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,080
with which we've

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,960
gone to great lengths to create and try

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,679
to make as

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,120
as realistic as possible and in terms of

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,160
like the sorts of data assets that we're

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,320
looking at we've

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,440
created five fictional uk banks which

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,080
covers um

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,679
around about 400 million transactions

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,520
over the course of a year

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,280
uh we've created like i guess a

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,160
synthetic world which looks somewhat

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,400
like the uk

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,840
but um but a little bit different and i

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,039
kind of always turn this in the way i

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,000
don't know if anybody's a game of

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,760
thrones fan

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,600
but at the start of game of thrones you

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,880
see this opening sequence and

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:42,080
it looks kind of like medieval uk

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,200
or europe and and then it but it doesn't

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,640
and that's kind of what we're trying to

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,880
create with this synthetic data asset so

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,520
we've shrunk down the uk population to

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,480
up to about seven million synthetic

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,559
individuals

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,720
that represent demographically what the

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,400
um what the uk looks like

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,080
and then we're making that all those

00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,799
data assets available to solve these

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,480
three

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,159
use cases that we're going after for the

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,840
for the pilot itself

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,440
and so that's like one feature and then

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,440
there's other features in in terms of

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,799
like collaboration features and anybody

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,320
can register and have a look and see

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,039
what the teams are doing within the

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,400
environment

00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,400
so there's an opportunity for them to

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,080
showcase some of their work um

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,760
there's also an opportunity for people

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,039
to connect so we've created a lot of

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:23,520
um a lot of collaboration features

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,559
uh so originally i was kind of terming

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,440
this is like the

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,799
the amazon for regtex and fintechs and

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,559
now i'm kind of terminate

00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,880
the term i'm using it's like the

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:35,120
linkedin for fintechs and redtex

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,360
and combining that all together to make

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,640
this um this really valuable product

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,039
that's great what kind of dog do you

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,679
have i have two

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,679
noisy ones

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,840
that's awesome david appease car up in a

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,840
minute

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,000
for those of you who are watching uh i

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,919
have a cat who likes to sit on my

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,159
shoulder but he's uh he's busy at the

00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,159
moment

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,919
um you know both of you at the fca and

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,799
at the cfpb you've both had a tremendous

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,320
opportunity to explore tech sprints and

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,559
and really see the benefits of tech

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,480
sprints but you've also had to engage

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,640
the challenges of actually setting up a

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,440
tech sprint and overcoming

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,600
some of the challenges of um you know

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,360
bringing market participants in to work

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,200
with regulators and so

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,960
you know starting with the cfpb jennifer

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,919
what kind of challenges did you face

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,240
when you were kind of

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,000
engaging market participants and trying

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:34,000
to promote participation

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:37,679
in the tech sprint sure

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,640
so i think i must applaud our tax parent

00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,360
team because they made over a thousand

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,400
phone calls

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:47,919
in the month of july to various

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,520
audiences in the u.s to talk about the

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,400
problem statement and the text print as

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,240
a model

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,520
part of it was because we had originally

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,679
planned to host it

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,240
as a traditional text print format in

00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:01,679
the spring before coved 19 hit

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:04,400
and then we moved to a virtual format

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,600
and we wanted to understand what people

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,120
would be looking for

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:11,360
in terms of engaging in a virtual manner

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,480
with the intent of still achieving the

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,960
same outcome

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,280
we also wanted to pressure test with

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,799
them the problem statement and make sure

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,960
that it was a problem statement that

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:24,240
they were interested in

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,240
and capable of tackling we wanted to

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,240
stress to them that we were not looking

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,480
for companies to

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,280
come and apply as company x to

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,200
participate

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:38,240
in the sprint we wanted um people to

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,960
teams to be multi-disciplinary

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,520
and have a variety of experts around the

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,320
table

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,200
uh contributing to the problem solving

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,400
that week

00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,480
i would and i will say the um

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,919
the softer side of the conversations and

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,159
concerns that we heard

00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,960
which i think were just as critical as

00:22:54,159 --> 00:23:00,159
those logistical pieces i just discussed

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,880
were what is in it for me

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,679
as an institution or an individual to

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,840
participate

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,280
in the sprint why would i want to do

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,000
that um

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,480
i'm afraid that i'm opening myself up to

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,840
regulatory scrutiny if i participate

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:18,480
in this space with you um

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,080
what kind of media and publicity might

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,240
my institution receive

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,120
if it is heard that we are collaborating

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,720
in this way

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:28,640
with a regulator so i think um

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,320
i think those questions are very real

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,440
and it's really important to speak

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,880
directly to them

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,520
when you're talking to people and

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,799
generating interest and engagement

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:41,919
around a particular tech sprint

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:43,679
yes i think that um uh you know air just

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,200
recently produced a tech sprint on

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,039
cryptocurrency and its

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,120
ability to limit the distribution of

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:52,320
child sexual abuse materials

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:54,000
and uh you know while we heard that

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,000
uh you know from participants that this

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,440
was you know really a life-changing

00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,279
event to be involved in something that

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,480
was so mission driven and had such high

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,960
impact for

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,159
you know for individuals uh at the same

00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,000
time you know

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,200
you're you're you're trading off many

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,279
different risks

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,279
uh in terms of of participation

00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,880
especially uh when you're

00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,480
a covered entity working with a

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,919
regulatory body

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,320
you know matt what are some of your

00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,520
experiences uh having produced so many

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,799
different tech sprints what's summer

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,919
what are some of your experiences in

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,720
trying to convince

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,279
market participants to participate uh

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,440
it's

00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,720
funny enough it's always um i'm always

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,679
surprised about

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,120
how how many participants we do get that

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,720
are generally interested in trying to

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,080
solve these problems

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,200
i'm always uh we always get to a stage

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,159
where we're having to knock a lot of

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,559
people back

00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,559
and and that's generally i think because

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,919
they um

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,279
the people that want to get involved in

00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,559
solving these problems and especially

00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,240
when it comes to something like money

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,080
laundering and financial crime

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,159
it's um it's some it's a very big

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,799
problem it's a global issue

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,679
uh it needs to be um it needs a global

00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,720
effort so

00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:02,799
to actually reach out to that community

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,760
i found it quite easy to to bring them

00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,120
all in

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,120
don't get me wrong there have been tech

00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,240
sprints that haven't been as successful

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,279
and maybe they're not as as appealing

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,120
when it comes to

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,760
the actual use case or problem statement

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:18,320
um we had done one previously which

00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,440
was quite difficult to generate a lot of

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,559
interest

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,840
and maybe the topic wasn't as

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,679
interesting as money laundering finance

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,640
crime but if the use case is compelling

00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,960
enough

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,320
you will find you you can convene the

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,240
industry um

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,760
around that particular problem uh it

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,640
also gives them an opportunity to show

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,159
off some of their

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,080
their technology to a broader audience

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,000
so we always you know

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,000
i sort of briefly mentioned this before

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,400
like the c-suite on the last day

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,080
when you present these solutions uh

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,520
that's really important in terms of like

00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,640
trying to make sure that there's an

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,600
audience which can

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,919
can go some way to either help push the

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,240
the

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,039
development of that product further or

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,480
um or just

00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,799
in general to start making some of those

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,320
connections and and getting

00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,000
the whole industry to work around that

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,960
that problem outside of the realms of

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,880
the tech sprint

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,840
yeah and um can i david can i just add a

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,200
comment there

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:12,880
which is um one of the the

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,600
flip side is when you extend your reach

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,240
outside of

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,919
just covered entities or regulated

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,039
entities and you start to include your

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,240
community

00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:25,840
advocates and other community

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:28,000
for us consumer-based organizations um

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,480
it makes a very interesting conversation

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,440
so for our evaluation panel

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,039
we had representatives um across the

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,320
board including community

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:40,720
advocacy and um

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,640
what it did was invite a conversation

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,400
that i think normally wouldn't happen

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,240
around the tensions of a particular

00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,880
application of technology

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,360
and for the bureau it's very important

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,960
to hear those conversations play out and

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,679
understand the perspectives of those

00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,679
respective constituencies and

00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,400
be able to take that into consideration

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:03,360
as conversations unfold internally

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:06,480
around application of uh that

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:10,400
information and the rulemaking process

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:12,480
so i don't know of another space

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,080
at least one that is that public where

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,000
you have

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,320
those two bodies of people who don't

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,840
normally come together to collaborate

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:25,360
on a topic um in a non-combative way

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,360
and i found that to be very valuable

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,399
so ian i wonder if this is a a moment to

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:36,240
pivot we've spoken a bit about

00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:38,799
the um kinds of innovation tools that

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,679
regulators are are beginning to embrace

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,080
and

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,360
um uh you know one of the challenges

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,399
that we talked about earlier

00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:49,520
is is how to make sure that those uh

00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:51,279
innovation exercises live on and have an

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,279
opportunity to gain traction

00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:55,360
and one of the ways to do that is

00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,159
through open source and ian i wonder if

00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,200
you could

00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,880
you know revisit the comments that you

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,799
made a little bit earlier about the role

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,320
of open source here particularly for

00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:07,200
regulators and the interaction of

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:10,480
regulators and market participants

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,919
yeah i i mean jennifer i think i've

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,760
mentioned this before but what i was

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,039
saying earlier is obviously it's great

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,559
the work that the fca

00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,320
are doing and it's great the work that

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:21,279
you're doing but actually for in

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,640
firms that are international by nature

00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:25,600
and multi-geography

00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,440
then there's not always the same level

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,720
of like maturity in in

00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,559
regulation innovation but actually those

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,600
those global firms

00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:37,360
want need to adopt like standards and

00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,720
and need to meet the regulatory

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,559
requirements and

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,120
how do you how do you meant like we need

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:45,760
to report to i know 40 50

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:48,000
different um different regulators so how

00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:51,200
do you ensure that like these

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,559
these we do that successfully

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,240
and i think what we believe the work

00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,080
that's coming out of finos and we've

00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,240
seen financial institutions

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,840
put their code out into open source and

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,279
the data model in code

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,559
and we've seen the work that's been

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,679
going on in the fdc3

00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:09,440
interoperability working groups across

00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,720
different domains that not necessarily

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,080
regulation

00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,360
but potentially the impact if you put

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,440
that on regulation

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:20,080
could be significant and and if there's

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,000
a place and the work that finos is doing

00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,520
and is driving from an industry

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,320
perspective if there's

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:28,080
you can open that in the compliance risk

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,320
and regulatory domains

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,200
then we think that there's significant

00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,600
um

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,520
significant gains that can be made from

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,120
an industry as a whole

00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,960
and some of these whether it's the tech

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,720
firms or whether it's the

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,320
the financial institutions or even if

00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,240
it's the regulators

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,080
there actually there's a place that we

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,360
can share internationally

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:51,760
um for the benefit of all

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,600
and and jennifer you know i know that

00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,080
the cfpb for those of you who aren't

00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,760
familiar

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,080
with the different u.s regulatory

00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,320
agencies the cfpb is the newest

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,440
of the u.s regulator regulators to be

00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,360
stood up and

00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,200
you know one of the benefits of being a

00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,159
new regulatory agency

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,080
is that they are not hindered by the

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,200
legacy technology and the legacy risk

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,960
that many of our

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,520
uh financial institutions and financial

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,760
regulators are are kind of um

00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,279
strapped with and you know jennifer i

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,480
wonder if you could talk a little bit

00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:23,760
about the history

00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:28,080
of open source at the cfpb and how uh

00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,080
you know the cpp uses open source today

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,799
well i'm not going to talk about the

00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,440
history specifically because i'm going

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,919
to encourage

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,720
everyone to come to the conversation

00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,000
after this

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,159
where my two bureau colleagues will join

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,919
me in having that exact discussion

00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,520
so a little bit of a teaser if you

00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:50,640
haven't chosen your session yet

00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:53,760
for noon but i will say um

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:56,880
i will say and how it's used today um

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:58,720
so i posted in the slack channel i

00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,360
forget which channel it is exactly but

00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,240
the one

00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,200
that um pertains to policy and

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,640
regulation

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,320
um csp a link to cfpp's github on that

00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,360
github you will see all of our open

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,399
source work

00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:16,240
um please feel free to comment

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,880
um and uh i will say that where we are

00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,640
today

00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,799
is that we are in a place where we are

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:24,080
open source by default so

00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:24,960
there are certain um there are certain

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,799
criteria

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,640
that if they are checked then there is a

00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:31,600
conversation about

00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,519
not having open code but for the most

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,600
part

00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,640
we are approaching situations that we

00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,360
will be coding

00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,279
in in the open and we will encourage

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:44,480
participation and feedback

00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:46,799
from the public accordingly one of the

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,240
places where we've seen cross-agency

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,600
collaboration

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,519
and we're hoping to pick it up and

00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,200
encourage it further is around our

00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,880
interactive regulations work or our

00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,919
machine readable regs

00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,600
and this is work that we had started um

00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,360
every time i say this i surprised myself

00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,480
but about eight years ago

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:07,679
and um really kind of

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,840
pioneered the space of how do we

00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,000
make regulations machine readable and of

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,600
course the definition for how they are

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,679
machine readable

00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,360
varies now from what it is now from what

00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,760
it was eight years ago but

00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,080
um that code is open and and we have

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,159
seen other agencies in the us forklift

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,480
that code and apply it internally

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:30,000
and it still is used as foundational

00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:33,039
code in a few agencies to this day

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,960
so we'd like to do more of that and

00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:37,919
that open source application i can't

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,159
remember earlier today i think i heard

00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,840
someone say we really want to build off

00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,399
of each other

00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,279
one of the things that is special for

00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:48,320
the bureau

00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:51,760
is that we also have an in-house

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,039
full stack dev team that is about 40

00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,039
people

00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:56,640
for federal full-time employees and then

00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:59,919
we supplement with

00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:02,399
an almost equal number of contractors

00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,440
no other regulators that i know of in

00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,360
the us

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,480
have that kind of staff available to

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,240
them as full-time

00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:12,000
federal employees and that is a resource

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,000
that i think if we can figure out

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,760
how to kind of build off of each other's

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,720
work and leapfrog from our various

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,880
efforts

00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,120
um that we will be able to share with

00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,519
the rest of the regulatory community

00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,240
um so we shall see what the future

00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,200
brings

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,519
i think it is bright and and matt you

00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,600
the fca has also been a pioneer

00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,640
in machine executable and machine

00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,880
readable

00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,760
uh regulation and i wonder if you could

00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,240
share with us

00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,880
um uh the story of the tech sprint that

00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,640
you did on

00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:45,120
on that yeah so um we were exploring

00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,039
um what we now call digital regulatory

00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,919
reporting it was called mdmer or

00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,440
something which was

00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:51,200
a bit of a mouthful to say at the time

00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,880
so we shortened it somewhat

00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,640
um but yeah we did explore that in the

00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:58,080
in a tech sprint back in november of

00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,559
2017. this is before i joined the team

00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,640
so

00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:02,000
you know i've just got to try and um

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,559
pull together some of the information i

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,320
know from

00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,919
from from my prior knowledge but

00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,360
essentially we went through we did a

00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,560
tech sprint we tried to prove out that

00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,520
you could actually

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,599
um that machine readable um machine

00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,000
executable reporting could be done

00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,760
uh and the final day we we demonstrated

00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,119
that with by by changing

00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,119
um uh one of their uh policy

00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,320
uh instructions and then that actually

00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,560
pulled in different data

00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,240
uh according to that so so we did we

00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,560
could we proved that it could work

00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,440
um then we ran a series of pilots we did

00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:35,280
two pilots

00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,240
and we um we expanded on the scope of

00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,240
the actual

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,280
proof of concept to try and bring in

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,320
some for some

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,599
further data and then um it's now in a

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,440
position where we're actually

00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:47,520
looking to try and integrate that within

00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,520
the fca internally

00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,720
now it's not so open source um as say

00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,560
cfpb but

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,240
what we're looking to do is think about

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,960
sharing at least our learnings

00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,560
on uh with the bank of england and uh

00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,119
without with ourselves

00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:03,200
and the g fin community so that we can

00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,599
look to expand some of that work as well

00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,240
you know we're an acronym free zone here

00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,480
oh sorry

00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,599
global financial innovation network

00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,599
which is what

00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:13,040
it's uh so it's a it's it's a i guess a

00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,720
community of regulators

00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,079
an international community of regulators

00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,000
who who are getting together

00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,920
and you know just discuss things like um

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,839
supervisory tech or regtech

00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,200
uh and and and actually look at some

00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:25,440
cross-border testing so

00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,200
it's got quite a broad scope uh but it's

00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,200
bringing it's quite unique in terms of

00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,280
like the conversation across the

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,640
uh international community yeah that's

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,440
excellent you know

00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:37,680
uh my co-founder at air joanne barefoot

00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,359
was at the tech sprint in 2017

00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,119
i think that it's commonly referred to

00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:44,400
as the moonshot

00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:46,079
and um she likes to say that it

00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,160
you know what what was amazing was when

00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,240
they finally executed the code

00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,640
and it actually came through you had a

00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:55,119
participating bank that was able to

00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,880
actually develop a report based on code

00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,160
you know code that was delivered as

00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,960
regulatory

00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,920
requirements and when it actually

00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,119
executed

00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:08,320
the entire room filled with regulators

00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:10,079
and compliance officers cheered

00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,839
and when do you see regulators and

00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,400
compliance officers in a room cheering

00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,560
together

00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,200
it's a very unusual sense something's

00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,200
gone right

00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,480
yeah and i think you can actually see

00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,240
that on the website as well there is the

00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,160
video and at the very end of that um

00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,800
that video that that text on the fta

00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,520
website

00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,720
yeah i'm pretty sure that i i it might

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,079
still be up i haven't looked at it for a

00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,839
long time but at the very end of it you

00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:33,520
can see that that moment

00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:35,440
and i really encourage all of you to go

00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:38,800
there it's a very unique moment

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:41,280
in uh in regulatory um uh

00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:44,079
regulatory market participant you know

00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:47,119
uh collaboration

00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,000
um uh matt where do you see uh open

00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,640
source being

00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,119
uh useful for you know the fca moving

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,720
forward

00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,320
you know as you think about the future

00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,200
of of open source

00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,160
how how is the fca thinking about that

00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,480
yeah so um

00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,000
obviously there's the digital sandbox

00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,880
where we would be exploring

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,560
um different solutions and we we always

00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,760
encourage open source in terms of that

00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,760
the development of any of those

00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,760
solutions that go through

00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,520
not all of the teams will want to do

00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,920
that some of them have proprietary

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,680
um technologies that they want to use so

00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,160
they might hold on to that

00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,079
so we are kind of at least a promoter of

00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,400
open source in that way uh

00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,160
i mean in in terms of open source that

00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,960
we use internally at the fca

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,720
our advanced analytics team which is

00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,680
otherwise known as subtech

00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,079
they they do use open source in some of

00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,560
their

00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:38,640
work that they're doing but they are

00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,760
looking at ways that they can

00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,599
maybe be a little bit more open with

00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,880
that global financial innovation network

00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,079
on some of the work that they've been

00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,520
doing in the future

00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,200
so that we can actually share some of

00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,400
our learnings across the

00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,079
whole community of international

00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,200
regulators so i guess that's kind of

00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,960
where we're thinking

00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,560
we'll be going in terms of open source

00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,079
but it's only probably a smaller

00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,040
community within the fca that are

00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,720
actually using it

00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,280
it's not it's not broadened out to the

00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:05,119
to the whole wide fca

00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:07,040
i mean come on jennifer

00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,640
oh i just wanted to build on that and i

00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,119
just wanted to make a note because i

00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,079
know

00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,480
that the concept of enterprise-wide open

00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:15,680
source

00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:18,160
policy can be very daunting um

00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,280
even if you believe 100 in the

00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,640
principles

00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,960
and um so to matt's point i want to call

00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,560
out there are degrees of open source

00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,640
that you can follow as you are

00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,160
developing your strategy it doesn't have

00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:33,520
to be

00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:35,280
fully jumping in to that pool for us

00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,560
um for example even amongst the

00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,760
regulatory community

00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,839
the cfpb has had a very fruitful

00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,839
collaboration with the fca

00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:45,359
um and i would consider those

00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:47,839
conversations to be

00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:49,119
open source in nature just between our

00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:51,359
two agencies

00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,720
likewise the example that matt provided

00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:55,200
which is um

00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,880
collaborating in a tech sprint style or

00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,599
similar conversation

00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,720
with one or two specific institutions

00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:03,280
and allowing them

00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,320
to keep their information proprietary

00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,480
and confidential

00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:12,079
and working with them in that manner

00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,440
where they are being transparent with us

00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:16,480
as a regulatory body

00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,440
and vice versa but in a very protected

00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,240
and small bubble

00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,560
that is a step towards open source as

00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,119
you

00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,760
bring your regulatory legal community

00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:27,119
along

00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,359
specifically within regulators

00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,720
and giving them some baby steps and

00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:33,040
proving the value

00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:35,440
of that relationship will help you work

00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:38,720
towards that larger open source

00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:41,440
state yeah yeah we at

00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,480
air we like to say think big but start

00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,119
small

00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,240
and so uh we've had an opportunity today

00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,040
to really see

00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,920
how regulators are uh you know really

00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,240
engaging

00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,760
in innovation and using technology

00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,359
innovation in terms of

00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,200
not only understanding what they need to

00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:58,880
regulate but also integrating new

00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,320
technology into how they regulate and

00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,320
being able to do a better job of

00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,720
regulation i think the promise

00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:07,200
of of technology innovation for

00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,720
regulators is lowering the costs for all

00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,520
of the different parties involved

00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,000
and improving the outcomes of what we

00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,359
want

00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,920
regulation to be and what we want

00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:18,960
regulation to be able to to manage

00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,800
um you know ian i wonder uh if we could

00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,800
you know use this as an opportunity to

00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,319
shamelessly plug the sig

00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,240
and the work that we're hoping to do at

00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:28,480
the special interest group

00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,680
yeah absolutely i mean that's what we're

00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,800
here for isn't it so

00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:35,920
obviously what what we what we want is

00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,800
um individuals coming together

00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,920
who've got expertise and really right

00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,880
trying to drive

00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,760
uh open source nature and i think what

00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,839
what i

00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,440
i've observed in the kind of past year

00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:49,200
or two is that is

00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,040
becoming ever more progressive in the

00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,880
industry we are beginning to see

00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,119
financial institutions and we've seen

00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:58,000
today that like the deutsches

00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,640
um goldman sachs and other institutions

00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,400
are

00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:04,480
progressively moving to open source um

00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,480
and putting it on platforms such as

00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:10,079
finos and i think the opportunity

00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,880
for us to to do more of this is is here

00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,240
now

00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,960
and i think this is a great group um

00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,720
and hopefully we will get more members

00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,760
that are looking to join it that have

00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,079
the same

00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,359
view as us to really move this this

00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,760
forward as an industry

00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:26,640
because we we truly believe that open

00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,520
source

00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:31,280
regulators don't set regulation for one

00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:33,599
institution they say it for

00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,680
multiple institutions we as an industry

00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,359
need to work together closer together

00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,280
and we need to be more open if we're

00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:42,319
really going to progress

00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:44,079
which is just great so uh you know if

00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:47,200
you walk away from this session with

00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:49,680
one key learning it is definitely that

00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,359
regulators are engaged in the

00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,599
conversation around innovation

00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:55,040
and how to use technology to drive that

00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:58,319
innovation

00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,560
i want to remind you that the uh

00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:02,000
next session is jennifer lasseter and

00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,560
her colleagues from the cfpb

00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,200
so please uh join them if you want to

00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:09,920
hear about the history of open source at

00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,079
the cfpb which is a fascinating story i

00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:15,359
also want to remind you that our next

00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:17,359
uh meeting for the sig on regtech is

00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,760
going to be on tuesday november 24th at

00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:21,599
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:23,520
noon uh et eastern time and you can go

00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:25,599
ahead and get information or sign up for

00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:29,119
that through the github

00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:31,680
link but um essentially

00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:33,440
uh we are really excited ian and i are

00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,839
really excited to host the sig and we

00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,560
really

00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:38,560
encourage participation um uh if you

00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:42,800
want to be a troublemaker like us

00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,800
come join us on tuesday november 24th

00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,720
and a big thank you to uh matt and

00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:49,520
jennifer uh

00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:51,440
as well for uh sharing their insights on

00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,319
the tech sprint and open source it's

00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,119
been like

00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:56,160
very valuable i really appreciate matt

00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,760
any closing notes

00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,280
what yeah i was just going to do my own

00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,560
shameless plug if that's all right david

00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,000
um

00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,000
if you if you want to get involved in

00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,560
the digital sandbox pilot uh you just

00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,560
have to go to

00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:12,319
www.digitalsandbox.com.uk

00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:14,640
so digitalsandboxpilot.com

00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:15,839
dot uk uh and then you could i mean

00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,520
anybody can register

00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,280
uh you can see some of the features that

00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,760
which we're looking to explore and um

00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,119
that's kind of like a it's an evolution

00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,920
of our thinking in terms of where we're

00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,079
trying to push um

00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:29,599
innovation within the fca which is just

00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,599
great jennifer any closing thoughts

00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,359
i was just gonna say thank you it is

00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,640
always a pleasure to join these

00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:35,680
brilliant minds and have this

00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,720
conversation

00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,800
um and i'm always humbled by the number

00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:44,240
of people that i see in the audience is

00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:46,160
the curiosity that remains when we have

00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,599
a discussion around this topic it gives

00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,079
