Building an FDC3 enabled web application - OSSF 2020

The FDC3 1.1 standard was released in April of 2020, and more and more vendors and organisations are supporting the standards. During this talk, Riko will explain the benefits of an FDC3 1.1-enabled web application, what features are available to use, and walk the audience through a practical example of building such an application. The talk will demonstrate the tooling and libraries available for FDC3 applications, how to engage with the community, and how workflow-driven design is important for successful application interoperability projects.
