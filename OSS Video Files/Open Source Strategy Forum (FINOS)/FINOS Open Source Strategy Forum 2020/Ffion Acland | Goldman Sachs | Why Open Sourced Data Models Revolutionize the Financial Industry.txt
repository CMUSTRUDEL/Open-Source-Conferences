Ffion Acland from Goldman Sachs talks about how the open sourced Data Management Platform FINOS Legend will impact collaboration and efficiency across the Financial Industry through the use of shared data models.

Ffion Acland's BIO

Ffion leads the EMEA Data Models and Governance team at Goldman Sachs tasked with defining, building and governing the internal data models for derivatives products. Since joining the Data Models and Governance team four years ago, she has contributed to many internal consumer implementations and most recently championed the project to open source the firm’s proprietary data management software ‘Legend’. Previously, Ffion was a member of the Credit Middle Office team in Operations where she gained experience over a six year period in derivatives and cash products. The need to successfully navigate the complexities of trade processing during that role led to a recognition of the industry-wide lack of coherence in data models.
