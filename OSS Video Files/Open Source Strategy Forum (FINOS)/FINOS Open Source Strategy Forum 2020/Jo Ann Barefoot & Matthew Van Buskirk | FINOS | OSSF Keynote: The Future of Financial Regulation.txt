air we are a non-profit dedicated to

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,400
digitizing the financial regulatory

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,720
world

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,000
and i'm happy to be joined in this

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,040
fireside chat with

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,320
matt van buskirk the co-ceo

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,439
of hummingbird who is also an advisor to

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,399
us at air on technology in general

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,960
and especially on open source so matt

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,280
welcome to this conversation

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,000
looking forward to it we are going to

00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,920
make it a

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,680
two-way conversation we actually talk

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,520
about these issues all the time so we're

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,759
just going to have that conversation to

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,080
share with the group today

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,280
so when we think about bringing open

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,879
source to the financial regulatory space

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,680
a lot is at stake the financial system

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,120
is the circulatory system of the economy

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,599
if it doesn't work well

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,800
bad things happen if it works really

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,640
well some

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,560
really good things can happen in today's

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,360
technology world that weren't possible

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,400
in the

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,599
in the past but if we're not careful

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:37,599
uh the regulatory aspect of this since

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,599
it's such a highly regulated set

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,680
it'll choke off good innovation that we

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,720
would all like to see

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,120
accidentally and it will also uh

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,959
potentially allow new risks to come into

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,519
the system

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,200
and the regulatory system needs new

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,120
tools for the digital age and the

00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,080
pandemic in particular

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,159
has really uh accelerated the

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,440
recognition of that and the readiness to

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,159
adopt it

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,319
so matt let me start by asking you where

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:12,640
does open source fit into that

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,599
challenge i like to draw parallels to

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,280
the

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,120
tech world when we're thinking about

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,040
where the regulatory

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,720
situation is today and where we would

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,040
like it to go

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,360
uh it's basically like the tech world

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,040
was back in the 1990s with a bunch of

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,480
different

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,879
providers sort of building their own

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,920
closed ecosystems whether that's

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:36,640
microsoft versus apple comparison

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,400
or the sort of fragmentation we saw in

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,000
the internet space with aol and

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,680
compuserve and all these other solutions

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,879
that didn't really

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,319
speak with each other at all that's

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,599
basically where we are today

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,239
in the regulatory world from a

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,360
technology perspective and in some cases

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,840
the technology that's being used

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,200
actually

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:58,799
does come from the 1990s kind of vintage

00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,720
uh maybe even older in some cases so

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,720
the revolution we've seen in the

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,840
software space moving towards more

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,920
interoperability

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,120
more reliance on shared protocols and

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,640
standards

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,720
more open source code bases uh

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,640
is non-existent really in the regulatory

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,840
world and

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,320
they're i think it presents a

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,280
major challenge to innovation widely in

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,280
financial services

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:30,160
as we've seen sort of fintech expand and

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,479
the banking industry tried to adopt more

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,639
sophisticated technology

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,479
we're still regulating using the same

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,520
approaches and tools that we did

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:42,880
20 years ago and it's going to continue

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,360
to it'll become a bigger and bigger

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,240
anchor weighing down innovation unless

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,840
we can

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,320
move to a new footing uh using

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,040
the same themes i was just talking about

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,240
in the regulatory space as well

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,600
so we could really unlock innovation to

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,080
a degree that we have not

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,759
seen before if we can start to think

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,520
about regulation

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,360
as more of a open source software

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,880
challenge as opposed to

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,039
sort of lawyers and papers and

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,759
spreadsheets yeah

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,759
and this thinking is quite new in the

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,919
regulatory space we do have some

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,600
financial regulatory agencies that are

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,919
using open source

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,720
techniques the in the united states the

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,880
financial

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,720
uh or in the uk the financial conduct

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,639
authority has done this in the united

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,919
states the consumer financial protection

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,800
bureau

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,320
has open sourced some of its work but

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,360
regulators still

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,199
tend to react to the thought of open

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,840
sources sounding

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,800
insecure and risky so there's a lot of

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,400
education and

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,320
part of what we're trying to do today is

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,120
to offer a

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,199
issue a call to action for the people in

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,800
this virtual room to do more

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,479
but they're tremendous potential

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,039
benefits to regulators

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,039
and some of them are just what this

00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,840
audience already knows about open source

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,720
but

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,000
part of it is uh that regulators today

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,919
reinvent the wheel

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,240
every time they need to develop

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,560
something and we could tell you horror

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,639
stories about agencies spending

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,120
tens of millions of dollars to create

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,120
some new

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,960
platform for doing their work that type

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,440
of thing

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,479
completely inside their own silo when

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,639
there's maybe

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,240
already a better one at a sister agency

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,919
that they don't even know about

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,319
so you could get beyond reinventing the

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,720
wheel you could get the benefit

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,319
of regulators being able to build on

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,759
each other's work

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:40,720
you could get the benefit of scrutiny

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,800
from the open source community on these

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,919
tools to find the

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,840
the bugs and the weaknesses and the

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,520
vulnerable spots in them and get those

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:54,000
fixed quickly

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:56,319
you can get the ability to constantly

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,599
improve can continuously update and

00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,840
build these tools out

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,360
much of the financial system and

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,800
certainly the financial regulatory

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,919
system is

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,840
is half paralyzed with rigid old

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:11,280
technologies as you said

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,599
that are really hard to update um

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,280
and you can also build interoperability

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,680
of the regulatory system which

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,520
would foster in interoperability of the

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,880
financial system which would be very

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,919
beneficial

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,479
especially to international financial

00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:26,800
organizations

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,880
and you can also get the benefit of

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,720
regulatory agencies being able

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,639
and to some extent to get away from

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,520
their procurement

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,599
processes for technology which are very

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,280
cumbersome and difficult

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,319
um and inflexible and let them start to

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,960
be able to build

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:49,680
tools just by finding the open source

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,800
material for it and and be able to move

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,400
in a much more

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:57,280
adaptable way so

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,160
toward that end one of the exciting

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,360
things that

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:04,960
i want to talk about today is that we

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:08,160
at air are partnering with venos

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,639
and creating a special interest group a

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,360
sig

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:15,840
on reg tech in the um uh in the linux

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,919
ecosystem we want to invite all of you

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,280
to join in that we're just at the very

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,680
start of it i think it's going to be a

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,319
very exciting opportunity

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,599
but matt let me ask you what you think

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,080
are the obstacles

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,800
to being able to bring open source

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,640
approaches

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:35,440
into the financial regulatory space

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,000
i touched on some on the regulatory side

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,000
the

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,760
existing procurement processes are one

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,240
of the biggest barriers

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,120
one of the agencies that we've met with

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,920
in the past

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,240
which i will not name said that if they

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,680
wanted to get their hands on the new

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,760
piece of technology it would probably

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,040
take them seven years from

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,640
kicking the process off to when they

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,760
would actually have it deployed i

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,519
remember that meeting

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:02,480
yeah yeah we think about how it would be

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,000
no good anyway yeah yeah it will be way

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,959
out of date

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,880
um so there are all sorts of structural

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,120
barriers that the regulators face

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,399
and another challenge is that since

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,800
they're typically forced to go through

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,320
normal procurement processes

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,640
the companies that are often the best at

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,200
navigating procurement

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,880
the procurement world and government are

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,760
rarely the ones that are

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,040
the most cutting edge on technology so

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,480
there have been multiple instances we've

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,959
seen in the past where a

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,080
contractor gets steel deploys technology

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,760
and it's already

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,440
many years out of date by the time it's

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:39,120
deployed

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,640
um and probably cost five or ten times

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,880
more than it would need to if they had

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:47,440
taken a more open source development

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:49,200
uh model so there are a variety of

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,800
legal structural impediments that the

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,839
regulators face uh

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,680
the uh air the alliance regulation and

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,160
the buckley law firm

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,800
released a memo a report earlier this

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,440
year

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,560
which was analyzing several of those

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,000
barriers

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,680
which if uh adjusted slightly could

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,240
enable the regulators to adopt this

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,839
approach

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,880
more readily but another i think is

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,440
a challenge they face is that the

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:19,200
regulatory agencies themselves are

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,920
used to needing to be authoritative and

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,440
fully understanding of all the risks and

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,480
opportunities presented by something

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,480
before they come out and

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,519
make their view publicly known and that

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,480
typically involves them sitting back for

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,880
two or three years

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,480
and studying something but they don't

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,720
have the in-house expertise

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,600
to understand this technology for the

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,800
most part

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:46,399
with some notable exceptions

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:49,120
and they don't the process inherently

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,360
doesn't lend itself to staying on top of

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,200
things as they evolve

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,920
so the lack of exposure and

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,440
lack of in-house expertise or at least

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,320
enough in-house expertise is one of the

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,839
biggest barriers

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,160
and i think that's one of the largest

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,279
opportunities presented by

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,519
the open source community here um

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,040
like one major learning i've had as i'm

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,399
a former regulator

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,240
but a techie at heart

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,519
there are not too many people in the

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,120
regulatory world have a full

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,560
understanding of what

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,320
the cutting edge capabilities in the

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,519
tech world are

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,160
and if you go to a technologist and tell

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,760
them

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,200
about or speak about the regulatory

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,800
world they probably would be falling

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,399
asleep immediately

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,000
uh without realizing that there are some

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,120
very meaningful

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,079
and impactful challenges uh that

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,399
could really benefit from bringing their

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,440
talents to bear

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,680
so we really need to be able to

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,200
cross-pollinate

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,560
have people understand regulation

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,160
getting in the same room with people

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,320
understand the technology and start to

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,120
develop

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,639
common approaches to things and i

00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,920
strongly believe the most effective way

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,200
to do that is through

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,800
open source uh development mechanisms

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,839
and putting projects out on github for

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,880
people to contribute to

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,560
and start to build a community that can

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,519
brainstorm solutions to these very

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:14,959
meaningful challenges that we face

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:18,079
and then go ahead go ahead okay

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:20,560
so there will be areas where certainly

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,760
regulators will need to keep their data

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,839
uh

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,120
not shared although there be some places

00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,360
where it'll be good for for them to

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,680
share data so that

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,639
for example companies in the industry

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,279
can

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,160
benchmark themselves against other

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,440
information or

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,000
trends and that type of thing but your

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,120
view

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,760
is that there's not too

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,639
much reason to fear that putting

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:50,079
methodologies into open source

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,839
uh will compromise them there's a lot

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,200
you do a lot of work in financial crime

00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,760
at hummingbird

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,639
and there's certainly a concern raised

00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,720
that if

00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,760
if regulators were open sourcing their

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,000
techniques

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,600
for detecting financial crime that the

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,800
criminals would all

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,200
go figure out how to how to game it

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,720
what's your answer to that that's sort

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,000
of the same response to

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,440
the information security angle on

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,720
open source where there's sort of a

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,959
common uh stereotypical view that open

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,200
source means open data

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,000
and reality it's sort of the the

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,839
eyeballs

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,920
comparison question like how many people

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,240
are looking for vulnerabilities versus

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,560
how many people are looking for

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,079
uh vulnerabilities to exploit versus how

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,600
many are looking for them to protect

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,240
against them

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,959
that holds true very significantly in

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,600
the

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,279
any money laundering world as well where

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,519
the criminal world are not

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,800
they're not uh hiding information from

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,800
each other there's

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,160
been the advent of a concept of crime as

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,959
a service

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,480
where people are developing tools and

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,480
finding vulnerabilities in financial

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,600
services providers

00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,360
and they're often not exploiting

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,279
themselves they're building those tools

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,120
then selling them or licensing licensing

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:06,639
them to other criminal

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,240
people so you have a average level of

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,079
sophistication these tools that keeps

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,320
getting better and better

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,199
but on the financial industry side of

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,959
the table

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:18,079
where often combating these bad actors

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,880
by

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:22,160
going to conferences once a year and

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,800
learning what the latest

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,800
developments are so best case scenario

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,519
there you may learn about a new approach

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,839
a year plus after it's been commonly

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,839
deployed

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,240
so the there's an equivalent challenge

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,920
there where

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,279
i would argue that if we were developing

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,800
capabilities and

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,720
that were much more sophisticated and

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,000
robust and

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,040
even if they were visible to the

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,480
criminal world it wouldn't be any

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,920
different than it is today

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,240
where they're freely sharing information

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,360
amongst themselves but

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,800
every financial institution in out there

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,120
regardless of whether they are

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,320
a major bank with thousands of people

00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,839
doing this work

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,000
or a community bank that may only be

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,279
able to put half of a full-time person

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,760
onto it they could all

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,880
coordinate uh and defend themselves more

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:13,920
effectively and it would

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,519
even the playing field significantly so

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,279
i think there's a lot of parallels to

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,920
there there's

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,720
there's shocking uh statistics from the

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,680
un

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,160
uh saying that the volume of money

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,240
laundering annually is

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,759
somewhere around two trillion dollars

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,440
and then we catch less than one percent

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,959
of it with the tools we have now so

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,680
we're gonna have to have better tools if

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,839
we're gonna

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,639
combat crimes for example like human

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,240
trafficking that rely on laundered money

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,519
so i know we're going to run short on

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,800
time we want to share with the audience

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,720
some

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,560
some things we want to urge you to do

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,040
because this is a revolution that's

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,360
coming

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,399
it we think it may be coming faster than

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:57,279
people think there's a lot of energy

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,360
globally gathering around really

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,480
transforming the financial regulatory

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,759
space

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,680
so for the the people in this room who

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:09,360
may be working for their

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:12,639
major financial company on

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,399
on the product side what should they do

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,000
if they want to get involved in helping

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,000
their company do

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,720
better on the compliance side with open

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,720
source tools

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:26,240
i think part of it is just uh educating

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,920
the getting involved with the compliance

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,720
team letting them know what

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,160
could be done compliance teams very

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,600
rarely actually have engineering

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,959
resources that they can

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,360
bring to bear on the challenges that

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:40,880
they face so they don't know what

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,920
could be done so

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,880
it's getting interested in your

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,320
compliance team's work obviously there's

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,680
sort of stereotypical view of compliance

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,959
that they're the people

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:56,000
that say no to all of your good ideas

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:58,240
but in most cases hopefully

00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,360
those it's just because they may not

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,680
understand fully

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,559
the opportunities or the risks presented

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:07,600
by adopting new tech and

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:10,240
investing technical effort into

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,360
your compliance function could really

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,600
unlock

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,720
a lot of potential for you to do other

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,000
things that are

00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,280
consumer-facing um

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,400
so that's one piece of it i think

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,000
another would be

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:29,039
uh participating in the

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,240
the sig and with non-profits like air

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,760
and the finnos that are trying to bring

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,440
collaborative efforts to bear on this

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:41,440
those are other issues you would

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:43,120
highlight i think one thing

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,400
that would be a good practical step

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,480
would be as you talk with your

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,360
compliance teams about this

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,640
uh talk with their examiners as well if

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,919
especially if you're a bank

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,440
um and uh let them know that you

00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,960
that you're thinking about doing some

00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,000
work along these lines

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,919
and and bring them along because

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,280
matt and i are both former regulators

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,280
and we know we don't

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,480
we're not criticizing the regulators

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,400
they've been doing the best they can

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,760
with the technology they've had

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:14,240
but getting that community comfortable

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,000
with newer technology is a learning

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,360
process and we need to engage in it

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,360
together

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:23,840
and maybe to close just to say that

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,320
working with this effort as matt said

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,440
there's a stereotype that regulatory

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:33,200
work is boring and uh

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:35,520
you know box checking and bureaucratic

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,400
and that's really not true there are

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,480
very interesting problems in this space

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,480
there are problems that nobody has

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,919
touched yet with good technology

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,880
and that you could really have major

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,280
impact

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,799
and the good that it can do if you want

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,880
to fight

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,000
credit discrimination or you want to

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,039
fight

00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,640
trafficking in children or you want to

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:02,240
figure out sustainable finance

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,919
because you care about climate change i

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,600
mean these are the big issues on the

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,440
regulatory agenda

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,360
and these kinds of tools are going to be

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,240
the secret to doing it

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,640
so we hope you'll work with the new sig

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,080
and

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,480
um and and go back to your offices and

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,440
or

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,520
virtually go back and talk with your

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,000
regulatory teams about how to

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,080
bring open source innovation into this

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,350
very important sector

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:34,600
so thank you matt thanks everyone thank

00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:37,600
