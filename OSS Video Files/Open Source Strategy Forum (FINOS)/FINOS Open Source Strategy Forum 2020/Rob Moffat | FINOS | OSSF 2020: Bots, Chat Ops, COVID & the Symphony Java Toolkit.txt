Bots, Chat Ops, COVID & the Symphony Java Toolkit - OSSF 2020

In this talk, Rob gives his views on how permanent remote work has changed the nature of software development in the finance industry.   This talk weaves together: the effects of COVID on Agile; the increasing importance of chat platforms such as Microsoft Teams, Symphony, and Slack; the rise of “Chat Ops”, Bots and GitHub; participating in a remote Hackathon; and why Deutsche Bank’s Symphony Practice have contributed their Symphony Java Toolkit to FINOS, the Fintech Open Source Foundation.

[Music]

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,440
hi thanks for joining my talk

00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,880
bots chat ups covid and the symphony

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,719
java toolkit

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,480
i'm also going to talk about hackathons

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,880
workflow agile

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,240
github and open source as we go and

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,320
hopefully i'll be able to tie all that

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,800
together into some consistent hole

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,439
but you can be the judge of that and i

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,880
know that

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,800
this might be a confusing bunch of

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,320
disparate keywords but

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,000
over the next few minutes i'll unpack

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,280
all those and hopefully you'll see how

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,239
they all fit together

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,079
so let's start with symphony uh this is

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,040
a screenshot from symphony it's a chat

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,559
platform

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,559
it i'm imagining that lots of people

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,079
here today are very familiar with chat

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,760
platforms now and use them from their

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,480
day-to-day work

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,399
and this is slack it's pretty similar to

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,920
symphony maybe you're familiar with that

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,920
you've got your chats down the left hand

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,079
side and the box at the bottom for

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,640
entering text

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,079
and this is microsoft teams and again

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,280
it's the same kind of layout i guess you

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,760
could say there's a lot of

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,360
convergent evolution going on here all

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,159
these platforms share a lot of the same

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,520
features

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,080
and we'll talk about some of these

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,439
features as we go

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,200
and you might have even seen this in the

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,920
press lately about how the guys building

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,080
slack

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,960
are trying to sue microsoft over exactly

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,280
that issue

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,640
not only is teams similar to slack but

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,280
they're trying to push teams out to

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,799
everyone

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,280
they're using their dominance of office

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,680
tools to try and muscle in on slack's

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,680
territory

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,799
and here is a google trends chart of

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,960
those two

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,880
as you can see teams is now a lot more

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,720
popular as a search term than slack

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,240
which explains why slack guys are

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,600
getting mad now what's really

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,200
interesting to me at least is what

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,600
happens in march

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,439
suddenly teams gets this huge boost and

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,200
slack gets a smaller one

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,960
loads more people are using it and i'm

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,960
pretty convinced this is

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,560
kovid related it ties into when we all

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,960
started to work from home

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,399
somehow microsoft got a big coveted

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,960
related uptick here which

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,640
really helped their notoriety now

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,680
symphony isn't on this graph symphony is

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,719
a kind of a small

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,399
player when compared to slack and teams

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,720
it's super specific to the finance

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,520
industry and it has a really good market

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,039
share there

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,959
the reason being it has a much better

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,319
story with regards to compliance and

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,680
security

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,000
which is something that banks and

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,000
financial regulators are really keen on

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,440
at deutsche bank we saw the same things

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,520
in this chart the number of messages

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,160
going over symphony since about march

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,280
has doubled and that makes sense people

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,840
can't communicate

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,519
face to face anymore obviously covert

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,200
has changed the way we work

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,640
and teams and slack and symphony they're

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,840
the kind of tools we use to interact

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,840
with each other now

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,319
so let's let's just change tac now this

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,160
is the the manifesto for agile software

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,879
development it's a website from about 20

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,319
years ago

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,840
and i expect most of the people at this

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,360
conference are going to know what agile

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,800
software development is

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,800
basically the guys who came up with the

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,120
agile manifesto were unhappy about the

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,640
way the software got built in the 90s

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,480
and they wanted to throw out the big

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,120
project plans and the big upfront design

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,640
and so on

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,280
and try and build software in a more

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,720
collaborative exploratory way

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,480
this has had a massive impact on

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,360
software development and i'm going to

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,599
run through a few

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,959
agile practices now really quickly

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,640
because i know everyone's just going to

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,319
be nodding along to these they know what

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,280
they are and i want to get onto the good

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,640
stuff

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,159
but there are four main statements in

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,000
this manifesto here and the one i want

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,680
you to keep in mind is the first one

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,640
individuals and interactions over

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,640
processes and tools

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,920
so here are a bunch of beautiful people

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,720
having a stand-up meeting in their

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,159
office

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,920
this could well be a photo taken at

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,599
deutsche bank in 2019

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,440
everyone stands up to keep the meeting

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,640
short these are individuals having

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,760
interactions

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,319
over processes and tools now if i'm in

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,840
a meeting now no one knows whether i'm

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,840
standing up or or lying down

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,920
the other thing about stand-up meeting

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,599
is that it forces you to concentrate

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,439
but on a conference call or a zoom chat

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,200
like this one i might be present

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,599
but engaged in some other task on my

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,120
computer and if i'm present but i'm not

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,400
really paying attention

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,200
and if you're there but you're not

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:09,120
really you know focused and involved

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,120
is it is it really still even a meeting

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,040
number two this is a scrum board it's a

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,640
it's a bunch of post-it notes keeping

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,439
track of what works being done and who's

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,959
doing it

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,639
and these were already on the ropes

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,000
before coronavirus because of

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,600
distributed teams

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,680
but now it's just impossible there's no

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,160
way i'm devoting a wall to my house

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,000
in my house to do this and it wouldn't

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,400
help anyone because my team are

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,520
everywhere else so we end up with tools

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,160
like jira for

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,759
tracking this stuff and here's some guys

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,960
doing some pair programming two people

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,320
at one computer

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,400
and you can see their scrum board in the

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,680
background there this doesn't really

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,199
happen anymore either

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,880
we have to screen share to get things

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,160
like this and even then it's it's not

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,759
quite the same

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,320
and the tools we generally use for

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,120
screen share are things like teams and

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,720
skype and

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,040
and things that allow us to do chat too

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,040
and so there's this idea of having teams

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,960
big enough to feed with two pizzas

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,800
now this is attributed to jeff bezos on

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,400
this slide but i think this idea kind of

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,400
comes from kent beck who came up with

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,320
the agile approach called xp

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,000
or extreme programming he was he was

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,759
very keen on his developers all eating

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,520
together and working in close proximity

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,440
to each other so they could

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,880
discuss their issues over a coffee or a

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,160
doughnut

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,560
i don't know about you but most of the

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,160
people i work close closely with now

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,280
i've i've never even met physically

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,160
there a lot of them are in india

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,120
and finally uh this is planning poker

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,479
from scrum

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,800
the idea is that when you're planning

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,560
what work to do everyone's playing cards

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,080
and you you play a card down and the

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,080
higher the number of cards

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,520
you play the more complicated do you

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,039
think the piece of work is

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,479
and the idea that is that everyone in

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,360
the team will eventually agree on the

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,759
complexity the size of a piece of work

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,360
the reason you're doing this with cards

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,720
is to stop peer pressure and group thing

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,280
you don't want the first person's

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,840
estimate

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,280
to affect the last person's so you play

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,840
all your cards at the same time

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,520
face down and then discuss why you all

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,000
came up with something different

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,520
again cards table face-to-face

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,120
discussions

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,880
it's it's all gone and so this is that

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,479
statement from the agile manifesto again

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,560
individuals and interactions over

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,360
processes and tools

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,360
it's it's apparent now and certainly for

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,199
a while that you can't do

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,800
individuals and interactions without

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,319
chat and phones and video conference

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,080
tools we need those tools

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,400
it's not a choice of this over that as

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,800
the agile manifesto had it

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,240
it's literally you can't do that thing

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,440
on the left without the thing on the

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,360
right it should be

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,479
individuals and interactions via

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,479
processes and tools

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,120
but luckily there are teams that have

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,440
been working like that for a while now

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,120
on github like a lot of other people i

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,080
contribute to software projects and

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,000
rather than

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,120
coordinate with people using agile

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,880
approaches

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,120
that i've discussed we coordinate with

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,720
chat and here's an example where someone

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,120
on the internet has contributed a minor

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,199
fix for an article i wrote on github

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,720
and they opened us an issue submitted a

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,520
pull request

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,960
and then i reviewed and merged it and

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,720
github works really well

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,160
like this so kobe is really forcing us

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,080
to move away from those traditional

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,599
agile practices

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,440
while ago whether or not you preferred

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,000
one approach over the other was personal

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,520
style but

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
now that's kind of irrelevant you have

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,400
to make that change

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,199
let's talk a bit about chat helps now so

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,039
when i've

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,560
done previous presentations i've thrown

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,240
up the definition of chat ups and it's

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,560
got a lot of people scratching their

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,560
heads and maybe not really understanding

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,240
the full impact of it so

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,680
today i'm going to come up at it from a

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,560
different direction

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,720
so let's ask the question what is an

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,160
operating system

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,919
and according to bbc bite size which is

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,919
part of the bbc for helping school

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,560
children advice for their exams

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,400
an operating system or os controls the

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,919
general operation of a computer

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,520
and provides an easy way for us to

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,960
interact with computers

00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,479
and run applications the reason i chose

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,319
this definition is because

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,000
it's one of the only ones that mentions

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,599
us and os provides

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,360
us an easy way to interact with our

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,039
computers and

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,400
do the stuff we want our computers to do

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:14,160
printing editing spreadsheets whatever

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,840
on the desktop the dominant operating

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,680
system is microsoft windows

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,080
it's mediating the interactions between

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,360
you some software applications

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,280
and the hardware whereas on mobile the

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,160
dominant operating systems are ios and

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,319
android

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,759
microsoft did try to have a windows

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,440
version for mobile but that didn't

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,959
really work out

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,240
the types of things we do on our phones

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:35,839
and tablets are different to the things

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,200
we do on the desktop so perhaps that's

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,159
one reason why we ended up with a

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,519
different operating system there

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,200
the underlying hardware is also

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,560
different so the operating system is

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,240
doing different things

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,320
and the applications a lot of the time

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,320
are different too

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,320
now here's a couple of other things that

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,560
you could claim to be a bit like

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,040
that definition of an operating system

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,440
things like skype or whatsapp here

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,399
mediate the interactions with a lot of

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,480
people

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,480
rather than applications and something

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,560
like apache kafka on the right there

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,240
which is an enterprise service bus is

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,080
mediating the interactions between

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,040
lots of applications it's allowing them

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,040
all to talk to each other

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,839
so chat ops essentially is the chat

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,320
platform

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,360
as some kind of operating system lots of

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,880
users

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,680
lots of applications all working

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,360
together so let's look at an example and

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,720
for this i'm going to show you an issue

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,760
from our github project

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:35,120
symphony java toolkit

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,959
so in this issue gab raises and

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,640
raises an issue suggesting changes

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,240
changing to the name the name space and

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,120
he's see seeing mao

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,240
on on this with with that symbol there

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,240
in his comments

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,480
and on the next line you can see a

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,640
verified badge

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,720
which says that gabs commit was verified

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,320
and next to that you can see a red x

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,040
which shows the result of the commit a

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,240
builder's run and it's failed

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,800
and additionally you can see that

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,680
there's the finos cla bot has added the

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,240
tag cla

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,880
present and mao mentions the issue

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,040
somewhere else and i comment on it

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,600
and this is a workflow input involving

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,959
people and applications

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,360
although in this context we call them

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,200
bots that you know for historic reasons

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,959
and github have arguably achieved a type

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,480
of operating system here designed to

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,399
allow people and applications to

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,480
collaborate and build software

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,440
whereas windows was an operating system

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,680
about well windows and people and mouse

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,079
and

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,320
on-screen buttons github is an operating

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:36,160
system about chats and repos and bots

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,160
and users and releases and software

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,480
and this slide says it all teams is the

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,079
new operating system

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,360
essentially for a customer it's where

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,160
they will do everything that they need

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,600
to do

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,360
and this is microsoft saying this

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,880
microsoft gets this

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,399
they want to recreate the glory of

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,079
windows so much

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,079
that they bought github and they own

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,720
that and they're also throwing

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,880
everything they have at teams

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,000
so where we are so far well one there's

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,880
a new kind of operating

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,720
system that hosts our applications two

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,680
kofi just forced us into a new way of

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,720
working

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:12,320
and three old agile practices

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,839
don't work anymore so if that's the case

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,279
we need to build our applications to

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,279
suit this new working environment

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,839
um i've been developing bots and apps on

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,959
symphony for a number of years both at

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,320
hsbc and deutsche bank since being a

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,640
deutsche bank we've put together the

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,200
symfony java toolkit and recently we've

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,519
denoted

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,640
donated this to finos to own a market

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,079
going forward

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,240
it's an open source collection of

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,399
libraries available on github

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,920
that you can use to build symphony bots

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,120
but to frame this work i want to take

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,680
you through the evolution of our

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,279
thinking with respect to building bots

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,320
and through that arrive at the reason

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,720
why we built this toolkit

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,360
so to start with my view of bots was

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,200
like

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,959
oh it's the command line all over again

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,519
i can type commands to my bot

00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:00,079
and have it respond texting text out

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:03,040
it's just like dos or linux

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,560
and although that's limiting it's also

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,480
really liberating because i don't have

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,000
to worry about authenticating the user i

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,440
don't have to worry about testing in

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,760
different browsers

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,519
but worry about networks of firewalls or

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,639
accessibility or keeping up to date with

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,440
the latest

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,920
fad javascript libraries on the front

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,000
end

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,519
so so that seemed nice but at the same

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,360
time it's much more limited than

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,120
building a web app say

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,399
we've see we've also seen a lot of times

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,200
bots being used for things they

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,880
shouldn't be

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,320
it seems like every website has a bot

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,320
these days and they're

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,320
they're really victims of a hype cycle

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,320
but there are use cases that work better

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,519
on chat platform

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,240
the first is anything to do with

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,240
notifications that works so much better

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,760
than than on a web application because

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,959
generally people always have their chat

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,240
platform open

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,639
and it's probably a better way to

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,680
receive a notification via email

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,279
if the notification is something short

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,200
a chat platform doesn't replace like a

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,120
wiki or a content management system but

00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,760
it's a great way to notify people of

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,360
things

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,440
and it's great for persistence all your

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,480
messages are recorded for all time

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,760
and they're searchable and obviously a

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,680
chat platform's a better

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,040
is it's way better than a browser app

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,000
for sharing things between groups of

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,440
people

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,760
because all of those abstractions are

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,839
provided for you around identity

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,959
and rooms and groups and messages and so

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,639
on

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,720
so you've got some good reasons for

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,600
building bots

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,839
and next i started to see that a chat

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,720
platform was really a bit like a big

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,160
append only database like datomix if you

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,639
know that one

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,680
you can do indexing through hashtag

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,480
inventions

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,920
hashtagging and mentioning people and

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,760
you can control access to different

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,120
pieces of information via private chat

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,600
rooms since different rooms have

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,040
different

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,040
members and privacy settings and

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,959
administrators

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,040
each message on symphony and this is

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,959
true on teams and slack too

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,199
have a json payload as well as some

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,800
markup formatting the message

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,120
and that means that the chat is perfect

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,839
for storing details of a workflow

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,079
as we saw in those github examples

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,880
earlier

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,320
so rather than rather than do a tour of

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,720
the functionality of

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,320
the symfony java toolkit i'm just going

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,800
to demonstrate something we built with

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,000
it

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,600
and show you how it works a lot of the

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,600
stuff i'm building at deutsche bank is

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,519
is behind our firewall so i can't show

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,160
you any of that but a week ago

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,639
um the db symphony practice participated

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,040
in

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,920
symphony's yearly london hackathon now

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,160
as you'd expect

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,600
this was done remotely we were all

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,639
sitting at home chatting about what we

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,199
were going to build

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,959
using symphony obviously and we were

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,600
visit video conferencing and screen

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,760
sharing

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,680
but actually this was a plus as i've

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,160
said earlier my team is based in india

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,399
so

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,920
if we had a physical hackathon in london

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,959
it would have been a very different

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,399
story

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,120
my team wouldn't wouldn't really have

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,040
been able to get involved at all

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,720
but this just underlines the point

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,399
further about the changing nature of

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,560
development work

00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,920
so we had to choose something to build

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,040
for the symphony hackathon

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,240
and probably somewhat fortuitously it

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,920
ties together

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,600
all of the things i've been talking

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,040
about so far at least

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,199
i hope so we've talked about symphony as

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,880
being like an append only database

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,519
which handles access control and

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,199
indexing we talked about chat as being

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,800
like a new kind of operating system

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,000
linking people and bots and allowing

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,279
them to work together

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,279
and we've talked about the effects of

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,880
covid on agile and how the

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,360
a lot of the practices of agile don't

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,959
work anymore and the symphony hackathon

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,320
gave us a great chance to test out how

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,639
quickly we could build something with

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,920
our

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,920
symphony java toolkit

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,079
so what did we build remember we only

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,279
had an eight hour working day to build

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,279
something in

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,800
so we weren't really looking to change

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,240
the world but hopefully

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,839
it will give you an idea of how the

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,839
symfony java toolkit works

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,519
so we built a symfony bot that allows

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,240
you to play the scrum planning poker

00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,839
game

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,600
via a symphony chat so remember back to

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,920
how i described this earlier people get

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,759
together they play cards face down

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,519
and they try to indicate the complexity

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,199
estimates of tasks and then everyone

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,720
reveals their estimates and shows you

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,880
the results

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,560
and now i'd like i'd like to do you a

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,000
live demo of that

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,079
but unfortunately at the time of

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,639
recording all my colleagues are very

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,079
asleep

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,920
and so instead i'm going to replay the

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,040
demo we gave to the hackathon as a set

00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,600
of slides

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,440
and yeah i mean this also reduces the

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,440
chance of a massive technical

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,480
disaster too so this is a bit of a

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,480
cop-out but

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,240
hopefully you'll be able to see how it

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,279
works and get an idea of what's going on

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,639
anyway

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,440
and i'll be using screenshots of

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,279
symphony to illustrate my points

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,199
and at the same time i'll talk about the

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,639
symphony java toolkit and how it allows

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:48,240
us to build these things at

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,759
hackerspeak hackathon speeds sorry um

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,199
just as a trigger warning going in

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,079
there's going to be some screenshots of

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,759
java code

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,680
i'll be talking about them at a high

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,839
level so there'll be no

00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,160
need to comprehend what that code is

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,160
doing

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,000
so instead of getting our developers

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,160
together in a meeting

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,600
room we're going to get our developers

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,640
together in a symphony room

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,520
to play playing poker and on this first

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,079
screen

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,520
i've typed slash help often when you

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,959
want to address a command to a bot you

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,240
put a slash in front of the word so

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,919
people know it's for a bot

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,000
this is kind of a convention we have in

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,839
symphony and everyone in the room gets

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,760
to see these same messages so they see

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,760
this helm message

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,600
and simply allows you to embed form

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,200
elements into a chat so

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,960
you can have these buttons like these

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,280
blue ones here and people can press them

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,760
to tell the bot to do things

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,640
and we're going to use those later so

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,960
first up

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,799
in planning poker someone proposes a

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,559
story to vote on

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,400
and at the bottom i'm typing in the

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,559
details of the story

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,520
now to identify the story we're using a

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,799
hashtag

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,799
so there it's moon tower so people can

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,400
refer to that story by using that hash

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,480
moon tower hashtag

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,320
and as i said before hashtags are kind

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,039
of like an index and in symphony i can

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,039
also watch

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,080
tags and get notifications each time

00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,960
they're used

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,720
just like in twitter so the rest of that

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,200
line is a description of the story for

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,320
the other

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,640
other developers to think about and then

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,000
i

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:19,039
hit enter and this happens

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,280
so the bots replied back with a like a

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:23,120
card here containing the story

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,600
it's got a name a description and an

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,200
empty story points field

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,880
now remember back to our database

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,400
metaphor this is something like adding a

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,760
new row to the story table in the

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,280
database

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,039
and as i said before although there's

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,840
markup on the screen here to display the

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,679
story

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,280
there's also a json representation of

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,240
this story

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,720
that symphony and our bot both

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,440
understand so

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,600
on the left is the underlying json and

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,240
that workflow double 01 bit at the top

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,000
there

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,080
that's the main bit the rest you can

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,520
kind of ignore it's got the name and the

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,160
description and then the

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,039
empty story points field in it on the

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,960
right

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,480
this is the java representation of that

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,280
story and you can see it's got fields

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,679
for the name

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,240
there's a hashtag and the description

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,480
and the story points

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,640
and the symphony java toolkit handles

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,360
all the serialization and

00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,520
deserialization for you

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,480
through the magic of jackson data

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,000
binding

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,520
so we didn't have to think about any of

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,200
that while we did the hackathon we just

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,960
wrote the thing on the right

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,120
and then the thing on left the left we

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,480
got for free and the symphony java

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,480
toolkit also handled

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,960
the presentation of that story on simply

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,799
for us kind of a basic way

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,240
although as we're going to see it's it's

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:38,400
custom

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:40,320
customizable with some templates

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,760
um so we haven't set the story points

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,559
yet um

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,679
next if i click on that poker button uh

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,080
which in this

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,360
screenshot has ticked turned into a tick

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,160
after i pressed it then

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,200
our symphony bot replies back pogba

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,840
created for moon

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,039
tower and then there's a button there to

00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,559
end the poll

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:01,120
and as you can see on the top left of

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:03,200
the screen in that little red circle

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,880
i've been notified of a private message

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:09,200
from the bots

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,880
and this is the private message here

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,000
asking me how many points i want to give

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,440
to this story

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
so this is the equivalent of the playing

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,240
cards uh from that real

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,799
poker planning game and yeah i know this

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,440
looks a bit scrappy and a bit

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:25,039
not the presentation's not great um but

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,559
you know this was a hackathon we were

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,559
just working quickly

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,400
uh so yeah scrum uses these weird

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,880
fibonacci series numbers which i can't

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,720
quite

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,000
get behind but you know whatever this is

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,080
just a hackathon

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,200
we're not trying to reinvent the world

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,440
here

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,880
so everyone in the original room

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,640
everyone who is a member of that

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,720
original chat gets a message

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,960
like this and then they all reply back

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,960
with their votes

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,039
and so here you go you can see all the

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,720
votes coming back into the main room

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,960
and we did this live in the hackathon

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,799
and we got all the judges to be in the

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,720
room and vote on the story too so you

00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,320
can see them all voting here

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,080
and you can you can't tell how many

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,960
points they gave but you you know they

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,200
voted

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,720
and so this was quite a nice interactive

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,919
experience for everyone and made a

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,039
really good

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:13,919
good demo for our hackathon entry

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,840
um behind the scenes what's happening in

00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,520
the room we're basically writing these

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,600
votes as messages into the room

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,200
so again it's like an append only

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,559
database we're appending each answer

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,799
into the room

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,080
here we see the javabean code for the

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,240
answer on the left

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,880
and that json representation for it

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,919
again the workflow one thing is

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,159
is the main answer we've got

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,799
uh the user the poll id the choice they

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:41,919
made when they made it and so on

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:43,120
now what we didn't show you now so

00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,200
so that we didn't show you how many

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,559
points the user gave we customized the

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,919
message view with the free marker

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,440
template

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,440
and you can see that there at the bottom

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,559
it's referenced in the answer java class

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:58,000
using that annotation on line 12

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,840
on the left there uh and the symphony

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,240
java toolkit just takes care of all of

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,120
this

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,919
super super easy to set up and it

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,360
basically

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,960
generates and dumps out these free

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,520
marker templates if you don't provide

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,760
them

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,039
so what you can do is you can have a

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,120
template free

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,880
running of the code look at the

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,919
templates it generates and then go and

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,000
customize them

00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,320
and then reference them in your project

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,400
so you don't really even need to code

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,760
know how to code apache free marker all

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,200
that well you can just

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,960
sort of play around with what's there

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,799
and work from that

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,280
which is it's nice and makes things

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:34,400
really simple

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,320
at some points then so everyone's voted

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,679
which we left as that button to click in

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,520
the man in the hackathon but you can

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,720
you can close it by clicking that end

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,559
poll button

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,080
and so the bot then looks back at all

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,760
the answers in the chat room

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,120
and tallies them up it's just like doing

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,039
a database query

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,200
and again using the free market template

00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,400
and the json we produce this table of

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,320
results

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,520
and at this time at this point because

00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,840
all the results are different

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,200
in scrum what you'd normally do now is

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,159
you'd have a discussion about why

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,120
they're different

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,559
and vote again and obviously all of that

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,440
can just happen in a chat room with

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,120
messages

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,559
or you could fire up a conference call

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,200
in symphony and and

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,600
hash it out between you but the idea is

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,440
really

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,039
is that this sort of stuff can happen

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,080
asynchronously

00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,640
and not in a meeting anymore once once

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,159
you get

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,720
some kind of agreement you can hit the

00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,400
assign button and set the results and

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,919
we by the time we got to this point we

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,280
were really running out of time so we

00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,880
kind of fudged it

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,200
i think there should be like a button

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,280
here to assign the

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,120
the most popular number of answers which

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,320
is eight as well but we didn't

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:43,200
we didn't get to that um so

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,880
if i hit that button to a sign what

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,240
happens now is we write a new message

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,960
into the room with the details of the

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,360
story

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,000
updated and it's got now the number of

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,760
story points

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,600
attached to it and i'm going to show you

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,480
just one tiny bit of code to demonstrate

00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,640
how that function works

00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,760
so uh what you can see it here this is

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,919
our result class in

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,520
java it's got all the details of the

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,039
fields that you need to display that bar

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,559
chart who's voted for what like the

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,679
counts and the names and the options in

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,480
the question

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:12,400
and the story hashtag in there and it's

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,200
got that template on there so we can

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,039
format the bar

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:20,559
chart when you hit that highest button

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:23,840
on on the results it actually is going

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:26,080
to run this method called highest here

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,880
and it gets past some parameters so the

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,559
symphony

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,080
java toolkit will hand you pretty much

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,720
whatever parameters you ask for here

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,120
it's very

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,720
it's very open and extensible so here

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,320
we're passing it the details of the room

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:41,919
where it all happened

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:44,640
and it also this history api too

00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,200
and on line 37 we find the relevant

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,159
story

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,200
that this was the result for and on line

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,799
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,279
we fight we figure out which was the

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:55,520
highest option that got voted on

00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,960
and on line 39 we changed that number of

00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,279
story points

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,039
and on line 40 we're returning that new

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,039
version of the story which symphony

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:05,039
will then put back in the chat room so

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,720
as far as our bots concerned

00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,960
we don't really know need to know much

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,880
about messages and chat rooms and stuff

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,799
we can let the tool kit handle that

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,480
toolkit worry about all of that and the

00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:18,000
json formats and all that stuff

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,000
it's all just taken care of

00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:23,039
so the hackathon bot was just really for

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,679
a bit of fun for us

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,880
and we wanted to try out use our toolkit

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,159
and anger and see if we could build

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,360
things quickly with it

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,200
we're going to show some people

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,880
internally this spot and see if they

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,840
want us to carry on developing it but

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,679
personally

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,200
i'm not completely sure that scrum's

00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,400
planning poker is going to survive the

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,080
transition to the

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,760
post-agile world but hopefully um

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,279
i've used this to demonstrate some of

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,840
the power of the symphony java toolkit

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,200
today

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,200
there's actually a lot more going on

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,039
here that i haven't covered

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,200
so it does symphony apps it handles

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,159
clustering it handles microservice

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,760
configuration

00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,520
12 factor apps that kind of thing it

00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,520
does fix messages

00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,600
it can do reporting on maven builds it's

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,480
got health endpoints and spring actuator

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,640
metrics

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,880
and it handles an authentication token

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,720
life cycles and all this sort of stuff

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,080
and we've got tutorials for all these

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,679
things as well

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,200
we're really proud to have been able to

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,720
contribute this to finos

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,039
because we think this is something lots

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,880
of developers can benefit from

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,159
and we're talking to symfony themselves

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,760
about this too and they've

00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,080
they they've agreed that they're going

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:27,279
to donate their bot toolkit

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,360
development to finos 2 and sometime in

00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,640
2021 we're going to combine our efforts

00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,919
together

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,919
and build something really great

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,080
as a whole piece so yeah watch this

00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,080
space there's a lot going on in the

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,840
world of symphony bots

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,520
and we actually have a lot more pieces

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,799
of this in the pipeline

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,120
which maybe i'll come back and talk

00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,760
about another time so thank you very

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,240
much for

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,600
listening if you've got any questions

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,520
