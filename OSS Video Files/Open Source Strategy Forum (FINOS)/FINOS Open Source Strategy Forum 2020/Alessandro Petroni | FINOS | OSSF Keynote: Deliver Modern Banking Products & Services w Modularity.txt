Alessandro Petroni, Global Director & Head, Strategy Financial Services, Red Hat

Banks are looking for ways to adopt new technologies that will allow their customers to expand their financial activities in a friction-free and seamless way, but delivering customer value in a legacy environment is immensely challenging. Restricted by business processes or infrastructure badly in need of modernization, banks need to adopt industry standards, open architectures to quickly embrace business capabilities from vendors, using industry blueprints, that allow them to quickly build offerings that meet digital customer needs.  In this session, Alessandro Petroni will explore Red Hat's experience of building and deploying a modular business microservices-based open architecture - with a code blueprint to accompany it - that helps banks innovate at will, rapidly composing new customer offerings within hours instead of months.
