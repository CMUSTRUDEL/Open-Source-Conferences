diversity in our team

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,520
our board and our community this is a

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,720
fundamental area

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,280
where concrete action is needed now as

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,280
diversity remains a huge issue

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,040
both in financial services and in the

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,080
open source community

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,000
so ali joins us today to talk about

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,119
building an inclusive community

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:27,150

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:30,239
please join me in welcoming ali villagre

00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,239
[Music]

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,799
hi everyone it is such a pleasure to be

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,680
here with you all today

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,240
albeit over zoom not not as good as in

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,960
person

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,240
but um a pleasure nonetheless i'm

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,880
absolutely delighted

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,280
um and honored to be here to speak with

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,840
you

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,439
a bit about uh penis diversity and

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,560
inclusion efforts and a little bit of my

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,759
own experience in the space as well

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,000
so with that i'll get to it the first

00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,560
time i stepped onto city's trading floor

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,079
i was

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,040
completely awestruck excited and beyond

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,840
intimidated i studied social sciences at

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,319
dartmouth

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,920
to be honest i did not know what a stock

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,760
or a bond was

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,760
i did corporate recruiting because it

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,360
seemed my 21 year old self

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,000
lazy not to and since my friends were

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,280
then lo and behold i'm in new york city

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,920
at a final round interview

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,000
talking about a world i barely knew even

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,480
existed

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,720
there's a lot that is fuzzy about that

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,599
day but three things stood out

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,760
number one the trading floor it was

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:39,120
intense

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,200
number two an extremely kind

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,959
extremely kind administrative assistant

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,080
named ellen who must have read the

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,160
terror on my face

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,720
because she complimented the new bag

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,080
that i bought for my big day

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:55,360
and number three my interview with

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,160
a very confident very warm and very

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,519
pregnant

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,680
suny hartford almost on the spot

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,040
i knew that i was meeting a new north

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,440
star

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,440
that day suny took an incredibly

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,080
important place in my heart and in my

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,239
brain

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,720
because i wanted to be just like her

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,000
she had important clients she was the

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,080
boss of a big team

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,080
and yeah apparently she was about to be

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,680
a mom too

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,159
and there was her name sunni what was it

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,959
i didn't know i didn't ask i just knew

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:33,840
that on some level it was like my name

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,840
it was different but here she was

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,840
so preparing for this talk in fact right

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,680
now

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,159
uh made me really really nervous

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,000
i knew from the moment that i said yes i

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,720
was gonna stress about it until

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,319
it was over i also knew that i

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,680
absolutely needed

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,439
to say yes to be visible in the way i'm

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,760
asking my colleagues at finos

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,720
at city and in the broader open source

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,400
community

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,920
to make efforts to see that

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,920
underrepresented people

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,000
are visible so here i am

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,080
after stressing about saying yes i

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,360
quickly moved on to stressing about what

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,879
i could possibly

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,840
say to you all over zoom in a pandemic

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,600
and in a moment of reckoning with racial

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,359
injustice

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,800
everything i could think to say just

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,000
seems

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,240
really unimportant on a relative basis

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,280
so finally i settled in on what i know

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,880
best

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,639
my own story my tiny tiny

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,240
sliver of an experience that might

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,120
personalize for you all

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,400
why representation matters how it

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,639
happens

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,360
how it shaped my career and brought me

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,360
to you today

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,560
since that day when i first met suny on

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,919
the trading floor i've had a lot of ups

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,880
and downs in my career

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,880
like everyone i've had moments of pride

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,440
i've had moments of disappointment

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,440
i've had times when i was short i would

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,759
not make it in the world of finance and

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,240
moments when i knew this was exactly the

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,320
right place for me

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,440
but this talk is about representation

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,000
and why it matters

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,039
through my eyes and the story i'm

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,520
telling is about

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,160
how important it's been to me each step

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,199
of the way

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,880
to see a person i aspire to be

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,960
it is proof hard data evidence that it

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,120
can be done

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,240
the list of reasons my career has been

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,039
successful is

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,080
full of intentional interventions it's

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,960
full of luck

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,120
setbacks successes and my own stubborn

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,199
competitive nature

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,520
and while suny and other senior women

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,639
have been my north stars

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,280
i have benefited enormously from men

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,120
who've been fierce advocates and mentors

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,720
who've taken chances on me

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,600
and put their faith into my abilities

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,319
i've also worked with incredible teams

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,520
women

00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:02,720
men black east asian indian white

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,960
straight gay colleagues who have poured

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,280
their talents into our shared goals

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,479
and more importantly who believed in me

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,319
as a leader

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,080
they believed in me as a leader and in

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,560
doing so created a self-fulfilling

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,560
process

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,639
representation takes a village it takes

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,800
effort from

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,880
everyone the role models who prove it's

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,039
possible the leaders and the managers

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,039
who set the stage and the colleagues who

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:30,240
embrace it

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,680
but those of you listening who are in

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,120
the minority

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,800
i see you i am rooting for you

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,919
you can do this for those of you

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,080
empowered to change the numbers identify

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,199
the underrepresented talent in your

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,319
organizations and

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,880
give them an opportunity to lead

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,599
for those of you who work for black or

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,639
latino

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,360
colleagues for women for anyone in the

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,639
minority

00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,199
in your world embrace and accept them

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,840
you have more power than you know to

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,840
help them succeed

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,400
i'm here speaking to you today because

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,919
finos has made diversity

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,800
and inclusion a priority gap the phenos

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,280
leadership team

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,360
and my colleagues on the board entrusted

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,599
me with the responsibility to serve

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,039
as vice chairman then chairman of the

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,960
board during an exciting

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,800
but really challenging time for our

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,199
organization

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,199
but beyond this one example we are

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,960
working to define our diversity and

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,440
inclusion strategy by setting

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,840
representation goals for ourselves

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,120
for our board of directors and we'll be

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,360
reaching out to you

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,639
our open source community to help us

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,280
grow the number of

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,199
underrepresented people in our ranks if

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,240
even one person

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:51,280
reaches out on the back of today

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,280
that will be progress

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,639
so bear with me through one more story

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,879
just one more

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,720
uh later in my career to drive home the

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,199
point

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,000
in november of last year having recently

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,479
taken over

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,160
is the head of velocity at city i was

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,800
asked to present my strategy for the

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,639
platform

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,280
to the heads of the trading division and

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,360
their management team

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,319
20 minutes or so before i was due to

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,879
speak

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,960
i was invited into the room there were

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,879
about 40 people in there and a lot of

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,720
jackets sort of slung over the back of

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,319
backs of chairs

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,240
the room was almost entirely men

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,759
my heart rate absolutely went through

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,880
the roof

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,680
i felt really really intimidated and

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,080
nervous

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,839
and that's not something i typically

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,599
feel

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,519
among the senior people in the room was

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,279
deidre dunn the recently

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,800
promoted co-head of our global rates

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,839
business

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,200
i was close to deidra and sent her an

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,800
email from my phone

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,040
saying i am really nervous

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,880
i was sitting in a chair by myself kind

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,680
of off to the side

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,320
away from the conference table she

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,040
replied

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,519
right away saying she totally understood

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,560
how

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:09,279
intimidating the room felt

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,839
and she reminded me that i know a lot

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,760
more

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,839
about what i was presenting than anyone

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,320
else in the room and that i was here to

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,680
teach everybody something

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:23,760
and she kind of nudged me and she said

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:27,120
you should take a seat at the table

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:31,200
you should take a seat at the table

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:34,000
she said so my heart pounded

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,880
and i pulled up my chair and i found a

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:47,519
little spot

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:47,519
