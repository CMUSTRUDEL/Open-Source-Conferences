hello everybody

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,160
i am happy to be here today speaking

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,400
about

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,160
unlocking high performing teams with

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,720
open source

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,119
i'm tracy miranda the executive director

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,240
of the continuous delivery foundation

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,840
and uh let me introduce myself so

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,039
i've been at the continuous delivery

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:30,240
foundation uh just for the last month

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,039
where before that i was director of open

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,360
source

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,120
strategy at cloudbees where i got to

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,840
work closely with the jenkins and

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,960
jenkins x open source community

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,079
and i've also been heavily involved with

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,920
the eclipse

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,840
community including being on the board

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,559
of directors there

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,280
for a long while so in general you could

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,480
say i am

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,440
a big fan of open source so

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,480
i i love everything about open source

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,440
and uh so

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,000
yeah no surprise that this talk today uh

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,079
features

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,320
uh how you can leverage your open source

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,080
um to make your teens better

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,000
so yeah feel free to get in touch with

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,960
me either on twitter tracing miranda

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,960
linkedin or i also have a blog where

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,280
so on to the talk today

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,320
and the first question i think we need

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,600
to ask ourselves

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:29,200
is what does it mean to be

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:32,000
a high-performing team and why does it

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,000
actually matter

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,159
and the reality is that in the world we

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,479
live today

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,159
every business is under tremendous

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,119
pressure to transform itself

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,840
into a software business and continuous

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,280
delivery

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,280
is a cornerstone to this

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,040
if you imagine an organization that can

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,880
deliver

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,840
new features faster than the competition

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,360
or if you even imagine an organization

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,159
that can take advantage

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,799
of fast feedback to build a deeper

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,360
relationship with its users

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,920
or imagine an organization that can

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,000
pivot

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,840
when needed to respond to industry and

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,720
world events

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,400
that is a big differentiator that

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,400
continuous delivery

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,319
and you know delivering software to end

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,319
users brings to an organization

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,560
so today we're very fortunate

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,519
to have some amazing research in this

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,400
area

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,920
and this is thanks to the state of

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,800
devops report

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,519
and also the companion book known as

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,319
accelerate

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,480
written by nicole forsgren jazz humble

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,519
and gene kim

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,319
and this book provides

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,560
research back information on how you can

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,440
go about building and scaling

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,760
high performing technology organizations

00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,680
and

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,920
i love this quote um in the book from

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,920
nicole forsgren which says

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,080
software delivery is an exercise in

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,959
continuous improvement

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,599
and our research shows that year over

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,640
year

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:15,040
the best keep getting better and

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,400
those who fail to improve fall further

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:22,239
and further behind so

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,920
what the book does outline is exactly

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,400
what we mean today by being a high

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:30,560
performing team

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,799
and it provides four specific metrics

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,599
often known as the dora metrics by which

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,239
teams

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,280
can measure their performance now two of

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,080
these metrics

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,959
uh look at the speed of your software

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,040
delivery

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,120
so how frequent are your code

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,760
deployments and how long does it take

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,920
you

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,200
from the moment you commit your code to

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,720
the moment it gets out to the world

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,040
and then the other two metrics are

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,239
focused on security

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,560
or safety um so how long does it take

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,920
you

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,280
to recover from incidents and what is

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,519
your change failure rate so

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,400
every time you make a commit or push

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,000
some code

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,920
how often does it fall over

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,519
and as you can see from the numbers on

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,400
this slide um

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,759
the folks who are doing all these things

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,199
really well

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,919
are significantly um better they have

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,160
you know

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,080
you see the incredible numbers like 46

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,919
times more frequent code deployment

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,440
up to 2 000 times faster

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,360
than than those folks who aren't doing

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,320
that so

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,080
that is in a nutshell what we mean by

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,320
being a high performing team

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,080
and you know one of the key things to

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,520
take away from this slide is

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,479
you don't have to compromise speed

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,120
for security you can have both at the

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,120
same time

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,639
so how do you go about doing this so the

00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,000
excel library book is

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:03,120
is pretty awesome because it maps out um

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,960
a whole set of capabilities related

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,199
to um you know that the research shows

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,600
that

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,479
teams who are these high-performing or

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,520
elite teams do

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:18,960
now these capabilities are

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,320
divided up into different types of

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,440
categories

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,240
and in particular one third of them or

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,320
the first eight

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,759
are what we call continuous delivery

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,280
capabilities

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:33,759
so uh practices and capabilities that

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,240
will help you focus on delivering

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,240
software

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,720
now just before we go uh more

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,840
into what this means and how open source

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,000
can help

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:50,479
um i want to position three things that

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,080
are often used in an interchangeable and

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,720
confusing manner

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,840
especially if you are new to the space

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,039
and those are

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:02,240
agile cicd and devops

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,600
or as as i prefer to say agile

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,720
continuous delivery

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:11,680
uh in devops

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:14,000
while there is a overlap with each one

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,560
they do each tend to have a distinct

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,680
focus or kind of starting point

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,560
so agile focuses on processes

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,759
devops focuses on culture while

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,800
continuous delivery

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,960
focuses on tools and automation but

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,880
not to say they don't include other

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,000
things but that is kind of

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,960
the key starting point

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,440
and continuous delivery is is the aspect

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,919
that

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,919
um i want to talk a lot more about today

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,440
so what do i mean by continuous delivery

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,240
well continuous delivery is

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,039
a software engineering approach in which

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,360
teams produce software in short cycles

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:59,360
ensuring that that software can always

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,360
be reliably released at any time

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,840
this is related to ci cd and because

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,400
that includes continuous integration

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,319
where we see continuous integration as

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,319
the practice of merging

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,440
all the developer working copies to a

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,680
shared main line

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,680
several times a day but continuous

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,280
delivery is the umbrella for all the

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,400
processes including

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,520
ci that go go towards

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,520
producing that software

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,800
so we know a lot about

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,800
continuous delivery and we know how to

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,919
manage team performance

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,199
but the reality is that the adoption of

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:43,039
these practices

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,879
is very very low throughout the industry

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,560
and even for those who have gotten good

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,800
at delivering software

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,759
um the rug has been pulled out from

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,280
under their feet

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:57,039
and um this has made

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,280
things very complicated in this area so

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,800
i the way i see it is there's the three

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,039
key problems um

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,639
affecting organizations who want to get

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,960
better at continuous delivery

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,000
first of all um the rise of

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,039
microservices

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,560
and cloud native technology so

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:20,560
once upon a time we would have teams

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:25,599
and it was the default there

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:28,800
was that you would have a monolith

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:31,039
so teams were working on a monolithic

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,880
code base and deploying a monolithic

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:36,399
application and they only had a small

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,959
number of environments to worry about

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,240
then along came microservices and cloud

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,760
native architectures

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,320
and they promise to dramatically improve

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,000
what we're capable of delivering

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,040
especially when it comes to

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,120
scaling so you get huge benefits with

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,120
scaling

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,720
but with those benefits also come

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,839
challenges

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,160
so now teams would have to deal with a

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,160
proliferation of environments

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,360
and with microservices a proliferation

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,920
of code bases

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,720
that would make continuous delivery more

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,320
important

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:16,240
and more challenging the second problem

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,720
people would see we would see is

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,200
the whole fragmented continuous delivery

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,360
landscape

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,320
so with the rise of these new

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,360
technologies

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,000
uh we've also seen a corollary rise in

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,560
the number of tools in the landscape

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,519
however it is challenging for users to

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,560
figure out

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,560
what works for their use case and often

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,160
putting together different tools to

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,120
create a full solution

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,519
is left as a trial and error lesson to

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,200
the user

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,880
and we're definitely in a space where

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,600
new technology paradigms are coming

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,200
along at a faster rate than ever before

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,600
so if you think about things like

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,760
serverless and machine learning

00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,440
uh the rate of change in technology

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:04,079
today is simply incredible

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,560
and then the third point is simply that

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,600
change

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,600
is hard

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,880
people and organizations have limits on

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,920
the amount of change

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,079
they can absorb at any one time well

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,240
that's certainly what we thought

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,000
though in the last few months we've all

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,959
learned

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,720
to keep our distance to wear a mask and

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,920
to wash our hands like we're going into

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,959
surgery

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:34,000
but most of us have so

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:37,279
change is hard but it turns out that

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,279
when it becomes necessary or we have a

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,640
shared sense of purpose

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:45,360
we can adapt faster than we think we can

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,000
but in most cases it's still a big

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,800
challenge

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,800
for most of us

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,480
so that sort of sums up um the present

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,360
we know

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,959
what and why but we still need to figure

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,800
out the how

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,800
and i think many of us are in that same

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,279
position where we all want to do it

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,279
together

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:14,000
so this is the thinking behind

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:17,920
the continuous delivery foundation

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,440
which was uh launched in 2019

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:24,399
originally as the new home to

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:28,240
a set of open source projects so jenkins

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:31,680
and contacts spinnaker and tacton

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,680
and the idea was that it would be this

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,040
future home

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,360
for projects but also a place to drive

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,320
collaboration in the continuous delivery

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,440
space

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:48,399
and use what we know about open source

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,399
um or you know at scale collaboration

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,680
so when we first launched the foundation

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,160
uh

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,519
we had a lot of meetings and we were

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,279
happy to get advice

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,279
from folks in the industry like jane

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,320
groll of the devops institute

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,959
and jess humble um to help us focus on

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,160
where

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:08,639
what we wanted to tackle

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,600
and today um the continuous delivery

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,079
foundation

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,040
as an open source foundation has the

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,360
mission

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,800
to improve the world's capacity to

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,160
deliver software

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:23,519
with security and speed

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,279
so we believe that every team can be a

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,760
high performing team

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,399
and every organization can be a high

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,120
performing technology organization

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,120
and cdf uh wants to be your open source

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,200
partner just to help you

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,600
to make that continuous improvement

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,680
journey easier

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,800
and so what i want to talk to you about

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,639
today is

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:50,000
how we want to do that sort of

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:52,480
three key ways that we're approaching

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,399
this adoption of continuous delivery and

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,800
helping everybody to become

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,600
high-performing teams through what we've

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:07,839
learned

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:07,839
of open source practices and principles

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:14,320
okay so the first thing

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,880
i want to share is just some efforts we

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,040
have

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,600
uh in trying to drive continuous

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,480
delivery adoption

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,240
so first thing uh we mentioned is that

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,800
there's a very fragmented

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,760
landscape so the continuous delivery

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,519
foundation

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:34,320
um put together this

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,920
continuous delivery landscape it's an

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,959
open source document

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,079
um that's an interactive landscape and

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,680
this is our version

00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:46,240
0.1 and the idea here

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,120
is to map out all the different

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,639
categories

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,120
of types of tooling and how they come

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,360
together

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:58,079
to build a continuous delivery solution

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,040
so we know um there's much more to it

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,000
than just

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,560
cni and cd you have to think about

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,279
things like

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,000
version control and security management

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,680
and testing

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,240
testing is super important so

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,199
this is the place for people to take a

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,519
big picture

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,440
look at things to start to differentiate

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,800
um you know what supports

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,199
what works for cloud native or

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,279
traditional and we welcome

00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,040
and encourage everyone to submit uh all

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,519
the tools they use

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,519
uh with open source proprietary um to

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,399
this landscape so we can start to build

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:34,079
out

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:36,399
a shared outline of all the tools in the

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,399
space

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:43,440
um so the second thing uh we

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,760
help promote is the adoption of open

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,040
source projects

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,440
so as i mentioned earlier cdf kicked off

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,279
with

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:57,040
four initial projects and these projects

00:14:53,279 --> 00:15:00,079
are all at different points on

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:03,120
adoption and usage so

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:05,120
jenkins was the original tool that

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,959
brought continuous integration

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,199
um that democratized continuous

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,560
integration for the masses and that's

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,959
you know heavily

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,800
adopted across all sorts of different

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:18,000
industries

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,320
um then also with a lot of enterprise

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,279
adoption you have spinnaker

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,320
which is the tool netflix uses to

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,680
achieve

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:30,880
its continuous delivery aims

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:34,240
so those are two tools um

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,920
more on kind of the heavily adopted side

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,519
of the adoption curve

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,480
but we also have um tools that fall into

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,240
the

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,759
kind of the innovation and early

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,720
adopters because these

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,839
tools are like jenkins flex and tacton

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,519
are focused on

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,000
kind of the new containerized

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,000
microservices cloud native world

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,199
and i'll talk a bit more about those in

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,440
a minute

00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,959
and and then after we launch uh we have

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,199
additional tools have joined

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:04,639
the continuous delivery foundation so do

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,639
check them out on our website

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,880
but one of the things uh we know going

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,959
back

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:15,839
to the research from the accelerate book

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,399
is that the high performing teams

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,839
leverage

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:22,160
open source software so in

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,079
the book the elite performance leverage

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,199
and plan to expand their use of open

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:29,360
source

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,360
whereas they also um

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,000
they tend to use more open source

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,199
tooling where

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,240
there's a correlation and low

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:42,240
performance had the highest use of

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:45,680
um propriety data and tooling

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:49,040
and i think when you look at how quickly

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:52,720
the landscape changes um this

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:55,360
you know one theory is is that by

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,720
leveraging open source you're not

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,199
reinventing the wheel

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,440
and if you stay kind of current and

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:04,319
engaged with the community you

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,240
um can adapt and we often see you know

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,720
open source tends to be pretty resilient

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,959
especially in difficult times

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,480
uh well and that's certainly true for

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,079
kind of well sustained

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:19,280
uh open source projects so

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,160
one of the other things um that we're

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,720
keen to

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,439
to promote and how you can leverage open

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,559
source to get better

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:31,360
is if we go back to

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:34,160
these capabilities and we sort of ask

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,160
ourselves okay

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,080
delivering software securely and at

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,880
speed

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,080
and the list is pretty long so there's a

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,280
you know there's 24

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,679
things um you have to do there some of

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,240
them

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,080
involve um you know the most challenging

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,799
things which are creating habits

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,240
and working with your teams the question

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,880
we ask ourselves are

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,360
is are there some things in that list

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,960
which

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:04,320
can be simplified or in fact

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,640
automated and you can have tools help

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,880
you do that

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,640
and you know i i think the answer is

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,559
pretty much yes

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,480
certainly all the eight continuous

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:17,840
delivery practices

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,160
can be facilitated a lot with tooling

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,640
as well as a whole set of other

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,400
capabilities

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,000
and what we're seeing with the

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,520
continuous delivery and some of the

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,039
newer projects

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,720
is that their tools are looking at

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,799
you know leveraging this research and

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,919
building in those best practices by

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,000
default

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,360
so if you take for example a tool like

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,840
jenkins x

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,600
which um for those of you who know

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,080
jenkins jenkins x is completely

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:50,480
different it's a whole new rewrite

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:54,240
um in go um and kind of optimized for

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,559
for ci cd on kubernetes um but jenkins x

00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,640
the

00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:59,679
team there you know started off saying

00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,679
okay how can we

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,440
promote some of the capabilities from

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,400
the accelerate book

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,520
and make sure those are built in by

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,440
default

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,880
and that includes things like um

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,480
making sure everything is version

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,559
controlled and

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,080
that includes um all your environments

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,799
so you can have this environment

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,120
promotion

00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,160
through to what they're called hitops

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,640
and also

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,320
you know other features as well so as we

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,360
think about microservices we

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,960
we're going to be in this world where

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,480
you can't be writing all of your

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,640
pipelines by hand

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,679
so jenkins x will help automate those

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,280
pipelines so

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,039
we're not you know we're no longer

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,039
treating pipeline

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,880
uh as pets it's it's more that pipeline

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,360
is capital you can just kind of create

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,559
them

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,799
and kind of manage them as as a whole

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,799
set

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:57,120
so one of the ways uh jenkins x also

00:19:53,440 --> 00:20:00,559
kind of helps promote best practices is

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:03,840
by building on other open source

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:06,400
uh projects and incorporating them

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,320
to so it's also not reinventing the

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,960
wheel

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,720
and so we have a big mission um at the

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,360
continuous delivery foundation to

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,320
promote

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,480
tool interoperability and actually

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,520
jenkins x builds on one of our other

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,120
projects

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:25,760
which is the tecton project

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,520
and this is great analogy of you know

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,559
the tecton

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,840
is uh kind of the plumbing so it

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:36,400
it provides some building blocks for

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:38,960
cicd um and jenkins access to porcelain

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,880
um so it builds upon that and provides a

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,919
great user experience

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,400
and uh we'll leave the toilet analogy at

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,320
that

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,600
because we're not going to say what that

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,919
means about what you delivering

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,679
um but really like the whole philosophy

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,080
of techton and this is a project that

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,200
came

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,360
out of google it came from the k native

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,640
uh platform but it's already been

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,480
heavily adopted

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,159
by ibm and puppet

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,320
who are using those build same building

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,720
blocks for their platforms and even

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,360
um has had a great story from ebay as

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,520
they are kind of

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,720
rebuilding their continuous delivery

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,000
platform and

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:21,440
looking to leverage tecton

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,200
so um it's by you know using these tools

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,880
and taking advantage of

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,280
kind of the latest and greatest that you

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,760
can avoid the technical debt

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,280
and you can build kind of conformance

00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,720
systems that make the most

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,600
of today's technologies and that will

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,960
evolve

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:44,960
thanks to the ecosystem over time

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:48,640
as things change in the industry

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:52,480
okay so um interoperability is

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:56,000
a big focus as well so as a community

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:58,400
we want to also drive uh the future so

00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,159
besides the tech tone we're looking at

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,640
ways that we can improve the state of

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:05,600
delivery for the entire industry

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,559
um so it might be through common apis or

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,080
metadata

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,400
or one of the really interesting

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,600
discussions is

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,600
you know why can't all the tools have um

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,960
a standardized way to express release

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,679
metadata

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,520
um so it's it's a great community where

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,799
lots of like-minded folks are coming

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,799
together

00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,000
and sort of having these discussions and

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,799
saying you know

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,440
how can we all make the most in open

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,240
source so

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,080
that we're working together across the

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,880
ecosystem to make things easier and help

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,200
us all get better at software delivery

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,000
and uh if you're interested here's where

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,840
you can get

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,840
involved in those conversations as well

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:52,559
so the third and final thing is

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,080
i want to address is the whole idea of

00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:57,120
change is hard

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,280
and it's challenging to set up new

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,400
habits and change how your team has been

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,559
behaving

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,679
um so these are the initiatives where

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,520
the

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,679
where we want to help you on your

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,000
continuous improvement journey and make

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,280
that

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,080
easier so

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:16,720
the first thing we hear a lot is um okay

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,840
when it comes to these best practices

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:23,760
uh you know what are they

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:27,679
and how can we get there faster so

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:30,080
accelerate book maps out um

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,039
a lot of these capabilities but then how

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,919
do we

00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:36,559
go deep into that and then how do we put

00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:39,840
them into practice

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:42,559
so that is a key thing that cef will be

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,799
focused on in 2021

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,080
and we'll be looking at a best practices

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,640
working group where

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,480
everybody can come together to do this

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,279
and this initiative is

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,120
uh being led by michael galloway of

00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:58,320
netflix

00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:01,039
so i'm going to pause for a minute

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,039
and we're going to switch to uh michael

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,080
galloway himself just introducing that

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:07,120
initiative to

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,760
kind of give you a sense of what we want

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,799
to do

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:13,520
in this area so

00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,520
take a look at this

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,240
continuous delivery is a goal for many

00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,240
organizations

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,440
but today every organization that wants

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,360
to achieve that

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,960
is forced to go through the same cycle

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,120
of trial and error

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,880
and expensive learning before they can

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,960
reach that goal

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,880
what makes this especially painful is

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,799
the fact that many of the lessons that

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,640
organizations end up learning

00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,400
were lessons that others had already

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,200
learned before

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,159
lessons like what are good strategies

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,279
for reducing

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:47,279
blast radius of software changes how can

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,440
canaries help increase confidence in a

00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,679
delivery workflow

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,480
as a key goal of the cdf we're going to

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,880
invest time

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,159
into creating a living community driven

00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,320
knowledge source

00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,400
to start capturing and distributing the

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,919
various best practices that have been

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,039
acquired over the years

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,880
by our member organizations it is our

00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:09,279
hope that with this resource

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,760
we can reduce the time and complexity

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:13,919
for organizations to finally succeed

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,960
in establishing a true continuous

00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,960
delivery workflow

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,640
okay so that is best practices uh

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,320
at continuous delivery foundation and

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,960
check out our website if you want more

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,960
details

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:32,640
or if you'd love to get involved

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:35,919
the other community we currently have

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,919
for helping drive adoption is the end

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,320
user council

00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,600
and the continuous delivery foundation

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,000
brings together

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,039
end user organizations these are folks

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,880
who don't

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:51,279
uh directly produce software but they

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,720
use it for their operations so some of

00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:55,679
our member companies

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:58,400
like netflix and capital one and ebay

00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:01,440
you know with all the end user members

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,840
so we have a end user council where

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,000
folks meet together to have these great

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,840
discussions in a kind of safe and

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,840
neutral environment

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:13,279
and they kind of compare notes of

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,559
you know what is your approach to

00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,480
governance what is your approach to

00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,919
compliance or security

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,000
and just re have really good

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,640
peer-to-peer discussions to see how

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,760
other people

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:27,600
are managing things um to get

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,919
good context rich um understanding you

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,080
know

00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,480
uh the organizations with 100 people

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,480
organizations with 10 000 people

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,919
and what the what difference does that

00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,960
make

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:41,679
and um so this is something uh being led

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:44,400
by john mark walker of capital one

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,840
and uh if you're interested in joining

00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,480
some of the meetings

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,760
uh please check out the link there and

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,120
you can

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,640
follow the links to ask for an

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:58,640
invitation to our next end user council

00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,640
and just be part of that conversation

00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:07,360
so those three

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:10,640
initiatives um kind of really

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:13,760
tie into what we're trying to do

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,400
at cdf so cdf is all about

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,279
people collaborating with transparency

00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,360
diversity

00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,120
and openness and this makes all the

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,320
difference to

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,320
innovating at scale

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,880
so

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:37,360
to conclude um i think we

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:40,159
are very lucky um as we all become

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,559
you know software eats the world we know

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,240
what it means to be a high performing

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,720
team

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,640
and the awesome accelerate book gives us

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,399
the high level steps

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,559
we need to follow to unlock high

00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:54,720
performance

00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:58,320
and as you've seen continuous delivery

00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:01,760
practices are key to this

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,720
so while microservices and cloud native

00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,080
technology

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:08,799
have changed the game and in some cases

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,159
have forced us to kind of rethink our

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:13,520
systems and the way

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:16,640
we've set up our teams we

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,399
can look at kind of tackling that so

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,120
even though the change is hard

00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,559
uh open source is the key to kind of

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,480
unlocking

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,559
um those those capabilities and

00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,960
practices

00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:31,840
so uh one thing i encourage you to do is

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,240
to adopt open source technologies

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,960
uh to make the most of modern software

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,039
delivery

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,480
so look at some of those projects as

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:41,279
your building blocks

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,679
and then join open source communities to

00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,760
make

00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,720
your continuous improvement journey

00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,559
easier

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,880
so to work with like-minded folks who

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,880
are also tackling the same problems

00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,720
and also trying to figure out how they

00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:58,320
can kind of continuously improve

00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:00,720
so i not sure invite you to get involved

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,600
with the continuous delivery foundation

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,880
you can

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,480
check out more on our website uh we have

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,159
a pretty awesome community

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,720
these are some of the folks who got

00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:15,760
together at our virtual event

00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:18,080
um just a month ago at cdcon

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,240
and yeah we you know try to operate at

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:23,520
the space between continuous delivery

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,760
open source and building a global and

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:28,320
diverse community

00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,760
so thank you very much i'm happy to

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,320
answer any questions

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,960
and i would very much love to welcome

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,039
you

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,000
to join the community building the

00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:41,840
future of

00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,840
