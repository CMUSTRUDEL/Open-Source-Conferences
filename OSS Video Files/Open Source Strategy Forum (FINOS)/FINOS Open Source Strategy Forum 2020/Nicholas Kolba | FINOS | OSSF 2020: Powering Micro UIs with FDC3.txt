Powering Micro UIs with FDC3 - OSSF 2020

The use of Micro-UIs (or Micro Frontends) is a relatively new pattern for splitting complex monoliths into vertically integrated components. This is of particular interest to financial application development, since data dense views and complex workflows can be broken into logical and re-mixable parts. In this session, we will demonstrate how key features of FDC3 1.1 and emerging FDC3 standards can be used to build micro-ui based workflows that span across applications and components from multiple providers and how the genesis Low Code Application Platform (LCAP) is leveraging open source web technologies and the FDC3 standards to transform application development in finance.
