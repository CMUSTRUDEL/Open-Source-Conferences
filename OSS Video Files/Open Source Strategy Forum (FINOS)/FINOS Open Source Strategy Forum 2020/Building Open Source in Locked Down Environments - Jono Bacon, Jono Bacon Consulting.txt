hey everyone and thank you for joining

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,719
me today for my session here at the open

00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,160
source strategy forum

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,400
i hope you're all safe and well wherever

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,080
you may be now i'm so thrilled to be

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,000
here i've got a bit of a soft spot for

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,279
finnos i think they do they do really

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,480
really important work and they used to

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,760
be a client of mine

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,119
and the people who are working there who

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,160
are doing this work are just fabulous

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,760
people okay so

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,760
this is a great event i'm so thrilled to

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,439
be playing one tiny part of it

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,760
now today i'm going to be talking about

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,079
how to build open source in

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,440
locked-down environments okay there's a

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,719
little bit of background for those of

00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,760
you who are unfamiliar with who i

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,520
am my name is jonah bacon and i uh i'm a

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,239
community strategy consultant so i work

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,160
with

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,280
with with a variety of companies from

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,200
small early

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,559
kind of early stage startups through to

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,800
very very large businesses like

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,280
santander deutsche bank sony mobile

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,239
samsung to help them to build effective

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,320
communities

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,760
and a large chunk of the work that i do

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,079
is in helping

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,960
large businesses utilize open source

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,800
effectively and

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,400
contribute to open source projects

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,159
effectively and

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,439
this is often a bit of a tricky

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,960
challenge and one of the main reasons

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,640
for this is that open source is

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,960
complicated you know it's not

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,840
a particularly simple concept to wrap

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,000
your head around

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,040
especially if you are in an organization

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,880
that is large

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,320
that is command and control driven you

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,600
know where the the the

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,960
the you know the directives come from

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,119
the top and then they kind of sprinkle

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,520
down through the ranks open sources

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,880
is more decentralized and operates in a

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,079
very very different way

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,079
so a big chunk of this is kind of

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,520
bridging these two worlds together

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,799
so what i wanted to talk about in this

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,240
session with some really practical

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,079
recommendations for how

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,360
you should think about building open

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,439
source and helping to be

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,960
successful with open source inside of a

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,360
lockdown organization

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,720
now this is going to apply to a few

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,920
different areas the recommendations i'm

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,920
going to provide today

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,840
will apply to if you're an organization

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,280
that wants to contribute code into an

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,119
open source project that's outside of

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,880
your business for example

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,719
or if you want to build open source

00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,360
projects inside of your organization

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,799
which is

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,759
known as inner source okay so everything

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,960
i'm going to cover today is going to

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,840
apply to both of those different

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,520
contexts

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,759
now the tricky thing here is that when

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,200
people think about doing open source and

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,120
doing open source well

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,720
they tend to think about this right they

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,560
think about code that it's all about

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,239
understanding how code is created

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,000
and all the different pieces from how

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,680
you write the code how you deploy it

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,200
how you test it all these different

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,480
elements of the of the software

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,480
development life cycle

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,680
well that is true with open source you

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,319
do need to be able to understand how to

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,840
build code

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,840
to contribute to an open source project

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,519
as a developer however

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,120
within the context of really

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,000
understanding open source especially in

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,120
businesses

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,280
it's all about culture and workflow okay

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,120
it's not just about engineering because

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,319
open source communities

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,200
really are you know first and foremost

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,239
communities who then develop code okay

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,440
when you talk to a lot of people who

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,040
contribute to open source communities

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,120
the thing that they cherish the most

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,560
is the community it's that collaborative

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,080
group of people who work together

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,280
to create software that is going to be

00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,959
better than any one of them could

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,280
produce themselves okay

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,319
so where this becomes complicated is

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,040
that you're really talking about

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,560
bridging

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,239
many many different cultures you know

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,120
you've got people such as this guy linus

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,159
torvalds

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,000
you know who is all about the community

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,760
and building software that everybody can

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,480
utilize and then you have people such as

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,239
this guy

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,000
who is for the intents and purposes of

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,319
this conversation is

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,680
business dude okay he cares about

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,159
driving profits

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,280
delivering growth for his business okay

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,840
you know if you look at

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,959
if you look at him he is very very

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,560
interested in the health and the

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,200
vitality and sustainability of the open

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,120
source project

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,480
this guy is very much looking at it from

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,920
the perspective of his business

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,080
so how do we make sure that these

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,680
different worlds come together well what

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,599
makes this a little bit more complicated

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,360
is that in the business context

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,360
you you it's not like you don't operate

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,519
in a in a network okay

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,040
but you are one critical piece of that

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,480
network and you really look out for your

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,840
own best interests okay if you're a

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,280
business you're looking out for your

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,120
your business's best interest and then

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,319
you you want to play well and be a good

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,319
citizen within the

00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,920
business world that you operate however

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,200
in the open source world it's a little

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,760
bit different because there are many

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,200
other

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,799
organizations that will be playing a

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,000
role that you'll need to work

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,840
collaboratively with

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,480
in many cases in open source you get for

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,680
example two or three or four companies

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,280
many of which may compete with each

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,720
other collaborating together on the same

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,920
feature on the same piece of software

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,560
because it's going to benefit all of

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,479
them

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,000
so the dynamics not just the code is

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,359
complicated and how the code is created

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,240
but the dynamics of it all

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,759
is pretty complicated too however the

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,000
good news here is that there are a lot

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,919
of opportunities and there are some

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,919
challenges okay so if you if you

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,199
understand how to do this well you can

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,720
you can develop efficient more

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,320
productive engineering you can lower the

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,919
costs of software acquisition and

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,479
deployment you can become more efficient

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,960
you can

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,639
gain all kinds of insight and experience

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,840
you can diversify the level of

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,600
participation innovation that's

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,720
happening in your organization

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,800
you can have a real impact on staff and

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,000
in terms of you know their impact and

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,440
their level of empowerment

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,360
you know as a general rule engineers

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,880
love working on open source projects

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,440
and then building personal relationships

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,120
and growth and just that network effect

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,800
but there are some challenges you know

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,960
it's confusing in how you get started

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,560
with this it does challenge that command

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,560
and control culture you know

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,000
if you manage and run your own software

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,759
project inside of a business you're

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,280
in charge but if you're participating in

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,039
an open source you're participating in a

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,639
commons and it's a little bit different

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,720
and then of course there are fears of

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,280
failure and the sense of lost investment

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,280
and

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,479
it takes a while to really see the the

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,680
fruits of your labor when you start

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,840
participating

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,680
you know it's it's i've met with lots of

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,960
companies for example where people will

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,880
start contributing to open source

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,320
projects and then four or five or

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,440
six months in they'll be saying like why

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,560
are we doing this what is the value that

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,759
we're getting out of this

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,280
it takes a little while for them to

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,000
really understand and see that broader

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,520
value because sometimes

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,120
it takes a longer period of time for

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,800
that value to manifest and then

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,000
sometimes you just get people inside of

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,039
a business who just don't want to do it

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,560
they don't think that open source is

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,080
valuable they don't see the point of it

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,840
they don't see why that we should be

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,199
investing in it and therefore you get

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,320
those internal blockers

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:57,039
as well okay now what i want to cover i

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,400
you know when when tasha and the team

00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,199
reached out to me about speaking at the

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,960
event

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,160
um i really wanted to deliver something

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,759
that was going to be very practical in

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,600
nature so i'm kind of setting the stage

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,080
now but what i really want to dig into

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,280
are five recommendations about how to do

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,960
open source well and then

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,960
three pitfalls that i think you should

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,919
focus on avoiding okay so let's dig

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,919
right in

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,000
the first recommendation here is getting

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,800
clarity on your goals and the current

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,240
state

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,680
so what i mean by this is looking at the

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,800
future state what do you want to achieve

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,880
what do you want to get to

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,479
which are your goals and then being

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,680
aware of where you are right now and

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,120
being reactive to it

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,720
one of the biggest problems i see with

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,240
companies who i work with

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,000
is they don't have an accurate view of

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,840
their current state of their limitations

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,520
but also the potential that they've got

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,720
and then they just kind of say well i

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,080
just want to kind of participate in this

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,280
open source project i want to just

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,880
publish some code

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,280
and they don't really have any crisp

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,720
reasons why or they don't have clarity

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,400
on the broader value that they want to

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,680
get out of it okay so the first thing

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,199
i'd recommend is sit down and look at

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,639
the goals you've got and your objectives

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,400
and make sure you're clear in them

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,720
is it about reducing your overall

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,000
infrastructure costs is it about

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,080
increasing the security of your

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,360
deployment is it about collaborating

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,560
with other companies

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,639
to create something that would be too

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,639
big for one individual organization to

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,400
to create for example so think about

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,880
what those are draft them down

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,599
get feedback on them get input on them

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,520
and make sure that

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,960
all of your stakeholders the executives

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,599
the developers are involved in this are

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,039
clear

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,520
in why we're doing this you don't want

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,240
any ambiguity the second element is to

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,160
really

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,840
get a sense of what's required in terms

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,919
of in terms of resources you know how

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,520
many developers do you need on a project

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,960
um how many docs writers you know

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,319
contributing to open source isn't just

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,680
about writing software

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,720
it's about creating documentation it's

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:38,080
about creating tests it's about

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,919
it's about testing and deployment and

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,280
you know all kinds of different pieces

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,720
that kind of glue together

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,319
and then of course even if you just

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,360
contribute to the project then how do

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,360
you bring that software back

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,599
into your organization and deploy it

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,720
within your product to your service okay

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,639
so think about what's going to be

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,400
involved in that and then assess like

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,919
what is your open source experience

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,000
inside of the business right now you

00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,120
know it may be none in which case

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,120
you're gonna have to think about how to

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,960
develop that experience and kind of

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,160
um build the necessary skills to be able

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,759
to participate

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,199
and then also what is the level of

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,720
support or opposition

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,639
and this is a really really important

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,400
question really evaluate

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,680
who's on your side in terms of working

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,599
with open source and

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,800
and why are they supportive and to what

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,720
extent do they have support

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,000
but more importantly who is against it

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,479
who's going to stand in your way they

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,680
may not

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,039
state that they're going to stand in

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,000
your way but they may in fact be

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,199
standing in your way and you want to

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,039
figure out how those people are because

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,879
it's not about squashing them down

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,000
it's about building alliances and what's

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,360
the thread that you'll hear throughout

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,519
the rest of my talk is

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,880
the way in which we make change happen

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,159
is that we understand that people are

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,919
going to be our biggest critics

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,959
and then we we turn them into allies

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,880
that's the way in which we make the

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,320
right kind of changes okay

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,240
all right so our second recommendation

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,440
here let me just let me just reiterate

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,440
this before we go on

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,120
seriously clarity on your goals and the

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,880
current state you can't do any of this

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,399
without focusing on that first

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,240
all right so the second one is really

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,040
building a very clear open source

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,800
workflow

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,800
so as i mentioned earlier on open source

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,519
is incredibly confusing i mean i've been

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,560
working in open source now since 1998 so

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,800
22 years

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,480
and i find elements of it confusing let

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,000
alone you know someone who doesn't come

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,120
from an open source background who's

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,640
brand new to it

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,480
and open source is more complicated now

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,120
than it was when i got started

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,399
it's just confusing okay the solution to

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,399
that is to understand the different

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,320
pieces that are involved in the process

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,000
and to develop a clear workflow for how

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,279
you engage with a project

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,920
so the first element here is going to be

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,839
the legal requirements what is necessary

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,760
to be able to participate you know can

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,720
you work on software that has that

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,880
license

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,720
uh can you sign the contributor license

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,240
agreement you know and assign some kind

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,240
of copyright okay

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,279
are you able to meet the needs of the

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,480
open source project that you want to

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,200
contribute to

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,040
in some kind of manner okay if you're

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,560
working on an internal open source such

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,160
as an inner source project

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,440
then you need to determine whether you

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,800
can create that with whether you can

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,000
build that internally even if it doesn't

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,120
go outside the walls of it you need to

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,399
make sure that you can

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,519
legally do that now i can't think of

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,560
many reasons why i wouldn't be able to

00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,560
do that internally

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,080
but you want to check that anyway but

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,399
then think about the workflow

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,680
of code okay so if you are going to

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,399
contribute to another open source

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,959
project

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,320
if you've got a branch how do you how do

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,839
you how do you contribute it

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,839
you know with most open source projects

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,440
for example you'll you'll take a copy of

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,959
the code you'll make your branch

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,959
and you'll submit it as a pull request

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,480
it'll get reviewed there'll be comments

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,600
in the pull request with anything that

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,360
you might need to fix

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,600
once it's ready to go in it then gets

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,160
merged into the main branch

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,040
that's a workflow so if you determine

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,160
that that's the way in which you're

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,959
going to be working with the projects

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,640
that you're targeting

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,480
document that so people internally can

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,480
understand how to work with it okay

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,000
because the biggest one of the biggest

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,680
drawbacks of open source is

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,200
understanding how all these pieces work

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,640
together so if you want to do open

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,600
source well in a lockdown environment

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,920
you're going to want to make sure that

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
you're

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,519
making it as easy as possible for your

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,920
staff to understand how to get started

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,200
the same goes for issues how do you how

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,200
do you submit issues

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,680
what kind of things go into issues is it

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,600
bugs is it defects is it security issues

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,680
is it feature ideas is it wish list

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,040
ideas make sure that you define that

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,240
and get that clarity and i'm going to be

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,200
talking a little bit about training

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,640
later on

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,399
but getting that workflow clear is

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,720
really important you know to use a

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,760
little bit of a comparison

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,000
about um two years ago i hired

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,440
my assistant mindy and one of the things

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
that people had recommended to me in

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,800
bringing a new

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,480
assistant in was uh that you create

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,959
essentially document how you like to

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,600
operate

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,200
so for me it's you know what what you

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,640
know my preferences in terms of travel

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,079
and my calendar and

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,680
and publishing my podcast and various

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,079
other different bits and pieces and i

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,760
learned

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,120
through this process that if you

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,640
document that workflow

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,920
even for someone who comes in who has no

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,360
idea about it as long as they've got

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,839
that available and they can refer back

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,519
to it

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,200
makes it much easier for them to get

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,800
started i've heard horror stories about

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,399
people who hire assistants

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,839
and it takes them months to get spun up

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,279
because they didn't document it so

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,640
that's why this is so important

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,959
and the documentation doesn't have to be

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,360
a war and peace it can just be

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,000
you know single pages of documentation

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,880
internally

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
on your network off you go okay the

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,120
other thing that you're going to want to

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,120
get clarity on is going to be

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,240
communication making sure that your your

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,600
staff and your team

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,880
understand how to communicate within the

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,160
open source world and one of the things

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,639
i'd recommend

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,680
is that they always look first you see

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,160
there's a lot of

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,839
unwritten rules in open source ways in

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,639
which we engage and we collaborate with

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,240
each other

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,760
and there's just some cultural norms

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,760
like there's any cultural norm you know

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,000
the culture of walking into a pub

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,680
on a saturday night in ireland is very

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,880
different to the culture of walking into

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,760
a museum

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,320
in london on a thursday night okay we

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,560
behave

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,839
and speak and and operate differently

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,440
and it's the same thing with going into

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,720
an open source project so make sure that

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,680
you're clear on the communication

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,000
elements as well

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,279
how to communicate effectively and and

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,720
go in there first of all

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,079
look watch listen read and gradually

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,519
you'll get a sense of the culture and

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,000
then start participating

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,600
and it'll be much easier to get started

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,519
also just as a general rule especially

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,200
when it comes to inner source building

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,600
open source internally in an

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,800
organization as a general rule you

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,040
always want to default

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,839
to open one of the biggest challenges

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,600
with doing in a source

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,519
is that you've got a company that

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,079
operates with a command and control kind

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,519
of methodology that's so used to

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,200
a very small number of people making

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,480
decisions and defining requirements and

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,480
then it getting distributed to other

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,079
people who then make those changes

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,920
whereas open source is different right

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,680
so if you if you build an internal open

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,040
source project and it operates like a

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,079
command and control project it's not

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,760
going to succeed

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,279
so for example i worked with a client

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,079
one time and they wanted to do inner

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,800
source

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,760
and they didn't have an internal github

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,360
or git lab

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,399
where everybody could access these

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,839
different projects and start

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,279
participating that was the first thing

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,040
that we focused on and when we did that

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:38,000
it made it much easier for all the other

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,360
lego bricks to fall into place all right

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,560
so let's move on to the third one and

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,959
this is really

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,959
really important there are a lot of

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:48,079
organizations who i've worked with

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:50,079
that could very easily do great work

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,279
with open source they've got the skills

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,160
they've got the expertise

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,760
internally in certain pockets they've

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,120
certainly got the talent and the skills

00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,639
and they've got the time and they've got

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,639
the permission

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,240
but they don't succeed because they

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,639
don't put the necessary training and

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,760
recognition in place

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:10,079
training and recognition are critical in

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,240
anything that we do if you want somebody

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,000
else to deliver a predictable

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,680
set of behavioral patterns which is what

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,959
we want to do with open source

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,519
then we need to train them in those

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:22,320
behavioral patterns you know

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,600
it's just like kids like my wife and i

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,480
have got a seven-year-old

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,440
and if we want him for example to unload

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,959
the dishwasher

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,399
then we need to teach him how to unload

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,320
the dishwasher and when he should do it

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,480
and how to do it right and not to

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,000
balance glasses on the edge of the

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,440
countertops and things like that

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,760
we need to do the same thing for our

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,199
teams as well so first of all systems

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,639
systematize that workflow that we've

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,000
already talked about what i would

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,720
recommend is that you create a series

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,160
of playbooks so these are basically

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,000
presentations okay it can be a

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,120
powerpoint presentation a libreoffice

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,720
presentation whatever it might be it

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,440
could be a google docs presentation or

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,240
google's

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,639
google sheets no google what is it

00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,600
google slides that's the one

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,680
it's been a long day and it's uh 10 to

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,240
10 at night so yeah it's been a long day

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,639
forgive me people um but basically what

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:12,800
you do is you you formulate into a short

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:14,639
 a small set of slides um

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,839
the necessary training pieces how to do

00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,320
code well how to do

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,519
issues well how to do communication well

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,600
in open source

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,959
and then what you do is ideally you

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,320
record a little bit of a video

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,440
just share your screen kind of like what

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,639
i'm doing right now and going through

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,000
some slides

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,360
and then provide a bit of training in

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,480
that font so people got access to the

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,000
video training

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,600
that's a great way to get started but

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,720
also have somewhere that people can go

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,120
and ask questions

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,480
so have an engineer or a couple of

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,160
engineers or someone else

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,079
it could be an internal like an open

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,839
source programs manager of um

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,199
leader or it could be somebody else who

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,399
can answer questions

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,600
people are going to have to have

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,480
questions it doesn't matter how much

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,920
training you've got

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,519
or how good the training is people are

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,959
going to have questions things that they

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,240
need to figure out so have a place where

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,680
they can go and ask questions

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,920
it could be one-on-one or it could be an

00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,279
internal forum or an internal zendesk

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,800
whatever it might be

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,040
but then the key thing is always

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,120
delivering regular recognition

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,880
the very first time you have an engineer

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,560
submit a pull request that gets reviewed

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,399
and merged in you should be

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,920
you know popping champagne corks right

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,600
or the equivalent of what would be

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,839
appropriate for your organization

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,759
you need to make sure that that person

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,720
is celebrated is recognized for breaking

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,320
new ground

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,240
you know people celebrate when they

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,600
literally break new ground when they're

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,759
building a building okay

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,279
do the same thing here think about the

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,959
perks that you can apply to your

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,079
organization when they start achieving

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,360
these new things

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,920
one of the things i write about in my

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,680
book called people powered

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,959
is what's called submarine incentives

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,240
and this is where you detect when

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,920
somebody does something

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,360
and then you celebrate them by reaching

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,120
out to them so for example

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,040
detecting the first time somebody

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,880
submits an issue that gets resolved

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,560
the first time one of your engineers

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,279
fixes a bug in a public open source

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,959
project

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,480
or the first time somebody contributes a

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,120
bit of documentation to an open source

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,440
project

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,199
or the first release of an inner source

00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,240
project that you make internally in your

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,120
organization

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,399
recognize it and reward it okay this is

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,600
one of the most wonderful elements of

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,360
open source is that it's really

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,439
fulfilling it's really rewarding

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,120
to participate in open source people

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,039
love doing it again like i said earlier

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,559
on it's not just about the code the code

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,240
is one tiny piece

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,679
about why people love open source people

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,120
love open source because of the

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,240
community because of the sense of

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,679
meaning because of the sense of

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,799
accomplishment because of the sense of

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,480
purpose

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,400
and if you can bring those similar

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,039
principles that have driven open source

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,160
for

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:29,280
25 30 years into your organization then

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,039
you're going to see those same kind of

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,880
patterns with your staff members as well

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,480
this is where it's all about culture

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,520
this is what drives me crazy

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,440
when i work with some clients where they

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,160
only look at it from a carving code

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,240
perspective

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,520
is that carving code is important but

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,480
it's building the culture the

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,480
recognition

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,480
providing the skills and the education

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,960
to succeed that will help you to do this

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,320
well

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,760
okay all right the other thing that i

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,880
just want to touch on here which i think

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,400
is important

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,320
and again is a mistake i see a lot of

00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,440
companies making is that when they do

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,799
open source they kind of

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,200
go in with their sleeves rolled up

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,640
and they bite off a massive project and

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,039
they try to get started with that

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,120
and while i admire the enthusiasm and

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:13,440
the gusto

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,400
when we try to do anything new it's much

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,760
better to start

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,039
small and to get quick wins okay just to

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,320
start with something

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:24,080
small and and and and and

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,080
get some success there now this is

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,120
important for two reasons one is that

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,400
one is that it's going to

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,480
hold my finger up and i realize you

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,880
couldn't see me in the camera so one

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,640
the first good the important reason is

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,000
that it gives you an opportunity to just

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,760
start doing okay

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,919
there's a there's a time for preparation

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,919
and there's a time for doing okay so

00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,799
reading books and watching seminars

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,320
and going into training courses and

00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,160
interviewing people about your open

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,200
source approach methodology is one thing

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,240
but at some point you've got to start

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,080
just doing it

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,080
and i'd much rather you start doing it

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,760
and making mistakes

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,720
then read every conceivable piece of

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,080
education and guidance documentation

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,480
and try to do it perfectly because it

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,840
won't be perfect but the second reason

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,480
why this is important

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,760
is to make mistakes okay it's to make

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,799
mistakes and figure out what those

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,400
mistakes are

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:16,320
and then to win to do something right to

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,640
get that very first pull request merged

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,160
in okay what that does is it builds a

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,520
sense of confidence it builds a sense of

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,160
achievement that's really really

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,919
important

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,600
so focus on first of all building some

00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,799
internal software like building your

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,640
internal branch that you want to

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,799
contribute to an open source project

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,080
and then navigating the code submission

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,679
review process

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,160
navigate how to communicate with these

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,919
projects and then iterate and improve

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,679
too many businesses they don't start

00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,720
small they focus on a massive chunk of

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,320
code and by the way

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,000
most open source projects don't like

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,559
massive code dump they want someone to

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,120
start

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,400
small and build manageable code because

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,160
it's not going to be perfect so that

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,039
gives the the project an opportunity to

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,200
kind of refine

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,240
and i'd apply the same principle to

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,240
inner source as well

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,160
you know within a source project start

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,240
small just even if it's just

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,760
a tiny little project that adds a small

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,360
integration start there

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,880
start getting contributions from your

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,080
other colleagues and engineers

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,080
and then you'll start seeing the results

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,760
start flowing

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,280
and then the fifth one i just want to

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,559
really summarize very quickly before we

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,480
get into the pitfalls

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:17,520
is about regular reporting you see um

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,960
they're going to be many different

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,559
stakeholders in a company who are going

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,840
to be interested in your open source

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,120
strategy whether it's in a source

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,799
whether it's contributing to external

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,159
open source projects

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,520
one is going to be your teammates it's

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,280
going to be people who are on the same

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,760
team and people who are

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,280
on on related teams so if you're on an

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,000
engineering team it could be your other

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,480
engineers and

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,480
developers um but it could also be

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,000
people on the product team or people on

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,280
the customer success team or it could be

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,480
people on the community management team

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,640
or the devrel team

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,200
so the first thing is to provide simple

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,200
cross-team updates okay focus on

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,720
on just updates about what's going on

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,520
what you're working on and the success

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,880
that you're seeing

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,559
i like to recommend that you do this as

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,840
bullet points in an email do it once

00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,559
every couple of weeks and share that

00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,919
with people

00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,760
so someone can read it like they can

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,200
grab their phone and you know within

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,000
five minutes they can get a bit of an

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,880
update on what's going

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,919
on and they're off to the races but also

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,640
do the same thing

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,760
for your executive and your stakeholder

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,480
teams okay

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,960
um if you've got for example a vp or an

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:18,400
svp of engineering or a cto

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,080
giving them um just a simple plain text

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,600
email every couple of weeks with bullet

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,960
points of what's going on

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,640
you know accomplishments roadblocks um

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,000
insights that you're seeing is

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,799
incredibly valuable

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,400
okay we we don't have enough information

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,440
sharing in many businesses okay

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,880
information gets

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,320
hollowed out into silos and that's one

00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,440
of the reasons why we can't we have many

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,960
problems in businesses

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,679
so definitely focus on that i think it's

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,919
going to be really critical okay

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,799
okay so let's now get into some pitfalls

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,880
now

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,840
this is a half an hour talk and i can't

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,440
necessarily

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,200
you know go into every piece of detail

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,320
with everything okay if you want to do

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,760
that you should

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,760
reach out we can talk about maybe

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,240
working together but um i did want to

00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,600
cover

00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,760
what i think are some really really

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,520
important pitfalls to be aware of

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,880
the first one and it's kind of an

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,960
inverse of

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,840
of starting small and getting quick wins

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,640
is to learn to walk before you run

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,480
um one of things i think is fascinating

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,159
about getting older

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,679
and just kind of doing the same thing

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,919
for longer is you see

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,720
similar stories manifesting in different

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,320
areas

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,840
and similar principles and one of things

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,280
i've seen a lot of is companies who get

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,000
really excited they come into the open

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,080
source world

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,360
with a big bang and then before you know

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,720
it they're gone and they're gone after a

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,440
year and a half two years

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,840
and and some of these companies never

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,559
quite

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,840
fully trusted or embraced because it's

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,400
too much too soon

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,520
you know it's kind of like meeting you

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,760
know

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,799
meeting someone's boyfriend you know for

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,080
the first time

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:47,039
and they're too flashy and you're

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:49,039
thinking what's going on here okay

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:51,280
learn to walk before you run okay so

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,960
this again is about starting small but

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,280
think about your engineering workflow

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,280
just learn the basics get started with

00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,960
how to write good code how to how to

00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,559
submit it how to get it reviewed

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,000
all of those different pieces learn

00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,559
about the collaborative workflow

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,080
about how how pull requests are reviewed

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,440
about the role of issues

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,360
about the relationship between

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,640
discussion on issues and pull requests

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,039
and in slack channels

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,640
okay the only way to really do this is

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,880
to immerse yourself in it

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,799
and there's kind of two areas to focus

00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,240
on here there's the community culture

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:24,240
so that's being part of the project and

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,840
the great news about open source is that

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,200
we document our history

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,520
everything that we do in open source

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,240
projects is documented right if you go

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,880
into any

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,240
project in github you'll be able to see

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,559
how the code was written

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,919
the discussion around the code um the

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,440
issues that were considered

00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,400
to varying degrees there will be some

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,760
open source projects that are really

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,480
good at that kind of documentation some

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,320
that aren't

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,080
but as a general rule you can see how

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,600
the project was formulated

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,520
because you know when a pull request

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,000
gets accepted and merged into the main

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,760
branch for

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,520
example it's not like it gets vanished

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,200
from the banish from the internet

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,799
it's just you know you've got to go and

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,159
dig it up to go and go and look at it

00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:01,279
okay so go and learn

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:03,279
go and go and listen go and learn but

00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,279
then there's also the company culture

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,400
is if you're learning to how you know

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:09,520
how to to

00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,840
adapt your company to um

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,880
to the open source community if you push

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,440
too hard

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,039
then you'll get some pushback okay so

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,520
just take it step by step in

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,120
understanding how the company's reacting

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,960
people liking it people against it

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,880
people nervous or they're fearful

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,400
those kinds of things if you go take it

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,840
step by step and importantly

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,520
set expectations that you're going to

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,720
learn to walk before you run that is

00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,159
important because if your

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,279
stakeholders are expecting you to go a

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,840
million miles an hour then it's not

00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,799
going to work

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,840
you're going to get you're going to get

00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,919
better results the second pitfall here

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,120
is that plans don't mean action there's

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,720
been many times when i've worked with

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,320
companies where people are nodding in or

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,039
agreeing in the middle of a strategy

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,880
session

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,720
but at the end of the day until you can

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,640
get people actually doing the work

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,720
it doesn't mean anything okay and the

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,480
way in which we get people to

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,919
to to build new habits and to build new

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,039
skills is to be collaborative is that

00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,200
they play a role

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,120
in shaping the project you don't go away

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,200
as the subject matter expert

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,960
and craft the plan is that they play a

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,679
role in helping to design the plan as

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,919
well

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,600
so you know include them in how you're

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,120
going to define that workflow and how

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,799
the training is going to look

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,080
in what the goals are going to be and

00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,760
how are you going to recognize people

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,480
and what the reports look like

00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,799
gather their feedback and be reactive to

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,799
it

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,640
and the thing here as well is is to say

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,360
to people i want to be in support of

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,520
your goals

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,120
okay and i mentioned at the beginning of

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,640
this session

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,720
that the way in which we affect any kind

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,279
of change is that we

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,720
identify the people who are with us but

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,559
also people who are critical of what

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,960
we're doing and not really convinced

00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:40,559
and we support their success as well i

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,480
remember one time working for a company

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,159
and the head of marketing was not a fan

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,679
of building communities at all she saw

00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,919
it as a complete threat

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,200
so i kind of sat down with her with a

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,799
coffee one day and i was like tell me

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,159
what your goals are like what do you

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,240
want to achieve

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,960
um because i really want to get a sense

00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,000
of how we can pursue those goals

00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,919
even if you're not convinced by

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,840
community i want to make sure that i'm

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,760
in service of your goals as well

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,360
there's a wonderful author who's in the

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,559
marketing world called seth godin and

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,320
his philosophy is

00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,080
if you're in service of other people

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,520
you'll get better results okay you'll

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,039
good things will happen to you

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,039
if you serve the success of other people

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:17,520
and i think that's absolutely true

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,799
and also you know provide mentoring and

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,000
support you know if you've got people

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,200
who aren't really sure

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,200
in terms of what they're what they're

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,000
doing it's one thing to kind of have a

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,200
plan and

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,799
people start building open source

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,559
technology and open source code but

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,000
providing that mentoring and support to

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,799
them even if they're critical

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,320
i think is a good way forward and then

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,600
the final pitfall here and i've just

00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,640
realized my numbers are the wrong way

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,919
around that was three

00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:42,000
that's one one three two hmm i think i

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,039
should have reorganized these slides my

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,159
friends

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:47,600
the final pitfall is what i call i can

00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,279
convince them

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,279
uh and i've seen this time and time

00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,520
again that i was guilty of this

00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,480
where if you're watching this you may be

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,760
thinking okay

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,400
i know what i'm doing when it comes to

00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:01,919
open source i'm working in this really

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:03,600
locked down slow moving organization and

00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,520
um you know i'm the expert they should

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,000
listen to me and i can convince them

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,240
it's just a matter

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,440
of time before i get them on my side

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,360
well

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,960
convincing people doesn't work okay

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,600
unless you're brilliant at convincing

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,840
people

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,520
it doesn't work what gets people to

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,000
change their behavior and to change

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,159
their

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:25,120
their habits is when they can see

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,799
and feel the benefits themselves okay

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,520
you know it's one thing

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,880
to for example i'll give you an example

00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,600
which doesn't sound like an example but

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,520
it is

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,760
if you describe virtual reality to

00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,279
someone they can kind of get it like oh

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,559
yeah i get the idea if you put a helmet

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,880
on and you can kind of see this virtual

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,880
world and you can look around it

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,919
and you can even convince them that this

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,159
could be really useful in lots of

00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,000
different environments

00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,399
but it's only when you put that vr

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,720
headset on that you really get it when

00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,039
you

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,760
feel it when you experience it it's the

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,000
same thing

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,360
here as well people usually make three

00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,520
arguments when it comes to

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,120
uh convincing they either say we should

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,399
be doing this because this is ethically

00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,840
the right thing to do i see this a lot

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,960
in open source

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,600
but ethically open source is good for

00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,960
the world

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,399
it's good for humanity therefore we

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,159
should be doing it people don't like to

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,279
be lectured by ethics so that usually

00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,799
doesn't work

00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,880
the second approach is that i've got

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,080
more experience than you and i know more

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,799
about it

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,919
i've got more expertise and therefore we

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,360
should do it because

00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,200
i know more about this and you should

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,600
listen to me again that doesn't work

00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,360
people

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,120
don't like to be lectured and patronized

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,640
in that regard and then the final

00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,039
argument is often

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,480
the energy argument and that is you know

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,679
let's do it i'm really excited about

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,120
this this is gonna be amazing this is

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,559
gonna be fabulous we're gonna

00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:42,480
rock the world and that kind of energy

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,760
is infectious and many people love that

00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,799
kind of energy

00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:48,880
but it feels dominant it feels pushy to

00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,559
some and and it varies culturally like a

00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,600
lot of americans are like kind of like

00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,640
yeah

00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,480
if you take that kind of energy to japan

00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,919
or you take it to norway for example

00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,600
you're going to get very very different

00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:02,799
kind of response okay

00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,440
different kinds of energy so these these

00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,760
kind of

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,760
convincing approaches don't tend to work

00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,480
from what i've experienced

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,080
what what works is start small develop a

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,240
bit of a you know simple workflow

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,600
provide the right kind of training uh

00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,200
recognize when people

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,240
you know break new ground they get their

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,120
first pull requests in they're

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,640
successful

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,480
and then bit by bit what you're going to

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,279
find is that you're going to be able to

00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,720
penetrate

00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,480
into understanding the open source

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,320
community deliver great work

00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,760
or build uh in the source more

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,520
effectively okay

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,039
anyway that's it i hope that was useful

00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,320
i hope that was you know got the kind of

00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:37,679
the wheels turning

00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,200
um i i'm a complete open book if you've

00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,320
got any questions about this that you

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,279
think i can help with

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,600
drop me an email to jono at
