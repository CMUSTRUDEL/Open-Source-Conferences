Sarah Novotny's BIO

Open Source Wonk, Azure Office of the CTO
My technological focuses have been in recent years Open Source; Cloud and Utility Computing; Infrastructure automation; and Data (big and small; relational and non-relational).

My calling, though, lies in sharing my excitement about technology and coalescing a group around a consistent vision. I love meeting people and rapidly assessing what information I need to impart in order to draw them into the vision or story that I have to share.

My background has consistently included leading operational IT and development teams as well as external facing work - Biz Dev; Sales Engineering; Customer Support; and, of course, Public Speaking. I enjoy bridging the gap between the business world and the tech world.
