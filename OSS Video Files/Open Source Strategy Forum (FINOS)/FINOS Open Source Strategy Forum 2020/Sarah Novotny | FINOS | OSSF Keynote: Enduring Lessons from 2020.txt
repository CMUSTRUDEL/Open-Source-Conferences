Sarah Novotny's BIO

Open Source Wonk, Azure Office of the CTO
My technological focuses have been in recent years Open Source; Cloud and Utility Computing; Infrastructure automation; and Data (big and small; relational and non-relational).

My calling, though, lies in sharing my excitement about technology and coalescing a group around a consistent vision. I love meeting people and rapidly assessing what information I need to impart in order to draw them into the vision or story that I have to share.

My background has consistently included leading operational IT and development teams as well as external facing work - Biz Dev; Sales Engineering; Customer Support; and, of course, Public Speaking. I enjoy bridging the gap between the business world and the tech world.

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,360
our final speaker today is sarah novotny

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,960
who's with microsoft in the azure office

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,679
of the cdo

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,160
in recent years she has focused on open

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,800
source

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,400
cloud and utility computing

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,359
infrastructure automation

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,359
and data big and small relational and

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,000
non-relational

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,640
today she's going to be talking about

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,840
some of the

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,160
enduring lessons of 2020.

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:44,879
please join me in welcoming sarah and

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:48,480
about me from microsoft

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:51,600
hello and thanks for joining us today

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,399
i want to chat about enduring lessons

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,039
in open source technology more broadly

00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,879
and

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,239
definitely specifically learned from

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,640
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,600
so let's just take a moment and have a

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,640
big breath

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,680
because 2020 is almost over and it

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:11,119
has been a deeply weird year

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,000
it doesn't matter where you live or

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,280
what your interests or persuasions are

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,720
this year has been hard

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,960
so take a moment with yourself and say

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,159
we're almost done there's a lot of

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,400
cleanup ahead of us

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,400
but we're almost done with 2020. so

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,159
i want to talk about people because

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,720
within 2020

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,400
i have found that very few of my

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,520
problems have been technological

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,320
problems

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,560
they've frequently and usually been

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,880
people problems and people challenges

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,799
and

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,399
ways that the people interact with each

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,799
other and the world

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,320
that are the hard bit so let's talk

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,880
about the world for a moment

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,360
this year this year has been long and

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,520
hard

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,399
and of course in march february and

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,680
march we were

00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,880
actually uh hit with the

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,439
coronavirus and the covid19 pandemic

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,920
this has

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,560
led to so much change in the world in

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,119
the last

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,000
nine months that we really are

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,599
struggling with

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,800
all of these changes most of us

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,360
many of us are working from home a lot

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,920
and that is completely different making

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,160
our

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,200
engagements with our peers engagements

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,440
with our projects

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,560
completely different and that is

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,599
something that we

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,800
really need to understand especially as

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,920
we look toward

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,040
a global workforce that can work

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,239
on our technological problems around the

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,959
world with all these different

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,959
perspectives

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,640
come summer we found that the us is

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,760
still deeply

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,519
deeply divided and suffering from

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,680
systemic racism

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,680
well we found this out we many of the

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,599
privileged white people who are not able

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,840
to or not experiencing

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,040
this challenge on a day-to-day are we're

00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,239
suddenly

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,760
brought to attention for the challenges

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,040
that are facing

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,519
our peers and friends and people of

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,560
color

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,840
within our communities that is

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,560
incredibly important

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,319
as a thing that we need to work on we

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,040
also struggle this year

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,000
with the fact that global warming is not

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,239
a little thing

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,840
the west coast of the us is on fire and

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,519
the way fires

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,400
are behaving is changing because of

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,640
the problems and challenges with our

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,599
global climate change

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,599
it's tough to say you know that this is

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,440
that this is anything but a global

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,879
problem when it runs the gamut from

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,400
fires in the west coast of the us or

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,000
fires in siberia

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,760
to methane escape in the arctic

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,040
circle and methane does so much more

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,840
damage than even

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,879
carbon dioxide to our world we really

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,360
need to focus

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,120
on all of these things so it's been a

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,760
rough year

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,280
and i hope that most of you have gotten

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,080
the support and guidance that you've

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,239
needed

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,720
have been able to connect with people at

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,400
work felt supported in work

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,080
been able to connect with your social

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,120
circles your communities that you're

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,439
engaged with

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,120
and feel supported in those and that

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,880
you've been able to support other people

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,919
in this

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,479
what i have found in these communities

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,360
is seeking out someone else's

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,360
perspective

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,199
which is completely different from my

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,320
own has strengthened

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,479
and deepened and opened my eyes

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,840
to the change that is needed in the

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,759
world

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,000
learning from people who have different

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,880
perspectives and then being able to

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,560
share and grow and interact with those

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,919
around you who may not

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,680
have had those same experiences is a way

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:52,479
that we can continually improve

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:56,000
our world and we need to be focused on

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:57,759
that at this point

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,199
order to make sure that we are impacting

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,440
things that are important

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,560
and consistent we need to make sure that

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,280
we are measuring

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,199
things that we want to change not

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,600
necessarily measuring second order

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,919
effects but measuring directly

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:16,160
the changes we need we need to make sure

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,840
that we are listening and engaging

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,199
across differences

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:24,240
and making sure that we are able to

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,080
internalize what we hear just

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,280
listening and trying to respond or

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,560
trying to argue

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:34,320
is not enough listening internalizing

00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,240
synthesizing and maybe even changing

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,000
your own opinions about this

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,600
about whatever you're listening to from

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,840
this different perspective

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,880
is very important today

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,880
and empathizing

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:54,160
we need to make sure that everyone's

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:58,240
experiences become more equal

00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:00,720
today my wish to join

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,960
a person of color or be a person of

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,919
color in a particular experience

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,080
would be very low i recognize that they

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,800
have a very different experience

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,120
in the us at least and across some

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,720
portions of the globe as well

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,120
but i recognize that they have a very

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,240
different experience and i have to be

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,840
empathetic

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,400
because how they interact how i interact

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,000
in a world that has such different

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:30,000
experiences

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,319
is super important it's really important

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,479
because we want to get back to a world

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,919
where we can interact with people

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:40,240
where we can be focused on

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,000
what we are interested in while the rest

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,120
of the world is moving around us

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,280
without nearly as much effort and

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,319
attention as we have had to put into it

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:53,680
this year but that means we need to fix

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:56,000
underpinning systemic challenges

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,039
we have an incredibly divided world

00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,720
right now

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,080
we have a world that is moving more

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,000
toward nationalism

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,360
and less toward collaboration in a

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,319
global economy

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,560
that's that's worrisome we need to be

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:11,120
paying attention and collaborating

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,120
across those people who are happy with

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,840
the policies and those people who

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,680
are unhappy with policies it's work that

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,560
needs to be done

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,039
and that work is not glamorous that work

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,440
is

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,720
work that we need to do in every one of

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,880
our communities

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,960
open source communities preschool

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,360
communities

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,400
city communities and we need to make

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,440
sure that we

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,720
are able to and invested in doing the

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,960
unglamorous work

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,520
doing the heavy lifting that change

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,000
requires

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,919
and when we see change that's happening

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,960
and behaviors that are supporting that

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,599
change

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,199
we need to be sure that we're rewarding

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,360
those behaviors

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,639
we're celebrating the people that are

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,120
making that change

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,720
we're celebrating the way that change is

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,680
happening

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,080
and most of all in all of this

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,960
especially since we are technologists

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,960
who are building

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:12,160
tools and building new ways to

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:15,680
engage with the world we need to make

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:19,440
sure our tools cannot be weaponized

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:22,800
and that our tools respect privacy

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,720
and do good in the world any tool can

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,360
become a weapon

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,000
but starting from the premise of how to

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,039
limit

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,159
any damage created by this tool is also

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,000
an important

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,760
ethical consideration as you're

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,320
developing something

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,240
just because it can be developed just

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,279
because it can be a product doesn't

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,279
always mean it should be

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,519
i'm looking forward to 2021 i think

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,519
there's a lot of possibility

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,519
ahead of us i think there's also a lot

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,440
of work ahead of us

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,440
but i wanted to end on a happy note i

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,440
wanted to end saying

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,480
look saying respect your privacy for

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,880
sure

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,320
but i wanted to end and go through 21

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,720
with a positive note

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:12,320
wherein i want to say you're amazing

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,640
and your amazingness in this world

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,360
is brought to bear on every decision you

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,160
make

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,920
your team makes and your communities

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,360
make around you

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:26,640
so please reach across

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,360
any divide you see any

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,519
challenge you find any hard conversation

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,320
that needs to be had reach across

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,399
those differences and try to come to

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,959
some sort of understanding

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,399
and if not even understanding respect

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,600
for the individual

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:46,800
who is presenting that opinion

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:50,720
because we still are humans and human

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:53,600
dignity is an important part of

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,040
our growth through this very difficult

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,760
year of 2020

00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,160
and on to the hope and potential of

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,360
2021.

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:06,480
so my last recommendation for 2021

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:10,240
given the year we've had in the past

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:13,920
is to make sure that there is space

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,279
for fun and novelty because one of the

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,720
things that we have been

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:22,320
most missing in our year

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:26,000
2020 is the serendipity

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,640
and novelty of random interactions with

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,880
friends

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,839
with people on the street with someone

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,560
in a coffee shop

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:38,399
so be silly have a bit of fun

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:47,440
go out and do good in the world

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:47,440
