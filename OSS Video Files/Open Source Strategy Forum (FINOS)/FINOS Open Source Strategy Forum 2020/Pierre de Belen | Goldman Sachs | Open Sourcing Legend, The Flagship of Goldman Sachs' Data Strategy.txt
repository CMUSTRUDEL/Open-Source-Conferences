What is FINOS Legend?

A flexible platform that offers solutions to explore, define, connect, and integrate data into your business processes. Getting access to timely, accurate, and complete data is becoming increasingly more difficult to achieve. Why?

The amount, speed, and complexity of information is exploding exponentially.

Businesses often operate within data silos limiting opportunities to collaborate, connect, and communicate efficiently.

Data inventories are not well understood due to a lack of meaningful metrics such as usage and information flow.

The Legend platform aims to provide solutions to these challenges.
