hello everyone

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,440
welcome to this presentation done by

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,799
paula hunter

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,520
and myself paula is the

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,359
mojave foundation executive director my

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,760
name is costa perrick

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,880
i'm the nojado foundation chair of the

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,840
board

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,519
and also deputy director of for

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,439
financial services for the poor at the

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:34,640
bill and melinda gates foundation

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,200
let's start by putting ourselves in the

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,360
shoes

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:44,079
of someone who lives on less than two

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:47,280
dollars per day on average

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:51,120
it is expensive to be poor

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,760
why because uh these the poor people

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,760
the only way they have to transact find

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,879
uh for financial transaction is with

00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,920
cash

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,879
and dealing with cash beside in addition

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,080
to security

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:06,080
issues takes time and energy because

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,360
essentially to pay for things you have

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,040
to walk

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,320
you have to walk to the utility you have

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,240
to work to school

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,640
you have to work to the merchant to

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,080
actually hand over the cash

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,799
which takes time and energy um

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,799
and because and in the case of where

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,360
these people live sometimes walking to

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,560
the school

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,680
can take you hours

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:35,680
the other interesting case is when

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:39,040
a rural household has a child in a

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,079
working in the city the the son

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,799
may want to send money back uh but in

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,399
fact

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:49,920
probably he has to pay to transport this

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:52,720
cash uh back to the family because

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,159
he has to pay some friend or bus driver

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,280
to actually travel

00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,479
and do that so it is very

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:04,320
difficult uh and expensive to be poor

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:07,520
and be essentially also be excluded

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,200
from the formal economy by dealing only

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,800
with cash

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,840
so the the basic innovation

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,560
that first time helped

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,160
this population of which by the way

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,200
there is

00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:27,200
1.7 billion on the planet today

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,440
and if we look at africa 400 million

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,120
so the basic the first innovation that

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,160
aimed to help

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,920
people in this situation

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,480
was invented in kenya uh some 11 years

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,400
ago

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,680
uh through a commercial system called

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,720
m-pesa

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,840
that was run by a telco provider and

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,319
that's

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,360
called that was called mobile money and

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,440
the way it works

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:56,080
is that uh it allows uh

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,680
you to send and receive money pretty

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,879
much in the same way that you stand and

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,920
receive text messages

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,560
over time uh the system in kenya has

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,560
proven

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:12,319
hugely successful in terms of helping

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:15,440
uh the poorest uh access to

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,840
the formal economy and uh

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,120
easen the burden on their lives and in

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,360
some cases

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,200
get out of poverty by betting better

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,280
managing their money

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,319
and pesa has also proven that it can be

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,879
profitable

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,480
to serve this population obviously in a

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,920
very different way than a

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:37,680
traditional bank would do so

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:41,280
over time if we look at africa

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,920
uh a number of mobile money operations

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,879
were created we see here the situation

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:50,080
in 2018 with some statistics

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:53,120
but in fact today over more than 250

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,400
operations uh exist in africa

00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:00,000
uh in terms of mobile money

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:03,920
and so while this was this is

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,200
obviously great and shows great progress

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,080
still today as i mentioned there is 1.7

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,519
billion people

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:14,879
remaining to be connected and therefore

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:18,320
there is a need to accelerate further

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,120
this innovation to do that how do we do

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,880
that

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:26,400
the key word is interoperability

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:30,720
and in this for this one it's tanzania

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:34,639
actually that innovated a few years ago

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,280
where the four mobile money operators

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,120
started uh essentially connecting their

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,759
systems together

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,840
and by doing that they actually are

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,600
growing the market before in

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,320
you know the typical mobile money

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,280
operation uh today

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,280
uh is like a silos in the sense that

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,000
both the sender and receiver

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,520
have to be on the same network to be

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,160
able to transact

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,240
and while it's great you know it's also

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,600
very limited imagine that you had a

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,919
mobile phone

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,840
where you could talk to people only

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,280
connected to the same network as you it

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,919
wouldn't be very useful

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,080
but mobile money is the same and in

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,280
tanzania these four mobile money

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,759
operators

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,280
realized this and interconnected their

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:24,190
systems together

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:59,010
so let's see what was the result of that

00:05:24,190 --> 00:06:00,410
[Music]

00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:18,160
[Applause]

00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:21,039
[Music]

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,160
yes so as you can see interoperability

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,360
really

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:28,319
allows to grow the market um

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,840
and uh when uh financial service

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,759
providers realize that an internal

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,360
connect we observe this

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,600
uh huge uh exponential curve of growth

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,600
another good example of this would be in

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,240
india the upi system

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,720
which is also a real time interoperable

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,319
payment platform connecting banks

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:51,360
in india we saw this also this huge

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,520
curve of of growth so that shows how

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,360
interoperability is the next wave of

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,560
innovation

00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,319
and indeed in the case of

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,880
interoperability one question obviously

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:06,400
comes to mind is how to do it

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,080
and that is where mojo loop open source

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,520
software plays a role model

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:14,479
is an open source free

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,440
for everyone software that enables

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,479
easily

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:21,840
to connect various financial service

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:25,680
providers and payment systems together

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:29,039
and therefore it it is

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,800
kind of like a tool to

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,280
for people to take and implement

00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,000
interoperability

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,440
in service of market financial inclusion

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,960
but also growing

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:44,160
the markets in uh low-income countries

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,639
and elsewhere as well

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,360
before i head over to paula to explain

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,599
in more detail what moja loop is

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,400
uh let me just finish with this last

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,560
slide

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,080
that shows kind of a typical

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,960
architecture

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,800
of a payment system platform in a

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,240
country or region

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,319
um and on on the bottom side shows the

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,520
collaborative space where

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:12,479
typically we see collaboration to create

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,199
rules uh that govern the payment

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,360
platforms

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,280
and the obviously the regulatory

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,720
framework that applies

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:24,240
and then the rails that are actually

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:28,080
providing the interconnectivity and

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,800
payment flows and these two layers are

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,440
typically

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,640
considered utility so collaborative

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,919
space

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:38,479
to to create these rails and this is

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:42,159
where the modular foundation is active

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:45,120
and working uh the why

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,360
why it is important to create this your

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,680
payment platform as a utility

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,120
because it's a level playing field for

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,519
competitive

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,200
providers to come in to provide accounts

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,080
and wallet services

00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,560
and also innovative applications so

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,399
that's how this ecosystem works

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:07,519
essentially is collaborate

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:11,279
to compete better so that's

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:13,839
a brief overview of financial inclusion

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,120
and payment platforms the interoperable

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,839
payment platforms

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,839
now let me hand over to paula uh to talk

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,640
more about module thank you for

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,720
listening

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,399
thank you costa and thank you all for

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,480
joining us today to hear more about moja

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,080
loop and the moji loop foundation

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,240
i think what i would like to start with

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,839
here today is to emphasize that

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,240
mojo loop is an open source software

00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,800
toolkit that's designed to enable

00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,920
interoperability across

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,680
payment service providers so folks are

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,480
free to download the open source

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,240
software

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,880
it's apache 2.0 licensed it's on github

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,760
and we welcome folks that want to learn

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,560
more about

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,880
mojo loop deploy it or operate it to to

00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:00,000
visit our github repository

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,720
and and dive right in and uh get to know

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,760
the platform but let's talk a little bit

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,320
more about

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,320
the design of mojo loop and and how it

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,240
came about

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,240
the fundamental principles behind the

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,279
design of the modulo platform

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:18,560
is the financial inclusion level one

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:20,880
project principles the level one project

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,480
was defined by the bill and melinda

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,640
gates foundation

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,959
and these principles are an important

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,480
foundation to our decisions with regard

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,959
to the platform

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,120
first of all we provide an open loop

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:36,320
interoperable platform

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:39,040
for providers to engage with

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,279
we adhere to international financial

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,519
inclusion standards

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,640
we provide push a push payment model

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,079
with immediate fund

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:50,480
transfer and same day settlement

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:54,000
we want to ensure adequate system-wide

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,399
shared fraud and security protection

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,959
efficient and proportional know your

00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:02,640
customer

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:05,360
standards meeting or or exceeding

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,640
the convenience and cost and utility of

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,680
cash which is so

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:12,480
important in these times of pandemic uh

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,200
folks are really uh conscious about

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,839
shifting away from cash

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,279
and we have to provide a customizable uh

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,839
software stack

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,800
so that folks can update and evolve

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,440
their systems

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,000
to ensure appropriate compliance with

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,800
their own

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,760
operational standards and local and

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:34,160
national

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:37,200
regulations so the mojo loop foundation

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:40,640
is relatively new we were just formed

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,800
uh in may of this year

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,160
and we were founded based on the

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,720
principles of

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,720
providing inclusive digital payments in

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,040
emerging economies

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,240
we're very fortunate to have the support

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,200
of both charitable

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,079
and technology leaders in the space from

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,839
a charitable side

00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,600
the bill and melinda gates foundation

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,480
the rockefeller foundation

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,320
and omidyar network have invested in the

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,800
moja loop project

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,760
because it lines with their charitable

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,160
mission

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,279
and is is consistent with the standards

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,639
that they want to see

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:17,200
employed to address financial inclusion

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,560
we're also very fortunate to have

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,240
technology

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,959
leaders like google coil modus box

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,839
ripple phone pay giory digital and

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,040
cybrin

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,600
who have joined in on this initiative to

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,399
provide the technology leadership and

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,519
insight

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:38,160
to deploy mojo loop around the globe

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,959
so the the compatibility between our

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,200
mission

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,600
and our technology partners will allow

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,200
us to uh expand and grow

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,720
around the world and the modular

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,959
platform is not new

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,040
um the good news is we started work on

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:56,160
this in 2016.

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:59,440
we kicked off the project uh in in

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,320
mid-year of 2016. we started work on an

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,880
open api

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,600
specification we launched the open

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,760
source platform in 2017

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,920
and then we started launching community

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,279
meetings uh the first one being held in

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,519
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,200
we've since just finished our 12th

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,800
community meeting

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,800
just this past october and so

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,320
we've really made a tremendous amount of

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,639
progress even

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,279
uh given the fact that as a legal entity

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:30,560
we only formed this year

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:32,480
uh we're now in our uh closing days of

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,560
of phase four development

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:38,240
and we're planning for phase 5

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:40,240
development in january of 2021

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,760
and as costa mentioned we've been

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,560
engaging with the marketplace

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,360
to start seeing imp deployments of the

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,399
module

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,440
offering the bank of tanzania is working

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,519
with the code base

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,680
to initiate a single-payer system

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,920
payment system

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,600
and we also have mawali which is a first

00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,000
commercial deployment

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,959
which is a joint venture between orange

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,199
and mtn

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,279
which are two very large mobile network

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:08,320
operators in africa

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:10,480
and they have announced a pan-african

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,839
partnership to deploy mojo loop-based

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,240
platforms

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,959
they have launched implementations this

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,440
year

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,959
and will continue to expand and grow

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,240
those implementations

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,240
uh into next year

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,680
so let's talk a little bit about our

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,720
development model and

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,079
and why um it is so important for us to

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,199
have this inclusive

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:36,320
developer community we um

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:39,519
we follow agile development process

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:42,720
which means that we iterate on

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,000
our work on a regular cadence three

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,240
times a year

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,480
we have we have meetings where we talk

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,199
about our work stream progre

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,480
progress and we establish our priorities

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:55,519
for the next program

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,519
increment the community is very much

00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,920
involved in determining what work

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,480
streams we will focus on in the upcoming

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,959
program

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,440
increment and that's based on market

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,920
requirements and gap analysis

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,880
uh again that the the community

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:13,279
articulates as uh being a priority

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,480
it's a very open process it's inclusive

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,360
of developers

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,120
implementers and customers so everyone

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,000
can participate in our community

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,839
meetings

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,600
and everyone has a vote on what our

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:27,040
priorities are for the next

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,120
iteration of work as i mentioned we

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,880
entered phase four of our development

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,360
cycle early this year

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,240
we're wrapping it up and uh we'll launch

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:41,279
phase five

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:44,079
in in our january uh meeting uh in 2021

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,680
some of the core technologies are are

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,759
technologies that many of you

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,839
on this pro in this presentation are

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,720
probably very familiar with

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:55,120
so as you can see we have an array of

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,600
open source tools and technologies

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,560
that are the underpinnings of the modulo

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,600
platform

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,759
of course linux based but many other

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,880
important technologies are part of the

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,279
solution

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,079
and i have to thank many of you that

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,800
have contributed

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,199
to these other technologies that are

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,920
really

00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:16,560
uh essential for us to be able to deploy

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,360
this this type of solution

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,120
with regard to hosting of the platform

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,839
we're infrastructure agnostic

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,759
we our development platform right now is

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:29,199
on amazon web server

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,240
we have azure implementations uh already

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,480
deployed

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,440
but we also want folks to have the

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,680
freedom to do on-premise installations

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,720
with some government and regulatory

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,399
agencies

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,880
having very tight control of the

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,880
infrastructure and the data

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,160
really dictates how they host the

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,959
platform

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,680
so it's perfectly acceptable and and

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,720
designed

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:56,399
to be either cloud-based or uh hosted

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,560
in-house uh if you want more details on

00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,199
the tools and technologies

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,560
uh you should just check out our github

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,640
repositories

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,720
and you can find out a lot more about

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,079
the tools and technologies that make up

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,079
the modular platform

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,280
let's talk a little bit more about our

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,480
community from the onset

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,120
we really wanted the mojo loop community

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,160
to be

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:24,559
multinational uh provide perspective

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,079
around the globe with regard to this

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,120
platform

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,600
obvi our center of gravity for our early

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,480
work

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,880
was to meet market needs in africa where

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,919
there is a large percentage of unbanked

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,840
and underserved

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:43,120
uh individuals but we have contributions

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:46,160
and input from countries from countries

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:49,760
across the globe uh we're up to over

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:53,039
over 650 participants in our community

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,840
we span six continents 47 countries

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:57,760
and we have 10 sponsor promoter members

00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,080
so when we do those week-long

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,840
planning sessions community meetings as

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,360
i mentioned we just finished one earlier

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,160
in october

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,200
we get input from all over the globe

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,919
from a wide

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,160
range of participants whether it be

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,760
digital financial service providers

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,880
central banks implementers open source

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,440
developers

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,960
so it's a very rich and uh robust

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,720
community that's

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,400
guiding us through our development

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,720
and what we want to do is make sure that

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,360
we have this ecosystem that benefits

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,679
everyone

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,600
there's a lot of stakeholders here

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,640
involved in the moju loop

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,799
solution first of all there's fintechs

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,960
fintechs and banks that can use the code

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,320
to modify internal systems or extend

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,880
their external

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,000
internal systems so that they can easily

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,039
interoperate with

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,799
other payment providers central banks

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,039
can speed up deployment of

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,799
national payment gateways uh and and

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:58,480
work with commercial partners

00:18:54,799 --> 00:19:00,400
again having an interoperable platform

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,400
governments can use mojo loop to deliver

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,000
support payments to citizens right into

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,720
their mobile wallets

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,480
as you know with a pandemic right now

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,440
government payments are becoming

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,080
increasingly

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,039
uh frequent and the necessary for

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,919
efficient

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:18,559
cost-effective and speedy delivery is uh

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,640
has never been more important

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,240
merchants uh want their customers to be

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,360
able to pay their bills directly from

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,919
their phones

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,200
the reduction of use of cash is always

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,919
uh desirable for

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,000
merchants and and banks and then the

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,799
users as as costa mentioned

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,120
some some users today have to walk miles

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,280
or

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,320
pay money pay for someone to transport

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,320
their miles

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,840
to send money to their relatives or to

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,240
pay a small bill

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,440
uh this way they using a mojo loop

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,840
enabled system

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,960
they can use their mobile phones and and

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,760
reduce the cost

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,640
and complexity of being part of the

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,640
banking system

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,080
there's four primary ways in which mo

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,080
mojo loop

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,280
enables an interoperable payments

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,280
platform

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,280
first there's an interoperability layer

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,840
that connects bank accounts

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,360
mobile money wallets and merchants in an

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,400
open loop system

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,799
open loop is so important here uh to be

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,880
in

00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,720
to make sure that consumers are not

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,919
locked into one platform

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,600
and can share money across different

00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,360
platforms

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,960
we have a directory service layer that

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,840
navigates different methods that

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,840
providers use to identify accounts on

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:33,039
each side of a transaction

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,919
so specific to what the service provider

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:37,120
needs

00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,880
in order to validate those accounts we

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,360
have transaction settlement

00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,720
layer that makes payments instantly and

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,400
irrevocable

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,120
if you're making two dollars a day if

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:50,640
you're living off of two dollars a day

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:53,200
you cannot afford to wait uh 24 hours or

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,919
48 hours for a payment to clear

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,919
uh it's so critical to have instant

00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,440
payment settlement

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,360
and of course we have components for

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,559
designing and implementing straw

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,039
strong internal fraud controls we need

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,919
that

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,720
that pla component to be very flexible

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,360
for the unique

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,720
requirements of each region and

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,559
regulatory requirements

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,880
now i know a lot of you in the audience

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,760
probably understand the benefits of open

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,640
source

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,440
but it it warrants reiterating the

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,919
advantages

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,080
of open source software in delivering

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,640
the mojo loop platform

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,120
first of all there's a lower capital

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,760
cost

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,720
upfront to deploy the open source

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,400
software

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,919
as you know open source software is

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,120
license free

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,440
and it allows people to not only deploy

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,000
without those costs but also to test

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,840
drive

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:51,360
and create a proof of concept or

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,960
do a sandbox in a very low cost way

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,720
to get themselves going with the

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,480
platform

00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,480
as far as lower maintenance costs are

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,720
concerned because

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,000
this is a shared effort across many

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,000
organizations

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,320
as we continue to expand those that are

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,880
involved if we have multiple banks

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,679
multiple

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,440
central banks multiple fintechs it's

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,679
likely that some of their challenges or

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,720
issues or requirements are similar

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:19,200
and uh that that allows us to

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,080
share the efforts of maintaining those

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,559
those

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,320
various offerings and features across

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:27,120
the community

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,200
there's also no vendor lock-in uh so

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,039
there doesn't doesn't require you to go

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,320
if you need new features if you need

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,880
enhancements

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,760
uh you don't have to go back to a vendor

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,799
and write a check

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,640
to see that that work happen you able

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,280
you're able to tap into the community

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,840
and again

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,600
probably find like-minded companies that

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,760
have similar requirements

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,200
and share the burden of developing that

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,640
additional functionality

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,640
and maintaining that additional

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,200
functionality so this is

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,799
um you know this development models the

00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,400
perfect solution for

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:04,159
rolling out a low-cost interoperable

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:07,039
platform for financial inclusion

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:09,200
and the entire ecosystem benefits uh so

00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:11,600
as moji loop comes online

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,320
it it will reach uh it could reach up to

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:17,120
1.6 billion individuals that currently

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,120
have no banking accounts today

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,640
businesses will see an increase in the

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,760
transaction volume

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,640
uh it in estimates by uh the the folks

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,240
that wrote this

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,360
this study is it's well over 2 trillion

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,360
dollars

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,679
digital financial service providers will

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,960
see more transaction and activity

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:39,760
new account holders and new participants

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,279
in their offerings and governments will

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,640
save billions of dollars

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:46,720
in being able to disperse funds out to

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,600
the populace in a more cost effective

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,799
way

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:53,200
rather than cutting checks or dispersing

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,200
cash

00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,679
so there's plenty of opportunities for

00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,240
you to engage with us

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,840
and we encourage you to investigate more

00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,559
fully on how you might be able to do

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,799
that

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,080
but let's talk about a couple of ways in

00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:09,520
which you can uh

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:12,559
you can collaborate with us first of all

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,679
our ultimate goal is to see adoption of

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,919
the mojo

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,440
platform out in the marketplace so

00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,000
whether you're a central bank

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,919
a digital financial service provider or

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,360
other financial institution

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:29,039
we'd encourage you to test out the code

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:31,360
try it out we will help you with with

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,400
setting up a sandbox and a proof of

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,440
concept

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,200
and um and uh enabling you to adopt the

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,120
platform

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,360
you can also contribute uh to the

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,760
platform of course we're always looking

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,400
for

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:47,039
uh for developers to contribute code to

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,039
the various work streams that we are

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,640
working on but there's other ways to

00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,840
contribute you can contribute on

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,320
documentation

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,679
you can contribute on advocacy awareness

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,600
education

00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,600
uh so there's a number of ways that you

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,200
can engage with a community

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,679
and and hopefully when you come to our

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,080
website you'll find a number of ways

00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,880
and if it's not clear to you reach out

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,200
to myself

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,559
or community manager or product manager

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,679
we'll happily walk you through the

00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:15,360
various areas that need your support

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,720
and then finally you can join the mojo

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,760
loop foundation

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,480
as they mentioned we were formed in may

00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,919
of this year

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,919
as a 501 c 3 non-profit

00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,520
and of course there are some operating

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,000
costs in ensuring that we have the

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,559
development

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,080
platform in place that we have staff to

00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:35,360
manage the community

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,760
that we provide the the sales tools and

00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,480
and uh training materials for the

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,600
community

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:44,799
to advance the use of mojo loop

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:47,360
that always obviously

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,559
involves some cash outlay and so by

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,120
joining as a member

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:53,200
of the foundation such as some of our

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,760
other benefactors have recently

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,799
you can help underwrite the ongoing cost

00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,559
and development of the platform

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,240
so with that a couple of things i'd

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:05,320
encourage you to check out

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,360
uh first of all do check out our website

00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:10,320
mojoloop.io

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,520
we also uh have a community manager

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,760
simeon orrico

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,520
who is available uh to to engage with
