hello everybody

00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,400
and welcome to this short and i hope

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,960
interesting talk

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,599
called uh open for business i'm going to

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,800
explore

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:20,160
some of the emerging trends and i guess

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,400
accelerating drivers around open source

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,199
open banking and what i call the open

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,000
data

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,760
ecosystem or economy that's uh becoming

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,679
more and more important

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,079
my name is gerald schottmancy i'm head

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,239
of propositions at near form

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,800
and i want to give you a very brief

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,680
background on near form just for context

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,920
so we create software solutions and

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,879
deliver them support them

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,039
for enterprises in large organizations

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,640
we also help with capability and what we

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,680
mean by that is

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,640
we help enterprises get to a more modern

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,520
architecture

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,879
set of tools technologies technologies

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,719
and governance

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,199
a lot of this is that is around open

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,080
source particularly around the front end

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,199
we are lucky in that i guess we've been

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,880
a remote first

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,479
company that's part of our dna for the

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,200
last eight to nine years

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,000
and that's helped us to i guess not miss

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,640
a beat during

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
this pandemic we've been able to just

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,759
roll on as normal

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,200
we're also very lucky over the last

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,400
decade or so to have worked with some

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,920
great clients

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,479
all around the world and lots of

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,479
different sectors and segments

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,479
we find that bringing the ideas and

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,560
experiences from

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,680
one sector to another is always well

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,560
received and very useful for our clients

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,040
in terms of open source uh i think we

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,759
can

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,799
justly um claim to have some credits

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,720
here

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,119
again going back to the pioneering

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,159
theories of node.js where the company

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,479
initially um started a lot of this and

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,119
have contributed greatly over the years

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,600
uh in fact we run nodeconf every year

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,799
and

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,640
right now um as i'm speaking the

00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,920
conference is ongoing at virtual

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,200
conference this year for

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,560
so two days for engineers to

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,759
and architects to exchange ideas

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,160
around that area uh more recently

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,959
we've been working around what we call

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,560
an approach

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,640
to the front end we call polaris which

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,920
is a single code base based around react

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,239
react native

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:24,239
to deliver solutions to ios android

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,520
and web from uh from the single codebase

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,200
and i'll speak more about that later

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,080
because it's relevant to financial

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,400
services and

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,519
open source and of course we've used

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,560
that same approach

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:37,840
in the last nine months to deliver

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,640
covert tracking apps national and state

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,519
apps to nine different jurisdictions so

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,760
everywhere from

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,800
new york and pennsylvania delaware right

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,000
through to

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,879
scotland uh gibraltar ireland northern

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,239
ireland so

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:55,360
a whole range of states and countries um

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,440
they they open source around that

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,120
and the tools and the technologies we've

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,440
used has been donated

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,560
uh we've donated it through the linux

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,319
health foundation

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,640
under the name of covert green so if you

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,680
look on gate up slash covet green you

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,760
can find the code there

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,360
we're hoping that will help to a lot of

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,200
countries or states to in the fight

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,519
against culvert

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,040
our engineers love to engineer and love

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,760
to collaborate and they have over the

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,440
years

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,120
created their own products which are in

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,799
use in the open source community

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,400
uh products like fastify which would be

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,319
very well known so

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,159
i guess we're a software company we do

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,080
have a lot of background in open source

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,319
and we do

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,959
use open source in the projects wherever

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,959
it's appropriate

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,560
okay so looking at open banking and what

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,280
the context is here

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,519
this is my own slide i did work in

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,680
banking technologies in the 90s and

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,799
so some of the move from legacy and

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,760
monolithic

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,760
bank i.t into digital banking to step

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,480
back a little bit from that i'd say that

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,040
the

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,560
the early moves into digital banking

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,120
very much have been

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,000
to the benefit of banks it's a more

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,640
efficient way

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,360
to deliver services than true physical

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,799
branches

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,879
and that has spurred on a lot of the

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,720
move to web it's actually been

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,519
easier and cheaper for banks to do that

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,599
way and certainly at the start of

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,720
using application programming interfaces

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,239
or api banking

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,880
and i've explained some of that in a

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:23,680
while certainly

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,040
certainly part of that is to benefit

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,199
banks as well and actually getting

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,600
access to their own data

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,919
more and more though and it's hard to

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,520
believe this is only since about 2015

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,400
because it's such a big impact

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,639
we've seen the emergence of external

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,080
market factors which are affecting

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:45,280
retail banks in particular for now so

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,840
the the famous and and um

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,680
well-known digital channel uh challenger

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,280
banks or neo banks like revolution

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,479
starting and 26

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,639
are taking off and have already

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,840
gained millions of customers and

00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,840
billions in funding

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,120
between them and it's an external threat

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,919
some people would say they're not banks

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,560
they're more like

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,000
digital wallets but certainly um it's a

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,680
threat to retail banking in that

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,280
they own a lot of the front-end

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,800
experience and are gaining ground

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,560
rapidly

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,560
what we're talking about more today is

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:19,680
the open banking regulation which is

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:21,919
um coming out around the world allowing

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,080
bank customers to grant access to their

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,720
account data and payments data to third

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,440
parties

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,560
and that's really interesting i think

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,759
these

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,680
external factors are gaining momentum

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,800
and a lot of ideas that were theoretical

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,479
in the future are now

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,800
happening through this new um

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,240
open data uh economy and that we're

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,360
moving into a new banking sys

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,800
ecosystem and we'll take a look at it

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,360
let's look at open banking first so

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,880
any proponents of this or any evangelist

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,520
wrote banking would immediately say

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,479
it will drive innovation so a customer

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,400
being able to

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,560
get new products and services based on

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,720
their existing financial data

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,479
um but i've seen a lot of changes come

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,080
technology changes and regulation

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,240
changes over the years i always ask

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,479
myself the same questions will it really

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,400
lead to real change um is it going to

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,120
impact and the questions i tend to ask

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,960
are

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,240
is it really going to be available on a

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,319
global scale um

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,000
are there use cases that make sense to

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,479
me and to you

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,759
and are there big benefits in some cases

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,360
i say show me the money

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,240
if you can see that there's benefits and

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,759
money to be made then that often drives

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,960
it's a marketplace driven innovation so

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,319
um let's look at the the availability

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,960
first

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,720
um and we don't understand all of this

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,280
map but i guess the darker the color the

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,720
more

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,880
um in place regulations are

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,560
and if we look at say the uk and europe

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,720
since 2018

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,400
and the legislation is finished the open

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,400
banking is in place and there's already

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,039
a

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,080
vibrant ecosystem fintechs new fintechs

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,319
which are

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,520
offering services based on account data

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,919
and payments data

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,520
that has rolled on through to india and

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,599
australia

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,360
other countries are developing the

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,720
regulation

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,479
or considering it i think north america

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,520
is very interesting in that

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:19,520
it may take time for regulation

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,880
full regulation to come into play for

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,720
open banking

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,960
because of the fragmented nature of the

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,840
banking system however

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,240
you can see in real time that some of

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,840
the

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,840
more progressive banks are already

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,520
starting to open up their apis and look

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,479
for partners to share with because they

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,560
can see

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,319
which way the marketplace is going you

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,960
can see other um

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,599
apps for personal financing and

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,639
budgeting

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,800
like why ynab or

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,479
mint the they're actually using screen

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,720
scraping in some cases

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,080
uh which is an interesting um way of

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,199
doing things they're getting financial

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,039
data with consent

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,879
but it leaves the banks responsible for

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,879
the data but not necessarily control in

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:03,440
all of the data analysis

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:05,759
so i feel that in the u.s it's actually

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,639
market demand is starting to move ahead

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,720
of regulation

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,879
or won't wait for regulation we'll start

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,919
to actually drive out some

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,280
use cases there overall answering the

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,400
first question

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,479
it very much looks to me like the the

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,319
inexorable drive of democracy over

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,680
tyranny it's like open data

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,960
over closed data you can see that

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,520
with the movement that's already going

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,320
on and the unlikely

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,120
case of ever reversing it that this will

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,880
come into play

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,839
sooner or later in your region wherever

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,479
you are if it's not already there

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,880
and around use cases there are many

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,240
let's

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,399
take a look at a very simple one to

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,880
start with

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,399
right now insurance providers in order

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,240
to assess somebody's

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,760
financial risk profile and provide the

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,959
appropriate risk cover and premiums

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,640
requires a tortuous manual

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,360
to and fro to get all of that

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,519
information from various

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,720
institutions and compile it and work it

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,080
out so

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:11,680
even this relatively boring use case

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,440
you can see how um account information

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,519
can be aggregated through open an open

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,120
banking api immediately for that

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,560
customers bank accounts wherever they

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,360
may be in whatever bank

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,080
brought together collated and analyzed

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,760
so there are

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,760
already third party providers offering

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,680
this service this is more

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,120
automation than innovation but you can

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,360
see that

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,279
it immediately provides a far far

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,080
quicker and easier way

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,680
to compile a good risk profile which is

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,480
a benefit insurance providers and

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,200
customers

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,200
that's just one use case um for

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,399
insurance using account aggregation on

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,399
open banking apis

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,560
also of interest and this is one that we

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,240
would all could

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,959
identify with uh going to your

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,240
local retailer supermarket starbucks or

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,800
macy's or whatever

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,279
and using your card actually triggers a

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,720
chain

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:07,040
of um engagement from various

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,480
third parties uh to get that payment

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,399
completed

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,760
and when you look at this kind of a

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,120
chain uh

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,160
it seems to comply with a lot of the

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,120
characteristics

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,320
that would make it open for disruption

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,399
first is that they

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,680
there are only two real parties involved

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,120
in the value exchange

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,800
um and yet there are so many other

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,760
parties involved to get the transaction

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,480
completed

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,440
which seems to be uh not very logical or

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,760
useful

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,600
um the second thing is that all of these

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,279
parties for payment gateways and

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,880
processors and current networks

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,959
are taking a fee and it's sometimes

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,040
quite a sizable fee

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,040
and this is not necessarily adding

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,399
tangible benefit to the value transfer

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,480
but it's certainly costing

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,320
both the customer and the merchant in

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,360
money and then the last thing i'd see

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,519
here is that there's actually

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,279
quite often trust depending on the

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,640
nature of your relationship with the

00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,640
merchant it could be

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,880
someone that you trust or a merchant or

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,399
a supermarket you visit very often

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,720
and there's already some brand loyalty

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,920
and brand trust there

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:11,200
and in that case um

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,880
you would see that this is ripe for

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,040
disruption

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,160
and if you look at the open payments

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,760
initiative

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,360
uh that allows right now retailers who

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,800
are in those areas with with open

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,040
payments and open banking already

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,800
regulated to set up a relationship with

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,360
the customer whereby they can withdraw

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,760
the

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,120
money for the transaction directly from

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,040
their bank account

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,040
so customers again just pick it from a

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,440
point of sale option or from an app

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,200
and give biometric authentication and

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,680
the transaction is completed

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,640
it gives immediate value to the retailer

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,040
it cuts out

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,240
a lot of the middlemen and the fees and

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,720
therefore

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,560
it uh that extra value can be used to

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,040
increase margin for retailers to reduce

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,040
cost

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,480
costs or to even reduce the price of the

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,399
transaction for the customer

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,560
so it's a win-win for the two people at

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,360
the core of the transaction

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,680
and it's i'm sure only a matter of time

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,040
before this really starts to become more

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,480
uh widely spread as a use case um i've

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,320
started to look recently at press

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,800
releases from mastercard

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,480
where they're starting to i think get

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,079
this about the market and making sure

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,839
that they're launching open apis

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,839
themselves to get into that ecosystem

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,040
rather than be left out of it

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:26,160
and acquiring fintechs to

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,519
again be part of that new ecosystem and

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,160
i think the banks should probably take

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,839
up

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,160
a sit up and take note of this kind of

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,040
activity because action speed but louder

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,560
than words

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,720
this is a value chain that's right for

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,839
disruption and open payments make that

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,720
makes that very possible right now

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,120
um stepping back what actually gives a

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,399
lot

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,120
of the these new innovative products and

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,000
services

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,760
uh fuel is the fact that it's not just

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,920
that you can technically access this

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,839
data is that the other third-party

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,040
providers can do something and they can

00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,959
bring an extra

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,880
dimension to the service by combining

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,680
financial data so looking at the one we

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,880
just saw

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,200
it's c3 on this diagram the

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,920
retailer has actually started to build

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,560
up a financial services relationship

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,200
um with that customer that they didn't

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,279
have

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,200
and you could imagine that that could

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,720
extend when the trust is there and the

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,320
channels are set up

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,839
to point of sale ending where the

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,240
retailer can actually lend

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,399
the customer the money to buy the item

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,480
and pay back overtime

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,600
which is really interesting if we look

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,800
at v1 and this

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,760
it's a very simple account aggregation

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,959
use case but interestingly for retail

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,880
banks over many years

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,880
the single customer view has been a kind

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,720
of a holy grail to even get

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,639
one single customer view of their own

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,440
customers for the accounts in their own

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,079
bank

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,000
which tend to be siloed what this would

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,240
do here is it would allow

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
a third party to aggregate all the

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,480
account information from any bank

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,240
for that customer that business and then

00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,440
provide more analysis and more value

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,600
around that data

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,199
so it would kind of almost leap frog

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,680
over what banks have been trying to do

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:08,000
over the last few years really

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,720
interesting you start to get into c1

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,199
at the mega app um i think this is one

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,040
is

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,440
it becomes more interesting as i go

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:18,480
along in this presentation the idea that

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,560
an amazon or a wechat which has huge

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,360
information about its own

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,440
clients could become one of the

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,959
third-party users and combine

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,240
financial data along with all the

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:32,160
location personal purchasing and

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,440
preference data that they already have

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,959
and that would make them very very

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,680
powerful

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,560
and actually possibly push banks right

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,079
to the

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,480
right to the back of the stage in this

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:45,680
case so there's a lot of use cases

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,760
i think if we look back there we can see

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,440
over the last few slides there will

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,440
definitely be global availability of

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,120
this that's already rolling out

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,279
there are some interesting use cases to

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,440
say the least and possibly

00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,240
as these emerge over the next year or

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,399
two some very compelling use cases for

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,480
other third parties to start building

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,320
innovative new products and services

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,680
around open banking around unbundled

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,880
banking i guess you call them the

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,399
digital banking

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:14,880
and around open payments so what's the

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:18,720
bank's perspective on this because it is

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,160
quite an existential threat i guess um

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,000
and i've worked in bank id for a number

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,440
of years and i know that it's a bit of a

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,360
cliche to

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,560
push on the poor banks that they do

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:31,440
struggle to roll out new

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:34,240
services and features like most larger

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,399
enterprises or older enterprises

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,399
and i know a lot of banks are trying to

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,560
move ahead with digital transformation

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,320
and doing well normally starting at the

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,880
the back end first i guess

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,320
but there is still quite a big ship to

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,680
turn around in many cases

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,720
um and i think that banks that are still

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,160
struggling with modernizing and moving

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,880
slowly towards a new

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,160
um a more agile digital model will

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,240
definitely struggle when

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,600
api banking open banking rolls out over

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,639
the next couple of years

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,040
and these are the things that they need

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:08,240
to consider um so

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,720
placing in terms of modernizing a lot of

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,279
banks

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,560
realize that they have a lot of

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,040
technical debt and

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,639
uh outdated legacy back-end systems but

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,120
rather than take the risk of replacing

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,800
them all

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,720
a core strategy for many banks is to

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,600
place an application programming

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,079
interface

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,600
as an abstraction layer and that would

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,360
be the private apis

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,560
a lot of banks are doing this just to

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,920
get out their own data in a more

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,199
efficient way

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,320
um the public apis would be around the

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,480
open banking so

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,680
it's a version of this api which is

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,759
available to the public

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,880
and is enforced by compliance to be

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,399
there

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,240
i've spoken some colleagues who are

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,079
still in banking i.t and they said that

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,160
it's taken them so long to get their own

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,680
apis working and then to comply with

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,000
open banking that they haven't really

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,639
thought

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,600
any further than this and i would say to

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,839
them

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,079
this is really important right now um

00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,320
opening up partner apis

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,000
on the it gets is a chance for banks to

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,240
get on the front foot and start getting

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,640
out to find partners in the new more

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,760
open

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,360
ecosystem if they don't do that somebody

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,319
else will and somebody else will use the

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,360
open

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,839
banking apis to do that if banks are

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,000
still

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,760
slow and saying look let's see what the

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
market is going to bring us over the

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,559
next

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,559
years before we decide i would ask this

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,199
question which seems an unusual question

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,160
but

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,799
it's around mobile telcos um and then we

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,520
can see

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:31,200
from financial times articles of last

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:35,120
why that they have been retrenching

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:37,440
reducing rationalizing and cutting costs

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,039
and you can see the reason quite clearly

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,280
now looking back

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,600
at mobile telcos while they've generated

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,679
billions during the 90s and early 2000s

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,120
have actually lost the front end to the

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,880
over-the-top players like

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,480
amazon and netflix and google and apple

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,640
and facebook obviously

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,480
and a lot of the margin and the value

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,799
and the experience is happening there

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,240
in their front end but on their network

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,760
but the

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,280
cash is going to the over the top

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,960
players and

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,480
you might say how is that relevant well

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,880
if you look at that it's a highly

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,120
regulated

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,480
industry where the industry has spent

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,720
years building up

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,760
the strong infrastructure to support

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,840
services

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,280
but didn't quickly enough get out into

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,360
the front end experience

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,559
let other players get in there who are

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,360
now taking the

00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,559
core relationships in the margin and

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,160
leading to

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:32,880
i guess telecom operators becoming

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,640
back-end wholesale less relevant

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,000
providers in their own industry

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,600
and you do have to wonder if that could

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
happen in retail banking and happen very

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,000
quickly

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,160
if we look at some very recent uh

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,840
research from accenture

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,240
uh when talking to i guess what they

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,280
call digitally active or digital

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,840
nomads um there's a huge

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,400
majority 78 of those who would be quite

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,679
happy

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,400
to take banking services from the likes

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,160
of google or

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:04,000
amazon some would also be happy to share

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,440
their google amazon data with banks but

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,960
they would expect a lot more in return

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,799
from banks and more personalized

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,960
services

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,559
this has always been mentioned and for a

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,000
long time people have said look google

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,360
doesn't want to be an insurance company

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,360
doesn't want to be a bank

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,280
but we now see coming from the wall

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,840
street journal and other places

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,559
um actions again speaking out in words

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,760
with google

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,840
announcing that they will provide

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:29,039
checking accounts

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,720
with apple introducing credit cards

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,039
amazon talking about checking accounts

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,240
as well so this whole

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:38,720
theoretical possible future threat is

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,520
now here and when you combine that with

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,360
the likes the

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,880
types of regulation around open banking

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,240
and the expectation around

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,240
open data in general uh i think these

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,679
changes are going to rapidly accelerate

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,880
over the next while

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:56,640
so retail banks in particular

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,880
need to sit up and take notice of this

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,280
the question we often ask around open

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,960
source and where that fits in here

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,720
oh and particularly in conferences like

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,039
this in the in the open source

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,559
strategy forum we we spent a lot of time

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,640
looking at lighthouse projects where

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:13,360
banks have used some open source

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,000
in some projects and how it is good

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,159
enough

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,200
and the question is is it good enough

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,600
for banking

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,400
and i think that's the wrong question i

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,400
think that

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,080
banks are asking a very internal based

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,440
question from their side of the

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:30,320
the world saying is this kind of

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,159
technology good enough and based on

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,960
everything that's happening rapidly out

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,640
in the market

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,679
and the changes and the ownership of

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,679
data and changing hands

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,960
the question that should be asked much

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,280
more importantly should be a

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,360
market-based

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,120
question where is the market going for

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,880
banks they should maybe ask themselves

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,400
do we have the technical talent do we

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,159
have the speed and agility

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,919
to compete in what the open data

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,600
marketplace is going to look like

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,919
and it's not five years from now it's

00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,840
like 24 months from now

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:03,280
and that's where open source probably

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:05,520
comes into this equation more

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,559
the this is again is from accenture is a

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,280
great

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:12,640
illustration of what can happen we look

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:15,440
often at the open data marketplace where

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,760
life events and life moments are spotted

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,159
on

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,440
social networks they're true searches

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,480
they could be anywhere in the digital

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,520
world

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:26,919
recognizing those moments

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:29,360
and working with uh third-party

00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:30,000
ecosystem participants so that would be

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,400
a bank

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,440
who has an open api partnership with

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,720
insurance

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:39,120
or with car finance or with

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,960
any other services that match what's

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,440
happening with the person out in their

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,960
digital life and being able to be there

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,960
and be present and offer that

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,120
combined service in a way that's

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,400
personalized relevant and timely

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,480
and that would be the living bank and

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,080
that it's far and away from where a lot

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,919
of banks are now still struggling with

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,840
getting basic apis in place

00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,440
other banks are well ahead a lot of

00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,280
banks are thinking well and then maybe

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,559
starting up their own digital challenges

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,520
to themselves

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:07,280
but not doing this i believe uh would be

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,200
a major misstep

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,840
doing it will be really interesting and

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:15,280
will get banks back out in front

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:18,720
unlike the telecom operators

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,720
again looking at open source

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,360
we see the relevance for this it's

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,600
looking at bank challenges and looking

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,760
at where open source fits so

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,440
for banks the ecosystem is growing now

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,200
it's not growing next year the year

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,880
after so third-party providers are

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,280
already using banking data

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,799
to provide interesting new services

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,159
digital challenger banks we're going to

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:41,120
take some of this on

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,880
interesting in ireland kbc which would

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,760
be the third or fourth bank one of the

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,000
first

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,799
things they did on their app uh was to

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,240
offer

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,240
if you had a bank balance with one of

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,960
the bigger banks one of the established

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,640
large legacy banks they offered to show

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,480
that balance on their own app

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,880
knowing that they maybe only had some of

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,120
your business but could now offer you

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,039
an app which is more personalized to you

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,000
and you would start looking at your bank

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,880
of ireland balance

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,760
through your kbc app that's really

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,440
interesting

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,200
and that's only within the banking

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,280
sphere imagine what third party

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,559
providers could do with that

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,200
the other interesting point here for

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,960
banks is that while it now looks like

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,120
data is open and there's an open

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,039
competition for financial services

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,880
it's actually not that clear-cut and

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,960
what actually is happening is that open

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,440
banking

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,640
forces banks to provide account and

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,880
payments data

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,039
to the rest of the world but there is no

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,200
reciprocal so

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,320
google and amazon or facebook can now

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,360
get at

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,720
account data for customers but

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,480
that does not mean that they have to

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,720
provide any of their

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,080
really important personalized data to

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,400
the banks

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,320
so open banking actually puts banks at a

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,880
retail banks at a disadvantage

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,960
so it's not an even competition uh

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,120
there's also and i think this is true

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,720
and so many spheres there's been a shift

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,480
to the front end so

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,000
a bank account is a bank account running

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,600
in the back end it doesn't feel any

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,440
different necessarily whatever system

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,279
it's running on but

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,720
uh what has been proven time and again

00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,919
and it's proven even by the digital

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,520
challenger banks is that if the

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,480
front-end experience

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,360
is personalized if it's slick uh if it's

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,679
interesting and

00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,200
and uh offering innovative products

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,360
that's where

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,240
the new battlefield is and it's not

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,559
necessarily

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,159
a strength of banks banks tend to lag

00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,360
five or ten years behind in their

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,200
front-end apps

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,880
even if they're launching new apps they

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,960
tend to be siloed

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,679
and not giving a full customer view or

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:40,320
as i say a little bit behind

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,360
and in this new growing ecosystem which

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,440
is very much

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,960
enabled by new technology there's a need

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,559
for banks to have the best technical

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,279
talent

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,080
and this is where open source fully fits

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,960
the frame

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,679
um the open source community is quite

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,080
equivalent

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:58,159
to the ecosystem that's growing now and

00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,159
speaks the language of fintechs so

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,520
open banking apis themselves are open

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,279
source and

00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,720
a huge amount of the products and

00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,400
services that are developed around there

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,480
have been developed in open source

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,919
which is not just the technology but

00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,000
also the culture

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,760
um the collaborative nature and sharing

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,720
of that and it's much much easier to do

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,400
that

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,760
working with new fintechs if you're

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
working with open source tools and

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,960
processes

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,640
then coming from a proprietary backend

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,000
or closed off system

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,919
and open source let's not forget

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,360
dominates the front end so react and

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:31,679
react native are the most popular

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,840
frameworks or approaches for front end

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,480
along with things like angular and vue

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,159
and engineers almost automatically will

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,520
choose the open source tools that

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:45,120
they can use so if you want to

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:47,600
work and lead in this ecosystem which is

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,480
technology technologically driven

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,559
front-end

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,080
focused and open and collaborative and

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,480
moving very rapidly than

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,240
open source is necessary not so much

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,600
around the back end proprietary systems

00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,679
of the bank but definitely around the

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,440
future front ends

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,799
engineers love to collaborate and that's

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:07,200
why a lot of these open source systems

00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,240
attract great engineers and architects

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,720
who want to collaborate

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,400
learn iterate true and talk to other

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,279
engineers which is essentially what open

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,279
source facilitates

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,960
uh just to give an example uh i

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,880
mentioned polaris earlier on that's our

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,919
approach to the front end so we use

00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,320
uh in near form react and react native

00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,679
core

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,640
and things like graphql in the

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:31,840
background but we use that to create

00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:35,600
um fully working

00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:38,400
great looking apps on android ios web

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,360
using a single code based of react we

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,279
recently

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,520
partnered with ibm to develop an open

00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:46,320
banking reference app

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,440
fully working against open banking

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,120
accounts and

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:54,240
using financial transfers

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:56,400
uh using polaris using react and had the

00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,320
whole thing up and working in four weeks

00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,320
uh that's the same framework we've used

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,000
for coveted tracing apps so

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,000
it shows again that the open source

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,640
tools in the right hands

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,320
using the right way can create uh really

00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,600
exciting front-end

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:14,799
experiences using open banking uh and

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:17,039
very very rapidly and securely

00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,960
so just final thoughts again this is

00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,000
even wider it's not really just about

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,919
open banking it's about

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,200
open data and that is growing and

00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,799
growing so

00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,640
the real winners here will be the ones

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,720
who understand that financial data can

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,840
be combined with all sorts of other open

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,320
data

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,520
true apis and that's where the next

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,760
ecosystem is

00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,039
if you look at say amazon's dominance of

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,039
the american market

00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,600
with 80 of households having amazon

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,000
prime it's just showing that the super

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,320
app

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,799
based on getting your data understanding

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,320
it and personalizing it is where the

00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,000
world is going

00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,240
and banks i think have a couple of steps

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,799
to catch up retail banks

00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,600
in getting more open source and more

00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,840
open data

00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,240
and more open approach to this very

00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:05,200
quickly

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,080
so finally i guess um to come full

00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,039
circle

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:11,279
i think that that result is if you look

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:13,679
at unbundled banking and digital

00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:15,679
challenging banking coming in the last

00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,399
five years and hugely

00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,000
taken the world by storm open banking is

00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:23,679
has gone even faster

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,720
i believe that the next move to

00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,480
financial data being open and used

00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,799
in whatever front end is the most

00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,880
personal and the most familiar to you

00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,840
is what what the open data economy is

00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,600
about

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,919
so we've moved beyond i think even in

00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,559
the last few months we've moved beyond

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,880
um api banking and multi banking and

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:46,080
we're now in an open data economy

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,799
and that's where open backing

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,919
open source and i guess an open mind is

00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,559
going to

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:59,840
show us who the next winners are and

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:59,840
thank you very much for your time

00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,279
