good day everyone welcome to open

00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,280
innovation in the financial services

00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,880
sector

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,559
my name is leslie hawthorne and along

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,320
with my colleague joe giordano we're

00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,160
going to talk to you today about how

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,880
co-creating open source software is a

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,960
great benefit to your business

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,240
to briefly recap our agenda for today

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,600
we're going to

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,359
of course give you a little bit of more

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,720
information about us and why we're here

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,160
to present to you today

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,160
we're going to talk about how open

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,079
source software is ubiquitous across the

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,760
financial services sector

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,559
we're going to talk about the process of

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,399
moving from being a user and a consumer

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,000
of open source software to contributing

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,800
to open source software projects and the

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,680
benefits

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,600
of doing so we'll also make sure to give

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,120
you some concrete ways to get started

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,079
contributing to open source software

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,680
projects

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,199
uh and last but not least we're gonna

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,399
give you folks some resources so that

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,840
you can learn more uh

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,520
about this topic area after our

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,879
presentation today

00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,600
so uh a little bit about myself um i

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,039
was fortunate enough to to learn uh the

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,559
best way to describe myself a couple

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,080
years ago for my manager here at red hat

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,200
deborah bryant she said leslie you're a

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,560
super connector

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,400
you're one of those people who knows

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,439
everybody and is always there quietly

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,840
behind the scenes helping them to

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,759
collaborate and get good stuff done

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,960
so i've been doing that throughout my

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,080
career in the tech industry

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,640
a little more than 15 years i've had

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,159
roles

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,799
previously working in open source at

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,640
google at elastic and i'm actually on my

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,520
second stint at red hat i'm what we call

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,880
a boomerang

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,960
someone who loves red hat so much they

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,400
came back to work here a second time

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,240
uh i've in addition to my professional

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,240
uh work with open source i've also done

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,799
voluntary work for several

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,880
open source software nonprofits uh in

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,880
board director or advisory roles

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,799

and i'm a proud contributor to phoenix's

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,680
open source readiness working group

solutions

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,440
and helping them with their business in

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,039

i've worked at a number of different

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,920
software and media companies over the

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,599
years and

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,360
have spent over 20 plus years in

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,200
technology i'm

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,200
happy to talk to you guys today about

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,840
some of the things i've learned and

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,920
and encourage all of you to start to

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,959
participate in open source communities

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,640
so that you can

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,400
derive a lot of the value and benefits

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:36,400
from them

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:39,440
next slide very cool

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,879
okay so you know open source is

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,680
everywhere in your business and your

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,959
business can't

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,599
function without open source uh today um

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,879
in fact you know we've heard numerous

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,360
times that open source

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,400
is uh software is is eating the world

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,680
right so

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,840
um what red hat does is every year we um

00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,200
charter a state of the enterprise open

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,200
source survey

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,280
uh and we enlist the third party to do

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,720
that so the third party illuminist

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,440
was asked to pull some of them customers

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,879
others not

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,080
customers of red hat across 11 different

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,640
countries

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,239
and these decision makers and and i.t

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,680
leaders

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,120
you know we asked them a number of

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,159
questions around enterprise open source

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,720
technology

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,400
and we asked them how important it was

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,760
to their strategic vision in their

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,640
organization

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,159
not surprisingly 95 said that open

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,519
source is important to their

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,159
organization

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,879
digging a little bit deeper we see that

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,000
you know

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:40,480
36 percent and 39 view it as

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,480
extremely and very important and that

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,440
really makes up the bulk of 75

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,000
of the respondents and that's up 16 from

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,680
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,680
percent uh of the previous year's survey

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,519
so you know open source is really the

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,879
technical side of open innovation in

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,599
commercial and financial

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,959
services industries from open banking to

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,640
psd2

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,560
open source development and

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,439
standardization on open source

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,519
is allowing you know users and and

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,439
fintechs and other organizations

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,959
to take advantage of the data and

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,000
services that weren't previously

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,680
available

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,040
um you know there's a there's a great

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,919
great quote that

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,440
you know um is is talked a lot about in

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,280
in the open source community

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,800
and it's it's not a question of whether

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,639
to use open source

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,000
but it's really more how do you do it

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,080
more strategically

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,520
efficiently and extensively than your

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,080
competitors

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,080
next slide

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,919
so deriving some of the data out of the

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,560
state of the open source enterprise

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,520
open source report we can see that you

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,840
know it's really

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,840
open source is being used across all

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,400
facets of the it

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,759
organization as a field resource for red

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,160
hat i've helped numerous

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,800
organizations implement tools like

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,240
ansible

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,000
for infrastructure and devops pipelines

00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,360
right at runtimes to modernize their

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,800
applications

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,960
and openshift to enable it to deliver a

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,960
modern kubernetes based container

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,120
platform for their customers

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,479
i've worked extensively with a lot of

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,960
large financials

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,520
uh one example of that is deutsche bank

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,000
who

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,479
is a good red eye customer um and has

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,320
spoken at summit quite a few times

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,800
they were able to modernize their pads

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,600
platform from what they previously had

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,160
and the called

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,000
deutsche application platform depth to a

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,800
kubernetes-based platform based on

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,919
openshift

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,680
you in which they've named fabric

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,240
and they've been able to take advantage

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,120
of a multi-cloud architecture

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,960
they've really been on this

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,440
modernization journey for a while with

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,840
us

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,520
um starting with openshift three and

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,360
they've implemented the platform

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,280
while also redefining their application

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,520
development strategy and transforming

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,800
their devops and sre practices

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,639
so they've not only successfully

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,400
implemented the technology but they've

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,680
transformed their organization

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,840
some of the benefits that they've

00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,000
publicly highlighted are that they've

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,440
cut end-to-end application development

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,720
from six to nine months

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,840
to two to three weeks they've also

00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,680
significantly simplified their devops

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,759
collaboration processes

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,680
using flexible integration and an agile

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,680
approach and they've also

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,199
optimized the use and cost of data

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,000
center and cloud capacity

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,560
by implementing microservices containers

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,080
and cloud bursting technologies

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:27,840
next slide so

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,360
taking a look at um the benefits that

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,360
enterprises consider to be

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,520
the the top reasons for them you know

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,880
using open source software i think that

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,800
um you know some of these are not

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,680
necessarily going to be a surprise for

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,560
example lower to

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,680
lower total cost of ownership um but i

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,600
you know when we look at

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,720
the other two uh top benefits listed

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,600
based on uh

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,120
the illumina survey that joe referred to

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,800
you know we're looking at higher quality

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,800
software and better security

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:57,599
so the idea that because there is

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,160
this community of people coming together

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,520
to

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,280
create value in the form of software

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,880
because there is that wisdom of the

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,800
crowds and operation there is

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,880
is a higher level of quality of software

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,759
produced and also this this whole

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,759
concept that is

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,039
often referred to as linus's law right

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,840
the idea that with

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:18,080
enough eyes all bugs are shallow so open

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,840
source software is able to provide

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,520
a more secure operating environment for

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,720
the businesses who are using it

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,120
and it's it's 100 percent um

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,800
you know my experience that

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,319
organizations not only derive these

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,240
benefits through using open source

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,919
software but they they derive even

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,840
deeper benefit by being there to

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,479
co-create that software because

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,160
by being there to work alongside the

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,280
folks who are creating the products that

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,319
you use

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,759
you're able to ensure that your your use

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,879
case is attended to your

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,479
you're able to find out more about um

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,319
ways in which the security may be

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,599
vulnerable faster and you're also

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,879
able to um to leverage what has been

00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,400
created that much more effectively

00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,440
because your in-house team has been

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,039
there

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,560
each step of the journey to help create

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,199
it so

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,479
hopefully we have uh convinced you that

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,759
open source is important to you and

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,960
let's talk a little bit about how you

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,120
can move from

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,080
um just using open source software to

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,759
actually

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,080
uh contributing to it and making it

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,080
better

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,199
so i think one thing that's uh that's

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,840
really important to know when we talk

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,599
about

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,879
you know open source software we're not

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,720
just talking to you about

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,919
the the software stack you're selecting

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,520
right um

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:34,000
open source is 100 a an innovation model

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,680
right and when you decide that you're

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,519
going to go in all in on open source

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,360
software you're making a statement to

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,039
your employees about how

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,839
your organization is going to do its

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,680
work um how it's going to produce value

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,200
how they're going to be engaging with

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,680
their own customers

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,120
and you know how your organization is

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,640
going to meet new challenges that are

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,320
opposed to it right like thinking back

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,160
to joe's earlier example of deutsche

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,399
bank and how they've been able to

00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,920
to transform their operations and now

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:03,760
can deliver value instead of in

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:06,399
in months instead in days right and

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,680
when you choose open source software

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,000
you're embedding

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,839
that statement of purpose and how you

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,959
are going to innovate into

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,800
uh the set of tools that you are

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,640
using that enable or disable certain

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,519
organizational capabilities right

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,080
you're choosing the tools that are

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,000
fundamental

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,440
to the rethinking of how you operate and

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,519
you generate your value for your end

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,200
customer

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:33,680
so uh you know i really love this quote

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,040
from from greg satell right and he he

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,800
says for the past few decades

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,640
agility in the technology sector has

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,480
largely meant moving faster and faster

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,240
down to a predetermined path

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,600
over the coming decades however agility

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,519
will take a new meaning

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,519
the ability to explore multiple domains

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,120
at once and combine them into something

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,040
that produces value

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,360
this change will be profound we need to

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,880
rethink old notions about how we compete

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,720
collaborate and bring new products to

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,480
market um

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,080
and the the part about you know

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,920
rethinking old notions is really

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,440
striking right it indicates once again

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,160
that the challenges that face most

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,040
organizations

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,600
are not really about technology they're

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,440
not about

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,200
problems of finding or acquiring or

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,360
inventing new tools

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,680
to do the same work faster or more

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,120
efficiently it's really

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,800
problems that cut to the core of how we

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,760
operate and how we participate

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,880
in interconnected webs of innovation and

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,480
evolution

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,399
that are happening in places that we may

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,399
not have considered that may in fact be

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,399
uh be happening with our competitors

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:36,000
so now that we talked a little bit about

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,120
that and leslie you know conveyed um

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,680
you know that the benefits and started

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,160
to convey

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,200
a lot of the benefits um let's talk a

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,000
little bit about

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,959
you know the different types of models

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,880
of engagement

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,240
with open source technologies right

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,360
because there's there's quite a few

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,720
different models that we're going to

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,839
talk about today

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,760
and we want to focus on so i've broken

00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,839
this out into four different areas

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,680
and we'll start with the most widespread

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,680
open source relationship model

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,680
which is actually the consumption model

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,640
and um you know i have a very high

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,720
degree of confidence

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,640
today that if you're listening to this

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,320
talk your organization is using open

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,000
source in some capacity

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,519
whether it's enterprise open source from

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,440
a vendor like red hat

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,640
or you know open source from straight

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,160
from the community

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,160
that a developer downloaded and

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,600
incorporated or a tool that your

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,519
operations team's using

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,600
um and you're you're seeing obvious

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,440
benefits from this technology

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,800
um and there are also some risks that

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,120
you know we'll talk about

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,480
especially when implementing completely

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,440
upstream open source

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,839
projects um in a consumption only model

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,959
and

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:44,560
again this drives the benefit of whether

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:46,240
the the you know thesis of why we want

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,399
you to co-create

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,639
next let's discuss a little bit about

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,480
open sourcing of specific projects

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,680
now what we've seen over the past few

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,440
years is

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,800
some of the financial services

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,440
organizations

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,480
and other companies have decided to

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,320
fully release

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,920
specific projects that they've developed

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,639
into

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,360
the open source community and try to

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,360
develop a strong community around it

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,040
the code's been vetted internally the

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,120
organization has done their legal due

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,200
diligence and corporate due diligence

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,040
to make sure sure there's no proprietary

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,079
secrets or special sauce in there

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,480
um they've also you know they a lot of

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,800
these

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,320
communities that have been full-fledged

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,720
open source projects

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,639
being donated have seen mixed results

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,120
with some really taking off and taking

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,200
hold

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,480
with others not gaining as much traction

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,519
and we'll touch upon some of the more

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:41,760
successful ones in a few slides

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:45,040
next uh you know i want to highlight a a

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,040
way of contributing to open source which

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,040
is a little bit more private

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,959
um and it's a really good way for

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,680
organizations to get started with

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,839
the idea of setting up reusability

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,160
frameworks and setting up code sharing

00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,519
capabilities and this is called inner

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,200
source and there's a few companies that

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,880
are pioneering this

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,560
this is where an organization puts

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,480
structures in place

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,720
that enable the sharing of code between

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,440
development groups and other application

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,600
groups

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,040
um it could be within it or within the

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,480
lines of business but

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,800
the organization puts together a

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,320
framework that makes people comfortable

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,600
with the sharing

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,360
there's a good chance that a lot of the

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,000
capabilities that developers are working

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,720
on

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,279
um small functions and capabilities are

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,440
are

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,800
duplicated throughout the organization

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,839
so there's benefits

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,880
of normalizing this process and

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:37,279
reducing the deduplication of efforts

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,560
this is probably one of the easier ways

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,160
for your organization to

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,600
start getting their code out there

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,279
internally and

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,959
it will enable your organization to

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,959
share and improve

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,959
and pull from a common repository

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,839
internally

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,920
so lastly i'll hit on the most mature

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,120
model which is the participation in open

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,639
source communities

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,720
and this is why leslie and i are here

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,720
for you today this is when you

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,399
participate in a project that's outside

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,360
of your organization

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,279
the level of maturity here is increasing

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,920
the risk slightly increases but will

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,560
help you

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,120
understand how to reduce that risk and

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,680
it's still

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,360
very rare in financial services this is

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,959
the model we want to encourage you

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,639
our financial services customers to

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,000
drive towards and

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,920
we'll talk about this and give you a

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,920
roadmap next slide please

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,920
so i want to talk a little bit about you

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,519
know differentiating between the

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,560
consumption model and the co-creation

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,000
model right

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,760
so we'll talk a little bit about the

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,639
consumption model and in

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,360
in here i want to walk through why there

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,880
are risks in a consumption only model

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,839
let's say you're using an open source

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,519
project extensively throughout your

00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,600
organization and the auditors come to

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:50,480
you and say this piece of software

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,920
requires this type of transaction

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,959
tracking capability or

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,720
logging capabilities and this

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,320
you know this you can't just rip and

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,560
replace this software with something

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,680
that has this functionality

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,519
now you're you know your your test with

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,680
three options really to get this

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,519
functionality into your open source

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,360
software that you're using you can ask

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,399
the community for uh requests for

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,760
enhancement

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,240
which they may or not be able to

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,959
accommodate you might be able to

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,680
ask a vendor that supports this software

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,040
or

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,839
another vendor that's willing to make

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,160
the change and either carry the patch

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,000
or get it merged into the project in

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,519
some reasonable time frame you know

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,959
obviously there are probably significant

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,399
costs to this

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,320
or you can make the change yourself and

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,560
carry the patch privately

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,600
so you have to ask yourself how urgent

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,079
is this

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,680
change to your organization is it a

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,480
security-based change is there risk

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,959
involved

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,480
um you know does it go beyond what the

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,800
community sees

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,959
you know the risk and what they're you

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,320
know working on in their vision

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,480
does this change give you a major

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,839
business advantage do you want to work

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,079
on this change in private

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,440
and make it something that you are going

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,000
to completely

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,040
um keep are you going to fork the

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,880
project internally

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,560
are you willing to maintain that fork

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,600
for you know some

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,800
time frame or are you going to back port

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,440
the patches

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,399
to the original upstream project as it

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,560
progresses

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,000
and have to maintain that testing and

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,040
those capabilities

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,720
you know release over release and has

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,880
maintaining this fork or carrying the

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,279
patches that whichever you choose

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,560
put your organization in a very risky

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,920
situation

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:34,399
are you allocating resources to this um

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,680
to this methodology or this development

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,880
capability

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:41,680
that if these resources were to leave um

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,480
you'd be in a severe disadvantage or

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,800
disabled state and you know does this

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:50,240
technical debt that you're accruing

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:52,720
grow year over year and compound

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,519
i'd see i've actually seen this play out

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,639
in

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,040
you know a few organizations so as a

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,000
real

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,440
world example there was a so open source

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,759
software project

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,720
called open efs that was based on open

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,959
afs

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,240
a few years back and it was a

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,319
distributed file system

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,439
created that created namespaces on top

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:15,520
of nfs shares or nashers

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,959
and it helped solve a problem with

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,439
software distribution

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,720
that wasn't available at the time there

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,000
were a few contributors but the

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,280
community was fairly

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,120
small and a lot of organizations

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,960
adopted it and would customize it on

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,039
their own

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,160
the community itself stopped getting

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,360
contributions about

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,720
six to eight years ago but this piece of

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,360
software

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,559
was still being utilized you know

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,960
extensively

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,000
throughout financial services firms in

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,120
wall street

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,080
so now as technology increased the it

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,880
was up to the

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,559
organizations to either up keep

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,919
continuously updating that software

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,960
without a community

00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,760
and keep those patches and and

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,559
accrue more technical debt or they

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,799
needed to

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,480
you know move off that sort of piece of

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,679
software and as we all know in the

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,200
software industry

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,880
if something's working people are

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,720
reluctant to make that change and

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,000
generally we we have a tendency to kick

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,280
the can down the road

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,559
and look at it at a later date so

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:21,440
you know the the lessons learned from

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:23,280
you know not being able to install this

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,559
software on later operating systems

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,799
because

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,320
uh the the supported libraries were no

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,240
longer available

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,360
or security vulnerabilities that weren't

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,720
being patched because there was no

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,640
community left

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,039
put a lot of these organizations in a

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,919
very expensive situation

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:41,120
five or six years down the road and you

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,559
know the thing that i want you to take

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,679
away from this is

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,919
you know either you're going to maintain

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,720
the project if the community isn't

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,280
robust and

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,919
and dies um or you're going to spend a

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,360
lot of

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:57,280
money customizing it and or getting

00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,160
someone to customize it for you

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,240
so isolation software development open

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:07,039
source software development in isolation

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,039
can get very expensive next slide

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,760
so when we're talking about some of the

00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,440
ways that open source co-creation

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,960
actually creates business value

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,559
i'm just going to go down down the list

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,640
of where we see value created

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,799
uh at red hat right these are these are

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,760
the reasons why we co-create open source

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,799
software

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,440
um and where we've seen um open source

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,200
co-creation

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,480
creating value for for our customers and

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,080
our colleagues right

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,600
um we've already talked about minimizing

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,919
technical debt thank you very much joe

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,600
for story time i always love story time

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,760
um this whole idea of you know

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,080
innovating to be able to to try new

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,600
things

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,960
custom and then customize them right

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,400
which you can't do with proprietary

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,760
software investments you can't extend

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,240
those things you can't

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,799
uh make the software do uh additional

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,919
things

00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,440
in order to meet your needs without

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,960
relying on someone else's release

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,400
schedule and timeline and

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,919
you know they may not even think that

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,840
the the feature that you're requesting

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,520
is particularly important to them

00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,880
um and then there's also this you know

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,320
dovetailing right win with that right

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,840
this idea of failing fast and

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,919
experimenting in order to

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,520
to create value quickly right being able

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,840
to quickly spin up a minimum viable

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,159
product and do some kind of

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,679
user acceptance testing to understand if

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,320
that software is actually

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,720
uh meeting folks's needs right i could

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,320
go

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,840
go through the list but obviously um you

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,799
know all of you folks can can read the

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,240
slide joe

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,679
are you seeing the same things in in

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,880
your discussions with customers in terms

00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,200
of why they think that coke

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,559
you know of our customers who are

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,799
engaged in the process of co-creating

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,240
are they seeing the same reasons for

00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,440
it adding value to their business or are

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,880
they seeing other areas where it's

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,000
helpful to them

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,320
yeah absolutely so you know when we were

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,679
talking about this uh the the agenda and

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,960
the talk i reached out to a number of

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,960
different customers

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,440
and um you know a few of them who

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,080
participate in open source communities

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,559
you know they they definitely confirmed

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,320
that

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,080
you know these these are valuable

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,480
benefits to their business

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,720
i mean higher quality software you know

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,960
bugs in production are expensive

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,880
um you know the the innovation the being

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,559
able to try things before

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,000
making a full-fledged financial

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,480
commitment to them

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,720
um you know technology-wise is was

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,200
really important to this organization so

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,559
you know again part of my job my the

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,080
great part of my job is really

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,280
interacting with so many different types

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,640
of customers

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:21,200
in the field and you know as talking to

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,159
one particular open source developer who

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,280
works in

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:27,280
you know a financial large bank

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,440
he confirmed that all of these are

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,360
benefits that his organization looks to

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,440
when developing open source software

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,400
security is a very big one and i'll hone

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,720
in on that a little bit

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,840
but you know again the more eyes that

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,640
that see it

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,280
you know it's open there's no surprises

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,240
um

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,039
they they feel that you know the the

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,600
risk is

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,280
much lower with open source software um

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,360
so what they did is they actually set up

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,440
an open source program office

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,679
the open source program office sets the

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,200
boundaries and the rules around

00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,520
all the different types of community

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,200
interaction in that this organization

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,559
and the developers in this organization

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,880
participate in

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:07,600
along with an approval process for

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,200
contributing open source software

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,039
this allowed them to really take

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,840
advantage and

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,120
make it a culture where it's permeated

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,080
throughout the organization and

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,960
encouraged

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,480
to contribute to open source software

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,679
once everybody was comfortable in this

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,520
organization

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,000
you know an open source you know

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,520
participation started to proliferate

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,200
they were able to move much faster and

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,440
deploy different platforms

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,760
without as large a capital investment

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,280
that they previously had

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,360
and then they were able to choose better

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,919
platforms for their business

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,960
they started contributing code enhancing

00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,039
those projects

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,559
and really making those projects even

00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,919
more and more beneficial to their

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,640
organization

00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,640
so next slide

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,880
so you know leslie worked works with the

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,520
finnos organization for quite some time

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,559
you know myself i'm i've worked with

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,799
finnos a little bit he

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,240
you know throughout the years but one of

00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:05,679
the great things about finnos is

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:08,240
um it's it's an incubator where

00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,400
organizations can help or donate open

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,240
source projects and work with finnos

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,080
for their open source strategy and over

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,280
the past couple of years

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,159
we've seen a few organizations listed

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,200
here

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:24,480
you know open which gave

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,799
and donated open source projects

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,919
to finnos and and just outside to the

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,480
community

00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,840
um that you know previously we would

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,480
have never seen before

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,600
so organizations like goldman and jpmc

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,039
and capital one

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:42,400
and deutsche bank have all open sourced

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:45,120
uh you know projects that they felt um

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,799
could benefit not only other people but

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,600
even themselves

00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,799
for this open innovation and co-creation

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,559
of software

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,840
so you know just going through the list

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,960
at a high level

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:59,840
you know an exam a great example of

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,320
the community building communities are

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,320
you know just the symphony community

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,840
and the contributions that it's had over

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,840
the past couple of years

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:12,960
and capital one's hygiena platform

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:15,039
uh which has really taken hold and has

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,960
established a really strong community

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,559
with contributions from a lot of

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,200
different organizations

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:22,960
so these organizations are starting to

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,159
really see the benefits of

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,480
participating co-creating and

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,200
open sourcing internal projects that

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,520
they feel

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,960
are widely used in the vertical and

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,559
industry

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,880
next slide very cool so

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,400
um if we have not uh done a good enough

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,919
job to convince you that

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,840
there are many benefits to community

00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,240
participation you can see several here

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,000
on screen but one of the the ones that i

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,559
tend to harp on

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,600
since i have a long time ago background

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,120
in human resources

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,360
is this concept of attracting and

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,440
retaining better talent

00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,039
i think it's no secret that it is

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,080
extremely difficult to come by

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,559
professionals who have

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,360
the the skill set that we require no

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,760
matter

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,720
where we're working uh in the technology

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,799
industry

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,640
and it's it's particularly important to

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:13,120
realize the degree to which

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,039
being able to participate in open source

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,120
software projects has become

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,159
a requirement of software development

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,240
professionals now

00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,000
um you know there's this this concept of

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,960
github is your resume

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,720
and for folks who are uh you know

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,080
focused on making sure that they stay at

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,440
the top of their craft the

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,039
the latest and greatest developments in

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,000
software are happening in open source

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,279
and people

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,720
want to have the opportunity to work

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,880
with technologies like for example

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,640
kubernetes or

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,480
um you know the latest and greatest uh

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,880
you know financial javascript framework

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,320
right

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,159
so they the idea that um you know there

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,919
there's a benefit to participating in

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,600
the community because it can help you to

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,919
find the talent that you need because

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,360
they're

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,600
participating in that community right

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,880
along with you or you're you're simply

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,200
able to make sure that your staff

00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,960
remains invested in working at your

00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,360
organization because they're able to

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,840
work

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,200
on the cool latest and greatest

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,679
technologies and not just

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,120
in um you know maintaining a back office

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,159
system where the lights need to be kept

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,799
on right

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,159
so you know again this idea that there's

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:15,279
there's so many

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:17,279
benefits to to participating uh in a

00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:19,039
community and we wanna we wanna spend

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,520
some time now um talking to a little bit

00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,200
about

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,360
about how you can do that in in ways

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,760
that make sense for your business

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,039
so we wanted to to start really with

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,799
with easy steps

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,080
that your organization can take to to

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,520
start co-creating with the open source

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,200
community right like we've we've

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,159
encouraged you to do it and we wanted to

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,320
give

00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,840
very clear very concrete steps that you

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,880
can take to actually begin participating

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,600
in ways that make sense for your

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,880
business

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,279
so you can see if you want to take it

00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:46,640
even further

00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:49,440
so step one uh is this idea of

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,840
kind of uh follow along and learn right

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,600
so

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,240
nominate someone from your organization

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,480
to to do some research on a particular

00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,640
open source project right and do that by

00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,400
um you know actively engaging by

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,080
listening right you don't have to

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,799
contribute code you don't have to ship a

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,559
feature

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:07,279
you can just kind of understand what's

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,159
going on right look at discussion forums

00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,799
check out what's going on with the

00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,400
project in social media see what's going

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,400
on on the project mailing list

00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,799
some projects have weekly or monthly

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,279
community calls where they talk about

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,880
all aspects of the project so the

00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,520
community calls sometimes take place

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,279
weekly

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,520
sometimes they take place bi-weekly

00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:27,200
sometimes they take place monthly

00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,360
there is typically an agenda published

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,880
in advance if you attend one of these

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,480
community calls you are

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,320
asked to at least introduce yourself and

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,360
let folks know what firm you're from

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,720
if you don't have anything else to

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,159
contribute during the community call

00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,840
that's perfectly fine it's

00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,240
absolutely acceptable to just listen and

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,480
learn and this is an opportunity

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,840
for someone from your organization to

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,240
learn more about what's going on in the

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:50,799
project in terms of technical direction

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,880
in terms of areas to contribute uh in

00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,880
terms of upcoming events which you may

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,840
want to sponsor or send folks to attend

00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,039
to learn more

00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:01,600
so again it's a very um

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,240
useful way to to literally have the

00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,960
opportunity

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,919
to just reach out and understand what

00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,840
the different participants in the

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:13,279
community are doing

00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:15,039
in a very low barrier to entry way

00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,480
of what is happening in that project

00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,399
community and that gives you a

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,200
a pretty good you know thumbs up thumbs

00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,880
down read on how healthy that project is

00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,559
which helps you for your future planning

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:28,720
and risk mitigation strategies

00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:31,200
so step two this is more the the

00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,960
medium-sized level of engagement right

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,799
um you can you can offer financial

00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,240
support to the open source projects that

00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,120
you utilize and this could come in the

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,880
form of

00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,039
sponsoring their user conference this

00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,039
could come in the form of an actual

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,679
uh donation to a software foundation in

00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:48,000
support of the project's development

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,760
you know it's if the easiest thing for

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,080
your organization to do is to write a

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,399
check

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,760
versus to donate employee time there are

00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,720
lots of organizations who are in that

00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,480
position

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,480
open source projects absolutely welcome

00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,399
financial support for their efforts

00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,840
um and you can also look at providing

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:03,440
in-kind donations for open source

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:07,039
software projects as well and these

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,799
can include things that are um

00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,159
you know that may not readily spring to

00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:13,360
mind but for example i know

00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,399
i believe cisco offers webex free webex

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,840
accounts to

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:18,559
um open source projects and other

00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,120
non-profits um some projects are looking

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,600
for

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,520
you know things like uh you know

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,520
computing resources or server space to

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:28,000
host their mailing lists um

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,559
some organizations are looking at things

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,640
like

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,760
uh you know software license seats that

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,240
may be possible because

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,080
your company produces that software so

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,559
um you know providing in-kind donations

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,120
is a

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,000
is again it's a low-cost and low

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,840
commitment way to

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,919
support the projects that are making the

00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,080
software that your business depends upon

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,600
and where you can if you have human

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,399
resources to spare

00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,039
uh it's great to donate the time of your

00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,960
employees

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,120
who are working on you know non-software

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,720
development aspects of the project

00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,159
every open source project needs help

00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,159
with documentation

00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,440
many projects need help with marketing

00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,120
so that more folks are aware of that

00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,000
project and their capabilities

00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,360
lots of projects are doing various user

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,360
events and they're looking for

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,279
folks who can help them you know set up

00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,360
a virtual event or

00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,559
find the right speaker to to address

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,399
their user group right

00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:18,000
those are all ways in which your

00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,200
organization can contribute to the

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
health and success of an open source

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,520
software project

00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,279
but again has nothing to do with

00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,640
contributing code or opening up your

00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,640
business to any sort of risk that's

00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,640
associated with software development and

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,399
uh taking that software outside of your

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,880
firewall

00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:36,000
uh and then the the advanced the

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,200
advanced level right is is actually

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,120
asking your software developers to

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,640
engage directly with the project and

00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,320
there are any number of ways to do this

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,440
and it's it's very useful to make sure

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,320
that you have

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,080
an organization within your company such

00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,559
as an open source program office

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,159
or an institutional review board who

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,640
makes sure that there are

00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,320
very clear rules of engagement for your

00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,960
organization as you start contributing

00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,240
software

00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:03,360
to uh external open source projects

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:05,440
uh and it's also um

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,960
you know it make it very clear how you

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,399
expect your developers to engage but at

00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,159
that point you know let them go and

00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:12,000
just do something that might be fun

00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,840
right lots of open source software

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,320
projects will label

00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,720
uh issues in their issue tracker with uh

00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:22,399
things like newcomer or getting started

00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,159
or or welcome tasks that are just

00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:25,519
to get people used to the process of

00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,720
contributing to the project so they

00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,080
understand

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,840
for example how to properly use the

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,600
style guide or

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,600
you know what does an appropriate commit

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,440
message look like for the project

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,120
and give your developers the opportunity

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,440
to go and do a few small fixes see if

00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,519
they

00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,799
like working and uh working in that

00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,480
project community see if they feel like

00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,640
they're deriving benefit from it

00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,000
and if everything is is going well after

00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,320
you've taken these these

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,200
first few steps you can start looking at

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,880
contributing

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,320
uh you know on a wider basis maybe an

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,080
entire new feature maybe

00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,399
uh resolving some outstanding issues

00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,679
that are also plaguing your organization

00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:59,039
and that you fixed internally and you

00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,840
want to contribute that change back

00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,840
stream right

00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:07,919
so to conclude um we wanted to

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,600
to share some resources with you folks

00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,880
if you wanted to to learn more about the

00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,679
subjects that we've been talking about

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,880
and just uh

00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,320
you know we wanted to be really clear

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,039
that these are things we regularly use

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,440
ourselves

00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,120
so we hope you will also find great

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,799
benefit in them

00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,399
so i cannot say enough good things about

00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,880
the phenos open source readiness working

00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,399
group

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,240
i'm a regular participant whatever my

00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,080
schedule permits and

00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,679
the finance open source working group is

00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,960
a practitioner-led

00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:35,840
group of folks who are all members of um

00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:38,559
finos member companies and they are

00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,000
sharing best practices and tools to help

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,080
their fellow colleagues and financial

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,399
services be able to successfully engage

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,760
on their open source journey we there's

00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,840
typically a weekly speaker

00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,519
we've had folks talking about subjects

00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,240
everything from

00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:54,000
you know open source licensing protocols

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,200
open data licensing we've had

00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,039
discussions about

00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,640
how to create training programs for your

00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:00,240
employees so that they successfully

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,159
contribute to open source in a way that

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,000
isn't keeping with the company's

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,559
uh open source program office or

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,480
institutional review board's rules

00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,080
so it's it's really a great opportunity

00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,279
for you to come and either share your

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,840
wisdom

00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:15,279
or ask your questions or do both from

00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,679
folks who are

00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:18,399
also experiencing the same set of of

00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,080
challenges

00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:22,080
and opportunities for success that you

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,440
are so if you're able to attend

00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,799
highly recommend at the very least

00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,120
subscribe to the mailing list so that

00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,559
you

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,320
understand what sessions are coming up

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,640
and potentially can watch uh recordings

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,080
or

00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,120
later write-ups another area where i

00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,320
have found

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,240
great values within the open

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:39,840
organization community this

00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,200
is a global community of individuals who

00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,960
come together again to share best

00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,159
practices and principles around

00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,320
understanding how we can change notions

00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,960
of how we work together

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,000
how we manage our teams how we function

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,039
as individuals who are

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,799
leading projects and to move beyond the

00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:58,399
idea of sort of traditional hierarchical

00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:59,840
models into

00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,760
doing things more the open source way

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,320
where there is uh

00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,559
an openness to new ideas where there is

00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,720
an ability to

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,240
share wisdom even if it comes from our

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,919
competitors right and to

00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,079
to be able to build something that is of

00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:15,839
mutual benefit and value for all

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,760
um and this organiza this open

00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:20,159
organization community focuses on

00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,720
principles of transparency collaboration

00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,960
community inclusivity adaptability

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,839
all of the the people processes that we

00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,000
need

00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,200
in order to achieve open innovation

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,040
right it's not just about

00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,159
tools it's about the individuals who are

00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,040
using those tools and how they're

00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,960
working together

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:38,560
to achieve new ways to create value

00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,320
last but not least if you're looking for

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,079
a quick write-up on the business value

00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,440
of open source software for financial

00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,200
services firms

00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,040
look no further than our fine friends at

00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,599
finos who have offered a white paper on

00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,399
that very same topic

00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,520
this white paper it runs the gamut of

00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,879
discussing

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,560
topics that are relevant to financial

00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,880
services firms everything from how to

00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,960
perform effective risk mitigation when

00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,400
using open source software solutions

00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,240
risk mitigation when contributing to

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,200
open source software projects

00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,400
using your uh energies in the open

00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,280
source world as a recruiting and

00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,880
retention tool

00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:16,480
so it's uh very useful it's a quick read

00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,920
and uh it's uh

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,839
basically brought to you again by

00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,960
practitioners within the the finos

00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,960
member community

00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,160
um full disclosure yours truly is one of

00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,160
the authors so of course i'm going to

00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:29,119
say that this white paper is great

00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,000
um and then last but not least um i

00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,400
thought really long and hard

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,920
about including these uh these resources

00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,359
because they are

00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,720
very much directly from red hat um and i

00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,160
cannot stand the number of conference

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,200
presentations that i've gone to where i

00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,400
have gotten sales pitches because it

00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,680
really annoys me

00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,800
but i did decide to leave them in

00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:49,520
because these are all um resources that

00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:52,079
either i have um directly participated

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,839
in or have had the opportunity to

00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,119
to benefit from so i'm going to share my

00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,760
own experience and hopefully you will

00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,119
also

00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,440
find significant value in what i'm
