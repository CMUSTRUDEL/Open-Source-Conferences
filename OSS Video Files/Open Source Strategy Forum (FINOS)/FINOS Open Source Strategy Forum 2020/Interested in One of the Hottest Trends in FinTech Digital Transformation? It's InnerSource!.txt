hello there

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,400
my name is denise cooper and i'm here

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,639
today to talk to you about

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,719
inner source this isn't the first time

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,400
i've talked about inner source at ossf

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,800
in fact one of my very first dinner

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,320
source speeches was done at the first

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,039
ossf

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,760
but this is becoming a very hot trend

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,320
among

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,760
the fintech people and so we have some

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,760
things to tell you about that

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,760
and hopefully will pique your interest

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,520
if you've never heard of this before or

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,120
if you've been on the fence maybe we'll

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,760
convince you so let's get started

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,160
first of all in its simplest form inner

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,480
source

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,760
is just the use of open source methods

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,360
inside

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,559
firewalls to fix engineering problems

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,760
that may have crept in

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,600
over years of practice it doesn't mean

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,000
that your code will eventually be open

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,239
source

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,280
although a lot of people that undertake

00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,680
this work

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,480
that have things that need to be fixed

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,120
in their

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,280
engineering practice are also trying to

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,600
figure out how to get to open source

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,520
and that is the reason that i initially

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,960
instituted this at paypal because they

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,040
were in that situation

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,240
they very much wanted to do open source

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,439
but they didn't really

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,040
understand how and they likewise had

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,640
very little collaboration across the

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,600
company and that was a goal

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,320
internally so we used inner source to

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,799
build that

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,400
internal collaboration and it yielded

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,200
more understanding of how to do open

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,520
source

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,079
um this picture is tim o'reilly and he

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,320
actually coined this term in 2000

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,920
so this is not a new idea but it took a

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,880
while for it to actually

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,840
land as an idea that could be actionably

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,920
implemented

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,040
and that's because it took a while for

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,520
open source

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,200
to win in the market and i don't know if

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,799
you guys remember but you know

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,439
20 years ago 15 years ago there was not

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,360
a lot of

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,479
certainty that open source was actually

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,719
going to prevail

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,240
there were a lot of very deep pockets

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,079
pushing against it

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,079
and a lot of people didn't think that it

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:07,680
could possibly survive

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:10,800
and then we won so

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,920
five years ago it was clear to everyone

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,879
that open source had won in its goal

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,239
of becoming absolutely essential to the

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,160
tech industry

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,280
uh there were had been lots of successes

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,160
along the way but

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,319
about five years ago we started hearing

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,840
some very conservative sources saying

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,840
that open source was the way to go

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,200
including microsoft which was of course

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,840
the big shift

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,360
and that paved the way for intersource

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,519
to really do well

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,440
inside of companies that had not yet

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,879
achieved understanding of how to do

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,720
proper open source

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,440
and the reason that it worked so well

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,640
with what the change was

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,440
was before open source one it was really

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,000
easy for middle managers to block

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,599
inner source by saying yeah well that

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,840
open source thing is a croc

00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,760
it's never going to happen but now they

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,879
can't it's well understood that it's a

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,480
more efficient way

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:08,080
in some important vectors to

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,760
get your engineering cleared up so

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,519
that's why i started talking about it at

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,239
paypal

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,720
and now i can't go forward anywhere

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,720
there we go

00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,239
um so my motivation

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,280
for getting interested in inner source

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,680
again

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,360
was that i've had a long and successful

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,000
career in open source

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,680
but i still think that five or ten

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,400
percent of the total engineering

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,560
workforce

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,319
is allowed to work in the open source

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,000
way even though we know it's more

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,599
efficient even though there's lots of

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,120
evidence that says that more people

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,680
should work that way

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,640
and so i think of those poor 85 percent

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,280
of the engineers

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,200
as still being stuck in the salt lines

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,720
and i feel like we should

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,799
work as an industry to upgrade our skill

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,640
sets for across all of our engineers

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,000
all if only so that we have a wider

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,120
workflow that we can

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,720
uh workforce that we can hire into

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,760
it it's uh it's just so much nicer to

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,319
work this way

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,799
but it's also faster and better and

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,799
better for the company and it buys you

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,519
out of a lot of technical debt

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,799
alleys that people fall into so for

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,280
instance

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:22,639
silos raise your hands if you have a

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:25,440
silo in your company i'm sure you all do

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,160
so the problem is that at some point

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,639
ownership

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,240
excessive ownership culture feels like a

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,080
good idea

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,759
and the reason it feels like a good idea

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,320
is because it creates some

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:39,360
pride in that work it rewards people

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:43,040
without giving them a lot more money

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:46,240
it it does a lot of good things

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,919
right up until they become a cult and

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,680
they're not sharing information with the

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,280
outside world anymore because they think

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,280
they've got job security

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,360
or they're so overworked that they don't

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,720
have any time to do that which is also

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,600
very common

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,800
and there's technical debt that has

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,120
entered into the picture

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,720
and they are loath to clear it out

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,160
because they understand how everything

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,880
works and they don't have

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,680
time or the heart to destabilize it

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,280
enough to

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,360
say cut it up in institute microservices

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,280
um in some of the companies that i've

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,720
worked with all of those initiatives

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,960
have been tried

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,720
as individual initiatives usually as

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,160
part of a digital transformation

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,919
around something like agile or

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,720
microservices and

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,440
the engineers just they they can't

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,160
decide

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,639
how to do it um document sprints are

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,560
also

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,680
something that i've seen fail in these

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,600
organizations

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,840
where there's a lot of siloing because

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,080
they they haven't had to explain it to

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,000
anybody that wasn't one of them

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,280
like new employees they probably have a

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,560
process for doing that

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,759
but it probably over a period of many

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,720
weeks

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,560
as circumstances arise where that person

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,120
has to be told another piece of

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,000
puzzle it's not a comprehensive this is

00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,360
how it works

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,440
and it's straightforward and

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,960
self-evident from the architecture

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,000
which is what you're supposed to get out

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:09,759
of microservices so in this picture

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,039
that amount of craft is um

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,840
represented by the rust on the silos

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,240
right

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,479
and so inner source one of the main

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,800
reason that inner source gets adopted

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,919
these days is by companies that have

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,000
excessive

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,240
ownership culture and are having trouble

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,160
with it either they can't get

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,319
the top people in the company to share

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,639
what they know effectively

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,520
or there is no cross-company

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,240
collaboration

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,960
or they've got that you know cruft code

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,280
that the

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,800
silo people can't clear out because they

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,440
can't distinguish between

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,919
the craft and the normal stuff or

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,560
there's a lot of executive escalation

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,080
going into how how decisions are made

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,880
about what to do

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,319
the first project that we did at paypal

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,880
which is written up in a book called

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,919
getting started with inner source

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,319
that was a very important pivotal piece

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,360
of

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,759
code it was the checkout stack and 90

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,199
of paypal's business was touched by that

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,560
checkout stack

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,199
and the manager that took on intersource

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,880
as a

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:17,599
change idea was so tired of

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,080
the fact that they would plan a sprint

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,639
of work

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,919
two weeks of work every single time they

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,680
were supposed to

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,000
and they'd never get through it because

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,919
65 percent of their time was being spent

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,720
on executive escalation

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,400
you know where the one executive calls

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,880
the other one and says why isn't

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,880
my feature happening yet and they they

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,479
barter or they or they intimidate each

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,360
other whatever it is that happens but

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,680
eventually

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,319
a directive comes down to the silo

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,400
saying drop everything and do this thing

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,919
they were giving 65 of that and they

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,960
would have done almost anything to get

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,280
out of it

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,360
so there's lots of reasons why silos are

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,120
something that you want to bust if you

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,280
can

00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,199
another reason and this is sort of a

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,120
consequence of silos although that's not

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,240
the only way you can have this problem

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,240
is bottlenecks complexity and

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,520
bottlenecks that make it hard for people

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,039
to get stuff done

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,120
because they have to wait through a

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,000
traffic jam or they have to wait on a

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,160
feature request

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,160
until a silo gets around to prioritizing

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,599
it or until somebody's boss calls

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,599
somebody's boss which we've already

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,639
identified as an anti-pattern but

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,919
it still happens a lot so clearing up

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,000
bottlenecks so that

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,639
everything can flow more freely you get

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,400
better utilization of your resources

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,440
because everybody can stay busy because

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,320
nobody's sitting around

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,760
waiting is another main reason why

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,599
innersource is attractive

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,039
to all companies not just fintech

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,440
companies

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,479
and then there are some companies that

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,040
have shown

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,640
and proven to themselves and to us that

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,920
inner source can be effective

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,560
to create opportunities for innovation

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,880
so the reason this picture is is of the

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,800
chinese army doing a formal drill is

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,120
because there are companies

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,080
where most of the engineers follow the

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,160
rules

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,920
even especially really large companies

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,519
where there are lots of engineers it's

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,240
really common for the bulk of the

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,800
engineers to be pretty good citizens

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,680
because they've been rewarded for

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,560
playing the game

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,040
as scripted but they get stuck and they

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,760
can't

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,080
they can't step out of that line in

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,839
order to innovate it's too scary

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,680
and there are some companies that have

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,959
figured out that inner source can break

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,320
up that pattern

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:30,160
um and i would name drop a couple of

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,480
them but i don't want to embarrass them

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,480
and

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,920
there is writing about this the last

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,360
book that i did is called

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,839
adopting inner source and it's got a

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,839
fair amount of information about how

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,680
that works

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,160
and then one that people don't think

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,680
about very often but it's a real thing

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,440
if you think about it the people that

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,040
you're going to be able to hire in

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,040
another five years

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,160
are all going to be people who are

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,360
digital natives

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,360
they've grown up with open source as

00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,080
a normal course of business they

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,240
understand that they want transparency

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,600
they understand that as individuals they

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,440
want agency

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,200
probably more agency than most

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,519
traditional engineering organizations

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,399
are prepared to give them

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,480
and this inner source as a method to

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,320
work inside companies is going to become

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,480
a recruiting tool we're already seeing

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,240
it in some places

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,480
when everybody wanted to work for google

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,959
partly it was because they worked this

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,920
way

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,800
when they started out so this is going

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,200
to be a thing

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,920
and if you think it's expensive to

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,800
recruit

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,160
and then lose your new recruits because

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,240
they think nothing of

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,519
changing jobs on a dime if they see

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,839
something better

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,079
um you know that's going to be an

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:46,000
expense and a problem going forward for

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:48,800
companies that haven't ingested this

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,120
and then of course there are companies

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,040
that go out and get github enterprise

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,560
which is a fine tool we're very happy

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,640
that it exists

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,680
but they think that they they don't even

00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,839
maybe realize

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,240
that they want the inner source effect

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:05,920
that's why they went and did it

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,160
and it turns out that that github alone

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,360
is insufficient to get the inner source

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,519
effect to happen

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,880
there are few reasons why that's true

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,480
some of it is there's a little bit of

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,959
tooling missing and we'll talk more

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,519
about that

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,720
in subsequent slides um they're working

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,320
on some of that and we

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,160
spent a lot of time talking to them

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,399
about these missing pieces but the

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,120
other bit is most companies that go get

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,279
github

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,040
are not actually comfortable with all

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,000
the code being available to all the

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,160
people

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,279
and the most common scenario is whatever

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,880
you had before

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:40,720
be it clearcase or some something else

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,079
the people that implement github will

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,640
put in all those same

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,839
walls between departments or divisions

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,839
or areas

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,360
thinking that if those existed before

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,440
they must be there for a reason so we

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,079
better maintain them

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,560
inner source requires that everybody be

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,440
able to read all the code or almost all

00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,519
the code

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,200
i mean there are examples of things that

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,600
you don't host

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,720
wikipedia hosts literally every line of

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,920
code except

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,399
the admin keys there's always something

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,360
but if you're finding that most of your

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,279
code is still

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,880
fenced then you're not going to get the

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,519
inner source effect you might get it

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,760
between

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,680
division or within a division but you

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,600
won't get it across the company

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,279
and if cross company knowledge full

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,480
stack knowledge is something that you

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,320
need and

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,760
you do whether you understand that you

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:32,320
need it or not you definitely need it

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,639
this will be difficult to achieve even

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,000
with a great tool like github without

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,480
some understanding some force applied

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,279
to making sure that it happens and

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,200
definitely

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:46,560
more transparency than you're probably

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,560
automatically comfortable with

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,399
so welcome to inner source this is the

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,200
inner source logo

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,839
notice that it both connotes an eye for

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,680
inner source

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,760
and like maybe there's a party going on

00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,720
in that room that's because it's

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,040
really fun to do inner source just like

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,680
it's really fun to do open source

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,440
the idea that an engineer could send a

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,399
pull request instead of a feature

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,839
request

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:13,760
read somebody else's code figure out

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,720
what they need to get done and express

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,120
that in code

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,200
and then learn through an interaction

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,079
with a trusted committer on the silo

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,320
side

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,279
what they haven't done properly how they

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,560
could change it

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,959
so that it will be mergeable they they

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,360
gain

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,320
knowledge they get their thing done

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,399
faster

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,760
and they have more influence about how

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,959
it turns out

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,480
but also they get to take their career

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,120
into their own hands a little bit

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,880
because

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,480
if they're clever and they're able to

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,120
learn this stuff

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,680
becoming a person who is well known for

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,360
having

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,839
broader knowledge of how everything

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,480
works automatically makes you more

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,000
valuable and it's more valuable to the

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,360
organization to figure out who those

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,600
people are

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,360
so inner sources is a virtuous circle

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,480
that can really help everybody and as

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,399
i've said before

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,680
at the end of the day it can also help

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,560
you understand

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,760
how or come to understand about how to

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,320
actually behave

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,639
in an open source context if you have

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,560
concerns that your brand is at risk

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,040
because you're going to get it wrong

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,920
before you get it right why not get it

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,160
wrong first inside the company

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,639
figure out how to collaborate properly

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,279
and then come outside and try to do it

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,560
there are many companies not so much in

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,320
fintech but it's starting to be

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,120
something that happens in fintech

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,959
that require open source projects where

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,720
you're going to be opening new code for

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,839
the first time that you've developed

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,639
inside

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,760
they require them to develop an inner

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,000
source following

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,959
for that code before they allow them to

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,720
open source it

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,079
to see that they know how to build

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,440
community with people who aren't

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,720
themselves

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,680
right all right

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,320
so inner source is an all boats will

00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,120
rise

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,800
kind of experience inside your company

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,519
but it's also part of a larger

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,959
experience

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:07,279
of the open source effect which is where

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,680
there are unintended consequences coming

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,600
out of the connections that are made

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,079
so some of those consequences that

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,959
happened in our original project at

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,800
paypal

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,480
the one i talked about that was the

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,199
checkout stack

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,560
their original goal was to cut down on

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,639
the amount of

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,000
escalation work that they were getting

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,959
that was keeping them from doing their

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,160
planned work but they got some stuff for

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,800
free

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,560
one of the things they got the first day

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,480
the guy that as i was explaining to the

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,440
manager how it was all going to work

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,800
and i did a version of this talk but

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,000
with a whiteboard where i drew some

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,399
pictures too

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,360
he ingested it very quickly surprisingly

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,560
quickly

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,320
and he turned to me and said okay so you

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,880
want me to put a trusted committer in

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,240
place

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,920
as a gatekeeper for pull requests that

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,279
are coming from people that don't work

00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,120
on my team

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,880
and i understand why you want me to do

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,959
that but you want me to give that person

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,959
only that job for the duration of a

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,320
sprint and that person is going to be

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,399
pretty bored

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,000
unless some pull requests come in from

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,600
the outside it's going to take a while

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,759
to create that engine

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,759
so in the meantime can i just send all

00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,639
of my own team's pull requests through

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,639
that person

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,240
to kind of rehearse them on the code

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,240
review thing and i said

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,000
yeah of course you can do that and then

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,320
he sighed this big sigh

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,759
like huge relief and i said okay what's

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,959
going on over there

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:33,120
and he said we hire engineers

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,680
and we give them commit access because

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:39,199
we've hired them to be engineers

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:41,120
but it's not always a good idea even the

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,399
we know they're new some of them some of

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,720
them are really senior

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:47,120
we hire them away from other groups in

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,959
all cases they get commit access

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,240
and then we say we're going to do code

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,240
review but we don't

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,600
really do it because velocity and the

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,560
imperative for velocity

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,399
always gets in the way people rubber

00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,759
stamp each other you know friends rubber

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,680
stamp each other's code

00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,959
the more senior you you are the more

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,559
likely it is that you're never going to

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,600
get a real code reading

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,439
but if i can make them do it but

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,720
through this means of training this

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,199
person up

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,880
i'm going to definitely have better

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,280
quality coming out of that

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,000
now at paypal they know exactly how much

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,799
quality costs because there's this

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,360
they pay for a lost opportunity cost

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,039
when

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,480
the system is down and merchants are

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,640
unable to

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,960
complete business because paypal isn't

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,039
working so they know exactly how much it

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,240
costs anytime that happens

00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:38,640
and he knew what his number was

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,600
and the amazing thing was that he got a

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,559
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,880
bump in quality just in that first week

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,679
and

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,679
and that persisted because real code

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,960
review was suddenly happening

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,320
so that alone was a huge help but then

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,160
the other thing that happened that was

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,360
interesting was as the trusted

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,520
committers and we

00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,400
suggest cycling through your engineering

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,160
resources

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:04,559
he had 35 employees and he put

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,440
the the most senior of his employees

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,760
into a pool

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,440
and every sprint the trusted committer

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,640
changed so they'd work for two weeks as

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,080
a trusted committer and then they go

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,080
back to coding

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,480
until it was their turn again and they

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,960
you do that because people who have been

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,520
their whole career evaluated on how they

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,280
code

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,720
and they've gotten to top coder they

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,080
don't want to stop coding they're afraid

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,679
to because

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,960
yeah this is the whole dilemma of do i

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,799
want to be a manager and do i want to

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,840
keep coding they've gotten pretty good

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:33,039
at it they like it

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:35,919
they don't want to give that up so um

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:38,000
so he was doing a rotation right but

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,919
after a couple of rotations

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,440
they started realizing that maybe some

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,520
of those people that they thought were

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,039
lesser engineers because they worked on

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,640
the edges or they were

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,720
they were working on localization or

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,320
they were working on front-end stuff

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,080
maybe they were better engineers than

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,000
they thought they were they found

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,200
several people that they really thought

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,760
were very good

00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,400
some of them became so adept at writing

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:03,120
code against this silo that was not

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,799
really theirs that they became trusted

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,880
committers in their own right

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,640
and so they had an opportunity to spread

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,640
that work across

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,760
this community they were building around

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,600
their code

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,600
they also found people that they wanted

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,120
to hire away from other groups so that's

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,679
one of the things that happens it's an

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,679
unintended

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,919
consequence but it isn't necessarily a

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,520
bad thing because it helps with

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,200
that problem of needing to build full

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,559
stack developers

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:31,440
okay so

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,840
transparency is a non-negotiable part of

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,919
both

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,360
open source and inner source and at

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,919
first it's going to feel

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,840
really uncomfortable especially for you

00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,600
guys and i have a slide later to talk

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,000
about regulated industries

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,120
and how that all works but i want to say

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,039
initially that's

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,280
the fintech companies that have been

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,919
talking to us and we have quite a few of

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,640
them that

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,600
have come and spoken at our events for

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,520
the broader

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,000
community have said that it was

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,760
surprisingly natural once they made a

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,159
commitment to inner source

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,200
to become more transparent at least

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,080
within

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,320
likely pairings of of people you know

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,480
and when i say pairings we talk about

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,600
a host being the people that own the

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,120
silo and

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,120
guests being the people that are going

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,320
to be contributing into that silo

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,080
and finding pairs where both sides are

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,840
motivated to get it right

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,840
at least initially as you're doing your

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,720
first experiments that's a really good

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,400
idea because you don't have any problem

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,320
you know making the code transparent

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,840
between those two sides

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,320
i will tell you that i've talked to a

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,799
fair number of companies as a consultant

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,480
where some part of the stack is pretty

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,360
sure that they're the secret sauce of

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,440
the company

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,520
and therefore they need to stay secret

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,960
because the company doesn't trust its

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,440
employees not to

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,080
inappropriately share that information

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,159
but when

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,080
we actually have gone in and looked and

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,240
done a code review the truth is that

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,360
code is pretty crafty and not very well

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,280
maintained

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,799
and they don't want it to be public for

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,200
that reason not even public

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,400
inside the company so that's not a good

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,559
reason to keep it

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,159
private right and it is a reason to

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,080
clean it up before you open it

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,200
so you don't cause problems for those

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,640
those engineers

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,480
because there's lots of extenuating

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,840
reasons why that happens like

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,480
under staffing and too much workload or

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,159
um

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:22,000
you know change of uh employee base and

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,840
and not enough knowledge transfers so

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,720
people will rewrite and leave the craft

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,000
sitting there

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,520
because they don't know what what's

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,799
going to happen if it goes away there's

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,880
lots of reasons why this happens but

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,559
the reasons why people push back on

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,679
transparency should be carefully

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,320
examined

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,039
because they are not always apparently

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,200
as

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,720
presented if not everything that gets

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,679
written should be considered secret

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,039
sauce

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:49,600
and if if obscurity is the only way that

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:52,960
you can keep your employees from

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,159
um knowing the full stack i mean

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,080
that's not what you're trying to do

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,480
you're keeping you're keeping secrets

00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,080
safe

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,159
i'm here to tell you that security

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,440
through obscurity is actually

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,400
not a real thing anymore most malicious

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,720
code is written

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,440
by or insertions of malicious code

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,679
happen

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,559
through disgruntled employees and

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,400
whatever

00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,640
checks and balances system you have in

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,000
place now is not as good

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:21,120
as a guy who is senior reviewing

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,039
foreign merges or all the merges ideally

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,720
and really reviewing them because it's

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,840
on him if something

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:32,159
gets through that shouldn't be there so

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,200
all right i have been thinking a lot

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,880
about the future

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,880
and i already showed you a slide with

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:40,400
the next workforce

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,960
this is the one after that these guys

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,679
are

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,280
are going to be interested in a level of

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,280
collaboration that

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,559
you've seen if you have kids they want

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,880
to help each other

00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,679
my kids got in trouble for helping that

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,720
they reverse

00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,600
cheated the smart kids were helping the

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,280
slower kids

00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,640
get better grades because they couldn't

00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,000
stand to see their

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,919
little hearts break right and it's it'll

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,120
make you uncomfortable if you are a

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,960
lawyer or a doctor

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,559
from one of those professions where

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,280
being at the top of your class is really

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,760
important

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,520
but the truth is most work in the world

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,679
isn't like that

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,080
most working in the world this is the

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:20,799
most valuable thing that you can teach

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,480
and it's not easily learned so inner

00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,799
source will be a way to teach it to the

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,559
adults that you have around you now

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,640
but i invite you to think about other

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:31,200
ways that inner source can be useful

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,039
one of the famous stories from paypal is

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,880
we you guys have probably seen stories

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,440
about the silicon valley buses

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,799
and how silicon valley companies that

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,200
are physically located

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,720
down in the valley found that their cool

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,799
employees all wanted to live in san

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,919
francisco which is 45 minutes away on a

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:49,520
good day

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:51,600
so they started running buses big buses

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,559
like the tour buses in ireland you know

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,720
with a big window

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,679
big mirrors facing back that look like

00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,799
arms

00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,760
um so 75 people at a time bust between

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,360
san francisco

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,600
and their silicon valley office and then

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:06,640
physically bust back at night

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,400
with wi-fi on the bus and music and you

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,919
could start working as soon as you sat

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,039
down because you could log in

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,039
right but

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,919
that process of getting people on the

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,279
bus was administered by admins who were

00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,279
down in silicon valley

00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,320
and had not spent much time up in san

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,480
francisco

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,600
and so the bus schedules were wrong just

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,440
flat out wrong

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,640
they didn't know how to say exactly

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,880
where the

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,799
bus was going to stop you know they

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,400
didn't they there were lots of things

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:37,600
they didn't understand

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,440
so intersourcing the bus schedule so

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,159
that people could make their own pull

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,840
requests

00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,720
against the bus schedule turned out to

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,480
be really really a good idea because it

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,279
got the idea across

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,679
to non-coders to the marketing people

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,400
about

00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,960
why it was important and you might think

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,400
about

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,880
ways to touch your culture with inner

00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,440
source that are not the standard ways

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,880
and think as well about you know like

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,799
bring your kid to work day

00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,320
think about inoculating them with some

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,640
sharing ideas and

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,159
the extent to which that is a valued

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,760
skill in your company because we've got

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,480
to do something about the education

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,400
system

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,120
and getting getting this to be a more

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,120
common thing to know

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,600
because at the end of the day open

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:25,200
source is people

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:27,120
this is uh people at a drupal con

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,200
this is a normal open source conference

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,960
and this is just a tiny piece of that

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,039
large audience

00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,799
i used to show pictures of the various

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,720
years of drupal because it started out

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,559
with like 10 people

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,799
apaches like this too started out with

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,080
13 people and then all of a sudden there

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:45,120
were a few thousand

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,840
ten thousand twenty five thousand right

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,679
this is the open source effect so the

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,080
reason that you want to think about

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,640
those

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,799
sort of rules of kindergarten and with

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,279
the implications of transparency and

00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,400
also

00:25:55,279 --> 00:26:00,159
celebrating wins celebrating people for

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,360
their wins the same way that

00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,080
happens in kindergarten is because that

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,240
is how

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,640
you build the stickiness that makes

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,880
people want to keep doing the thing

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,240
if you just blitz them with it as a

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,840
campaign the way

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:18,240
that you do in um well so many

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,520
failed transformation campaigns in

00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,600
corporations you know

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,120
if your employees roll their eyes when

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,120
you throw out that first

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,559
announcement from the cto that this is a

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,919
new thing we're going to try

00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,200
that tells you that you've already kind

00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,279
of burnt those bridges you're going to

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,880
have to find another way to do it

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,919
one of the things that we heard in the

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,919
recent fintech

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,600
session that we did at inner source

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,120
summit was

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,720
just admit to yourself this is a

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,240
multi-year commitment

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,240
i'm not going to tell you this is going

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,960
to immediately change everything in your

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,440
company

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,360
it takes a while to get this right but

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,120
you need to do it for the same reason

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,080
that you need to clean the crust out

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,840
of your the back of your fridge or they

00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,440
frankly your code base or the way that

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,640
you do things right

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,880
so remember that the people aspect

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,480
cannot be underestimated in this you

00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,480
have to come up with both

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,679
intrinsic and extrinsic rewards that

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,440
make this work

00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,880
we talk about this endlessly at inner

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,320
source summit we've

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,400
and inner source commons we've got a

00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,279
whole bunch of patterns where

00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,760
different kinds of extrinsic rewards

00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,159
have been

00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,840
introduced we tell people not to get

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:27,120
attached to

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,559
measuring immediately do not apply okrs

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,880
to this at first

00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,880
do experiments first do a cultural

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,159
inventory try to figure out what's going

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,760
on in your culture why

00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:39,360
isn't this happening without you

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:42,320
intervening and then secondly

00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,640
do some little experiments that will

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,480
validate your hypothesis about why it's

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,000
not happening and what dials you have

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,880
available to turn

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,320
and remember that helping people feel

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,480
like they've done a good thing

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,159
overcoming their natural reticence or

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,480
abhorrence of change

00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:01,039
is also on your plate in doing this kind

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:05,039
of a transformation

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:07,520
okay here's that regulation slide so

00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:09,440
we talked we had a panel with seven

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,919
members of the fintech community

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,120
talking about their recent intersource

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,840
experiences

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,840
and how it went for them and we got some

00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,480
really surprising quotes which i'm just

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:23,840
going to tell you about

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:27,520
so the advice that you focus

00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:30,640
on celebrating the culture focus on your

00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:33,039
your extrinsic rewards on celebration

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,640
right and remember that again this is

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,640
going to take some time

00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,559
but there are some things you can do i

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,880
would i was going to say to gamify it

00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,919
but

00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,200
it's not that trivial it's it's about

00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,039
motivation

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,480
so there's several companies that we

00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:49,600
heard from who used

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,919
the idea of a marketplace that showed

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,200
where a given person could could

00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,919
contribute

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,000
now it's easy to understand why the

00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:01,520
guests want to contribute to the host

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,399
stack it's harder to see why the hosts

00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:06,000
would ever look outside of their silo to

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,600
do some contributing and yet they're

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,720
some of the most senior engineers in the

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,520
company usually

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,960
so you want them to do that how can you

00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,240
make them do that

00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:19,520
well at paypal we had a disused fellow

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,200
track and we got the idea from some of

00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,360
these senior engineers that if we can

00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,840
figure out how to get them on the fellow

00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,000
track

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,240
or or signal that they should be

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,640
considered for this fellow track

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,559
this gave them an opportunity to

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,760
influence the outcome of their own

00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,720
careers

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,919
again in a way that they didn't have

00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,559
before

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,279
so if every single project every single

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,720
code base

00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:46,559
in your whole space

00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,880
if they're if they're participating in

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,559
intersource has a list of things that

00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,399
they would like to see get done that

00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:55,120
they're not getting to

00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,240
that gives those senior engineers a

00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,399
target

00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,760
for where they could show up and do a

00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:03,520
little good

00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:06,080
and in so doing they can rack up

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,720
successful merges in other people's code

00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,799
bases

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,399
even advocacy that they're doing in

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,559
those other code bases

00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:14,399
and if they rack up enough of them they

00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:16,399
can signal that they're interested

00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:18,880
in going to the next place becoming an

00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:20,799
architect becoming a fellow

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,080
doing more for the organization than

00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,159
they can do from within their

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,520
silo so there's an example of a really

00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,080
good hack

00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,760
okay other stuff we heard we heard that

00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,240
um

00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,039
when picking your projects you need to

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,720
be sure

00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:38,640
to focus on what's unique to your org

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,640
but also don't compete with something

00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:44,000
that should be open source

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,000
remember i said before that inner source

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,080
can be a way to make sure that your open

00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,320
source is going to be successful

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,600
but you don't want to keep stuff in the

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,520
inner source pen

00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,600
if it makes sense for it to be open

00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,200
source how you make those choices

00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,799
we can talk about another time since

00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,440
this talk is about intersource

00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:03,840
but it is possible to identify key

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,480
strategic moves to open source

00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,799
there's a paper that my former colleague

00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,600
dwayne o'brien wrote and also a talk

00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,880
that he gave

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,880
about something called the four

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,240
questions which is a good place to start

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,760
if you're trying to think about how to

00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,519
get to open source

00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,039
but just remember that it there are

00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,720
things that will always stay

00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,159
inner source and there are things that

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,559
will start inner source

00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,919
and then manifest as open source

00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:29,440
projects

00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:31,200
um here it's really helpful to do inner

00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,840
source if you're trying to work

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,240
on frameworks or common reference

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,320
platforms or common tools

00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,919
one of the most fruitful places to start

00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,720
is if you're implementing continuous

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,760
integration

00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,600
and deployment

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,760
you have a couple of options there but

00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,200
what you don't want is for every single

00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,559
group in the company to do their own

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,960
version of that

00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:54,799
and yet most of them will rebel against

00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,000
a version that has been built to

00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,880
be you know one size fits no one so what

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,840
works better

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,279
we've noticed is if you let them figure

00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,000
out their deployment

00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:08,240
on their own and you come up with an

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,960
integration framework that's extensible

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,399
give them an api and let them make it

00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,720
fit for their case

00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:16,399
or vice versa let them figure out the

00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,919
integration but give them a consistent

00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:20,880
deployment with some

00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,960
hooks that they can um localize to but

00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,720
this is one of the main ways that people

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,519
get intersources established in their

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,840
company

00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,600
is by pointing out that that code reuse

00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,200
is the strategy for

00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,600
implementing continuous integration and

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:37,760
deployment and then reward that

00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,240
right um there are definitely places

00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,720
where

00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:45,919
the risk of the regulation problem

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,640
is mitigated by what you get out of the

00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,440
program

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,519
so at paypal they got velocity now they

00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,399
didn't throw the regulation stuff under

00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,399
the bus

00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:56,080
but they definitely relaxed it in some

00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:58,880
places where it had grown

00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,519
teeth if you know what i'm saying and

00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,200
you know

00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,120
not to put too fine a point on it but we

00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,760
all know people who work as

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,480
you know policemen or security guards

00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,320
that have

00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,240
authority things going on and they want

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,640
to they want to grab more and more and

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,559
more

00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,399
a lot of times your internal company

00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,919
regulators fall prey to that same

00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,039
problem because it makes them feel

00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:19,440
important

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:21,679
um so looking with a critical eye and

00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,880
how close you can shave that is probably

00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,519
worth doing if it

00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,720
means a big savings or a big change in

00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,559
the way you can deliver for your

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,919
customers

00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:35,519
and then be making working

00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:38,880
on discoverability both of documentation

00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:40,720
and of code is a huge benefit that

00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,840
doesn't hurt anybody's regulation

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,960
regulatory framework just making people

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,360
able to find

00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,000
things is enormous finding a block of

00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,720
code

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,279
so that you don't have to write it again

00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,440
or as a starting point can be a huge

00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,880
help to engineers and what you don't

00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,519
want them to do is start copying and

00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,559
pasting

00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:02,399
but you do want them to be able to reuse

00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,760
things that are you know hardened and

00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:05,279
useful and

00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,720
they can find out everything they need

00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:09,200
to know about it if you also make

00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,919
documentation discoverable

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,440
so these are some of the reasons that

00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:16,320
many fintech companies

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,119
are overcoming their extreme fear of

00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,760
regulation

00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,520
and looking again at how how close they

00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,879
can shave it to get to the inner source

00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,280
place

00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,560
and we're seeing it blossom literally

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,800
all over the world

00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,079
all over europe all over the u.s all

00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,159
over asia

00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,440
we do inner source summits we just did

00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:37,200
number

00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:39,760
11. everyone is bigger in attendance

00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,560
bigger in the kinds of speakers that

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,560
we're getting and

00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,240
bigger in the stories that we're getting

00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,760
i'm getting ready to do another version

00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,679
of adopting inner source of

00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,280
volume 2 with more case studies because

00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,000
we found so many more

00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,599
interesting stories to tell it's just

00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,800
exploding and i think if you're not

00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,879
looking at it you're

00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,599
missing a trick because your competitors

00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:01,839
definitely are looking at it

00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,440
so here's a bunch of them these are

00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:04,880
obviously not all fintech but you're

00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,160
going to be surprised how many of them

00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,160
are

00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,160
and there are some interesting companies

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,680
in this list so i'm just going to call

00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,440
out a couple of them

00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,119
microsoft up there in the upper left

00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,520
hand corner of course

00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,400
famously was not a friend to open source

00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,920
for most of

00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,520
the history of open source but they've

00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,599
recently turned a corner

00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,599
and they did it because their new

00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:27,520
business uh azure was

00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,040
needing that kind of transparency in

00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,040
order to compete with

00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,880
aws and some of the other clouds out

00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,000
there so they recruited some people from

00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,839
apache

00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,520
initially into the open source office

00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:38,320
and then transferred them into the azure

00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,320
office

00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,520
and they got a great outcome out of that

00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,119
they felt like that was a really

00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:46,240
fruitful outcome

00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,800
so now they are actively pushing inner

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,800
source

00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,640
throughout the company to all the rest

00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,240
of their employees because they want

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,880
those same benefits

00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,720
they're basically admitting that the way

00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,200
they've engineered for all these years

00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,560
needs to change which i find really

00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,400
interesting because they want to

00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,599
understand more about this collaboration

00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,320
thing

00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,960
capital one i'm sorry comcast which is

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,400
sitting

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:12,079
sort of next to microsoft there

00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,359
comcast is doing something interesting

00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,000
they're the ones i was telling you about

00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,000
earlier that

00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
that started this idea of you have to

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,440
inner source before you can open source

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,640
which i think is really interesting

00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,839
they've been doing open source for a

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,520
long time too

00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:25,839
but they find that they get better

00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,359
outcomes from their open source efforts

00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:28,880
if they're certain that everybody can

00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:32,000
collaborate first

00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:34,720
and then i i will say something about

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,839
daimler who's over in the right here

00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,320
daimler of course a car

00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:40,160
company we heard recently is starting

00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,800
from a talk that we had at inner source

00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,000
summit

00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:47,119
is starting to use inner source across

00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,040
its supply chain so that

00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,760
third parties that write software for

00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,480
them are working with them directly in

00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,200
an intersource

00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,079
way with transparency across the code

00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,000
base

00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,480
and they're finding that it really saves

00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,119
them time and makes them more

00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,920
competitive against a company like say

00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,920
tesla

00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,200
which is delivering so much through

00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,040
software and cars

00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,040
that the rest of the industry is having

00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,320
to catch up i've got stories behind

00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,320
all of these names but i'm going to

00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,320
leave you with those three um

00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,480
if you'd like to see your your logo up

00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,920
here come talk to us

00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:24,400
over at innersourcecommons.org here is

00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:26,240
our home page of our humble little uh

00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,240
501c3 that we set up

00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,920
it's been in existence for five or six

00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,640
years now but it was under the auspices

00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,480
of paypal

00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:35,440
and we recently pulled it out to become

00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:38,240
its own thing it has a board

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:40,720
that is made up of contributors it is

00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,680
run like apache in that you can become a

00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,240
member

00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,040
as an individual you can be nominated

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,720
for membership

00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,320
and it is an individual membership it's

00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,119
not your company that's a member because

00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,280
you might change

00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,119
jobs but we like the work that you're

00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,320
doing if you demonstrate that you're not

00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,040
only fixing things

00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,880
in your own backyard but you're working

00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,119
to make the foundation better and make

00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,880
it more available to more people

00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:05,119
we work under chatham house rules which

00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,040
makes it relatively safe to talk to us

00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,560
and ask us questions however

00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,160
we're finding that some fintech

00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,359
companies are still not comfortable with

00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,560
that they they'd rather have a

00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:16,400
negotiated

00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:21,280
nda laden um you know cone of silence

00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:24,400
or cone of trust and for that reason

00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,320
we have an announcement which is that we

00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,640
are looking at putting together a

00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,880
special interest group at phenos for

00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,000
fintech companies that are inner source

00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,800
curious

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,599
we will make uh inner source commons the

00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,200
upstream

00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,640
to what's happening at phoenix because

00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,720
it will be a

00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,880
special interest group in the sense that

00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,839
the the issues that are facing fintech

00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,359
are different

00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:47,520
than many of the other kinds of

00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:50,079
companies that you saw in that big slide

00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,680
so we'll do our very best to make sure

00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,599
that

00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,119
we stick to the fintech stuff but if

00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,480
anything fruitful comes out of it

00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,359
especially if there are patterns

00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,640
identified

00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:02,400
that mitigate risk or or enhance yield

00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,680
or if there are tools that come out of

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,400
this special interest group

00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:08,160
they will be delivered upstream to inner

00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,079
source commons so that the entire inner

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,560
source community can benefit

00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:14,320
so this is really exciting news we have

00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:17,280
some partners in this

00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:19,440
and uh i'm looking forward to getting

00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,960
this started with many of the

00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,200
companies that i was talking about

00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:26,079
earlier including morgan stanley

00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:27,599
um royal bank of canada deutsche bank

00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,119
inner source commons and phoenix who are

00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,640
the initial members of this but

00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,400
of course everyone that's a member of

00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,920
phoenix will be able to come

00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,520
so we hope that that's exciting to

00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,920
people and

00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,560
uh welcome to the party i hope that this

00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,640
is enough

00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,960
to make you interested make you want to

00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,800
come in and be part of it

00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,960
it's it's a great community i can

00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,880
honestly say that there are very nice

00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,520
