00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,160
let's kick off with today's keynote um

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,879
yesterday

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,720
gab spoke briefly about the noteworthy

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,480
progress that our financial services

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,959
community has made in adopting open

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,560
source

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,640
and the value it brings to all

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,120
participants both on the technical and

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,160
and business side and today i'm going to

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,560
focus a little more

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,120
on how the finance industry can build on

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,840
that and tackle some big challenges

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,680
and by way of introduction i'm tasha

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,840
ellison the chief operating officer

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,440
at thanos so this morning we issued a

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,879
press release announcing that two new

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,040
projects have been contributed to the

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:54,959
foundation and that we've kicked off

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,640
an important new initiative so the first

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,080
the symphony java toolkit has been

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,560
contributed by deutsche bank

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,840
and as adoption of symphony grows this

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,519
is an ideal time

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,840
to collaborate on tools that address

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,840
common concerns and workflows

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,120
and this suite of libraries really does

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,920
just that you know it's been used in

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,319
production

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,080
at deutsche bank and it focuses on

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,080
delivering client functionality

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,720
things like request for quote building

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,720
orders sharing acts information

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,239
and these are useful utilities that

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,560
should be developed once

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,239
collaboratively not multiple times

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,920
across multiple firms

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,440
you know doing it once that means you

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,920
have more time to focus on

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,280
the price that's actually in that rfq or

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,519
the customer order

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,959
for your client really the value add for

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,599
your firm

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,400
and if you didn't catch yesterday's talk

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,720
um

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,760
it's worth watching the replay to learn

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,920
more

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,760
we also announced that openmomma has

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,720
joined finos now openmama is a

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,519
vendor-neutral

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,680
cross-platform api that interfaces with

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,280
a wide variety of message-oriented

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,280
middleware systems

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,319
it provides a simplified way of sharing

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,159
market data across

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,920
investment banks proprietary trading

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:05,200
companies hedge funds

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,200
and data providers

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,360
and if you've ever done an

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,959
implementation of a market data feed you

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,200
know it can be complicated

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,400
and take about a lot of time so you know

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,720
having this common

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,160
project can help reduce the cost of

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,079
ownership and the time

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,680
and the time to market for all of the

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,360
market participants

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,199
uh now openmobile was already open

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,199
sourced under the linux foundation

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,639
but when finnos moved to the linux

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,720
foundation it made sense

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,720
to join together where we can jointly

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,960
benefit from the alignment

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,960
of our members and community

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,600
so where is this taking us you know

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,560
we're excited about these contributions

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,400
and they really highlight

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,320
part of what has been a great year for

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,440
us you know as gab and dove mentioned

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,479
yesterday

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,560
we've had a record number of

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,040
contributions from banks and this is a

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,520
strong indicator that financial services

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,199
is more fully embracing open source you

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,280
know with this growing community and

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,800
ecosystem and this greater comfort with

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,880
open source practices

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,800
the finance industry is in prime

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,360
position to collaborate on

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,960
bigger opportunities and innovate the

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,840
open source way

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,039
and you know one of the opportunities we

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,400
see

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,960
is in regtech

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,479
you know we think that there's that open

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,240
source software and standards

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,000
can really change the way that financial

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,639
regulation is interpreted

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,160
implemented and supervised and and

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,800
that's why we started the open reg tech

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,400
initiative

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,479
really to explore and promote

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,800
opportunities for collaboration between

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,080
financial financial institutions

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,280
technology firms

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,520
service providers and regulators

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,720
um i co-lead this initiative for venice

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,680
alongside my con

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,479
my colleague itana miyal and we're

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,400
thrilled

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,600
with the interested interest that we've

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,199
had so far

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,680
from all of these different market

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,440
participants you know and as a result of

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,280
that interest

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,520
our board has a crew approved the

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,560
creation of a special interest group

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,520
focused on this topic now before i get

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,120
into the

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,639
a bit more about the special interest

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,639
group i want to give you

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,840
a little bit of a sense for just how big

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,919
of a challenge this is

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,919
and why it's important you know there

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,600
are a very large number of financial

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,919
regulators across the globe

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,880
and many financial institutions provide

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,639
services

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,400
in a large number of markets and so they

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,800
need to address the requirements

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,479
for those many different regulators and

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,080
those regulators might all have

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,840
different models or different approaches

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,880
to how they deliver and want to receive

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,880
information related to the regulations

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,240
and these regulations can be very

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,479
lengthy and dense

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,080
for example dodd-frank's regulatory

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,360
definition of swaps

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,600
just swabs is 160 pages long

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,039
you know these many millions of pages of

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,120
regulation

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,960
ultimately results in the production of

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,039
billions of data points

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,639
uh former bank of england governor mark

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,960
carney said last year

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,759
that the bank can receive 65 billion

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,039
data points

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,520
in a single year and there's a reason

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,199
for this

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,960
you know financial services is an

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,280
extremely complex

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,360
and often nuanced industry covering a

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,759
huge range of products and services

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,120
delivered to hundreds of millions in in

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,240
some cases billions

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,039
of people and

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,840
as you can imagine with this level of

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,599
complexity

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,759
and scale there's a cost you know

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,440
it's it's costly it's expensive to

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,680
interpret those regulations

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,120
one report showed that bank compliance

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,759
costs jumped more than

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,360
50 billion dollars a year after

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,199
dodd-frank and that's before you even

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,440
get to the implementation

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,759
and for each of the regulated entities

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,440
who has to implement those regulations

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,919
there's a technology cost you know a

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,039
systems cost lexus nexus recently

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,240
estimated that

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,879
40 of financial crime compliance costs

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,840
are associated with technology

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,800
and then there's the the expense of

00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,879
making

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,639
understanding what all of that data is

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,199
telling us

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,120
you know but with all of this it's

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,520
important that we get regulation

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,440
and compliance right because if we can

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,280
get it if we get it wrong

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:16,400
there can be disastrous effects

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,240
so with that as a backdrop i'd like to

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,879
tell you about our regulation innovation

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,879
sig

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,000
which we announced this morning this is

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,000
being led by air

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,120
the alliance for innovative regulation

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,879
and ing

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,639
in fact you can chat with the sig leads

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,520
ian hollabrad and david eric

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,560
in our ask the expert session uh just

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,399
after

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,839
during the break just after the the

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,360
keynotes today

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,959
um and the goal here is to bring

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,000
together individuals who are interested

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,560
in creating open source

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,279
solutions for regulatory and compliance

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,519
issues

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,519
and we provide a neutral trusted

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,000
environment to explore the challenges

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,519
identify opportunities and ultimately

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,560
build open source projects

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:57,279
standards tools models documentation

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,040
reference and reference implementations

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,680
really anything that is open

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,880
but governed that can help you know and

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,160
we recognize

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,240
that it's important to have

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,839
representatives and insight

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,360
from all of the different participants

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,800
in the industry so from

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,720
financial institutions we need

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,920
compliance professionals and architects

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,920
and engineers

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,040
and we need regulators at the table too

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,160
and you know there's some

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,080
great innovative regulators the fca the

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,200
bank of england finra cfpb

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,360
you can hear from later as well and the

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,000
tech and advisor community has a huge

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,480
role to play

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,480
also and we need the reg consultants

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,240
other foundations associations

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,839
we all need to come together to figure

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,680
out how we can solve these industry

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,720
challenges

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,640
we had of the first the sig had its

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,959
first meeting earlier this week and

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,040
two items that came up repeatedly were

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,240
standards and interoperability

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,399
you know we discussed a number of

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,120
different potential focus areas

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,839
digital regulatory digital regulatory

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,959
reporting

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,279
aml horizon scanning payments

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,560
and these discussions often came back to

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,360
the importance of

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,079
standards and interop and this really

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,000
underpinning

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,839
the ability to be successful in making

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,360
change you know so we had a great

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,720
initial conversation we have

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,720
lots of directions for future

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,880
conversations and you know we're really

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,880
looking forward to finding some exciting

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,160
projects to work on together

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,000
if you want to you can learn more about

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,920
the sig and find out how to get involved

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,640
on our website

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,880
or on our github repo at finos

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,880
github.com

00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,880
finnosopenregtech

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,839
and so

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,079
we know that this isn't an in an easy

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,800
industry challenge to solve

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,480
it's hard it's going to take time and

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,760
effort of many individuals

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,640
and many groups but open source

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,760
in all of its variations must have a

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,959
prominent role

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,760
in how we make it faster better and

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,040
easier

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,680
to produce interpret implement

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,519
comply with and supervise financial

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,040
regulation

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,640
now this is just one of the big issues

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,279
we think open source can help

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:15,839
solve for the industry but we do think

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,839
it's an important one

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:21,360
so with that i'll wrap up you know we

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,800
have many more projects and initiatives

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,959
and there are lots of ways that you can

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,720
get involved um you know whether that's

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,079
coding or providing insight

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,079
so many different opportunities so

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,760
please do reach out you can reach us on

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,920
slack via email

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,279
um lots of different ways and and there

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,440
are a number of sessions today that

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,600
touch on different angles of regulation

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,480
and also a number of other topics so

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,079
we're

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,950
pretty excited about our lineup today
