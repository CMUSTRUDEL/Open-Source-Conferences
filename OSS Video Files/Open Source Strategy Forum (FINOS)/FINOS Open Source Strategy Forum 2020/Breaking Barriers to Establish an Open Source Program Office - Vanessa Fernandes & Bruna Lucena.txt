history

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,480
on the open source program office and

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,599
what were the main challenges that we

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,399
face the barriers

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,000
that we face establishing the program

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,960
office

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,920
so i'd like to introduce myself my name

quantum computing

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:06,080
blockchain 5g and

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,520
open source is one of the main i would

say tools that we have

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,560
for emerging technologies and to adopt

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,600
in the in itau and uh

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,400

and i'm the lead of open source program

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,840
office at

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,759
and i work for in a work here science

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,799
2004 and during this time i've been

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,360
involved with different

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:50,799
areas like infrastructure i.t governance

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,119
it operation and for the last six years

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,399
i've been working with enterprise

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,840
architecture

00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:01,600
and specifically with

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,640
technical architecture and um

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:08,239
i would like to tell you a short story

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,759
on how we started our journey with open

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,239
source

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,239
let me

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,720
yeah and and this journey started in

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,200
2015 when we had to develop a big

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,959
important project inside the bank

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,200
and this project opened a lot of

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,080
opportunity for us

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,360
and one of this opportunity was to work

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,120
with open source

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:38,400
the the very important thing for us

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:42,080
and the first version of our project was

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,720
ready i remember that i looked at

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,400
i didn't work when i say yet the old

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,879
bosses

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,519
and we look at the environment with

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,720
other

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:56,000
managers and we thought oh my god

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,879
there is a lot of open source here and

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
let me

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,560
and let me take a little break

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,640
here to explain three important things

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,239
and that will leave that in that time

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,760
okay

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:13,360
first uh use we use it open source

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,239
okay but majority enterprise version

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,120
and not community version is not usual

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,159
for us

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,599
uh worked with these technologies and

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,799
involved with with communities and the

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,879
second thing

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:32,159
we had a lot of dependence on vendors

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:36,000
in that time to improve our platform

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:39,440
to uh develop our

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,799
products and this is dependencies

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:46,080
is not so good for us and

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:49,599
the third thing is no risks

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,159
are managed about open source we had no

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,080
idea

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:56,680
how uh work these things um

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,319
happen license compliance sense

00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,760
vulnerabilities

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:04,799
and okay the three important things that

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,920
in this scenario that we leave it

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,879
and in with this scenario we had to do

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,439
something

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,319
uh to formalize what was happened

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,959
because

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,920
for example uh in that time you had a

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,280
policy

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:22,800
that said uh we couldn't use open source

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:25,520
in the company and then

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,919
and i thought vanessa the first barrier

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,199
that

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:32,000
we had to break was to announce

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,639
to our executive board that from that

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,160
moment

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,639
on we could use open source

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,680
and we changed the policies and we had

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,800
to something

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:46,720
some some something to update

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:50,240
this and we were so happy because

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:53,919
our vp our cio uh

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,960
approved the idea and then

00:04:53,919 --> 00:05:00,000
in that time we are so

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,400
we were so excited because now we can do

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,080
the

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:07,280
open source project okay but

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,720
we had no idea about what is coming and

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,919
because only to change the policies it

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,720
was not enough

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,360
and then the next series the next two

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,560
years

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:24,400
we had men challenged and we

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:27,440
found some hurdles in in our path

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,039
and it's normal in the beginning we find

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,320
some hurdles like

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,960
we had no budget for example so

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,080
in budget it's important uh for example

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,080
to

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,440
became a member of the open source

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,639
foundation and

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:45,360
learn with them and and in that time

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,800
we had no budget for this and we had no

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,720
engagement with the

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,120
other departments and and even nobody

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,160
knew

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,440
on how to implement the ospo in that

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,800
time

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:02,400
and uh this is the second barrier

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:06,000
that we had to break we

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:09,680
was to be resilient and to learn from

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,759
the scarcity of resource but

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:16,639
uh today in my vision i think vanessa

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,000
thank you like me it's very important to

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,120
pass for this

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,440
because this hurdles make our team

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:28,240
stronger and the our vision about

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,280
open source and our strategy is stronger

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,400
also

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:36,000
and the first message that i

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:39,120
can pass to you is be committed

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,120
to your open source strategy and

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:46,840
don't give up uh make a decision

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:50,000
even is stronger than before

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:53,919
and and finally

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,840
now my i will we can do

00:06:53,919 --> 00:07:03,280
uh we finally we arrived in 2020

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:06,560
and after this hard years past

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,840
in 2020 it has been the most important

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,039
year for us because it has been the year

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,800
that we

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:18,319
structure an area with total focus

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,840
uh in developing an open source program

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,800
office

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,680
and the third barrier that we had to

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,120
break

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,759
was to find a leader and we found

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,800
vanessa just like you can see vanessa

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,919
stay here

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:37,039
uh talks about with me uh

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:40,160
about this this important subject

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:43,520
and we now we were running our

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,919
main pillars of the ospo

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,120
with the other important areas in the

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,680
bank

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:54,800
uh like for example hr

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:58,240
um devsecops team

00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:01,360
um lego a lot of

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:04,400
people involved with the team today

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,680
with us and we succeeded in

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,560
proving the budget also

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,759
and it's important because um in the

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,960
beginning of this year

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,919
we became a student member of finnos

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,879
and vanessa talks about a little more

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,479
about this

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:26,000
about this and um

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:30,720
for uh the last one i i

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:34,399
think leaving this journal since 2015

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:37,599
i can say we want the first steps

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:40,880
uh the top of iceberg

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:44,880
i think we won because um

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:48,640
it's i noted inside the bank and i

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:51,680
i think vanessa agree with me

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,720
our questions our concerns about

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,920
open source are changing are evoluting

00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:01,040
and all these things show us that we are

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,200
in the right way and noted this

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,640
new maturity level arriving in our

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,080
company

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:12,160
and then uh

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,080
uh our a little short story

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,440
and vanessa will tell about our

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,600
connection with the

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,640
big tanks and the big bands are the

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,760
peers

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:26,800
from to continue journey journey

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:30,080
you know please vanessa exactly bruno so

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,720
i'm and uh i i had i was very lucky to

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,800
join

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,480
the team because uh they passed through

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,000
all the barriers until i joined and when

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,399
i joined was a little bit easier

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,640
i would say um it was very good for me

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,920
to structure and be part of something

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,680
and i believe that my skill set that is

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,440
connection with other banks and build

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,839
the relationships and networks

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,959
uh was something that was missing

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,600
because the the team

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,200
was much more focused uh inside utah and

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,680
how to develop and deploy

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,560
uh the open source program office inside

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,440
but

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,320
it was without uh some references so it

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,680
was a lot

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,480
um self-study and knowing and hiring

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,519
people

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,399
and discovering uh we call training on

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,480
the job

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,920
uh but with no formal training and no

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,880
formal references

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,320
so when i start doing uh the research on

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,200
open source uh

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,160
when i start on blockchain and and i

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,839
start discovering

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,279
okay so this is something that we need

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,480
this is something that we should be

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,800
close to the community

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,880
we should participate on meetups we need

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,800
to discuss better about and learn

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,279
with the big attacks how they deployed

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,920
uh with our peers uh other banks

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,320
so we were lucky enough to discover what

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,360
was

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,040
uh phenos and and how can we be part of

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,160
it so it was through

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,720
actually to github and lab and

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,760
all the the our peers were referencing

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,360
as an open source

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:56,640
uh i would say um a sponsor and

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,560
and on the team inside uh

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,480
the community so that was something that

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,440
was more focused on financial

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,640
institutions

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,320
so we decided to join uh the discussion

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,959
with the big text was something that we

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,839
put us

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,680
in reference so uh our peers that was

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,600
more connected to

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,519
i would say to the tech world like

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,880
google microsoft

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:21,040
ibm intel uh those were

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,160
already it was on facebook it wasn't

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,399
inside their

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,160
uh i would say that structure their dna

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,640
so open source was not something new but

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,720
it was something very well structured

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,320
but the risks that they of course they

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,440
they they are concerned

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,680
are not the same as we are and uh

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,560
and and vice versa but the structure on

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,399
how to build

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,000
the the program office the governance

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,480
that we should be structuring

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,279
was the same so we could follow the same

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,959
i would say

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:52,240
idea about the program about what is our

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:54,399
main i would say reference and go to uh

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,279
operating model but then we have to

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,920
adapt to

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,440
what is feasible for us and uh what is

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,720
our concern so we are

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,959
and i believe that everybody is

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,760
concerned about uh risks related to

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,680
cyber

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,800
right so this was something that we were

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,800
concerned about tools

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,399
uh data loss prevention how can we be

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,279
part of something and

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,480
and by the same time protect uh how can

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,639
we innovate

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,320
uh and and be part of something without

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,279
being so um

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,000
and being cost effective uh while doing

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,720
that

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,480
so that was uh one of the main uh

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,680
discussions that we had inside phenos

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,720
and with our peers

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,720
to learn about the tools and and

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,720
methodologies that they had how they

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,320
apply uh operating models

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:41,360
uh so we could uh mirror what was good

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,839
uh the the lessons learned as well

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,880
to not follow by the same mistakes so

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,200
while going

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,560
and discussing with our peers like uh

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,959
citibank deutsche bank

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,800
goldman sachs uh we start getting close

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,600
to them learning how they

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,120
start consuming how they start um

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,880
sponsoring projects

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,240
and uh opening projects and contributing

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,720
to the community and

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,600
how this relationship should be working

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,040
and with that

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,760
we connect to to itau and the areas in

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,639
itau

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,279
on how could we evolve and get people

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,040
together

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,399
so the sponsorship for our senior

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,160
management i think is starting the

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,320
beginning of the year is stronger

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:24,000
i would say and what luna uh bruno uh

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:27,680
uh mentioned uh budget was a key um

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,959
a key aspect that we should be

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,720
concerned and uh and and asking for our

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,279
single management we cannot do anything

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,399
without being some somehow structured

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,959
with resources

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,600
uh with people that are connected to the

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,279
community

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:46,399
uh and tools and put focusing on on

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,040
on partners uh consultancy firms so we

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,720
hired

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,040
uh sans and i think that bruno is going

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,120
to comment a little bit about it

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,720
that is to help us with this uh uh

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,000
self-assessment and gap

00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:01,279
analysis to see what is missing inside

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,320
uh itau and how can we evolved uh with

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,480
with the open source

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,600
uh program office i think that we are on

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,079
the right track

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,680
uh but there is much more uh to be done

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,120
and i believe that bruno can explain a

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,079
little bit more about

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,800
um what what we aim now with the program

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:18,000
office

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,480
uh again we have a huge uh sponsorship

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,639
now

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,519
with our senior management uh they

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,320
understood

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,279
uh the one just some this is part of our

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,920
strategy now

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,399
so it's not about only to retain and to

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,040
gain

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,560
uh talent but is to be part of something

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,480
that can evolve so the technology we

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,320
evolve with open source we believe that

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,519
and that's it's part of our strategy

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,760
today so uh

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,880
maybe you know you can uh talk a little

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,199
bit more about

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,000
the partnerships and uh and and how we

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,320
are uh

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,279
connecting and and what would be our

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,480
next steps

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,079
for for the open source office yeah

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,199
thank you vanessa

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:59,120
um and i i am i

00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:02,399
can yeah now the foundation like

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,800
you said it's very important uh part of

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,240
this

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:09,440
this journey because uh

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:12,639
we for example we in the bank

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:16,639
we choose two pillars

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:19,680
in the linux foundation to

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:23,360
dip more because our

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:26,639
strategy and our business

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:29,360
make sense with these pillars how native

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,519
computing foundation and phenos and

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,639
financial services

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:38,079
is above uh pillars that we

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:41,839
involve it more with more approach

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:45,279
from this foundations and

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:49,519
it's a it's a a key because uh

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:54,320
in this this project we are can

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:57,600
uh we are evolute our vision our process

00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:01,199
together with the other companies and

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:04,720
it's important thing to to mention here

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:08,880
that in this open source

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:12,480
project in that part of this foundation

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:16,240
uh we link it with our business areas

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:18,399
and is this way that we scale out

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,440
the mindset open source inside the

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,920
company

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,920
and we

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,680
how can i say we are uh work together

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,279
with these areas but

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:39,199
these areas is a sponsorship for

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:42,959
each pro product and project open source

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:45,120
into following and to participate in

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:50,399
working groups like you can see

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:53,920
here for example for example um we

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:57,360
in the open source program office uh

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,680
weekly we we found with pinos

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,399
and participate the working group about

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,160
open source

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:07,520
readiness project and we uh

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:10,480
learned so much with them

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,280
it's very important to our team and our

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,280
company

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:19,360
um and uh very very

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,360
amazing things are happening

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,880
uh those two uh those are the main

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,839
pillars if you can uh

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,640
um just uh uh complimenting what you

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,480
were saying

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,160
right all the others like watching and

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,360
hyper ledger um

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,039
yeah all of them are are something that

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,400
we are of course we are working

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:42,000
uh network uh we are all interested

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:45,039
in in all the other projects as well

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,520
but those two we could find a fit

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:49,440
to a specific project that we have today

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,640
that we thought we could put more effort

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,679
and be uh more vocal inside the itau and

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,960
outside it all

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,240
being more participative um on the

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,039
topics that uh

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,080
were in our strategy uh this year for

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,320
revolution

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,679
so all the others we we attend some of

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,320
the meetings we participate in some of

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,320
the meetings

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,480
but being more connected we should be

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,919
focusing right uh we do not have

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,039
uh unlimited resources so the the the

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,799
scarcity as as

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,320
bruno was mentioning it's something that

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,760
sometimes is good because we can focus

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,760
and we can follow up

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,679
how they are connecting to the other

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,480
institutions what we are learning so we

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,120
have this

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,320
uh conversations that we have um time to

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,120
time with all the groups that

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,240
are participating on those projects on

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,400
what we are learning

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,840
uh what are what would be our next steps

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,160
can we use can we

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,960
uh be more active uh on those

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,760
initiatives

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,760
so so and uh what are the main areas in

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,080
italy that could be connected

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,760
and participating on a dick today so we

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,000
could find for instance in alloy

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,280
uh the risk management area the

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,360
sustainability area

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,799
interested on how to use uh this

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,960
technology so we thought

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,720
it would be good to have them uh joining

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,039
us but but we start

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,760
doing that we should explain first and

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,200
teach them

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:08,720
what is open source why we are investing

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:11,520
uh our time um our expertise

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,440
uh the team the technology team to study

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,640
something and to be part of something

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,960
and what would be doubt the main

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,679
objective and teach them

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,400
on on how to be part of some of our

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,640
community

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,000
was not something that was uh i would

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,240
say

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
natural for them it wasn't something

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,840
that the bank used to do

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,480
right but but more and more they are

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,320
saying that there is no competition

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,240
when we are talking about evolution on

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,000
technology because it's more about how

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,880
you use how you're going to deploy

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,480
and not about what we are using so

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,840
learning with the other peers

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,720
uh the the benefits of of their

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,280
uh tools and trying to get together and

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,640
share

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,480
as well uh what we are facing today

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,240
share with them uh what what are the

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,960
main benefits and

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,080
how our areas can help with expertise on

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,880
how to use

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,760
right bring some use case and even our

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,240
questions that we

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,080
sometimes you think that are so basic

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,039
and sometimes we think that we are

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,640
oh my god we are so behind um of the

00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,679
other banks we are so behind of the

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,600
other institutions

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,440
but when we come up to see okay so what

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,520
are the tools that you are using so

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,880
did you solve this problem of data loss

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,960
prevention and we see that

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,720
oh my god this is more operational and

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,880
uh and they they limited

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,000
the the resources that have access to

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,480
that but not

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,280
it's not that everybody do have the best

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,320
uh

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,159
inbreed tool to be used so we got more

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,640
okay so this is not something that we

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,039
are

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,320
so far behind uh but and we can

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,200
collaborate with them

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,039
with ideas and join the groups uh

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,240
discussing it on how can we evolve with

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,720
those technologies

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,559
so this i think that this was the main

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,600
uh the important thing that i learned is

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,919
that we are not

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,520
so far behind i think that is a journey

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,919
uh that some of them of course

00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,200
started a few years ago uh but the

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,440
problems are the same

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,480
right lack of sponsorship i think that

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,799
everybody faces

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,600
the same the same thing lack of resource

00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,080
lack of tools

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,840
is not a priority i think that those are

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,320
the main barriers that everybody faces

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,320
not

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,919
was not something that was only uh

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,720
italian was facing

00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,320
but learning on how they broke uh the

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,520
the silos how they broke

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:24,960
uh this cycle of of

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,440
of people preventing uh the technology

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,360
area

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,120
on to use open source what's important

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,679
to us learning with them

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,400
the main uh how they overcome uh those

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,280
issues

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,960
uh how they got sponsorship uh where

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,919
they invest what kind of consultancy

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,000
firm they brought

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,000
uh to that company i think that this

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,440
benchmark helped us a lot

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,600
to structure our main uh steps uh

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,880
to build our program office so i think

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,520
that uh

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,559
being part of a community being part of

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,640
a foundation

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,159
is uh is the main benefit is the

00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,120
connections that we make the network

00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,440
that we built

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,280
and how we learn uh with other people's

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,559
mistake and success

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:08,400
as well yeah

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:12,240
good good vanessa and um

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:16,159
yeah and now it's very important to

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:20,159
share with the community

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:25,120
uh how we how we are organizing

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:29,520
uh to our own open sources program

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:34,080
and and i

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:37,200
started saying that it's not a secret

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:41,039
is it's very simple we

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:44,000
follow uh what the companies

00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:45,200
uh have been successful and follow the

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,720
same path

00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:51,919
and best present best practice is

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:55,760
uh is are open to

00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:58,880
follow and if you um

00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:02,000
is is starting a open source

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:05,440
program and you have no idea for

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,720
where oh my god what are doing

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:11,919
now and it's very simple

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,960
and then this picture shows uh

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:17,440
for us that um inspired

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,080
by red hat for example but linux

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,120
foundation

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:24,559
also have divided program ops

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:27,760
like this um and we have

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:31,520
uh five pillars that uh

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:33,360
separate about the concerns and issues

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,799
about contribution

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:39,840
and and of other and other

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,320
other pillar uh about concentration

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,159
about

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:47,279
about how we manage our consumption

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:50,960
and the risks and the license

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:54,000
what we are use

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:57,039
uh and the other pillar that we

00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,559
put because for us is very

00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:02,320
important i think now in this moment is

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:05,760
the most important thing

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:10,240
to developing the mindset

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:13,600
in resourcing in our in our teams

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,559
because uh we had a pro a little problem

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,760
in our

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:21,360
uh in our company because we had we are

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,640
at 10 000 engineering work together and

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,000
then

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:29,440
we had to do we have to be established

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:33,520
uh inner source mindset to collaborate

00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:36,720
and uh our to collaborate more with

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:39,919
our products and

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:44,240
the team our need to collaborate and

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:47,919
and other main important pillar

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:51,600
is about our strategy and governance

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:55,039
in this pillar we talked about process

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:58,080
policies compliance and these

00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:01,679
specific pillar we have

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:05,760
we have a partnership with

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:09,120
uh open source things and then

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:12,720
this consulting help us to

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:15,520
improve our strategy to create a new

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,880
process to create a new policies

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:22,240
specifically for us because

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:26,240
our indo industry is very

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:30,159
regulated and we have to do

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:33,520
a concerned about some issues

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:37,200
and um the team that involved

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:40,320
the the with killers uh

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,880
important to say that i think it's all

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:47,520
the company are involved with this

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:50,640
and important to say to when we

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,919
when we are when we uh

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:57,440
already create new

00:25:53,919 --> 00:26:00,640
products and open this product we are

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:04,080
we have to do prepare from the

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:07,039
legal things legal issues and

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,840
and to solve some problems with our

00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,360
image

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:14,640
and everything is very important to

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:17,200
to concern yeah and if i can contribute

00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,720
on bruno i believe that the culture

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,039
that's something that we are

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,039
working uh within the companies part of

00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,880
our strategy and governance but we

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,240
will follow the whole pillars that uh

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,360
that on on our

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,080
uh program in our project right so when

00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,720
you mention

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,080
uh inner source and there are uh

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,799
companies that they start

00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,720
uh with inner source to start the open

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,080
source program and there are people that

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,520
start with open source

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,640
uh to focus later on the inner source to

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,600
learn with open source

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,840
and then deploy uh the the the practice

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,919
of

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,159
inner source so i think that there is no

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:55,360
right way or wrong way to do

00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,640
um it's more about what how the company

00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,720
is prepared or not

00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,240
uh to share so as bruno was mentioned

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,760
one of the barriers that we have

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:05,760
inside were to have a lot of engineers

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,520
so it's 10 000 people to control and to

00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,760
motivate to use and share

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,799
uh components and and pieces of

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,120
technology

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,840
and this is not easy right it's easier

00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,799
if you can okay

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,279
so if i want to uh to work with someone

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,640
else

00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:23,679
uh development or or pieces or code

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,520
uh how can i use it without being

00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:28,000
something very specific to my need

00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,640
can i use and and and contribute and

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,080
enhance

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:35,120
or it's easier if i can do my own uh

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:37,200
and deploy faster so this is always uh

00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,320
what what we have to bear in mind right

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,120
when we are doing it

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:43,440
because we we want more reuse and this

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,679
is something that was always in our mind

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,039
uh but we know that it's not easy to to

00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:50,159
control so it's something

00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,640
that we are now uh inviting them so okay

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,159
so you

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,159
want to do open source and everybody

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,760
does right so you want to be close to

00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,559
the community we want to do open source

00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,440
so why not we start sharing and using

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,240
and reusing

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,000
what we have inside uh itau with the

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,799
other communities that we have inside

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,399
itau so this was something that it was a

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:11,120
change of mindset

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:13,360
uh and i think that we reached it uh now

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:17,200
people are much more collaborative

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,240
um in inside the bank and sharing uh

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,520
practices

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,880
and uh sharing uh code

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,440
right so i think that this is something

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,440
that we are doing uh much better now and

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,399
i believe that yes it was something

00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,520
uh part of our uh culture change on the

00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:34,640
program office

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:36,080
that fermented the the itau for the open

00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,960
source mindset

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,080
so i think that this was something very

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,240
important and

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:46,000
a huge step for us

00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,279
starting new open source start with this

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,320
mindset and changing

00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:53,360
our our culture yeah

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:56,640
yeah it's very important to

00:28:53,360 --> 00:29:00,399
um ask help with other

00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:04,000
areas to help this uh

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:07,200
change the culture like for example i

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,559
can mention here change management

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,720
process these areas very important

00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:16,240
communication marketing

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,200
and then these areas uh it's important

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,880
to

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:24,399
help with methodologies uh with

00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:28,720
um a right way to

00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:31,039
uh to to scale out

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,320
this this culture this new culture this

00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:35,600
new mindset

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:39,440
from the all the company and

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:43,039
our partners um linux foundation

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:45,919
venus to the group is

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:47,120
cloud native computing foundation is the

00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:50,559
the foundation that

00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:54,960
we are based to learn uh

00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:58,720
a lot and to contribute also for example

00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:02,880
we are open issue in

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:06,840
uh phenos in the the project

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:10,080
redness to to create

00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:12,960
a new ci cd

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,640
process with the other banks with

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,480
automation with tools

00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:20,720
and we are we are developing

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,559
together with the other companies it's

00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,840
very important to us

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:29,039
and this is very important to

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,240
to the the the first step you have to do

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,919
contribution uh

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:38,159
contribute also and then our team

00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,880
now um start this these things also

00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,720
because

00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:45,840
i i think that our maturity is

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:48,880
changing little by little because it's

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,720
not enough to learn

00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,480
learn learn learn with the other

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,360
companies and the foundation we have to

00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,480
do

00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:59,600
and put on our

00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:02,720
skills put on our ideas and

00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:06,159
change mix shake this and

00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:10,159
i think uh the result is

00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:12,480
better when we have to work together

00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,440
yeah i think that there's one uh thing

00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,120
that is uh

00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:19,200
for us was sort of uh difficult because

00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,480
it's not it's not something that is easy

00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,919
to convince

00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:26,320
um legal and uh compliance

00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,559
area to focus on something that is not

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:31,279
part of our day to day is not our

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,320
strategy and there are so many risks

00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:35,279
involved

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:37,440
so when we have to discuss to them what

00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:40,240
what were the main benefits of it so

00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,320
first we have to to show right it's not

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:45,600
only that we want to run on risk

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:48,640
right there is a way more benefits uh

00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:51,120
that we can assume some sort of uh

00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,240
risks to be part of something bigger so

00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,200
they understood

00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,320
and now they are part part of our uh

00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,440
program office

00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:02,000
and they engaged in in our initiative

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,559
so i think that this was also a a very

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
good

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:07,840
uh achievement for us yeah and it's

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
important to say vanessa that

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:14,880
it's a latest time to to convince

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,360
all the the company and it's normal also

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,399
to

00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:21,679
the journey uh it's not uh

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:23,519
usually to legal to treat issues about

00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:26,559
open source what is this and

00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:29,679
open source and and even uh

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:33,279
it's very important mention in brazil

00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:35,360
our our law is different

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,320
from the other companies also and the

00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,440
technology

00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:43,120
uh it happened

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:46,240
more fast faster in the the other

00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:49,360
the other companies and then

00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:52,480
our legal uh learned a lot with

00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:56,240
our pillars and they all

00:32:52,480 --> 00:33:00,080
in in the the foundation also

00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:03,360
yeah it's a specific subject uh

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:06,559
hard to to developing

00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:09,600
in even to us we

00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:12,080
all all the time we are learning

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,640
foundation the other companies and i

00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,360
think that

00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,080
i the the big message that we want to

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,919
share

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:24,159
uh is that the path uh is not easy

00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:27,919
we have to be strong uh to keep uh

00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:31,840
what we defined as strategy uh convince

00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:34,799
others and try to engage

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,000
and and be an evangelist actually about

00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:38,559
that about the theme

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,200
is something that is needed is the basic

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:42,799
uh of

00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,960
of the base of this um initiative

00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:47,440
so it's not easy it's something that we

00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,399
can do we did it in italy everybody's

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,120
engaged now

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,320
and they are looking for uh have this

00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,200
program office

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:57,039
well established and start soon to

00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,440
contribute as well with the

00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,480
with the community so uh even if you

00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,200
find the barriers

00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,080
just be aware that they do exist but can

00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,399
be overcome

00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,240
i think that that's the main uh message

00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:11,280
that we want to have

00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:14,879
i agree with you

00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:18,240
yeah and uh this is our team uh

00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:22,079
a magnet team that they

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:25,440
never give up and and

00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,240
and this uh it's very important to say

00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,760
that

00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:33,200
uh it was a pleasure uh to share

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,159
a little about our story and lessons

00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,440
learned

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,240
with you and the last thing that i would

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,119
like to say

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,159
is that we are big and beautiful

00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:46,720
community

00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:50,320
and the open source uh have the power

00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:52,159
to join our financial industry

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,000
and we can make a difference in the

00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:57,440
world because it's a very

00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:01,359
important industry from for the world

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:04,000
and i dream that let's

work together to improve our industry

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,320
and

00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:11,599
