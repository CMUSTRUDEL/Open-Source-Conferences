ongoing future i'm pretty excited to be

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,240
part of it

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,280
just a little bit about me as an

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,759
introduction since i'm new to everybody

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,680
my background is in history is is

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,679
software engineering

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,520
particularly in the areas of networking

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,680
identity and security

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,760
but i've been part of open source for

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,959
many many years

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,920
hence the gray hair but i really enjoy

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,200
it

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,040
most recently i've participated in

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,640
several leadership positions in open

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,680
source including

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:33,200
hpc networking

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:36,720
cloud cloud native linux

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,680
and several others so i've been part of

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,440
of many different projects participating

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,280
in many different roles within open

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,840
source and truly enjoy

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,640
being part of the open source community

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,519
and

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,519
and getting to work with people from

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:55,280
around the world

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,920
so today i wanted to talk about

00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,720
change right all of us are sitting here

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,280
in a world that is constantly changing

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,280
and it feels like the change is

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,640
happening much more rapidly than it ever

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,040
has in the past

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,760
so one thing is you know change is

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,159
constant

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,000
and it's very rapid and it just feels

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,920
like change is the new norm right we

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,200
keep talking about the new normal

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,519
but the new normal just keeps changing

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,440
and what that means is that businesses

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,959
and the leaders within those businesses

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,400
have to deal with

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:31,760
these external shocks right and

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:35,920
um ever and ever

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:38,640
varieties of competition regulations

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,680
and shifting customer expectations i was

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,760
listening to a

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:47,120
a presentation from a ceo of a large

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,680
firm a couple weeks ago

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,920
and he was talking about the impact of

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,159
covet 19 on their business so they have

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,360
a global business

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,840
and he was breaking it down week by week

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,680
how it it affected their business so he

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,640
didn't just get on and say well kova did

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,680
this to us

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,799
he was going no we could sense a change

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,920
weekly of what it was doing to our

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,959
business

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:16,079
and i tried to capture his comments

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,919
and uh i liked what he said here he says

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,120
you know we have to learn to be flexible

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,120
and adaptable

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,360
as every week has been different during

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,120
the pandemic

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,040
there's more chapters to be written

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,240
right we're assured that the summers

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,479
they're not sure what the summer is

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,240
going to look like how the economy is

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,560
going to recover

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,080
there's so many new dynamics that we're

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,120
putting a premium on being

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,479
really responsive really agile really

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,400
flexible

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,280
and we're taking a much shorter term

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,320
horizon as we think about the business

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,080
and that fits with what i'm seeing when

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,000
i'm talking to businesses

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,280
things are changing such rapidly what

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,440
used to be

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,720
long-term projects or projects that we

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,120
were going to get to

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,120
sometime in the future are now all of a

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,479
sudden being thrown

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,400
into the forefront and and needing to

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,759
adapt to those and implement those very

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,039
rapidly so

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,720
when he threw out those words that

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,919
they've got to be really agile really

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,840
flexible

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:17,600
and looking at a much shorter term

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,680
horizon i could really relate with that

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,680
and it's not just the businesses if you

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,680
think about it this change that's

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,199
happening is really impacting all of us

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,720
and i wanted to give you a very simple

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,400
example

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,840
and maybe it's a very u.s centric

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,120
example

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:37,280
and maybe it's a local example but um

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:40,400
if i'm based here in salt lake city utah

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,479
and one thing that we've noticed here

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,759
is signs are going up in all the windows

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,680
in the you know in the store

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,759
saying hey we're asking customers to

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,680
give us exact change or to use

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,000
contactless payments you know such as

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,039
credit

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,880
cards or debit cards or

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,639
mobile wallets right there's a variety

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,520
of those

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,880
but the the impact is this it says there

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,080
was an article that came out in the

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,400
local paper

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,160
they were talking about how the utah

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,880
banks here are having

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:16,479
a difficult time coming up with coins

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:19,120
to supply to the area businesses

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,199
and that's because the federal reserve

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,600
here in the u.s has put a limit on the

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,840
bank's request for coins

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,360
um and so the banks don't have the coins

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,919
to be able to give to those businesses

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,280
so

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:33,919
we have a shortage of of coins

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,960
kind of bizarre isn't it and so the

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:40,479
federal reserve reported to congress

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,199
that the supply of coins has shrank

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,440
for two reasons one is the economy right

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,680
has slowed down

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,520
because of the pandemic and that's

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,240
because americans weren't spending near

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,400
as much as

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,000
when you know the before the pandemic

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,919
hit

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
the second one is kind of interesting

00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,800
well and it slowed down but then

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,560
also the the impact of everybody's all

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,319
of a sudden using plastic and

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:09,840
digital currencies over cash and coin

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:11,440
but the other impact was um here when

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,160
everybody's being

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,080
um you know stuck at home working from

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,599
home and so forth

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,599
they said you know it's really hard to

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,360
produce coins when everybody's working

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,479
from home

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,599
so in the article that came out here

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,759
locally

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,680
the part that i find that was hilarious

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,080
is the local banks were asking everybody

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,800
to go

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,720
find those jars of coins that they've

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,720
all been just throwing in the corner

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,000
and to bring them in and let them trade

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,520
them in

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,520
because they were in need of coins

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,160
so it's i just found that pretty funny

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,360
that even things like having coins in

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,160
your pocket

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,960
uh is is changing right is impacting all

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,160
of us

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,840
and an impact of businesses if the

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,520
business can't get coins then they have

00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,800
to adjust their prices to eliminate

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,960
those coins

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,800
so it changes the price of the items

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,240
that we're actually purchasing

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,840
so it's kind of interesting to think

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,759
about how this

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,759
change is impacting all of us

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,680
now the

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,440
to succeed that means that companies

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,400
have to change right we can't stay

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,720
static

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,639
so the best companies and organizations

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,039
understand that by embracing these

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,599
change

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,680
not fearing them not fighting them but

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,080
embracing these change

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,879
changes and the key is to connect the

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,440
right people

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,800
the right ideas and the right dots when

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,959
we can do that

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,159
we can move forward and we can adapt to

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,640
those changes

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,000
so they understand that a flexible i.t

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,560
infrastructure is key

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,120
right they are ready and and need to

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,800
support

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:51,279
digital transformation and this is a con

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,959
is a key piece in succeeding in this

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,560
world of constant change that we have

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,640
today

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,200
leading companies and organizations know

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,160
that their differentiating i.t

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,800
infrastructure

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,480
can't be invented behind closed doors

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,519
they know that they need what we call

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,519
the power of many

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,279
and the secret of this combination is a

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,720
connection as i

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:17,279
stated is people open communities

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,760
skills and technologies and so you need

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,399
to see

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,120
clear answers to complicated questions

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,279
by choosing to work with organizations

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,560
that need agility and stability in a

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,720
solution

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,279
choosing to work with organizations that

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,959
want true openness and no lock-in

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,839
and you don't stop until you

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,839
collaboratively find the means to get

00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,839
there

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,120
so susu was born from this concept the

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,720
concept of

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,680
the power of many its core the core of

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,080
its values

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,040
is made up of its customers employees

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,920
partners

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,040
and the development community these

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,880
define suse

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,279
and the work that we do through open

00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,080
collaboration and innovation

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,839
so suse is is the largest independent

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,920
provider of open source

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:09,120
software so susa is a fully open source

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,760
company right our vision souza's vision

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,399
is to be

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,360
the leading most innovative and trusted

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,120
partner

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,279
in providing true open source

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:21,200
technologies for the enterprise

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:25,360
to simplify accelerate

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:28,800
and modernize so let me say that again

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:32,399
to simplify modernize and accelerate

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:35,600
traditional and cloud and native cloud

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,600
and edge solutions

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,720
so financial times recently

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,120
reported that since the start of covet

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,720
19 or coronavirus

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,640
banks are under pressure from the

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,839
financial costs of the lockdown

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:54,959
right which is true to most businesses

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:58,399
but in the bank's case this decline in

00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:00,000
economic activity has created an

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,800
explosion of loan losses

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,320
right which the banks are now having to

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,120
look at the opportunity

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,000
to cut costs yet at the same time

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,440
because of the

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,360
changes from from the virus

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,360
they have a driving challenge to improve

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,760
their customer services right

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,760
all of a sudden we've got remote workers

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,519
we've got to supply remote services to

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,880
those workers into our customers because

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,959
they can no longer come into the

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,519
facilities when they're closed

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:30,000
we have the physical distancing

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,640
contactless transactions are

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,600
are either being mandated or are

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,600
preferred

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,800
right those types of things are becoming

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,720
a challenge

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,079
towards customer services so they've got

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,480
this balance

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,440
and at the same time it's being tasked

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,279
with

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,600
either maintaining or increasing their

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,360
security people have time on their hands

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,560
to create havoc

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,800
and they need to increase that

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,320
reliability more and more we're relying

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,160
on those services

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,320
for our businesses because of that

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,800
distancing

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,480
so while the financial industry is laser

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,680
focused on these needs and trying to

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,279
make that balance

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,000
we find that this is pretty much a

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,480
general drive for most industries right

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,399
these needs are very much similar that's

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,279
why i really like susie's vision to

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,160
simplify

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,480
modernize and accelerate i think they're

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,680
very spot-on for today's

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:25,040
business needs so simplifying

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,360
your it infrastructure really

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,360
is a focus on how to run your business

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,200
right you want to be able to securely

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,200
manage and run your application

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,480
so suse enables you to update your

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,560
systems

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,360
without downtime and being able to

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,480
achieve

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,720
non-stop i.t right so running your

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,639
business in a simplified way means

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,040
don't create complications of having to

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,480
shut things down

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,959
particularly at the worst times of the

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,519
day right this means that you can always

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,480
count

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,000
on your i.t solutions being there 24x7

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,240
with no disruptions

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,519
which gives you faster response time

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,040
which means you'll have more

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,720
engaged workforce because they're not

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,160
saving their downtime

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,480
twiddling their thumbs wondering what's

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,760
going on but it also more importantly

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,399
means that you're going to have happy

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,839
customers

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,920
right think about it from our

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,920
perspective as users we're never happy

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,519
when we try to access the service

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,680
and find that it's down and i can't get

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,920
my work done

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,320
secondly on on the need to modernize we

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,000
need to modernize our applications

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,760
to prepare them for this future

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,920
computing world

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,440
and modernization doesn't mean that it

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,760
has to conflict with simplification

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,279
with a consistent platform to manage

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,920
your different environments

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:42,160
as if they were one businesses can run

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,399
legacy workloads alongside with

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,760
things like modernized cloud native

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,120
applications

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,680
businesses can take advantage of a cloud

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,320
of the cloud and on-prem services while

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,160
remaining

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,279
fully in control with modernization

00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,920
comes open source

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,800
of course right with open source you can

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,680
leverage

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,440
cutting edge innovation in the most cost

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,320
effective manner

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,120
so lastly accelerate and be able to

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,279
scale your business through

00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:15,600
digitization right so to

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,720
to survive in today's world businesses

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,279
need

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,480
applications that deliver great customer

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,600
experiences

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,399
and provide the right business insights

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,199
this includes the evidence through ai

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,959
high performance computing and analytics

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,120
i'm very excited about these new

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,880
generations of solutions

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,360
that are embracing these new

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,600
technologies and delivering these

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,480
new services and new forms of services

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,480
to our customers

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:49,120
so susu we talk a lot about consistency

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,839
consistency from the core which is our

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,519
traditional

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,519
data centers in the center of our

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,880
businesses to the cloud

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,480
and out to the edge that same report

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,440
that i mentioned earlier finance

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,360
from financial times they're reporting

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,079
that there's a huge uptake in financial

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,120
services

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:09,279
moving services such as risk management

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,440
modeling to the cloud

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,000
while services particularly services

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,000
involving personal information

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,320
and trading data have not moved to the

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,320
cloud at this time

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,320
so what makes most technical sense is to

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,040
use data as your gravity will think

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:28,880
about it in that manner right

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:31,120
um and creating well-defined and modeled

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,880
services across the core to the cloud to

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,639
the edge so place the service where it

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,759
makes sense where's the data

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:40,079
where should the service reside but

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,040
in doing that you need that flexibility

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,279
to either

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,079
move that service or to break that

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,399
service up

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,440
and place it close to where the data

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,920
resides

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,920
so you need that flexibility this is

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,680
what's driving what we call a software

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,880
defined infrastructure or

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,560
sdi for short so let me take

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,720
let's take a look at a couple examples

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,800
here right so

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,959
in the area of financial services for

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,959
example we have high frequency

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:11,759
algorithmic trading financial modeling

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,519
and analysis black box trading

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,920
algorithmic processing

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,600
complex financial risk analysis and

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,839
order routing

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,759
and in general just more reliable

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,519
systems right

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,600
so this quickly highlights the need for

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,720
sdi constructs around hpc

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,160
and low late low ultra low latency for

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,880
example

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,519
but it also demonstrates the need for

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,800
sdi

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,279
which brings in greater policy

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,759
policy-based infrastructure control

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,120
automated management provisioning

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,240
configuration

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,720
and other software-based solutions

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,360
in the banking industry with today's

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,279
business

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,000
banking services such as internet

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:54,639
banking credit and debit card processing

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,519
credit approvals treasury operations

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,040
modernizing these types of applications

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,440
and accelerating the

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,639
delivery of new cloud native

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,039
applications

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,880
is also key in this digital

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,160
transformation

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,120
and then of course we have the

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,120
innovation that's happening at the edge

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,160
and this could be areas such as field

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,720
offices for

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,679
insurance groups for example or running

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,160
atms

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,600
right those are very known areas of the

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,400
edge

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,439
and but what's happening is we're

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,880
beginning to see

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:31,120
and accelerated seeing

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,320
uh hosting requests for new types of

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,120
business applications

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,160
and what this is driving is the need for

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,760
multi-function

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:42,240
platforms at the edge right the need for

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,240
better caching out there on the edge

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,240
some autonomy at the edge right

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,559
the networking and so forth may not be

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,600
as reliable as we push that edge further

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,280
out

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,720
but it also drives the need for

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,280
consistency

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,520
of your infrastructure trill truly out

00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,160
to the edge

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,080
so pushing those needs pushing out to

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,760
the edge can introduce completely new

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,240
business models

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,760
and subsequently can transform existing

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,559
products and services

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,240
hence going back to the need for sdi

00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,039
then of course we can accelerate the

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,280
business

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,960
by incorporating artificial intelligence

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,720
particularly out there at the edge put

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,200
some smarts out there in the edge to do

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,440
some filtering and processing

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,200
and then enhancing our high performance

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,039
and time-sensitive workloads

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,840
huge impact on our business when we can

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,840
do that

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,840
so now according to gartner i love this

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,080
quote from gartner it says open source

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:39,600
is the backbone for digital innovation

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:42,320
i truly believe that and i've seen the

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,799
the advent of growth of open source over

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:48,240
the last several years

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:52,160
and examples abound on how open source

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:55,039
initiatives including some of those that

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:57,120
i've shown on earlier slides are driving

00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:59,200
substantial innovations particularly in

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,320
areas such as mobile

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,520
big data machine learning and artificial

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,320
intelligence

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,200
and suse has been a leading entity in

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,640
the charge of

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,400
innovation and for uh driving

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,000
the innovation for infrastructure

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,520
software

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,520
so let me give some examples of how

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,559
susie is involved

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:23,600
since he lives the ethos of open source

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,600
and is at the fro forefront of true open

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,520
source solutions

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,960
there's thousands and thousands of

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,679
packages

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,240
that suse is involved with pulling those

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,799
together

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:39,679
to help build solutions in today's world

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:41,840
so true open source is is just built

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,840
into seuss's dna

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,120
susan knows how to take open source and

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,480
make open source work

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,400
particularly in an enterprise

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,160
environment

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,480
we've demonstrated that through our

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,600
pervasive enterprise-wide

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,679
mission-critical solutions that's why

00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,679
four out of five of the world's largest

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:03,120
banks are using siouxline again

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:05,360
suse linux enterprise true open source

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,720
leverages the power of many

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,280
to automate everyday tasks and to

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,039
unleash

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,960
human creativity doing so allows us to

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:18,000
focus on new opportunities

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,799
new ways to innovate

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,840
an ability to face the disruption of

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,640
unknown

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,440
without any borders or limits and true

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,240
open source

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:31,039
doesn't just mean open code it means

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:35,120
open development it means open processes

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:36,720
and open support sousa brings

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,960
peace of mind to the infrastructure

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,280
layer whether that be in the cloud

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,039
in a hybrid environment or on premise

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:46,080
and out to the edge

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:48,320
and as i mentioned we automate the we

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,159
strive to automate the mundane

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,840
to reduce human error and manual

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,880
processes

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,400
this is the power of of software-defined

00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,120
infrastructure

00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,440
so the power of many enhances our

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,919
ability to develop engaging

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,200
products and solutions where your

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,559
customers are at

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,480
or where they're going to be at

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,480
including places out on the edge

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,440
so by combining the thousands of open

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,640
source projects

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,679
into a solid flexible innovative

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,080
solutions

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,000
we can solve challenges in today's

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,840
rapidly changing world

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:32,320
the key is a solid consistent framework

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:34,080
of simplify modernize and accelerate

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,480
and that's my presentation for today

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,480
thank you

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,919
that's awesome thank you very much alan

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,000
um great presentation thank you and

00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,240
before we actually get across to the q

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,200
a so just to remind people if you would

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,039
like to ask um

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,520
alan a question just um fly your

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:54,000
question into the into the chat

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,559
um but before we we go there i'd like to

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,159
announce

00:21:54,559 --> 00:22:01,919
um our two uh finals t-shirt winners

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:05,280
um the first is um i believe this is

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:08,640
xavier uh from ibm

00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,039
and who says sylvia from lloyd's banking

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,320
group

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:14,640
um well done you've um both won um

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,559
a fitness t-shirt we'll get in contact

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,159
with you in order to get your

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:23,520
um details um and yeah we'll ship that

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,640
um so before everybody uh puts a

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,080
question into the chat

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,520
i've actually got a question for you

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:32,320
adam my question to you is

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,000
do you have an example of where susa is

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,000
currently found in banking

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,960
that may not be realized within the

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,280
finance community

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,720
that's a very good question james and

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,600
i'm not going to name any companies

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,799
because uh

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,200
the example i'll give you is actually

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:49,600
one where i can't um so

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,600
we very much it's it's easy to think of

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,480
suse particularly in the

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,679
analytics and analysis risk analysis

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,840
space

00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,520
we're very prevalent in the core data

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,760
centers right

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,240
running mission critical services

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:07,760
particularly like the analytics

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,919
and so forth lesser known is when we

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,559
push out towards the edge so

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:15,039
uh running exclusively out and and clear

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,840
out into embedded systems like atms for

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,760
example

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,280
but out into the field offices and so

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,520
forth and a lot of times

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,720
it goes back to this model as i talked

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,520
about earlier

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,280
asusa very much works with partners

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,720
works with his customers and works with

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,799
open source

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,720
and a lot of solutions are actually

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,640
delivered through our partners

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,360
and so sometimes you'll find that those

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,240
solutions has susa embedded

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,000
and you don't realize it so you may be

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,039
running those solutions and you don't

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,279
even realize

00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,039
that they're sitting there so we're

00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,240
scattered throughout these businesses

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,720
and as i mentioned before

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,320
four out of the five top world banks are

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,000
running susa so

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,600
so we're there in the data center we're

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,320
well known in the data center but we

00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,360
extend

00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,520
clear out to the edge

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,720
right that's great and my next question

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,960
to you is um

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,240
for anybody on the call who is actually

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,279
looking to accelerate

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,279
engineering within the finance industry

00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,520
can you give an example of how they can

00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,159
actually engage with cser in order to

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,760
really

00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:20,799
accelerate that digital transformation

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,120
so i would say let's uh let's well

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,480
there's

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,159
there's a couple different layers here

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,600
when you think about that question right

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,679
as a developer

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,760
the best way to engage with sousa is

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,799
through the open source communities

00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,320
um we're very much focused in into

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:37,039
the communities and working with the

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,279
communities everything we do

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,240
and develop we push back into open

00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:45,120
source

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,120
and so you'll find um our engineers

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,360
and uh alliance folks and so forth are

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,000
actually engaged

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,760
uh within those communities at the

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,600
executive levels

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,760
even our customer executives and so

00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,720
forth get engaged with

00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:03,120
these communities and at the executive

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,039
levels we we try to be

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,320
like i mentioned earlier our dna is

00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,240
being open

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,480
um so we're very much reaching out to

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,600
meet with even the executives

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,919
through forums and so forth um

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,360
so as a developer i would particularly

00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,400
say let's meet up in

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:23,200
in the in the open source communities

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,200
and work together

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,159
that's great my um my final question so

00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,960
i'm hogging the the airwaves here

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:34,880
um so looking at the caesar organization

00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,600
on github let's say github.com i can see

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,559
that you have

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,159
309 repositories um within that

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,320
organization

00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,320
can you kind of give us some guidance on

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:48,159
where engineers should actually go to

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:50,640
in order to you know understand um

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,279
the organization and also where to start

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,880
if um

00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,640
you know there are any good first issues

00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,240
or you know any

00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,760
um issues that people can actually

00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,440
engage with um

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,760
from within the open source community

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,559
sure yeah there's a variety of there's a

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,000
variety of

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:08,000
uh components or i wouldn't say products

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,720
but components and open source projects

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,200
out there

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:15,760
under github under susa some of those

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,440
i actually haven't gone out to analyze

00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,360
you know the percentages but

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,279
i would suspect a lot of those are

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,880
actually folded into the opensuse

00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,880
community

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,799
i know some of those are are folded

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,919
under uh some of the other

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:34,080
projects um seuss is involved with many

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:35,279
as i mentioned uh a wide variety of open

00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,240
source projects out there in the

00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,559
communities

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,240
um all the way from you know cloud

00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:43,520
foundry to the linux kernel

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:46,400
right and um

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,039
so it's not just the repositories that

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,919
you see

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:52,559
out under seuss's name and github but

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:55,200
those projects within

00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,799
um several foundations out there as well

00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,000
right so we're pushing changes we're

00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:01,279
bushing

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,640
code into cloud foundry into gcc

00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:07,760
into the linux kernel and so forth

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,760
so the so the best way to engage uh

00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,760
is to go to those communities of

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,520
interest right go to

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,360
where that those repositories are

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,760
pointing to to the communities that are

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,960
associated with those repositories

00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:23,840
and me meet up with this

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,520
in their communication channels and

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,880
again those vary depending on what the

00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,240
communities are right it could be

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,279
everything from irc

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,559
to mailing lists to slack channels and

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,159
so forth so

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:37,039
we like to communicate through the

00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,559
community channels

00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,799
right that's great and i'd like to say

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,279
thank you to mike nelson for actually

00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:45,679
