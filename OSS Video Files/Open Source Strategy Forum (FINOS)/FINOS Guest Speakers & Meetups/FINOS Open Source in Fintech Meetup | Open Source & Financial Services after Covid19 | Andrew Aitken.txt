00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,680
interrupt me as i go through my

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,480
presentation here and i'll be happy to

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,800
answer them so a little bit more about

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,720
my background this is actually my 21st

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,840
year in open source and i i do believe i

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,840
was probably the

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,920
one of the first people to to wear a

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,879
suit uh in open source

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,440
after the original uh leaders and

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,840
founders of of the movement uh

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,640
the folks would be the evangelists and

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,640
the folks with the

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,159
the knowledge and passion to create this

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,120
whole new uh

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,120
technology and wave building and

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,519
software and licensing model and

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,519
so on and i came in right after a lot of

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,879
the original founders and again

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,040
probably probably the first person to

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,120
wear a suit in in open source

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,640
so i'm going to share a bit of

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,080
information today

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:59,200
uh around the uh our journey

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,480
uh as as an industry and as a society

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,519
through kogit

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,159
uh i'll talk about uh some of the

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,280
elements or aspects and dynamics of of

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,760
open source and

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,439
and how i think they can really help us

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,680
uh not only

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,439
create a you know get through this in in

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,799
a much more smooth manner and

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,799
and also present us with some

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,280
opportunities so that's really the

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,400
the gist of the presentation we'll focus

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,960
on three

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,720
three particular aspects of open source

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,160
that i think have real efficacy for

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,520
today and that's

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,560
cost optimization inner source and

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,560
community engagement

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,120
so as as we know and for those of you

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,880
who are

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,320
who are in financial services today

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,880
you're you're probably much more aware

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,000
of this than i

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,320
am but broadly speaking coveted is

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,680
having an impact across regulatory

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,440
regulatory and governance

00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:01,120
issues financial obviously operational

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,960
and and the people and uh for today's

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,800
conversation regulatory and governance

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,160
are kind of out of the purview of

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,840
this presentation but we'll talk a

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,720
little about financial

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,120
uh operational and the people aspect and

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,880
how

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,639
open source can have a positive impact

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,440
on on all three of those

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,440
uh elements

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:24,160
so in preparing for this presentation i

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,759
i did a lot of research and i read

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,479
through reports from

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,000
firms like pwc and deloitte and

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,639
accenture i read through our own

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,720
internal analysis which we produce

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,680
i read through what our clients are

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,240
saying about

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,880
about the covet journey he really was

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,440
able to

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,320
you know really boil it down to kind of

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,400
three different

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,280
aspects or elements of the journey that

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,520
we're going to go through

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,479
different firms are at different stages

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,240
of this journey

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,160
but essentially we have survive which is

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,120
keeping the lights on making sure things

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,960
work keeping

00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,560
keeping people working keeping them

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:03,440
happy focused motivated and engaged

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,840
the second stage is around stabilizing

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,319
that

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,360
building resiliency in your organization

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,520
in your operations

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,880
and taking a little time to reflect upon

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,880
what your learnings are

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,240
and what you've seen that's working and

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,880
what's not working

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,080
to help us help help your organizations

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,160
and your clients

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,919
through the cova journey and then the

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,759
last stage is to thrive is to

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,560
operationalize what you've learned

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,520
works to institutionalize it inside your

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,080
organization

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,080
and to focus on innovation creating the

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,960
new business models connecting with your

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,280
clients your partners your supply chain

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,000
and

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,720
in different ways than you have in the

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,360
past

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,479
and again this is this is my extract

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,759
from all my readings

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:49,840
this is how the lowest common

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,840
denominator of our journey

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,140
there's another journey that we as a

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,319
society are going through

00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,880
[Music]

00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,240
during this pandemic and really in in a

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,720
pre-covered world

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,840
in a pre-coveted environment we were

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,400
very focused on

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,280
on the physical world and that has so

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,360
dramatically

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,319
changed in just the last three three to

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,560
four months

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,000
today we've moved to a much more much

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,800
more of a virtual world

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,759
for all of our good services supplies

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,599
even our human

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,400
relationships and connections have

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:25,520
become virtually in many instances 100

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,680
100 virtual

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,560
and as we go along this journey we're

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,639
going to find

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,240
a new normal you don't know what that is

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,000
at least i don't and

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,680
and most folks i don't believe know what

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,599
that new normal is but it's going to

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,960
it's not going to go back to the way it

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,960
was before

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,879
okay so so post covet post this pandemic

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,400
we will find the new normal and it will

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,199
be somewhere

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,280
probably closer to the middle between uh

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,639
the physical world that we came from

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,800
and the virtual world that we're

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,960
experiencing right now

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,280
and open source has a has also has a

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,560
role to play in the societal journal

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,560
journey that we're going through

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,080
so today as many of you are probably

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,280
aware open source already

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,960
is a large part

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,960
of the it ecosystem for

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,280
financial services and it's not it's

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,560
become much more than a set

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,080
uh or collection of languages and

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,240
frameworks and databases

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,199
it's recognized as having a much more of

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,240
a strategic

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:38,560
impact on on

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,240
on your i.t ecosystems

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,159
and it's you have organizations like

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,719
capital one they're building the open

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,800
source

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,000
key software building consortiums around

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,080
it you in

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,320
within finno west you have goldman jp

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,279
deutsche bank and others who are open

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,560
sourcing

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:57,040
really interesting pieces of software so

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,680
the financial services organizat despite

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,959
being a

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:04,480
highly regulated typically conservative

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:06,640
conservative organization or industry

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,640
is really leading the way in open source

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,760
today outside of what i would call the

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,600
dot-com or the internet company sector

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,640
right doing really really interesting

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:20,480
stuff and in our experience

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:23,519
open source is really 100

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,800
penetrated fully at the mission critical

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,519
production level

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,519
in all financial services organizations

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:33,200
today

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:37,200
the other the other aspect to note

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,640
is one of the foundations of open source

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,160
one of the reasons that it has to be

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,839
continued to be taken even more

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,959
seriously by financial services

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:48,480
is this is where innovation

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:50,560
happens this is where developers are

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,760
coming when you look at platforms like

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,360
github and

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,360
and others out there you look at

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,920
foundations like apache or linux

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,920
foundation or

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,240
part of you see the growth in the

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,920
developer ecosystem

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,320
is incredible uh just a few years ago

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,440
uh the octaver stats from from github

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,160
said there they had

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,680
around 10 to 12 million developers now

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,959
well over 40 million

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:20,399
and continuing to grow we're seeing in

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,600
one study i did let's use about six

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,279
months ago

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,200
looked at the top ten banks

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,240
representation on github and they had

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,360
over 5000

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:32,800
projects top 10 global banks

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,200
so your industry your vertical

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,959
is deeply embedded in the overall eco

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,360
open source ecosystem

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,320
and it's only going to continue to be

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:47,839
even more

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:47,839
more important over time

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,120
so i'm trying to move forward here

00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,160
so the journey we're on today can be

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,200
made a little bit easier by open source

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,800
and this is what we're going to talk

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,079
about

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:09,360
for the remain if you look at

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:12,399
the journey survive stabilize and thrive

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,839
uh elements there are three key aspects

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,399
of open source that can have

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,160
a real positive impact for financial

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,800
services organizations one is

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,680
what we call portfolio optimization so

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,959
that's

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,880
looking through your portfolio and

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,640
identifying where open source may make

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,760
sense to migrate to

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,880
and i've put these arrows in here

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,040
carefully to suggest where i believe

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,800
that organizations should begin to take

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,560
on this type of activity

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,560
uh if you're still in that survival

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,640
stage it's a bit early to try and look

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,279
at shaking up your application portfolio

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,240
so

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,600
get a little bit further down that path

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,519
inner source

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,600
which is the application of open source

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,720
best practices with inside your firewall

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,639
that's something that

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,880
you should begin looking at as quickly

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,040
as you possibly can

00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,920
and engaging more deeply and broadly

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,000
across the

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,920
the uh open source community again

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,600
if you're still in that survival stage

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,000
you might want to wait until you get a

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,920
little bit further down that path

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,680
and then begin to look at how you can

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,120
get more broadly engaged

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,920
in the open source community and let's

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,920
talk about why

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,480
so again portfolio optimization is

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,800
really

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,760
taking a close look at your application

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,800
portfolio

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,680
and trying to figure out and understand

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,880
where

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,880
migrating to open source may make sense

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,720
some of the key aspects of this are

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,920
really understanding

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,720
what your existing application portfolio

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,880
what the each individual application's

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,160
value is to the organization

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:53,120
how it's being utilized you know are

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,880
are you using 10 of your current uh

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,480
licenses are using 90

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,160
what about the level of functionality of

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,639
those applications that you're using

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,320
that's a key consideration here when you

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,000
look at open source potential open

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,200
source candidates it's important to look

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,959
at the vitality

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,839
and the health of the community behind

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:13,600
it you want something that is definitely

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:15,200
on a growth path unless you are

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,120
when you're looking at moving

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,160
considering an open source application

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,200
that would be in a production

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,560
environment

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,240
if you're looking to use something that

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,240
for more innovation

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,720
or more development then maybe you're

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,680
little bit less concerned about how

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,720
mature the community is today and just

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,240
more interested in

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,399
in the underlying kind of innovativeness

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,600
of the core technology

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,720
and one of the the most important

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,480
aspects to look at

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,639
when when considering whether or not to

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,079
move and migrate to an open source

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:50,079
application

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:54,720
is really the complexity of integration

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:57,360
so sometimes it may take two or three

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,399
independent open source applications to

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,560
replace the

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,680
functionality of a piece of proprietary

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,360
software

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,519
and so understanding what the level of

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,160
integration amongst those

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,519
uh amongst those softwares is really

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,760
really important

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,560
because that that's one of those make or

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,720
break type

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,600
of uh aspects of migrating to open

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,800
source

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,199
so some of the benefits that we've seen

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,760
for

00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,560
organizations is really the ability to

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,160
simplify

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,839
and to monitor modernize your

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,079
application portfolio

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,199
right most open source applications

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,880
today are

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:36,240
are based on a set of common denominator

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,560
technologies and so

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:42,000
it does give you the ability to to both

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,440
simplify and modernize your portfolio

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,040
there's an adage when you're looking at

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,000
the cost of open source it's important

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,839
to look at tco versus roi

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,519
because in when as you make that

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,320
transition sometimes the initial

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,920
investments

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,839
can take some time and energy and

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,279
resources and costs and so on and so the

00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,399
initial roi

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,360
might not be positive but kind of the

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,360
mathematical

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,240
adage is that the more open source you

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,160
use over the longer period of time

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,480
the more financial benefit will accrue

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,480
to you

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,639
we do see uh improved quality and

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,279
security

00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,440
when moving to uh open source

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:22,240
applications and and some people still

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,160
hesitate around that security bit if you

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,079
look at all the studies

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,079
that have come out over the last decade

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:32,079
comparing open source

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:33,680
uh open source uh security violations

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:38,480
versus proprietary

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:41,120
they're about equal so the number of

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,680
of issues between proprietary and open

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,560
sources

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,440
is is about the same but where open

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,000
source has

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,639
a very strong value proposition is in

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,759
its remediation

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:56,079
so there is really no software company

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,519
on the planet who can remediate a

00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,759
security issue

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:03,199
as quickly as the open source community

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:06,079
and that has been proven numerous times

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,440
and then you also by deploying open

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,279
source applications you do

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,720
you can improve your business agility

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,560
and your responsiveness

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,360
just by the nature of having code that

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,759
is open it allows you to do to customize

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,560
to specific existing needs and to

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,000
anticipate

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:25,360
future needs that proprietary software

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,560
is not typically built to impor

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:31,360
to incorporate and

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,000
in our experience and working with

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,240
customers

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,040
and also through the research we've done

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,800
we've seen

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,399
improvements in the 10 to 20 percent

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,440
range across all these

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,800
all of these elements in some cases we

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:51,279
see tco

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:53,680
reaching 40 percent

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,199
let's talk briefly about about inner

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,560
source and its value to financial

00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,839
services during this

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,199
this journey so really inner source is

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,600
the application of the

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:06,160
of open source developments best

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,160
practices

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,760
i'm getting a little bit of feedback

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:20,079
okay so intersource is not about

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,760
open source projects or technology it's

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,280
about the development model

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,679
itself and so it's taking the best

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,439
practices it's about the the culture the

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,320
processes the methodologies and the

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,559
tools and applying that to

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,720
inside the firewall essentially creating

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:37,280
internal open source communities

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,440
the key benefits really are around its

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,840
ability to drive collaboration

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,919
it's transparency and even the

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,600
meritocracy the ability ability for

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,600
people who participate

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,200
to have an impact and make their own

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,000
decisions and really feel

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,760
empowered the three key components are

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,400
are that ethos

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,280
are a set of processes processes have to

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,000
include

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,200
kpis there has to be a governance model

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,160
there has to be a risk

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,120
model built when deploying an

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,960
intersource

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,280
program and then of course you have to

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:15,840
have a set of tools that facilitate this

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:15,840
this collaboration and transparency

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,799
so some of the key benefits for

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,240
financial services during this

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,280
this journey is we've seen an improved

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,200
time to market

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,559
you know collaboration across the value

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,440
chain of

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,559
innovation and product development and

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,280
product deployment

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,240
when you engage not just developers but

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,559
you engage

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,600
your business community your analysts

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,000
and others

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,679
in this process we've seen significant

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,679
uh improved time to market you have

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,559
organizations like kaiser that have

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:50,000
talked about anywhere from 12 to 20

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,600
percent improvement in their time to

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
market

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,840
increased developer productivity really

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,799
the

00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:03,120
collaboration breeds energy

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:06,640
and this energy causes the developers

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:09,440
to produce more code right and

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,080
and that's a key benefit of of inner

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,000
source

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,280
the improved code quality so it's that

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,520
adage of

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,600
open source many eyes make for shallow

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:21,280
bugs

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,840
but many eyes also make people want to

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,360
develop

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:28,880
better code so we've clearly seen

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,799
for those organizations that are

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,080
operating through an inner source or

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,679
have some inner source

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,200
groups operating on in your source model

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,840
have definitely seen

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,200
a real improvement in code quality and

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,640
then one of the challenges particularly

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,080
for financial services

00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,600
um is this notion you know i've talked

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,240
to a number of organizations and they

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,000
say

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,840
we've got literally one organization

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,160
said we've got 400

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,280
uh agile teams and we've managed to

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,320
create 400

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:58,640
silos and had another conversation with

00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,760
a large uk bank and they said we have

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,679
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,159
uh agile teams and we've managed to

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,640
create 600 silos

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,679
so inner source is a way to create what

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,799
what i call a

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:13,200
effective distributed agile model again

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,799
through this notion of of collaboration

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,720
and transparency

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,080
we've seen it have a real positive

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,000
impact on

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,200
on agile during these times when there's

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,840
so when

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,360
everybody has has moved to a distributed

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,760
a work from home model

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,440
this is something that can really have a

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,200
huge impact

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:35,840
on development teams for financial

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,840
services organizations

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,120
and lastly i want to talk about

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,120
community engagement

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,200
again it's something that i highly

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,080
recommend that

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,200
financial services organizations embrace

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,120
more broadly

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,120
and it's really community engagement is

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,840
both an art and a science but the

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,720
success

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,880
but being successful really helps with

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,200
developer productivity and satisfaction

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,039
increased innovation and higher quality

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,600
and more secure software

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,640
and there are three aspects really as

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,679
you consume

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:12,240
more open source you are by default

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,679
becoming more engaged in the community

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,600
the second stage is typically to

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,640
actively contribute that may be patches

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,320
or fixes or documentation or whatnot

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,320
and then kind of the third step of

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,159
community engagement is by publishing

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,280
your own software and that's a

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:29,039
we're seeing that become a

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:33,200
what i would call actually a wholesale

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:35,039
movement within financial services

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,039
but there's also something important to

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,559
recognize when you publish open source

00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,880
publishing your own software's open

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,000
source we had one organization we were

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,600
working with that was really really

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,720
enthusiastic about this and wanted to

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,840
open source

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,200
a number of their own applications the

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,200
challenge for them is they hadn't even

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,159
considered going to github or other

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,159
repositories

00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,120
applications they wanted to to open

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,919
source had already been

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,440
already been done and after going

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,960
helping them go through that exercise

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,320
they realized about

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,240
some of the applications they wanted to

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,559
open source had already been done

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,240
as well or better and existed in the

00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,440
open source ecosystem today so that's

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,600
just one

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,000
one activity to go through before you

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,080
consider open sourcing your own software

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,280
now some of the benefits that we see

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,760
there is

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:27,840
definitely improved recruitment and

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,840
retention which is critical today

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,720
developers simply want to work on open

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,679
source software

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,280
right that's that's where we are many of

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,720
the graduates coming out of school

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,320
that's what they've learned on they

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,200
expect to work on open source they

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:46,080
expect to work in a collaborative

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,400
environment in a collaborative model and

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,039
they just like working on open source

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,600
i would say probably 75 to 80 percent of

00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,280
the it

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,799
executives that i that i have

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,320
conversations with

00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,080
this is one of the first things they

00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,039
bring up as to why they're getting more

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,640
and more involved

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:06,640
in open source okay and and during these

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:10,159
these challenging times this is a real

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:13,039
real benefit for for

00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,159
your organizations increased innovation

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,840
it's this notion of what i call

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,200
secondary innovation so you can

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,080
take the existing innovation that that

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,080
open source

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,720
has already created in whatever

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,480
application that has particular interest

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,080
and again this is something that i've

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,480
heard directly from our clients back to

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,520
me

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,200
large financial organizations said one

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,200
of the key values of getting engaged in

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,799
the community is the ability to take

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,120
take exis take innovation

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,720
that happens in this broader community

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,240
and then tailor it

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,000
to our specifics our context tailored to

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,480
the requirements of our particular

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,240
vertical of our industry

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:57,440
and that drives this notion of internal

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,960
secondary innovation

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,799
there's also the ability to drive

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,400
increased productivity by engaging more

00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,799
deeply in the open source

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,080
open source community again this is how

00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:10,640
developers like to operate

00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,320
and they want to be able to be active to

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,200
contribute to be seen as active

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,039
contributor

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,840
and so again that helps drive

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,840
productivity and then

00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,440
lastly is trust and that's one of the

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,880
one of the other takeaways from

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,240
the research i did in prep for this

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,320
presentation is this notion that

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,279
financial services organizations need to

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,919
focus on

00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:34,080
continuing to enhance or grow their

00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,559
trust in the brand within

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,039
uh with their customer base and with

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:42,080
their partners

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:43,120
in in financial services and so by being

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,360
engaged being

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,960
transparent being seen as an active

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,840
contributor within the open source

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,480
community

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,200
it helps build trust because your

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,559
actions

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,880
are visible and seen

00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,080
and so being engaged in the community

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,840
can can really

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:04,400
truly help your brand

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,200
and help your visibility and again help

00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,200
you grow trust

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,840
so i'll conclude on that note

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,880
that you really just wanted to share a

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,919
few of the aspects of

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,400
of or elements of open source that i

00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,440
believe

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:26,400
can truly help us all get through

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,080
the the pandemic journey that we're on

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,480
and help us

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,240
take advantage of what the new normal

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,200
would look like whenever we come out on

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,200
the other end today

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,080
so that's um that's amazing andrew thank

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,320
you very much for your presentation

00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,120
um and before we actually get to

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,360
questions

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,279
so if anybody's got any questions um

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,120
feel free to put them in the chat now

00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,559
um but before we get to that i'd like to

00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,640
actually announce

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,159
uh the winners of the finnos t-shirts so

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,799
that gives some people a little bit of

00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,559
time to

00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,080
you know start keying in their questions

00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,400
in chat so

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,440

we'll be in contact with you to get your

00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,760
congratulations

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:29,039
um so coming back to questions andrew

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:31,360
um i have a question for you um knowing

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,120
that you've been observing you know how

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,960
businesses and firms have actually been

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:39,120
adapting um to the covet 19 situation

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,159
do you have any top immediate

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,200
interventions

00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:46,240
um for firms that they can actually um

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:52,080
partake in now in order to to accelerate

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:56,240
into that distributed way of working

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:58,640
so i i i think it's in in that second

00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,480
stage of the journey that i talked about

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,159
where we're trying to and many i know

00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,760
many financial services organizations

00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:07,200
have got through that survive

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:10,640
they've implemented their their

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:13,919
kind of enhanced business continuity

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:17,440
practices uh is really

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,919
take a moment to reflect on your open

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,120
source

00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,159
footprint today are you just a consumer

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,799
of open source

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,480
and historically that's been fine but

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,320
the industry is changing

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,960
today you need to be more actively

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,600
engaged and there's a lot that can be

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,720
learned

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:38,399
from the open source community so

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:42,159
i would say understand where you are

00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:44,559
today and then understand how

00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:49,840
how you can get more benefit from a

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:49,840
deeper and broader engagement

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:57,440
so that's amazing thank you very much um

00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,039
and in your opinion i know that um wipro

00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,600
are actually members of finos

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,960
um would you recommend or you know would

00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,399
you recommend that people actually

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,279
explore you know different types of

00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,520
foundations

00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:09,600
you know to understand how you know

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,240
communities that are already engaging in

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,960
open source you know can teach others

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,559
how to

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:19,279
you know engage in this way of working

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,720
absolutely we were the first global

00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:23,600
systems integrator to

00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,600
instantiate a focused or dedicated open

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:29,279
source practice and today we're

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:32,159
a member of 10 plus foundations and

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:33,279
probably active in 25 different

00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,000
communities

00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,880
uh and yet we're still learning all the

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,600
time and one

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,279
one one thing to understand is not all

00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,200
communities not all foundations are

00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:46,080
created equal you can't create

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,120
a an engagement model that of one size

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,279
fits all

00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,240
you have to understand the individual

00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:53,520
the dynamics

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,760
of how each one works how you know code

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,120
is contributed how it's accepted how it

00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,640
evolves

00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:03,360
uh who the key players are

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,159
so again we're even though we're fairly

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,799
advanced

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,159
we're still on our own our own journey

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,919
our own learning journey and

00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:13,840
and learn something from the community

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,840
every day

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:19,039
okay so um i do actually have a question

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,279
that's coming from

00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,240
uh paul hunter um thank you very much

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:25,360
for asking us

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,840
so how is open source suited to smaller

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,159
fintech startups and emerging markets

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:34,080
where the community is less robust

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,080
and the industry is skeptical

00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,200
very good question so if i understand

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,399
it's regarding how do fintechs get

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,120
engaged well

00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:45,520
i would be surprised today if any

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:48,720
fintech

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,279
if their offerings weren't partially

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,799
based

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:56,159
on open source technologies

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:58,480
i just would be very very shocked

00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,279
your offerings may be proprietary in

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,600
nature

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:03,279
but i'm sure that some of the underlying

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,120
components or foundation of those

00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,080
offerings are are again based on open

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,880
source so

00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,200
identifying which of those are important

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,279
uh

00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,360
and getting engaged i mean if your

00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:15,279
products are are based on

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,720
you know new innovative open source

00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:20,240
technologies

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:22,159
like uh like um

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,840
anything related you know many of these

00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,679
applications in the in the cloud native

00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,520
computing foundation cncf

00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,799
related to the kubernetes technology

00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,799
ecosystem

00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,720
you know if if your offerings are based

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,919
on some of these you have to be engaged

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,960
you have to understand

00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:40,080
how and where and why it's evolving

00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,880
right so that's that's one step and for

00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,440
those that are

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,559
that are still skeptical there's so much

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,559
public data

00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,919
available today to help overcome that

00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:51,120
skepticism

00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:54,320
uh whether it's around cyber security or

00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:57,279
compliance or support support

00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:59,519
is definitely a challenge um you know

00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:02,000
the demand for open source

00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:03,519
developers exceeds the capacity of those

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,640
developers and that's going to continue

00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,760
for

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:10,640
for this foreseeable future but there

00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:14,240
are still ways to build a multi-tiered

00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:18,720
support model that should help overcome

00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:20,640
some of that potential skepticism

00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,559
right that's excellent thank you andrew

00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,640
and we have time for one more question

00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,919
um which is coming from amanda brock of

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,559
open uk

00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:30,840
um what recommendations does andrew have

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,559
for companies finding their way to inner

00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,720
source

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,760
there are well it's interesting amanda

00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,840
brings that up

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,640
uh there are some public sources

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:42,559
available for that

00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,720
such as the inner source commons there

00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,120
are some public case studies today you

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,480
can

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,480
look at some organizations like i

00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,080
mentioned kaiser and i think

00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,080
thompson reuters has actually been

00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,360
public about a use case and uh

00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,840
i mean some of the work they've done in

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:59,279
the past so have some others

00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,399
uh paypal and so on so there is some

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,080
some publicly
