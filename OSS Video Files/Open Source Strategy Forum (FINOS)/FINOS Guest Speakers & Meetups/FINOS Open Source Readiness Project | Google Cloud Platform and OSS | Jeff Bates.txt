[Music]

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,880
so

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,439
i wanted to take some time this morning

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,119
to uh talk a bit about kind of google's

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,439
roots in open source

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,720
uh my role at this point is really more

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,119
focused on

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,920
uh uh open source and commercial

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,119
enablement

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,160
on top of gcp uh google cloud platform

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,320
itself

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,320
but i think given the nature of kind of

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,200
the folks who are on here

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,559
um and as well as just you know kind of

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,600
some of the background material i

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,480
thought i would

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,480
kind of more focus on how what google's

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,120
open source journey has been and what we

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,399
have found

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,879
you know has worked for us and what

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,440
hasn't worked as well um

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,719
the thing that i would say is you know i

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,160
have the chat open

00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,199
um if you all have questions uh

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,440
that come up while i'm presenting um you

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,640
know

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,119
please feel free to either ask uh ask in

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,600
the

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,799
uh chat window or as aaron just said

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,799
unfortunately

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,320
feel free to break in and ask questions

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,080
then as well

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,080
um so so

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,840
we're going to start out with uh you

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,960
know google has been

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,119
in the business of you know well open

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,479
source for about the last 20 years or so

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:30,240
at this point

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:32,560
um sorry i'm waiting for the window to

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,880
catch up here

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,479
we started out with you know kind of

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,000
first releases of really

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,240
dense developer tools um and really

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,479
you know you look back 20 years that was

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,799
really kind of driven by the engineers

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,159
and

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,399
you know honestly the founders of the

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,320
company at that point who wanted to

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,360
contribute back to things that

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,200
you know we had written internally um

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,200
those kind of first releases were

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,920
important ones for the company to kind

00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,439
of get its

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,439
you know its grounding in its feet

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,560
within the open source world

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,880
and kind of set ourselves up

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,959
for the eventual release of you know

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,840
management of iconic projects like

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,440
you know android or chromium or go or

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,720
something like that

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,560
um you know one of the uh

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,760
i guess is both a joke and true

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,160
statement is

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,879
that i get asked often well how does

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,239
google manage its open source projects

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,800
uh the reality is is that we have tried

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,239
basically every method to manage them if

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,800
you look at the difference you look at

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,599
the difference between where it is where

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,879
chromium is operated or go is operated

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,920
we've got different government

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,560
structures

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,680
you know kubernetes is part of the you

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,680
know

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,120
part of the cncf which is part of the

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,760
linux foundation

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,680
whereas you know istio is being managed

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,440
internally

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,160
so we have i would not say was exactly a

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,519
plan

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,800
but we definitely have tried a wide

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,040
variety of ways

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,720
of kind of running these large-scale

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,280
projects as well

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,360
um you know and that has now kind of

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,879
driven into some more interesting areas

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,920
too so some of the questions that we're

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,400
dealing with now

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,840
is you know how do we handle the

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,720
overwhelming success

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,640
of something like tensorflow and how do

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,120
we then present it to our customers with

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,159
cloud

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,840
ai at that point and you know there's

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,000
interesting questions like what does it

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,720
mean to release kubernetes as open

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,640
source

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,879
but then be shipping it to our customers

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,159
as gke and anthos as well

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:39,680
um so hopefully we'll be able to hit on

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:42,400
a number of those points um

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,040
so first and foremost uh you know google

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,000
itself

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,040
is basically a an expression of open

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,280
source

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:53,360
um you know it is what the company is

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,480
is it's a bunch of different operating

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,080
systems we

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,760
wrote a bunch of stuff on top of those

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,319
operating systems

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,360
and we have embraced it from the

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,840
beginning

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:08,319
um you know and so the thing that i

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,599
it sounds very kind of hand wavy or

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,000
wishy-washy

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,080
um but it is really built into the

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,359
mentality of how people

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,120
do code development internally um

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,040
you know the code is made broadly

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,800
available across all the different you

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,919
know product areas so that people from

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,040
different teams can

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,520
inspect can use you know can uh you know

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,240
came

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,639
uh can make use of the code i will say

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,280
as much as i would like that to lead to

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,040
there being a reduction of you know

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,080
duplicate efforts in different parts of

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,639
the company

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,720
the reality is is that of course there

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,120
continues to be duplication of efforts

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,680
because that's how humans work

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,919
however by you know bringing those kind

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,800
of principles of open source internally

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,880
and i think it was tim o'reilly and like

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,440
2002 who coined the phrase

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,919
inner source we've been able to also

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,560
bring

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,560
some of the open source methodologies to

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,440
you know our inner source methodologies

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,199
as well

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,199
of trying to make code be broadly

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:11,280
available broadly distributed and

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:14,479
reusable as much as possible

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,680
so uh we'll walk through kind of a a

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:20,240
short history inside of here um

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,919
we were you know historically speaking

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,400
early adopters what you're looking at

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,759
here

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,720
is actually one of the early uh uh early

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,800
pictures of

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,560
of the network it was our last

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,880
heterogeneous network

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,880
um and we started out with writing

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,160
python on top of linux

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:41,680
data subsystems in c ad systems were

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,520
built on top of mysql back in 2001

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,280
and so you know the roots and the usage

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,199
of open source go back

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,280
you know it's well over two decades at

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,919
this point and that has really kind of

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,720
been the

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,560
you know underlying factor in how we

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,680
have done everything

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,400
um so one of the things that i wanted to

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,400
talk about

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,120
in particular was when you as a company

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,680
and i think

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,720
a lot of your organizations or in this

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,400
uh you know state

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,919
now uh begin contributing to

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,840
uh you know to to external projects so

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,440
for the very first one that google had

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,759
started with it was

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,520
early 2000 and it was contributing back

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,800
to the linux kernel

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,720
um we were very careful about how we

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,440
used it and what we did

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,840
all of the changes were kept in a

00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,680
sub-repository

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,960
and this is really the time frame where

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,199
the first uh

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,160
ospo the open source program off has

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,360
started

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,919
and uh the team's very first job at that

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,160
point

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:46,880
was compliance because as i think

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,000
most of you are well aware the one of

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,720
the biggest challenges

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,160
with working with open source is how do

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,680
you create a scalable

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:59,120
and reusable compliance process and

00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,520
that has been one of the uh

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,400
most important goals and most important

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,400
actions that the

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,080
jeff i lost your audio

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:19,199
ah there you go there

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,319
sorry about that my hub decided that

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:26,400
it did not want to display things so let

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,400
me just change back to the right camera

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,840
and everyone

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,319
your audience cut out again

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:44,319
okay there you are all right good

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:47,599
back on track i love usbc hubs no

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,599
really really i do

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,919
yes so anyway um as i was stating

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,520
one of the biggest problems that well

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,360
not biggest problems one of the biggest

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,000
work areas that we've had has been the

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,680
ongoing

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,560
side of compliance um

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,639
this has been i think by far the thing

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,680
that has remained the most common set of

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,080
work that we have had

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,520
throughout all of osbo and we will

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,039
continue to have in the future

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,720
so a lot of the work that we have that

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,360
goes into compliance

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,479
is simply around creating automated

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,319
tooling

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,840
that lets all of the different

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,160
engineering teams

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,360
be able to take code either that they

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,639
have written

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,000
or that they want to use and be able to

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,360
run it against

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
basically a set of license classifiers

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,120
and so what we will do inside of there

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,519
is

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,760
uh so let's say that you are getting

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,480
ready to release instead of code

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,279
um we use a unified internal launch

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,839
process

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,560
and the open source program team has

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:55,440
what a launch bit inside of there

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,000
and you as a external team let's say

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,600
you're

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,480
i don't know if you are a new team

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,360
releasing new

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,279
open source code you go through a more

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,800
you know kind of fine grain process

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,320
where we actually will

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,560
you know sit down review what you're

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,560
doing but over the long run for the

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,800
larger and more successful project

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,240
or you know kind of the longer running

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,600
project so like

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,519
angular or something like that um

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,760
we're able to do the training with the

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,600
team but after that point they're

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,959
able to continue doing their launches on

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,959
their own um

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,560
we give them sufficient tooling to be

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,959
able to run their own kind of

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,279
you know compliance testing if they ever

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,800
have questions you know particular legal

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,720
questions or something like that

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,160
we give them actually their sets of

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,240
office hours

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,399
um that you know people can attend

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,440
there's a mailing list as well

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:51,120
i will say one of the things that

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,800
uh we find to be challenging

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,240
uh in particular with kind of the

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,279
compliance side

00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,880
is actually more the ingestion of

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:02,640
uh agpl software and so one of the

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,920
things that we spend a fair amount of

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:09,440
time working with uh with internal teams

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:12,800
is trying to make sure they understand

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,920
how and when they can be using a gpl

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,640
software and what the usage of agpl

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,399
would mean

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:22,959
you know along with the rest of the yes

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,839
software that they're trying to use too

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,880
um

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:29,440
so you know the biggest things here was

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,720
it was starting small and starting

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,720
deliberately

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,800
and being able to take notes that you

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,040
know kind of went along with that

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,200
but quickly and by quickly i mean in the

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,680
order of year or two we were able to

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,600
bring

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,680
enough of the information approach that

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,959
we were able to you know make that

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,360
a much broader effort at that point um

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:52,079
and so you know part of the ways that we

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:55,200
built up that muscle strength internally

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:57,200
uh for being just

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,880
a better company at working with open

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,920
source was

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,839
a early commitment uh to the open source

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,640
projects that we rely on

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,320
and so that was important to us because

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,320
we wanted to ensure

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,000
as we relied on all of those you know

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,600
these different pieces of software that

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,880
they were getting a pipeline of new

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,800
contributors

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,720
the other thing that this meant by

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,399
running these programs like summer of

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,640
code or coden

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,480
um was it gave us a deep connection

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,640
directly with many of those projects

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,480
that we also relied on as well

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,920
and so one of the things that i i think

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,959
i would add uh

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,480
you know to your list as you're going

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,800
through and trying to figure out the

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,279
best way to chart these waters is

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,560
get a deep understanding of the open

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,560
source projects that you rely on and how

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,320
your team is also going to fit in and

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,519
work with those as well

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,440
um both because a you know rising tide

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,120
floats all boats but b

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,720
those are going to be groups and areas

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,519
that are going to be able to give your

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,800
broader team

00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:02,000
a lot of expertise and how to work um

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,680
you know so you know for instance we and

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,480
we've been working with the apaches

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,360
foundation since the beginning uh i

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,600
think we just

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,440
crossed 20 years of working together at

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,480
this point we're the first to sponsor

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,800
apache

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,079
you know with the linux foundation we

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,320
helped form it

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,639
and we continue to be deeply involved in

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:24,240
it sometimes in ways

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:27,440
that are all you know happiness and uh

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:30,000
you know rainbows and sometimes having

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,480
uh shall we say spirited disagreements

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,800
over

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,399
you know future directions of things but

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,240
you know that is part of the nature of

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,839
at least working within the broader open

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,839
source world

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:47,760
so you know as we have continued to grow

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:50,880
we release a lot of projects

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,040
so this data point is actually well now

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,560
out of date because

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,240
one of the things that we have been

00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:00,160
impacted with due to

00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,560
covet 19 uh is we had to change the

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,360
entire intern process for this

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,959
year so normally we have about 1100

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,760
undergrad interns

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,560
this year they are all working from home

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,200
and

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,639
you know have limited access to our

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,800
corporate hardware

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,000
um so what we did is all 1100 interns

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,200
are now working on open

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,680
source code and what that meant is all

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,839
the teams that were taking the interns

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,079
then had to either choose new prod you

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,959
know new areas for them to work on that

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,399
were previously open sourced or open

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:38,320
source the code

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:40,880
um much to our i guess i would say

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,160
pleasant surprise uh we found that the

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,320
vast majority

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,079
of all of the different product areas

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,320
that were looking for interns

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,560
went down the route of actually open

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,519
sourcing the code that they had

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,519
um so we suddenly went from i guess

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,959
we're up to like 20 000 projects or

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,399
something like that

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,399
but it's important to note that a bunch

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,480
of those projects are just kind of a

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,320
partial release of software

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,000
primarily for the purpose of making it

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,199
so that the interns would be able to

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,440
work on it

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,839
um and so one of the things that i would

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,680
add that

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,079
one of the things that makes running a

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,959
successful open source program office

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,320
uh challenging is figuring out where

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,680
you're going to be able to put your

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,519
actual resources

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,120
and you know kind of which projects are

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,639
going to support with it

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,040
and so what we've done with a lot of

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,120
things like these interim programs is

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,240
it's really kind of fire and forget

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,320
process

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,519
where it's okay you're taking this code

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,760
you're going to release it

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,760
we are going to give you a hard set of

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,040
guidelines for the licenses that you can

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,639
use to release it

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,079
you need to run these things through the

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,600
compliance engine

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,199
make sure that it doesn't violate

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,800
anything inside of there

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:53,120
but we're not doing a lot of kind of

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,120
hand build support that goes beyond that

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,279
so uh and i guess the other thing i i

00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,480
should add at this point is

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,959
uh currently we've got like 3 100 kind

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,560
of

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,959
seven-day actives on the different

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:08,639
projects that are associated with it

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:10,399
i would say as a as these as your own

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,079
program offices are getting up and

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,399
running those

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,079
those statistics like seven day actives

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,320
or other things like that

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,920
they're useful to have but you always

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,639
need to be able to ground that

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,199
in you know what the actual amount of

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,040
audience

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:29,199
interest is for something like that um

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,399
yeah like if your potential addressable

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,079
audience is like

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,000
a thousand people at a thousand

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,399
different organizations

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,199
well then you know having 107 day

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,440
actives is

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:45,680
a heck of a good number at that point

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:47,600
um so one of the questions that i often

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,680
end up having to address is you know

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:55,360
what are the motivations for

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:57,519
you know source code and release um

00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,360
because you know and i can tell from

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,480
some of the names of folks on here who

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,720
i've worked with before

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,480
these are questions that you all have

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,959
seen over the last you know 10

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,880
20 years of what's the value in

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,639
contributing to open source we're not

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,480
going to make money off of this i don't

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,720
see any point in doing this isn't

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,839
this additional time work things like

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,560
that

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,079
um you know the truth for reality is is

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,279
that yes releasing

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:25,040
code as open source is uh

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,800
extra work you know going through the

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,040
license classification

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,120
uh dealing with you know community

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,920
feedback and issues that are addressed

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,079
you know that come up from that that is

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,279
all definitely additional work

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:41,120
um however the thing is is that

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,920
you know it's it's the base value of

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,959
open source by the code being open

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,759
we can drill down and repair our

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,399
uh and enhance our own services that's

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,560
true

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,240
for other companies that will be using

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,360
code that we've released

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,040
it is also true for us using code that

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,680
has been released by

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,639
you know another organization at that

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,520
point

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,199
um using open source has allowed us in

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,240
the past to do something out of the

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,480
ordinary we

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,079
can use that source code without showing

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,120
our hand in what we're trying to do at

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,679
that point

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,280
um and so this kind of contribution back

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,000
to open sources

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,000
and really opened up a lot of kind of

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,120
experimental ways for us to work with

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,520
this as well

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,280
the other thing and this is particularly

00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,559
true you know for instance if you look

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,679
at kubernetes

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:34,720
uh no one is incentivized to hurt us

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,960
so in particular for organizations

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,559
like you know this group for instance or

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,160
other kind of more

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,760
uh industry focused groups finding areas

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,840
of open source projects

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:50,720
where that source code means that you

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,640
relieve a potential kind of in the

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,360
armor or weakness

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,640
it's uh i i guess it's co-option by

00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,200
cooperation

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,280
i should probably make that a an entry

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,080
in the slide i like that phrase

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,600
um but removing that kind of incentive

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,559
to you know have that competitive

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,320
pressure

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,640
is something that makes an appreciable

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,520
difference you know at some

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,000
now at some level the release of android

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,440
is

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,799
also about ensuring that you know we

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,080
have constructed a

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,880
big enough boat around android that

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,840
there isn't

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,360
a competing you know uh uh mobile

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,640
operating system that that would

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,840
displace us

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,120
because frankly even a google play

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,679
decoupled android

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,200
is still a better thing for google than

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,200
an entirely different

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,320
you know mobile operating system at that

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,520
point

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,320
um the other thing that open source

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,840
means is

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:50,559
that we can control our destiny um

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,400
you know that means yes kubernetes as i

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,919
said at the beginning kubernetes is part

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,080
of the cncf

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,520
however we also release kubernetes as

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,640
gke as well

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,160
so by you know donating kubernetes to

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,080
the cncf

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,640
we removed that kind of pain point of

00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,200
incentivization to hurt

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,799
us and gcp at that point while still

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,960
preserving our ability to

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,880
you know kind of innovate and uh move

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,200
things forward as well

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,240
um the last part that you know i think

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,480
the influence

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,480
computer science and industry and the

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,880
kind of google ethic

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,160
uh i could probably remove google ethic

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,400
and just say kind of

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,520
um you know software development writ

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,720
large

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,960
um it you know there is a

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,799
study that i was involved with with

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,559
kareem lakani who is

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:43,120
still at mit now that is gotta be almost

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,720
20 years old but one of the

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,679
one of the biggest outcomes from the

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,559
survey was most open source developers

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:53,440
identified the work that they did as you

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:55,679
know their primary creative passion

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,919
and you know compared it to writing

00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,720
music or writing poetry

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,280
you know which well thankfully for most

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,200
of us

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,760
uh it turns out writing software pays a

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:09,520
lot more than writing poetry or music

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:12,960
so that's worked out better for me um

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:17,120
but the thing is is that people

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,960
are people are motivated by

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,320
you know creative interest in what

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,120
they're working on

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,520
and being able to write an open source

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,559
code

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,480
being able to make it you know available

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,679
is not the primary motivator for

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,480
everybody

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,039
but for most people it makes a good

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,799
point

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,240
thank you tony and it's good to see you

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:39,360
again by the way uh

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,400
yes yes oh kareem he's such a good

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,520
person

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:48,240
um yes tony just corrected me he is at

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:50,400
hbs um it was his phd that was mit

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,760
with ericon hipple who is still a

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,360
wonderful person

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:57,919
um anyway so uh

00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,240
let's see so one of the things that does

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,720
come true with these motivations

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,240
is like for instance working within the

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,120
cloud space

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,320
we're trying to compete upon performance

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,880
of gcp

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,640
rather than the vendor lock-in side and

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,039
one of the ways that we can make that

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,760
point

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:18,400
is by you know contributing kubernetes

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:21,679
to the cncf at that point

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,120
um so let me kind of consolidate down

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,120
you know these different ways that we

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:29,600
operate um

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:32,960
so within google itself we've got

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:35,120
well as i half jokingly said earlier

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,799
we've essentially tried every method of

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,760
managing large scale open source

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,559
projects

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,520
that was definitely not planned but here

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,400
we are

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,880
um but you know oh and i should add so

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,520
the

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,559
uh the open source program office at

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,080
google we

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:54,559
are about 44 people in total um

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,159
that is a large number i let me break

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,799
that down a bit for you

00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,400
we've got about 15 people in the

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,520
engineering side

00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,280
um and you've got a split there where

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,520
about five of the people

00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,960
five of those engineers are actually

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,600
working on

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,760
patent search and being able to do kind

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,440
of uh searchable metadata

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,000
uh and then the rest of the team is

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,120
working on is focused on doing the

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,440
uh internal internal tooling side the

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,559
rest of the organization is really a

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,200
uh a program management group and does

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,400
things

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:34,159
like you know run cube flow or

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:36,159
you know does uh uh community management

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,880
for kubernetes or areas like that as

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,360
well

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,000
um so we've got a good size team the

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,000
problem is is

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,159
that's still not anything close to

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,960
servicing all of the needs that people

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,840
have

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,960
you know across all of google so we kind

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,159
of break things down

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:55,120
into these following categories which uh

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,559
we uncreativity uncreatively have names

00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,840
small medium and large

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:02,159
because well if the shoe fits wear it

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,360
um so we've got this example of small

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,400
and these are api

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:08,159
examples this is really uh i would say

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,400
about 60

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,760
months of source releases that we see

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,000
coming through

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,919
it's stuff where a team just wants to

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,360
make an api available

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:22,640
or it's a you know product group that

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,640
has code that they want to make open as

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,720
a you know example for how to talk to a

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,520
geo endpoint or something like that as

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,480
well

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,960
or sometimes it's simply a small product

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,559
that

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:37,679
um you know for example uh

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,640
there is your look this up because i'm

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,200
not making this

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,400
up one of the uh products that we

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,240
released is called

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:50,000
cauliflower vest it's an anagram

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:53,440
for file vault key escrow um because of

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,200
course you want to use anagrams for that

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,440
that was a small project that we wrote

00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,640
internally that addressed essentially

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,200
a feature oversight within

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,679
mac os's file vault and we use it as a

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,559
way

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,600
we released it to the world it lets a

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,760
enterprise do

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,640
the key escrow management for file vault

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,559
on the mac

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,320
letting you run a max lead at scale at

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,279
that point and that's kind of a good

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,120
example of

00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,960
you know some of these where it goes

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,440
from small to medium

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,320
you know medium are really teams that

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,200
are more like

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,799
five to ten people on a team um you know

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,880
in addition to file vault

00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,159
uh in addition to cauliflower vest we've

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,640
also released

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,960
um uh it's called what we call it mac

00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,919
pushy internally but it's a plug-in for

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,720
monkey

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,679
that again let's say enterprise do all

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,720
of its mac

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:46,159
uh mac os uh package maintenance

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,840
because apple's tools for that are well

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,080
turns out when you defund your

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,000
enterprise support group you don't build

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:56,080
any enterprise tools anymore

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,520
so we had to build all of the apple

00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,000
um enterprise tools and so those medium

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,360
efforts

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,159
are things where you know what we as the

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:09,279
open source program office team will do

00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:11,279
is hopefully early in the design process

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,960
although the reality is is that most of

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,559
the time teams don't come in

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,120
until they're like eight weeks away

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,960
before releasing and then they ask

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,559
hey what license should we use and what

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,000
else should we do to get ready to

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:25,039
release and then we have to back them up

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,720
and be like okay

00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,720
have you picked out a nade have you

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,240
talked to the copyright folks yet have

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,600
you talked to the trademark for

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:36,799
trademark folks yet and i cannot

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:39,520
i cannot tell you how valuable

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:41,279
it is to simply have a freaking

00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,919
checklist to be able to give to the

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,640
various tls and pms

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,080
of the things that go into releasing you

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,720
know an open source project

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,400
because a lot of those things like you

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,559
know the copyright around the name

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,480
or something like that they just don't

00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:59,120
tend to occur to many people

00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,559
so in this case it turns out there was

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,919
not a lot of copyrights around

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,080
cauliflower

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,600
vests so that was a pretty easy one to

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,440
get through

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,840
but we'll spend time working with them

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,039
going over name collision in the space

00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,240
walking them through the different

00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,760
licenses

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,440
and then basically being able to get

00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,000
them set up along the way

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,799
the nice thing is is that usually that

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,880
takes about an hour to two hours

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:24,720
and after that point is mostly you know

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,480
kind of self-serve and self-maintenance

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,320
because they're doing point releases

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,320
they're doing other things like that

00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,600
only rarely do we have to get into

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,760
things like

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,080
uh you know if they want to change a

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,480
license or something like that

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,720
one sub point that i would add to that

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:44,400
is particularly around when

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:47,679
a uh project goes from medium to large

00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:49,039
that's when we begin to start to get

00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,640
standardized process

00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:54,880
for uh community license arrangements

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,760
so one of the things that we see coming

00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,240
up uh

00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,120
particularly with large projects is how

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,000
do you handle

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,000
outside patches coming in and there's a

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,559
bunch of docs that already exist around

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,400
the web

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:11,440
for a standard clas that you can use

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,200
but i will say one of the things as

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,480
as you all are running these groups and

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,000
offices

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:21,120
is having a good cla beforehand

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,640
to deal with the happy happy day when

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,360
you have to

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,799
say hey we have a patch that is coming

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:30,320
in for a project

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:31,039
that we own but this patch is not an

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,159
employee

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:37,760
of the company that we are at having

00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:39,919
a clear easy to use cla that you know

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,520
assigns the cat you know assigns the the

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:44,000
copyright at that point

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,000
is something that is going to make your

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
your lives and your lawyers lives

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,120
immeasurably easier at that point as

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,440
well

00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:55,200
um so that is kind of an example of part

00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,200
of what we talk about with these large

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,240
frameworks so when i talk about large

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,240
projects

00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,000
i'm talking about everything from like

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,520
go and chromium size

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,760
to angular to you know one point part of

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:12,399
which was part of this as well

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:14,480
and this is the area that you know

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,080
most of the folks on here are all at

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,880
pretty large companies

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,039
and know all the joys and pleasures that

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,840
come with dealing with large companies

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:25,520
at that size this is where it becomes

00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,200
kind of a large company thing

00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,880
you know you begin to talk about

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,440
commitments of head count over the

00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,520
course of you know two to three years

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,960
what does community support end up

00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,080
looking like

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,960
and i wish that i could say that i had a

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,880
one size

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,960
you know one size fits all model for

00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:46,159
this the reality is

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,640
that it is highly variable

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,679
you know what andrew what you know the

00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,960
android

00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,159
uh aesop android the open source project

00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,240
needs

00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,000
they have a very different set of needs

00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,720
that uh you know for support

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,320
that they have uh than what kubernetes

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,520
needs at that point

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,120
and really the role that i think most of

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,039
the folks on this call will end up

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,279
playing is going to be stuff around how

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,120
do you differentiate and how do you talk

00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:15,600
through these different models

00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,640
with each of these area leads i think

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,480
the you know the

00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,840
the best advice that i can give is

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,679
trying to ground

00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:26,559
the strategic goals within kind of open

00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:30,000
source as a framework will

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:32,320
make for better long-term success

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,360
but again this is one of those things

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,159
where

00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,640
the needs of these large projects really

00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,120
does

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,399
end up influencing a lot of how the work

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,640
that gets done

00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:44,240
so you know just to be completely

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,600
transparent about it

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:51,039
what that means for us internally is

00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:54,240
that uh let's say for tensorflow

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:57,120
um we with an ospo do

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,960
almost all of the external kind of work

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:02,000
associated with tensorflow

00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,039
you know we have you know we've run the

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,679
conferences

00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,640
we do the you know we've run what we run

00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,480
the events

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,360
run the user groups we handle all of

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:14,720
that part for chromium

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:17,039
we give the chromium team kind of the

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,600
licensing and tooling support

00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,960
we also run the whole github instance

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,080
and everything like that

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:26,960
uh for them but aside from that

00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,480
they essentially we are we get called

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,480
and do consulting for them

00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,679
but they really run everything on the

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,440
ground and everything

00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:36,000
uh like that so uh it can be a highly

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,559
variable

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,200
model is probably a good way to put it

00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,039
um

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,880
i am taking more time talking than i

00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,559
thought i would so we're now going to

00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,799
enter some of the speed round of things

00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:50,559
so we can get to some of the questions

00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:53,120
um this kind of gives a example

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,480
of where we're at well i guess actually

00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,760
where we were at towards the

00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:00,880
end of 2019 at this point uh

00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:04,000
this is a number that we see increasing

00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:07,120
uh obviously um in particular with

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,440
the over the last year

00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,519
we have seen more and more of our

00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,919
internal open source projects just

00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:16,799
moving directly on top of github

00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:19,120
um you know frankly that of course now

00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:22,480
that github is owned by microsoft that

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:25,039
is giving us some degree of you know

00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,080
the question is how dependent do you

00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:29,200
want to be

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:32,240
upon a product that a competitor says

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,919
they will run at arm's length but

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,559
how long do you trust them to run in

00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:38,640
arm's length that said

00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,240
the amount of you know the tooling that

00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,039
github provides

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,640
their focus now on providing better

00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,960
enterprise support

00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,080
has really made it a no-brainer in many

00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,559
ways uh

00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,919
for people to be able to you know to be

00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:55,279
using github

00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:58,399
um so google contributions on github

00:31:55,279 --> 00:32:00,480
uh over this has actually been well part

00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:03,360
of both contract negotiations

00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,799
and uh internal tooling support that

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:08,320
we've been doing

00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:11,760
um so what we have been doing

00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,080
what we had been doing up until the end

00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,799
of

00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,320
last year was we had built a bunch of

00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:20,640
internal tooling

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,200
that internal so google or teams could

00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,600
sign

00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:28,880
up for our google github account

00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:31,360
and so it could be both person-based and

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,440
role-based accounts inside of there

00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,600
and what you would have to do then is

00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:39,440
teams would sign up inside of there

00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:42,480
and those we would end up with a

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:45,039
tracking list of what all of the well a

00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,960
the number of different you know people

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,559
b the number of different role accounts

00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,440
and you know the bot accounts and things

00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,600
like that

00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,600
and then see the total number of

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:57,360
projects that were operating

00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:59,120
um github's backend or its ability to

00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,640
you know kind of give us better data

00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,200
about what people have been doing

00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,679
has been improving quite a bit over the

00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,440
last

00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,640
year so we have been deprecating some of

00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,240
our old kind of

00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:15,600
uh basically was scraping dashboards

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:18,720
and then slurping it back into you know

00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,640
our internal tools and then doing data

00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,679
munching and making the dashboards from

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,440
there

00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:27,600
at this point so uh

00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,559
because of how github has changed some

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,559
of the per seat

00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:35,600
models we have begun to

00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:38,159
request justification if teams or people

00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,360
need more seats and so that has brought

00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,360
some of that number

00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,919
more back in line with how many people

00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:46,080
are using on a daily active basis

00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,360
but we are mostly just pulling the data

00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,159
out by

00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,600
having a because essentially we have an

00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,039
internal gateway

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,039
where if you're going to be doing google

00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:57,120
development you signed up through there

00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:58,240
we know who all the projects are and

00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,000
then we can pull the

00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,000
you know pull all of that information

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,279
out of github at that point

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
um one of the things that i will file

00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:09,119
from this that

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,760
we have been talking about is actually

00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,720
trying to release a bunch of the tools

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,839
that we have

00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:19,040
written to manage

00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:20,000
google's github work i'm just trying to

00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,200
make sure i said

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,919
that sentence correct i think i did

00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,200
but the t yeah the the too long uh the

00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:30,399
shorter version of that

00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:33,679
is uh open sourcing

00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:35,839
the tools that we manage to

00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:38,159
that we use to manage google's open

00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:40,480
source efforts

00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,240
yes yes i said all of those things

00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,240
correctly and it sounds like that is

00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:47,119
probably something that would be of use

00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:50,639
and interest to folks on here as well

00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:51,760
um this is just kind of i i can breeze

00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,760
through this next one

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,280
some of the example the projects that we

00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,800
are focused on now

00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,640
i think one of the things that is

00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,359
interesting to note here is

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,079
that you can see kind of where the

00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,839
companies

00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,920
and the company's focus has really

00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:09,520
remained on

00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:11,200
for our flagship open source projects

00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,359
has really been around kind of

00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:16,640
infrastructure work and enabling

00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:18,480
other uh teams peoples companies to

00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,560
build on top of there

00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,240
i think at least in the 25 years that

00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:25,040
i've been involved in open source

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,359
that has really been the you know kind

00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,200
of the

00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,400
the area that has made open source most

00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,760
successful has been

00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,240
you know kind of focusing on these

00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:35,520
enabling platforms as well

00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:37,760
um so this is

00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,599
actually i guess nominally my day job so

00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,400
i should be spending more time focusing

00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,200
on this part

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,400
um but i'll just use two and a half

00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,880
minutes on it

00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,480
um the focus that that the company is

00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:51,119
really trying to take now and

00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,839
and as i referred to earlier you know

00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,040
open

00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,760
contributing kubernetes uh is trying to

00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,560
compete

00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,000
around performance rather than you know

00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,640
vendor lock-in

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,480
um you know it's obviously no secret

00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,480
that gcp wants to

00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,720
you know is competing with both azure

00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:12,560
and aws part of how

00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:15,680
uh part of how we think that we can uh

00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,240
you know at least move up into being in

00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,240
the

00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,240
top two inside of there is going to be a

00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,960
wrong prodigious use of open source and

00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,880
making it

00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,560
uh you know kind of a core part of the

00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,480
enabling systems

00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,560
one of the things that i would love to

00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,480
and be able to hear from you all about

00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,400
whether it's here or whether it's a you

00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,440
know email afterwards

00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:38,640
is what the critical shortcomings are

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,400
that that you all see um because we want

00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,200
to be able to try to build and address

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,680
those within

00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,680
uh address those uh within gcp

00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,280
again for most of the folks who uh you

00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,119
know are on here this is not going to

00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,160
come as new information or anything like

00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,520
that

00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,599
now the shift especially in cloud and

00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:02,800
enterprise has been increasing usage

00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:03,680
of uh open source software it's been at

00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,839
least the last

00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,599
you know 25 years and i see no reason

00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:11,520
that it's going to slow down

00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:12,400
i think even taking into account things

00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,200
like

00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,800
the current uh you know kind of

00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:20,320
versus aws

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,839
and some of the uh other drama

00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,760
that is happening within the broader

00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:26,160
open source world

00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,440
it's still that's that's kind of a side

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,960
show to the main event

00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,920
which is going to be the consider you

00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:34,400
know kind of continued commodification

00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,800
of software by this combination of open

00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,520
source and cloud at the same time

00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,079
um my email address is on there if you

00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,800
also

00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,400
have other questions or want to get more

00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,119
specific information

00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,599
or of course i'm happy to you know talk

00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,560
with

00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:52,480
you know y'all individually or with your

00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,040
teams or companies as well inside of

00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,119
there

00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:58,400
but i wanted to make sure we had some

00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:02,079
time for follow-up questions as well too

00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:06,240
um and i'm gonna leave this

00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:08,160
up yes right this time and see you all

00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,520
here we go awesome thank you so much

00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,160
jeff i'm sure you

00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,640
have questions so um please feel free to

00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:19,839
unmute

00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:19,839
yourself and let the questions fly

00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,079
well we're waiting for that to happen um

00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,320
i

00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,520
i will ask my first one uh something you

00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,920
and i talked about

00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,200
um before the call a little bit jeff but

00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,040
you know we have

00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,240
i've spoken to several of our members

00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,520
who put in

00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:42,000
fairly heavyweight processes for sort of

00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,200
gating and reviewing external

00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,920
contributions

00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,640
um before they go out the door um you

00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,680
know as

00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:51,680
their initial process um for

00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,040
uh reviewing open source contributions

00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,920
and are now realizing that it's

00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,720
something that just

00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,880
won't scale as they try and roll out

00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:02,320
their open source processes across

00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:04,880
a large enterprise um i'm wondering

00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,640
you know what what lessons they might be

00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,079
able to take from google's experience

00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:11,200
about how you can

00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:13,280
uh how you can ensure that that external

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:17,119
contributions are reviewed appropriately

00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:20,640
but not held up and unduly

00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,640
yeah it's a

00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,520
so it's obviously a non like it's a

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,280
non-trivial problem

00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,680
and it's one that in particular tends to

00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,720
get

00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:35,520
a lot of attention

00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,280
from say your corporate lawyers or from

00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,680
your compliance teams or things like

00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,839
that

00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,720
because of the perceived risk that goes

00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:42,960
with it

00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,640
and yes there is obviously risk that

00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,400
goes with it as well

00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:51,440
i think in in our experience

00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,720
um there have been a few ways that that

00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,920
have made this easier

00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,119
one as i was alluding to earlier is

00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,359
having a clear

00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,640
you know a clear cla for external

00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:04,560
contributions

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:07,440
that you is is

00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,920
well written and clearly understandable

00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,920
because

00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,200
one of the one of the things that i

00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,560
would note is

00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:17,520
that well english is still the

00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,760
you know kind of lingua franca of uh

00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,520
open source

00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,280
in particular when you're getting some

00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,200
of these third-party contributions that

00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:28,319
are coming from outside

00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:31,200
uh making sure that you have a cla that

00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:31,920
can be translated you know fairly well

00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,920
by

00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,280
you know some an online translation

00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,200
engine or something like that will

00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,800
definitely produce any headache whereas

00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,680
you get this kind of back and forth with

00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:44,640
these contributors that come in

00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,839
more clear i i meant contributions going

00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:49,920
out to

00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:49,920
oh going out okay yes um

00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:57,920
all right so that

00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,800
is that is the area that is really our

00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,400
evergreen

00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:04,960
activity um because of course licensed

00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,119
you know licenses change what people are

00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,000
using for their systems also change as

00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,880
well

00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,680
so the challenge that that we have had

00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,520
is

00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,960
i think you know the term google three

00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,520
is one that you know

00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,440
leaked into the press a decade plus ago

00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,000
google three is like the internal

00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,359
development

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,000
system um you know it is what

00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:26,480
most of the internal code for google is

00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,599
written

00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,760
or based on and you know historically

00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:33,280
that represents the vast majority of all

00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,319
of the source code that gets written in

00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,680
google

00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:39,599
um that has changed uh in particular

00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,880
as more and more stuff has been open

00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,200
source more and more

00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,960
now gets written you know and stored in

00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,640
github or things like that because

00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,760
they're open source systems

00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:52,160
so what we have had to do is

00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,400
you know we we early on developed a

00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:57,839
licensed classification system

00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:01,040
uh for our internal systems um

00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:04,319
so back in

00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:06,319
whatever it was 2010 or so when

00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:08,480
google buzz launched and then google had

00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:10,079
to enter into the consent decree with

00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,680
the ftc

00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:13,359
that actually turned out to be a

00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,440
wonderfully good thing

00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:17,040
because what that consent decree meant

00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,560
with the ftc

00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:24,079
is that any external launches

00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,640
had to go through a legal and privacy

00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,800
review

00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,240
because that was the consent decree with

00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,359
the ftc

00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:32,960
um what that meant is that because

00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:35,119
every launch had to go through that

00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:38,319
process that meant that every launch

00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:40,400
now had a way that was being reviewed we

00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:42,400
then within the open source team

00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,280
piggybacked on top of that

00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,720
and what we have is it's called the open

00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,599
source launch bit

00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,640
and what it is is that if you are

00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,040
releasing

00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:55,359
any external software you have to go

00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:57,280
through the privacy and security review

00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,560
if there is any open source code that

00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,960
goes with it

00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,680
you have to flag that and then you get

00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,400
sent through

00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,079
our launch review process at that point

00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,920
i will note

00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,119
there is obviously a you know

00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,119
possibility for

00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,720
human failure inside of there since we

00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,800
are reliant upon

00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,839
the you know either product managers or

00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,400
tech leads

00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:20,240
you know to be able to say oh yes this

00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,920
is open source i should go through the

00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:25,760
open source review

00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:28,960
um there has been like

00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,160
in the last 10 years i could like count

00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,040
on one hand

00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,440
even if i'd had a wood saw like a wood

00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,359
shop

00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,839
accident with that hand the number of

00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:41,200
times that we've had problems with it

00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:42,960
because the the reality is is that all

00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,760
of the people who want to release this

00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,760
stuff

00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,599
they want to talk about it they want to

00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,280
talk about it being open source so the

00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,960
number of times that we've had like you

00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:54,560
know false negatives

00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:57,599
has been i think precisely two and

00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,720
you know that's really it turns out you

00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:01,760
can rely on

00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:03,359
humans wanting to get credit and

00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,920
attention for the things that they are

00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:05,680
doing

00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,520
so as long as you can give them that

00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,680
pathway to be able to say this is what

00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:13,280
i'm doing and this is how i'm launching

00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:15,200
you can pretty reliably uh figure that

00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,599
that you're going to hear about it

00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,359
what we did then from the very at the

00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:21,359
very beginning it was a hand milled

00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:23,520
system where essentially we would be

00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:25,520
you know talking to the tl talking to

00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,480
the pm taking a look at what code they

00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,240
were using

00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,400
and then saying okay this looks good or

00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:32,560
not you know does not look good

00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,920
one of the things that we have shifted

00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:37,040
to and this is

00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:39,680
i would say 10 to 12 years ago was

00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:41,440
yes there is still a part where you

00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,440
submit a ticket to us

00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,359
you know we have a compliance you know

00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,359
licensed compliance team that actually

00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:48,720
will go in and look at it and

00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:50,319
you know it's just it's a ticket

00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,800
interface so we can just make sure

00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:55,839
you're not doing anything truly insane

00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:59,200
and then the code itself uh

00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:02,480
gets uh pushed over into a

00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:03,760
code classifier the code classifier runs

00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,079
through the code make sure that there's

00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,319
no

00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:08,319
problems with it at that point i will

00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:10,240
note that this is something that

00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:11,599
you know we continue to put time and

00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,240
energy into

00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:16,000
uh we're actually have been talking with

00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:18,640
the author scan code

00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,359
about doing some more extensibility to

00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,920
the system

00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:22,720
that you know we have built internally

00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,200
um

00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,400
so i guess the you know the lesson that

00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,760
you should take from that

00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:31,680
is uh trying to roll your own

00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,599
uh is probably gonna end up being

00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:36,160
painful and

00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:37,440
uh there's probably a pretty good

00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,720
opportunity for

00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:42,240
actually releasing a open source

00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,160
one that would be able to be more

00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,839
broadly used as well and

00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,839
if there are folks who are interested in

00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:49,280
talking more about that i would love to

00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:50,560
be able to get a coalition of the

00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,800
willing together

00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,680
around trying to build said system

00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,720
because

00:45:53,680 --> 00:46:00,400
yeah the uh

00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:02,800
the whole notion of keeping up to date

00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,920
with all the different licenses

00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,119
like we make it somewhat easier by

00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,440
saying

00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:11,280
essentially if you are going to release

00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,720
code at google

00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:16,319
we want you unless you have a really

00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:18,480
strong reason not to

00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:19,599
we would like you to release it either

00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,040
as you know

00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:25,440
uh under the apache or the mit license

00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,359
because that gives us less headache to

00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,520
deal with over the long run

00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:31,040
um and that has actually made things a

00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:34,400
lot easier as well

00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:37,520
having an informed opinion around

00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:40,319
what license you want your company to

00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:41,920
use has its default and baseline

00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:43,839
is something that is going to make your

00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:46,560
life easier in the long run

00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:47,920
and honestly using stuff like you know

00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,240
the bsd or mi

00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,240
you know mit license also is going to

00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:54,839
make life easier for you in the long run

00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:57,200
as well too

00:46:54,839 --> 00:47:00,319
um let's see

00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:02,960
so mike is the new data availability to

00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:06,400
the advances ai

00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:09,440
ah data so data's a fun

00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:12,319
one um because there's

00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:14,800
actually literally a email chain that

00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:16,400
i'm dealing with right now about that

00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,920
so one of the fun things that we're

00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:21,040
dealing with right now

00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:22,880
is a team internally wants to use a

00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:26,400
piece of software that is written

00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:29,599
under the agdl to

00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:33,839
generate test data for

00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:36,800
use within a you know proposed ml system

00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:38,000
and where we have this whole back and

00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,960
forth right now

00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,480
about whether or not to use the atpl

00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:45,119
software because then

00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,800
possibly everything that was you know

00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,599
all of the data that was created by it

00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,720
would need to be

00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:54,240
open sourced and released as well um

00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:57,200
so mike uh the real

00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:58,720
i guess i would say the answer to that

00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:02,800
is

00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:06,160
we're getting there but it's

00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:09,599
been a more fraught process than

00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:12,720
we would have thought um

00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:16,400
so speaking completely uh

00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:19,040
candidly there has been enough

00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,160
news over the last kind of couple years

00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:23,359
about training

00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:24,240
ai and ml data sets an implicit bias

00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:27,839
that exists

00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:31,119
in previous data sets that that has

00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:34,640
put a uh put

00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:36,960
put the brakes on wanting to release a

00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:39,119
lot of these broad training sets

00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,800
and that mostly comes around wanting to

00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,839
ensure that the data sets that are

00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,319
released

00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:46,240
are actually free of any implicit bias

00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:49,119
that is associated with that

00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:50,400
and so you know famously you know things

00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:53,680
like

00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,800
most of the ai or ml vision based

00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:58,000
systems

00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:59,359
uh turns out that when you feed them 60

00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
to 70

00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:04,400
white people guess what they're super

00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,599
good at classifying white people

00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:09,280
not so great at classifying oh you know

00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:10,079
the majority of the rest of the human

00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,720
race

00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:13,599
um and so a lot of what we've been

00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,119
trying to do

00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:18,079
is make sure that the data that we

00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:19,760
release is actually along those lines

00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:21,839
is stuff that is actually going to be

00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,839
functionally useful and that we're not

00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:25,520
baking in some of these biases from the

00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:29,040
very beginning

00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:30,880
um industry-wise though into your

00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,880
broader question

00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,559
what we're trying to figure out is the

00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:37,680
best way to release

00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:41,359
the you know release this data

00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:43,359
uh in a way that is also economically

00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:45,839
feasible to use as well

00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:47,119
so you know one of the challenges that

00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:50,480
we have been seeing

00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:52,640
is well challenge i guess in

00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,000
some to some degree this is also a sales

00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:56,800
opportunity for the

00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,200
cloud team is just how much bloody money

00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:02,480
it takes to be able to train the new

00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:05,200
uh you know a new ml or ai based system

00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,760
and even with the ability to kind of

00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,599
create

00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,520
data to be able to feed the system with

00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:10,800
it just gets really really expensive

00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,559
really quickly

00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:15,040
to run these systems for long enough

00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:18,720
that they generate useful information

00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:21,760
um so the short

00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:23,280
the semi-short answer is we're trying to

00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:26,559
figure out a way that we

00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:29,680
can release open source data

00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:32,960
while also making it economically

00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:35,280
viable for companies who

00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,800
don't have as much money to spend on

00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,839
these training models

00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,480
to actually be able to use it at that

00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:42,160
point uh

00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,079
because one of the worries is is that if

00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,280
we just release these large data sets

00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:48,480
that'll just be seen

00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:52,240
as a way to essentially channel stuff uh

00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:55,680
you know gcp resources at that point um

00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:58,000
and no one wants to kind of uh be stuck

00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,000
with that

00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:05,680
great thank you so much of course

00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:09,839
anybody else questions

00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:18,000
hi it's it's jonjie from italy i have a

00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:20,720
question related to

00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,119
the access to the repositories and which

00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:25,920
internal repo you use

00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:27,119
just curious to use github and how the

00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,160
contribution

00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:33,200
from the engineers if they would

00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:35,599
uh if they contribute to an internal

00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,599
and mirrored repository and then it's

00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:40,000
pushed out or if they pushed

00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:42,000
directly to their vehicle but through

00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,720
some proxy routing and you will go

00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,920
through this

00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:48,960
uh reveal process yeah

00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:52,720
so at this point um

00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:56,960
they are for they are decoupled systems

00:51:52,720 --> 00:52:00,640
so if you are working in google three

00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:03,760
uh which is like i mean originally

00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:04,079
it was a you know so originally going

00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,240
back

00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,119
a long time ago that was all based on

00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:10,800
per force

00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:13,520
it now it was replaced a decade plus ago

00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,480
with a internal replacement for version

00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,400
control

00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:19,119
and if you're working on google three

00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:20,960
code and you are working on

00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:22,880
let's say it's add you know something in

00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:25,920
ads or something like that

00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:28,720
you are going to stay within that

00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,680
g4 we call it that internal repository

00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,800
you're going to be using

00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,520
all internal tools and that is a

00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,920
complete

00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:37,839
island from the you know from any of the

00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,680
github work

00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:42,319
anything that is going to be over on

00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:45,119
github is going to be

00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:47,440
only open source projects can be using

00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:51,119
that for development at this point

00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:53,280
and there is a proxy like we do

00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:54,400
use a proxy for people to be able to

00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,880
connect to that

00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,960
but that's really just for like user

00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:02,079
authentication or things like that

00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:04,319
so at this point at least we keep the

00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:07,040
source code completely

00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:07,680
it's not air gapped but literally air

00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,480
gap but

00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:11,839
it's air gap ultimately and we don't do

00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,400
any pushing from

00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:16,000
you know from one to the other over time

00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,280
that might change

00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:22,800
but um i

00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:25,920
have a it is very difficult for me

00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:28,960
to see any time in the near future where

00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:31,520
that really would substantively change

00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,319
because of just the internal security

00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:35,440
concerns

00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:38,319
about having any sort of explicit tie

00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:42,480
between our internal code repository

00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:45,119
and github at that point

00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,119
okay thank you

00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:54,480
so allocate resources google and

00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:56,640
projects like go versus google created

00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:59,760
projects like kubernetes

00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:03,760
uh so the real

00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:06,240
answer to that is it varies

00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:08,160
which is not a hopeful answer so let me

00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:12,880
unpack that a little bit

00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:17,680
um so the reality is is that uh

00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:17,680
most of those decisions kind of come up

00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:24,079
we try to not ship our org chart would

00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:26,960
be the first answer to that

00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:27,599
question and you know as any large

00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:30,559
company

00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:31,200
of course that is always the worry is

00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:33,359
say

00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,319
you know a director an engineering

00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:37,680
director

00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:39,680
who is responsible for go may

00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:41,359
just happen to have more head count open

00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,960
than the one who is responsible for

00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:45,200
kubernetes

00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,079
um and that really isn't how things

00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:50,240
should you know

00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:51,200
operate um the functionally speaking the

00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:53,520
company has got

00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:54,559
a lot more disciplined in particular

00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:57,760
over the last

00:54:54,559 --> 00:55:00,000
uh i would say four years in how we

00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:02,559
actually do kind of do effort tracking

00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,920
overall uh across all the different

00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:08,400
engineering efforts

00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:10,720
so to again being completely transparent

00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:13,359
four years ago it would have been

00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:16,400
incredibly difficult for me to actually

00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:19,200
answer with any degree of

00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:20,319
reasonableness how many people we had

00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,079
working on go

00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:24,079
versus how many people we have working

00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:25,440
on kubernetes versus how many people we

00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:27,520
had working on

00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:29,119
you know chromium or something like that

00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,480
so one of the first things that we did

00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:32,319
was actually just

00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,079
build better tooling to be able to track

00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:37,359
who the hell was working on what

00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:41,599
in what areas uh i will

00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:43,359
be uh our ability to

00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:45,760
we're much better now at being able to

00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:48,799
track kind of people who are working on

00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:50,960
areas the honest truth is is that then

00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:51,280
trying to marry that data with things

00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,319
like

00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:56,400
operating expenses is just spreadsheets

00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:57,200
at the end of the day and people like me

00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,280
having to

00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:01,119
chase people down and bank them and ask

00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:04,400
them for resources

00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:05,839
um and what we end up doing within the

00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:09,200
open source program

00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:09,839
office is because we have the broadest

00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:13,280
view

00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:15,520
of open source across google is that

00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:17,040
we end up kind of being the shepherd

00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:19,359
group that says

00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,720
here's all the different groups

00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:22,240
including ospo

00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,440
including the engineers and all these

00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,799
teams that are working on this

00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:27,599
particular effort

00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:29,200
you know so it says kubernetes and so

00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:30,960
we'd be like well we've got three people

00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,720
on community management and there's 20

00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,319
people in the engineering team and

00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:36,400
obviously i'm making these numbers up

00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:38,559
but you know we'll put together

00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:41,040
these kind of if you think back to that

00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:43,520
small medium large framework

00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:44,240
we do like essentially a competitive

00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:47,680
analysis

00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:50,720
for those large projects and then

00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:52,720
it's really during planning cycle is

00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,599
making sure that it gets in front of the

00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:57,200
appropriate

00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:58,000
you know vps one of the things that the

00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:01,040
company has

00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,799
done that has helped uh some of this is

00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:04,079
really consolidating some of these

00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:08,079
projects

00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:11,599
um so that go in kubernetes

00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:13,760
and istio and all of kind of these cloud

00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:16,319
focused open source projects

00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,839
actually all roll up under one uh

00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:20,640
director and one vp

00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:22,880
at this point but the truthful like the

00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:25,680
reality is is like the decisions that we

00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:29,599
make around kubernetes and go

00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:31,839
have no impact at all in terms of how

00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:32,880
much support say angular is going to get

00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:34,799
or something like that

00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:37,040
because it's just being funded out of a

00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:40,079
whole different part of the company

00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:43,200
one of the things that i have given

00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:45,440
our ospo team as a challenge for this

00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:48,960
year going into next year

00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:52,160
is how do we better articulate

00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:54,240
for the entire company where each set of

00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:57,040
resources is going into

00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:58,160
and kind of uh you know could do a

00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:01,359
better job

00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,760
of being able to i don't know navigate

00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:04,000
that

00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:06,240
or give kind of more useful feedback to

00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:09,200
the you know to the engineering teams

00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:10,960
but the short answer to it is we built

00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,000
better tooling to track what people were

00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:15,920
doing

00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:18,799
um we within the ospo team

00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,319
uh track the efforts across the company

00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:21,359
and then

00:58:19,319 --> 00:58:23,040
consolidation of the engineering

00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:24,960
reporting lines

00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:27,200
made it where we got to much saner

00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:29,200
choices about what was being done

00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:32,960
to answer the last part of the question

00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:35,440
about outside projects versus internal

00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,720
a lot of that really comes down to what

00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:39,920
i was referring to

00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:42,240
at the very beginning of

00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:44,400
we make sure that we get broad

00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,920
representation of googlers

00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,599
across all the different kind of

00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:50,160
technical or

00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:52,160
you know boards of the open source

00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:55,760
projects that matter to us

00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:57,839
and they really become advocates for

00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,680
no we shouldn't be putting these five

00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:02,880
heads in to go

00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:05,680
this work that needs to go into maven uh

00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:07,520
really matters and so we called that

00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:09,359
whole work stream kind of the upstream

00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:11,680
contributor work stream

00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:13,760
and really the effort over the last two

00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:16,960
years has been trying to turn that into

00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:18,319
kind of a top-tier uh voice within all

00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,720
the planning groups

00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:23,119
because historically doing upstream

00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:26,400
contributions has been something that

00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:28,079
we have not done uh as good a job as we

00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,520
should have in terms of waiting relative

00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:32,799
priority

00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:36,400
um again i uh

00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:37,440
bates j at google.com i uh be happy to

00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:40,160

00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,240
