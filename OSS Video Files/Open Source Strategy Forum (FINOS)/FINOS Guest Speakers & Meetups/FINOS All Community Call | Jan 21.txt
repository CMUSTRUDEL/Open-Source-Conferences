Title: FINOS All Community Call | Jan 21
Publication date: 2021-04-11
Playlist: FINOS Guest Speakers & Meetups
Description: 
	Thank you to everyone who participated in and presented at our Q1 All Community Call! We had a great turnout and appreciate all of the input our community provided before, during, and after the meeting. For those of you who couldn't make it, you can read on to learn more and access the recording.

The meeting kicked off with a quick recap of some Q4 2020 highlights, including recognizing members who joined in the last quarter (Alliance for Innovative Regulation, Suse, InterWork Alliance, Intel, diffblue, Accenture and Armory) and sending a shout out to recently approved Special Interest Groups and projects (DevOps Mutualization SIG, Regulation Innovation SIG, OpenMAMA, and InnerSource SIG).

Moving on to plans for 2021, FINOS Executive Director, Gabriele Columbro (Gab) shared the Foundation's Guiding Principles for 2021. You can see more in the slide deck but the short version is that while our focus continues to be on our members, projects and community, a primary emphasis this year is to deliver business value by supporting and enabling the growth and adoption of our existing projects and SIGs; increasing engagement with our current members; and showing the value of FINOS to participants of our ecosystem who have been less involved previously, such as FinTechs and regulators.

Gab and FINOS Director of Community, James McLeod, spoke about a couple of the initiatives we're working on to support our 2021 goals. In order to help our projects become as successful as possible we recognize that they need different types of support depending on the type and maturity of the project. That's why we are rolling out a variety of guides and tools for our projects and project leads as well as hiring new FINOS team members who can provide additional help. We also want to recognize the many contributors that make our Foundation and projects successful so are building on the Community Spotlight we started last year with even more to "Recruit, Reward, and Retain" our contributors. We're also putting the power of recognition in your hands; through our Community GitHub repo you can now recognize individuals who have done a great job supporting FINOS and FINOS projects.

In 2021 we'll also continue to build on our successful meetups and podcasts established in 2020. Tosha Ellison, FINOS Chief Operating Officer, explained that we'll continue to run virtual meetups until we can meet again in person and that we'll be extending our current podcast series as well. We'd also like to build on successful partnerships established last year with Scott Logic, who ran the very popular Open Source in Fintech UK event series and Andrew King from Suite2Go who helped run our first FINOS APAC meetup. Email marketing@finos.org or raise an "issue" in GitHub if you have ideas for a meetup or podcast or want to start a meetup series with us.

We also had fantastic updates from our community on FINOS projects (Morphir, Cloud Service Certification, Currency Reference Data, Git Proxy), SIGs (DevOps Mutualization, InnerSource) and project ideas (IoT in retail banking). We invite you to join a meeting, learn more and see how you can get involved.

If you have feedback, thoughts or other ideas please share them with us by emailing any of the FINOS team members, community@finos.org or adding a comment in our Community GitHub repo!

as an open source community to continue

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:49,120

and special interest groups so we have a

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,159
pretty packed agenda

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,880

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,799
short and give you a quick update on

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,000

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,079
goals and guiding principles that i'd

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,520
like to share with the community again

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,920
in the spirit of

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,200
all pushing in the same direction and

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,079
aligning to what

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,320
is looking like another fantastic year

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,759
of growth for finance

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,520

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,560
uh into new areas of

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,760
such a wide industry like financial

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,000

and also three associate members you

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,080
probably were familiar with air for our

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,000
work

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,159
on open source regulation but we've also

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,760
now built relationship with the

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,440
interwork alliance

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,200

which as you might remember we work very

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,799
closely with

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,640
on our legend pilots so before we move

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,120
to the next slide

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,720
i continue to you know when i look at

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,000
this light i don't see

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:55,360

00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:02,080
you know uh representative

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,799
of the corporate diversity that we have

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,799
in our

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,159
foundation between financial

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:12,400

fintech vendors uh you know i think

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,880
we continue to show that this is a

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,840
foundation that is open and inclusive

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,759
and can deliver value to pretty much any

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,960
constituents in this industry

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:31,040
uh and so again thank you to all of you

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,240

whether you are members

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,639
of our foundation um we are very

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,479
thankful for

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,880
you know not only trusting finance uh um

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,639
with your sweat equity but also

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,840
continuing to advocate for us

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:52,400
and and growing our foundation this year

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,400
um you wanna go to the next slide james

00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:02,080
so we had a really busy quarter in q4

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:05,440
um as you might remember earlier in 2020

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,280
starting from our projects in six we did

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,759
introduce the concept of special

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,000
interest group um this was a new concept

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,120
for

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,639
finnos uh it is really a way to

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,600
coalesce interest uh across

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,400
common uh uh sort of across different

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,919
firms

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,919
on a specific common topic

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,440
and really what we're realizing is that

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,960
special interest groups

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:34,639
are a great engine to discover

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,960
common interests and then you know

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,479
start working in the problem space and

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,520
then actually

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,360
uh trigger the creation of new projects

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,080
and new standards that become

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,919
very valuable and much sort of easier to

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,320
adopt given the interest that gets built

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,960
into the special interest group and so

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,800
i want to send a shout out to the devops

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,479
neutralization working group which is

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,800
gaining steam

00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,759
he's been also mentioned in forbes i

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,800
believe uh

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:06,639
earlier this month uh we look forward

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:09,360
you know to uh not only solve

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,199
regulated industries specific problems

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,680
in the cicd

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,319
uh tool chain but also to collaborate

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,160
with

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,880
uh our phone sorry folks running out of

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,400
voice

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,560
and it's already 7am but to collaborate

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,080
with other sister foundations

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,000
uh like for example the continued

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,039
delivery foundation in

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,800
uh the linux foundation we're

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,639
particularly very excited

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,160
about the regulation innovation special

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,800
interest group

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,800
which was really

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,400
a result of the major interest that

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:50,000
we've seen in applying open source

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,319
to solving common regulatory compliance

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,479
and regulatory implementation problems

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,000
um this is going to be a theme that you

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,840
continue to see throughout

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,880
2021 and so again very very excited

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:06,400
we've brought in open mama under

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:09,520
our umbrella and we continue

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,039
to grow again our footprints both in

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,160
terms of

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:17,199
marketing you know podcast

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,440
community spotlight we uh we're gonna

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:24,720
hear from james later this year

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:28,840
uh sorry later today um we continue to

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,360
add focus on our contributors

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,199
um you are the engine

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,440
of our community and so we want to make

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,240
sure that to the extent that we can

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,960
we continue rewarding and incentivizing

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,759
and

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:46,720
again thanking you for the contribution

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,720

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,080
show you

00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,000
i'm not gonna go through all of these

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,120
guiding principles but i think it was

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,879
useful

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,039
to share them with you with the

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,840
community at large

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,960
in the same way we share them with our

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,639
board

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,840
these guiding principles are the ones

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,840
that ultimately

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,800
drove the creation of the objectives

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,800
and the strategy for us this year

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,319
i want to point out a couple of

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,360
highlights here that are more relevant

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,960
to you

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,720
first of all 2020 has been a huge year

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,360
for us in terms of

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,080
uh banks actively contributing to the

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,240
community

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,599
we now have at least five major

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,240
financial institutions

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,719
actively contributing code both net new

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,159
code

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:46,320
and to projects um you know that were

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,959
originated from other institutions this

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,120
is

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,800
almost unprecedented in this industry so

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,560
we're very proud

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:57,200
we think that this means that in 2021

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,560
we have the opportunity of focusing on

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,640
our existing projects

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,920
our existing members of course this

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,800
doesn't mean that we're not going to

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,920
continue growing our project portfolio

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,839
and our membership uh but we want to

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,680
double down our efforts to make sure

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,000
that our projects are successful

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,720
it doesn't just take throwing a project

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,480
on github

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,480
to make it a successful open source

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,080
project and we think now we have

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:25,040
enough of a deep broad portfolio

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,519
to make sure that we um drive them to

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,519
success

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,920
the second point i want to touch here is

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,440
really the value for the business

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,920
as a vertical foundation um

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,839
we are different from other foundations

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,279
uh of course through our open source

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,240
readiness program

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,760
the recently approved inner source uh

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,000
special interest group

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,279
our cloud certification effort we will

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,839
continue

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,680
running initiatives that enable the

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,720
technology organization and deliver

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,160
value

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,360
to technologists but as a financial

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,720
services focus

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,959
foundation our goal this year

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,720
especially with firms actively

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,160
contributing and a project portfolio

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,240
that continues to grow

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,279
it's really to focus on solving

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,360
long-standing

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,279
industry challenges and using open

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,760
source and open standards really as a

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,240
mean

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,200
to an ad so you'll see more of this

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,279
focus

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,519
including for example our focus on

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,040
regulation

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,720
we will work with the linux foundation

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,000
to surface adoption we

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,399
know that our projects that are standard

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,079
are

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:36,240
used way more that oftentimes we're able

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,360
to measure or to realize and so we're

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,760
asking for your help

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,120
if you're using any of our projects or

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,480
our standards

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,440
let us know let us work with your firm

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,000
to put

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,839
your logo up there this is going to be

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,360
fundamental to continue growing

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,360
the flywheel of the community

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,360
in terms of our focus fintech and

00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,320
regulators are the two

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,680
new sort of messages and and value

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,399
proposition that we're looking to

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,560
develop

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,800
even further this year in addition to

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,120
the now very established value for

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:15,360
financial institutions

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:18,720
um can i move to the next slide james

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:22,240
so um i'm not gonna

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,839
not gonna uh go through this uh

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,440
well there's a little bit of an eye

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,440
chart there but

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:32,480
um we have i wanted to remind you

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,920
uh what are the

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,880
expectations really to run

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,320
our community in a successful way and

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,320
there are four main actors

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,839
you know we have now this is the first

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,720
year as a full

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,079
full year as a foundation under the

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,600
linux foundation

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:54,720
so we can expect a whole lot of tooling

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,760
project collaborations training and

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,639
value-add services coming right from the

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,720
lf

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,000
and if you have ideas on how to best

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,279
leverage those services

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,560
please let us know but the two

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,560
uh areas that i wanted to point out

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,480
where we have had pretty deep

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,680
conversations with the board

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,720
um first the balloon on the right

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,120
um as you know as a community we've

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,760
always promoted self-sufficiency of our

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,440
projects

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,279
and we continue to do that

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,000
through project enablement james is

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:33,680
going to give you a much more detailed

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,279
view of what that means in 2021

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:40,079
but we realized that it's often hard to

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,200
assign project coordination resources in

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,160
addition to

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,399
development release and really just

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:50,639
leadership and advocacy to your projects

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:53,839
so after a board conversation

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:58,320
i'm happy to share that venus will

00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:01,040
hire uh project coordinators to help you

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,680
uh continue progressing in your projects

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,880
and allow you

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,519
to focus on what truly uh you know

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,200
is the goal of a lead maintainer

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,519
developing great code

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,200
and advocating for the growth of its

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,720
community

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,519
the second point and then i'm gonna

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,720
close here is

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,399
we have we we

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,399
realized that we have an important role

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,040
in working with our board

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,240
uh with your member representative if

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,320
you're a member

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,839
to sustain the initial investment on

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,800
contributions

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,839
um it's important that once a third open

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,480
source a project

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,440
there is the internal buy-in both in

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,600
terms of adoption

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,880
and in terms of sustaining and rewarding

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,839
individuals

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,519
uh that are ultimately working on the

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,079
day-to-day on those projects and

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,120
therefore

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,920
that make up our community so i just

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,959
want to say

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,440
if you are experiencing

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,360
issues in terms of the internal support

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,639
for your open source activity

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:05,600
please let us know we can hopefully

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,040
help out and connect with um you know if

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,480
you have if you're a platinum member or

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,440
a gold member and you have a board

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,199
member

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,279
we can work through that but we

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,360
understand that

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,720
sustained investment is really the only

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,920
way to

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,519
uh you know have a successful

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,199
and run a successful open source

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,399
projects out there so

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:28,560
with that i think i am at the end of my

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,320
slide james

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,399
so thank you so much i might have to

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,199
drop in a few minutes but i'll certainly

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,560
be here

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:39,680
for the next section thank you

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,560
scab uh james okay if i pick it up from

and um if you want to skip to the next

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,760
slide i'm gonna

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,040
just touch on a few things related to

00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,639
marketing

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,079
mostly marketing because because james

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,880
is going to cover uh much more on the

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,680
community

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,199
but i i wanted to talk a little bit

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,639
about some of our successes last year

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,120
and how we're going to continue to build

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,120
on that

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,680
um in 2021 starting with the podcasts so

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,440
we introduced a podcast series

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,880
last year the fitness open source and

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,720
fintech podcast and

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:23,199
we have more than 15 and um we've seen

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,720
really quite good uptake on that and

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,279
certainly something that we want to

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,600
continue with um this year and and last

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,680
year we covered topics on our projects

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,600
uh new developments within open source

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,199
uh new things that our our members are

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,279
doing in open source

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,320
um as well as some of the the journeys

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,440
to you know to open source um projects

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,120
for the first time

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,440
and you know so some really interesting

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,320
and compelling um

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,800
conversations as well and so this year

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,160
we

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,920
we definitely want to continue to

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,160
explore that and maybe

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,079
mix it up a little have some briefs have

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,120

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
in our community repo which we can give

you the link

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,440
and we'll also talk about this again

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,000
throughout the

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,880
throughout the presentation this morning

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,680
um

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,360
i also wanted to touch a bit on events

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,160
and meetups as gab mentioned we had a

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,560
very successful

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,519
open source strategy form it was virtual

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,920
um which

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,519
you know isn't isn't really our ideal

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,560
and unfortunately we had the linux

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,199
foundation to help us

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,720
make that transition this year we are we

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,399
will do an open source strategy form

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,320
again we'll also have

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,320
members meetings in both london and new

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,279
york our plan

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,759
is to have them in person um but you

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,880
know

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,160
there's a the environment's changing on

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,160
a regular basis

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,199
sometimes better sometimes worse so

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,319
we'll you know we'll

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:10,000
remain flexible and agile and um

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,760
we'll do what we will do it in person if

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,240
we can otherwise um you know we'll

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,799
we'll certainly have some virtual events

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,640
and

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,919
for our meetups it's the same thing so

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,839
we'll we'll continue

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,280
you know last year we had a number of

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,679
meetups um

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,319
which was great and we'll continue that

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,000
this year

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,679
we'll do them virtual for now and as

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,960
soon as we can go in person

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:34,480
we will go in person um and one other

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,880
thing that i wanted to um touch on is

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,160
that

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,760
you know this year we also want to

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,679
you know we had some great successes

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,080
last year um which you'll hear about

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,240
from

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,600
uh claire cox from spotlogic and from

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,039
andrew king

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,640
about partnering with with other um

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,039
you know individuals and organizations

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,280
to run meetups and we definitely

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,080
think that there's great opportunity to

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,000
do

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,600
more of that so i'm going to hand over

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,080

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,520
andrew and claire in in just a moment

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,320
and just before i do that i

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,120
i also wanted to mention that we're

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,720
getting some

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:14,000
great recognition um in the news

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,919

all of the work that we and our

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,160

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,960
without our community uh we're not we're

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,760

thanks james so my name is claire cox i

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,200
work for scotlogic

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:14,240
for anybody who doesn't know scotlogic

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,480
we are a technology consultancy

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,640
that builds bespoke software solutions

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,679
for our clients who are primarily

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:24,400
in their financial services so

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,880
we partnered with finos just over a year

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,000
ago

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:31,120
to start the uk open source fintech

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,159
meetup we started that in edinburgh

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:37,280
shortly followed by london and we've

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,080
recently added bristol uh because

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,200
bristol has

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:44,480
a really vibrant fintech uh

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,919
scene the plan is to start the next one

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,480
in leeds this year

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,799
we've already built a community of just

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,240
under 1500 members

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:57,120
so far um we're hoping

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,600
to get back to physical events by

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,240
hopefully about september onwards

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,080
um when code struck like everybody else

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,360
we have to quickly adapt and

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,200
move our events online when we do go

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,039
back to physical events the idea is

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,200
we're going to almost run these roadshow

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,320
styles so we're going to rotate the

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,840
locations

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,840
and then we're going to live stream so

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:21,120
that we can continue to engage

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:24,720
the entire community um

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:28,320
the next event is on february the 11th

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,080
which is about how to create a data mesh

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,520
with open source

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:35,120
tools you can see the link there um if

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,679
you'd like to join us

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,520
if you want to get involved more widely

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,400
obviously there's the links to join the

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,960
regional

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,720
meetup groups there there's also a list

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,720
of the videos we record all of the

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,600
sessions whether they're virtual or they

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,440
um

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,120
in-person events so you can look through

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,840
some of the videos and see the the kind

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,799
of

00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,559
uh talks that we have at the events i've

00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,679
included my email address because we're

00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,600
always looking for

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,120
for speakers for the events and when we

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,280
get back to live events

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,799
we'll also be looking for organizations

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,280
to to host

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,720
as well so there's a number of ways that

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,799
you can get involved

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,320
and uh i think that's about two minutes

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,280
you must be proud of me james you've

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,000
never known me

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,440
talk for such a short amount of time so

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,720
that's that's amazing thank you very

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,559
much claire and um

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,400
as um chris has actually distributed

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,480
these slides over social so i think that

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,080
you'll be able to find them on linkedin

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,600
um you'll be able to get all of these

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,000
links and all of claire's details as

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,200
well

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,960
um it's a very recommended meetup so

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,120
that actually brings me

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,640
on to myself um where i'm going to talk

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,120
about the finnos community

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,880
and what we've been doing um so i'm

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,480
james mcleod director of community of

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,320
people who haven't um

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,080
been introduced to me before and the

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,799
very first thing that i'd like to say is

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,000
um

00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:52,000
throughout 2020 we've um wanted to

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,200
really cast the spotlight um on the

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,760
finnos community

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,200
um and all of the great work the um

00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,080
people have been doing within their

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,000
teams

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,919
um we're very used to you know talking

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,679
about the success of projects and how

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,559
projects are actually being

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:08,480
used and contributed to by the you know

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,880
community at the high level

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,880
but the the finnos community spotlight

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,600
and the ossf awards

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,039
a real opportunity for us to you know

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,640
look at the people who are doing those

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,559
contributions

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,320
and really talk about their stories and

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,320
everything that they've achieved

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,760
and so i'd like to say thank you to adam

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,039
david jessica

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:31,679
ingrid attila daniela alfred

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,159
and also claire and paul who have been

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,360
running

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:37,840
um the uk meetups for all of the work

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,600
that they they've been doing must be

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,000
whilst we've been running the community

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,679
spotlight and also keep an eye on

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,600
all of our newsletters moving forward

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,159
because um the community spotlight

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,960
throughout

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,919
2021 is something that's going to be

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,720
ongoing

00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,799
and we've actually scaled it out now so

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,679
whereas before we've been using

00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:59,360
finos data and you know all of the

00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,799
insights that we have about our projects

00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,080
in order to highlight the work that

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,320
people have been doing

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,279
you'll notice that within our community

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,000
repo which is

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,480
on github you can now actually raise a

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,039
um

00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,760
a finnos community recognition github

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,360
issue

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,039
which means that if you're working

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,039
within your projects and you don't need

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,919
to be a lead maintainer or maintainer to

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,159
do this

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,320
you can actually recognize all of the

00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,840
activity and all of the contributions

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,159
that your peers are doing

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,039
so this is a real good way to really

00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,440
kind of you know

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,400
get into you know the communities and

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,880
really show

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,679
um what people are doing by raising the

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,760
recognition

00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,880
tagging their github profiles you know

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,799
and letting us know

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,240
um who they are and what they're doing

00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,159
and featuring them

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,840
on community spotlight and you know

00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,400
awarding them with swag and you know

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:49,840
other goodies

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:52,799
now in the same way as um using

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,360
uh the whole recognition system so the

00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,840
the whole

00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,559
spotlight and the awards we actually

00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,799
want to

00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,799
within finnos really focus on our

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:04,159
recruit our reward and our re

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:06,559
retain um aspect of finos and so

00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,679
we've been looking at a particular flow

00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,760
that will capture

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,679
all of those great contributors who are

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,600
coming into the foundation and joining

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,960
our projects in our six and you know all

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,799
of our initiatives

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,960
in order to just say hello you know and

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,960
welcome them into the foundation

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,159
and then use initiatives like you know

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,600
community spotlight

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:27,279
and ossf um awards in order to

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,640
you know kind of recognize the people

00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,640
who are doing you know

00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,159
great work you know here and now within

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,720
the foundation

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,480
but also we recognize that people do

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,240
leave you know the foundation they do

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,520
leave jobs or you know they move on to

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,279
other things and so

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,640
we're going to be um working with our

00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,320
maintainers to

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,559
really know when people are kind of

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,200
moving away for from projects you know

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,480
maybe not you know on their own accord

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,000
maybe there's something else behind it

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,120
and getting in contact with them

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,600
and you know making sure that

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,200
everything's okay and when people come

00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,600
back you know making sure that we give

00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,200
them

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,000
you know a warm welcome back to the

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,320
foundation in order to really drive that

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
warm community that is all about

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,240
bringing people into finos getting

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,080
people contributing into the industry

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,279
rewarding people for all of the hard

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,039
work and you know

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:15,520
um you know initiatives that they're

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,360
taking and in order to really build that

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,600
community spirit

00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,799
and with that you know we're passing

00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,399
some of this um

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,159
you know knowledge and experience over

00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,120
to our maintainers and our projects in

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,799
order to

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:30,960
create a sense of um self-sustainability

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,159
um so rather than everything being run

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,039
by the finnos team

00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,960
or you know kind of um us kind of like

00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,559
coordinating this we're going to

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,559
be passing our knowledge and our

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,559
experience to our teams

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,679
so they can work with us in order to

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,760
help you know

00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,880
make sure that people feel recognized

00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,960
and warm and you know

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,880
um enjoying their experience within

00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,799
within finos as well and

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,240
we'll provide all of the recognition and

00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,720
highlighting people

00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,399
you know um as and when is is needed you

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,520
know in the right way

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,240
um so with that i'm really pleased to

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,480
welcome

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,159
um people from within our projects and

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,000
within our six and also within our

00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:11,200
community to give updates from

00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,880
what's happening uh on the ground um and

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,520
so our very first um

00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,240
update is actually coming from attila um

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,640
from within

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,480
more fur um sarah tiller if you're able

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,960
to come off mute and give your update

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,960
that'd be

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:28,159
that'd be great yeah sure thank you

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:31,200
um so my name is atlan mihai

00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:34,080
i work for morgan stanley um

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,559
and i'm one of the creators of morpher

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,799
um

00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:39,039
so let me start by saying a few words

00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:41,200
about uh the project itself

00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,320
so you know in the financial services

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,080
industry

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,720
uh we have mastered the art of

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:49,120
processing data algorithmically

00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,039
morpher allows you to to take that a

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,880
step further and also process business

00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,399
logic algorithmically

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,240
so it does that by turning business

00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,240
logic into data

00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,840
and once you have that data you can

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,000
unleash your

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,679
creative powers to process it in very

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,799
exciting ways so for example you can

00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,960
visualize it

00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,480
uh to turn black box logic into

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,760
insightful explanations for your

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,720
business users

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,919
translate it into executable systems and

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,559
move between

00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,880
languages and platforms effortlessly as

00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:21,360
technology evolves

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,720
and you can also share it across

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,960
different departments and

00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,240
or organizations for consistent

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,200
interpretation

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,720
um so the core of morpher is is ready

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,120
for use but we

00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,039
but we need you to to make it a real

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,600
success we need contributions

00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,720
morpher has uh has a lot of potential to

00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,120
enable new initial

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,960
initiatives like uh the rec tech

00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,640
initiative that that needs a portable

00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,880
data structure that can be translated

00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,279
into various technology platforms

00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,200
uh for consistent interpretation so

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:53,760
exactly at the at the core of what

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,480
morpher provides

00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,120
and um or things like the integration

00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,000
with the

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,760
with the legend um project which could

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,880
expand the capabilities of both of those

00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,880
platforms

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,480
um so i would like to encourage you to

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,480
to check out the project uh

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,760
it's very likely that you will find

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,360
something interesting

00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,880
we have a few examples of the kind of

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,679
problems that we are trying to solve

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,960
there

00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,880
um so we have we have really exciting

00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,080
challenges ranging from

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,159
uh language processing tasks like

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,520
building interpreters and code

00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,559
generators

00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,880
all the way to exciting visualizations

00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,399
like

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,640
turning complex effects expressions into

00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:37,039
decision trees that are easy to

00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,520
understand for business users

00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:41,760
so yeah i'd like to encourage you to

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,399
just check check it out

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,399
and reach out to us that's amazing thank

00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,760
you so much attila i really appreciate

00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,520
that and please um

00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,679
go to the fitness organization and check

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:54,960
out the morpher project

00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:57,519
and now we go over to eddie

00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:04,080
knight and also maybe lee for a cloud

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:07,600
service certification update

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,720
eddie if you're able to come off me yeah

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,799
yeah it's just a matter of finding the

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,440
buttons i suppose

00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:16,480
well done i can hear you all right let

00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:19,600
me actually turn on my camera as well

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,000
so uh over at the cloud certification

00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,440
cloud service certification project uh a

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,080
lot of people have been very very active

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,440
that aren't

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,159
named on this slide especially the folks

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,279
from

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:33,039
deutsche bank uh abdullah daniela

00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,960
and peter have all been really really

00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:38,720
active in setting up a foundation

00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:42,320
recently alfred tommy has come in

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:45,440
and actually put up the first big set

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,080
of infrastructure as code that's kind of

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,240
the core

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,000
and the crux of what the cloud service

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,080
certification is trying to accomplish

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,600
is to create these recommended

00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,320
infrastructure as code resources

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,200
that financial service institutions can

00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,399
use

00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:02,559
and myself and lee faust are working

00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,679
on building some verification and

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:06,640
validation

00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,279
resources that can be put in place to

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,960
make sure that

00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:10,960
as we're adding more and more of these

00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,600
terraforms and cloud formation

00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,799
resources that they can be verified that

00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,600
they're actually functional before

00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,080
they're committed

00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,000
and then we can spin it up and run

00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,720
prober across it to make sure that

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,679
the resources that are active and are

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,519
deployed

00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:27,600
are meeting certain standards like the

00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,799
cis standards and benchmarks that are in

00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,760
place

00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:32,799
so that has recently really started to

00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,559
hit the ground running

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,559
and it's been it's been really fun to be

00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,600
part of so we're excited to keep moving

00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,679
forward with uh

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,120
the bdd investigation is the thing that

00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,480
i'm most involved in

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,399
but it's uh it's going really well it's

00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,480
really fun

00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:48,080
that's amazing thank you very much eddie

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,080
and it's so great to be part of cloud

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,480
service certification and seeing people

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,760
you know testing and learning different

00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,120
mechanisms for

00:32:53,760 --> 00:33:00,720
um delivering the full flow

00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:02,480
of the uh gcp gta user journey and so

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,080
thank you very much for your update

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:08,720
um and now we go over to the currency

00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,440
reference data team so i believe um vjs

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,679
is um

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,679
on the the call to give the update

00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,720
if you're able to come off mute

00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,960
maybe we're having a few technical

00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,519
difficulties there so i don't know if um

00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,880
itana or anybody else is able to come in

00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:33,120
and give the update um

00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:35,360
on vj's behalf i i see dj on but um

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,399
yeah maybe there's an audio issue i can

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,440
give an update

00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:42,000
um so this this is a project that uh

00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,720
originally spun out of some of the pilot

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,720
work done around the is the cdm

00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:51,760
and the it it builds on the existing iso

00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,840
currency codes so this is about um

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:57,200
currency reference data to make

00:33:53,840 --> 00:34:00,640
processing easier and to make

00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,720
normal work uh lifecycle processes

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,679
more consistent and easier to manage and

00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,640
so the group has been

00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,440
built building out additional fields

00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,679
related to

00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,320
currencies there's been contribution

00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:15,760
from a number of different

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,760
banks as well as

00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:20,399
as well as isda and you can see it's a

00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,320
little bit smaller but you can see the

00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:24,399
model and the different types of um

00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,359
of values that that are being discussed

00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:28,240
and so the

00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:29,760
the it's the model is pretty well done

00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,919
we could really use the group could

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:35,599
really use some input from

00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:37,359
smes on so so um subject matter experts

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,399
on currencies you know specifically how

00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:42,159
you use it

00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:43,919
how you use ndfs or um

00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,679
you know various other elements whether

00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:47,040
it's currencies onshore offshore and how

00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,599
to represent that best

00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,399
so please do you can read about it in

00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,760
the um

00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:53,520
you can read about current status and

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,159
discussions in the repo

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:58,000
and if you would like to get involved

00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:01,440
please join us at the next meeting on

00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:04,160
february 9th um or

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,000
put a comment or an issue on um in the

00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,359
github repo as well and someone from the

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,359
the project team will get back to you

00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:16,960
thank you very much tasha and

00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:19,119
this is where i hand over to mao he's um

00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,720
here to talk about the get proxy um

00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,599
project

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,400
thanks james uh can you hear me i can

00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:27,440
absolutely

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,760
fantastic so um hi everyone i'm

00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,040
mao devops director at venus and i'm

00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,320
also part of the

00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,680
git proxy team i'll provide an update on

00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,960
behalf of paul groves

00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:41,359
who's the lead maintainer from citigroup

00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,520
for those who are unfamiliar with git

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:45,839
proxy

00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,040
git proxy stands between the developers

00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,760
workstation

00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,880
and an open source project code

00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,760
repository

00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,720
delivering a ui for manual review

00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,440
workflows

00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,839
and automated checks uh as you can see

00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,960
on the screenshot on the top right

00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:06,640
so we enforce compliance while

00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:10,079
keeping a lean workflow for developers

00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:13,200
which can actually uh pull and push uh

00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:15,839
code against a public key 10 point

00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,760
so git proxy aims to bring a simple and

00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:20,800
practical solution to one of the

00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:23,200
biggest challenges we at least witnessed

00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,640
at finos for financial institutions

00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,200
when contributing to open source

00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:29,200
software which sounds actually almost

00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,520
too good to be true

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,720
so last quarter we completed the finos

00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:36,640
contribution process

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,640
so the projecting now is now hosted on

00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:41,280
github.comproxy

00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:43,599
it delivers most of the features needed

00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,920
to run an initial mvp

00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:48,240
and we expect the code to be ready in

00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,320
actually the next two or three weeks

00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,680
which will enable financial institutions

00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,000
to run

00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:56,240
this behind their corporate firewalls

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,640
and provide feedback

00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:01,359
for this quarter our goal is to increase

00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:04,240
the number of project participants

00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:04,880
and early and early adopters and we have

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,200
two

00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,400
meetings being scheduled to gather this

00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:12,000
interest

00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:14,960
tomorrow we will hold a kickoff call

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,680
at 9 00 am instead time and on february

00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,839
3rd

00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,640
at the same time paul will present at

00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:23,359
the open source readiness

00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:25,599
meeting so if you want to know more make

00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:27,280
sure you join one of these two calls

00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,440
and you can check the details in our

00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,680
project calendar

00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,800
if you already know that you want to be

00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,280
part of it

00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,079
probably the best way is to fork the

00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,160
repository

00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,119
play with it submit for requests and

00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,520
issues

00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,520
um if you prefer emails you can use odp

00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:47,040
at finosotor to send

00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:50,079
messages and that's it from me

00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:53,839
back to you james thank you very much

00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:57,119
um now for that your proxy update um

00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:59,119
and now we go over to ammo um within

00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,520
devops mutualization special interest

00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,119
group

00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,880
ammo i believe that you're on the line

00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,079
if you'd like to come off me and say

00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,119
hello

00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,920
yes um thanks james hi everyone i'm amul

00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,920
shukla

00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,320
i'm with morgan stanley and i'm the lead

00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,520
for the devops mutualization special

00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:17,040
interest group

00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:19,440
which was added to finos in q4 as we

00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:23,119
heard earlier from here

00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,880
the sig is really intended to provide a

00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:28,400
platform for

00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:31,839
the members to share their approach on

00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,800
how devops adoption can be accelerated

00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:34,480
while providing

00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,240
obviously the continuous compliance and

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,839
assurance that many of our banking

00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,839
members need

00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:41,119
the goals are to actually develop a

00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:43,599
common understanding

00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,960
of devops practices tooling and projects

00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,119
across banks

00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,560
and then use that to influence the

00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,520
ecosystem

00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:54,000
around devops and cloud especially in

00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,680
terms of what vendors provide

00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,599
and then also document the common

00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:01,520
approaches that are used

00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:05,280
to ensure compliance and assurance

00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:08,960
across banks based on the

00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:11,359
2020 sort of q4 member feedback

00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,720
we've identified two themes that we'll

00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:14,880
be focusing on

00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,400
at least in the first half of this year

00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:19,440
uh in this week

00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,839
the first is uh basically

00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,680
identifying the different type of

00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,720
evidence artifacts that need to be

00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,400
produced

00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:32,240
and stored for sdlc and change

00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:35,200
sort of deployment uh processes at banks

00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:37,040
and the second one is around how banks

00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,400
are actually orchestrating their

00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:42,960
existing uh self-service workflows

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:46,560
around devops

00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:49,920
we absolutely look forward to

00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:52,800
contributions really from the community

00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,440
and really the best way to contribute is

00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,280
to

00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,400
join the next meeting our next meeting

00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,000
is going to be on february the 18th

00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,640
all of our meeting minutes are on the

00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,480
github repository that's shown on the

00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:07,280
slide deck here and you can obviously

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,640
also raise

00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,280
issues or add comments to provide your

00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,079
feedback

00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,160
and perspective on uh the existing

00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,760
issues on the github repository

00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,520
um and there's also the mailing list

00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,480
that's shown here to have

00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:24,000
uh discussions as well and again we

00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:28,079
absolutely look forward to

00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,560
uh feedback from the member community

00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,839
for this special interest group so

00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,720
that's everything from me

00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,680

00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,720
that we have you actually have

00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:46,400

actually have all of their agendas

00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,079
within their github issues

00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,440
um so certainly within devops

00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:55,280
mutualization

00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:57,440
and also cloud certification and others

00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,200
if you look in their github issues um

00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,440
and look for a meeting

00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,280

in terms of the growth of inner source

00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,000
interest uh in both the inner source

00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,119
commons but also with finos members over

00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,839
the last while

00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:01,040

00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:18,800
inner source sig

00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:21,040
and the goal of the special interest

00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,800
group is to create that safe space to

00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:25,359
identify and share challenges

00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,480
and solutions that accelerated uh

00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:28,160
organizations

00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,160
fintech organizations to implement inner

00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,599
source within their organizations and we

00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,200
are hoping to collaborate with that

00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,920
broader finos community to share the

00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,760
outputs

00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,599
and we know we've had a great interest

00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,359
from the open source readiness

00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:41,119
group so far in terms of the events

00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:42,400
we've run so far and we're hoping to

00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,760

and we also hope that we will continue

00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,880
to work with the inner source commons

00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,680
organization by sharing relevant outputs

00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,400
upstream

00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,160
we're in the very early stages of sig

00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,720
setup having only been approved last

move through these uh the operational

00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,800

facilitate and and support that

00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:44,240

for asking me so um it's james hi i'm

00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:57,680
interested in the

00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:59,839
inner soul sig how do i join a sig like

00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:01,359
that it's not obvious to me

00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:02,880
so actually that's um that's a really

00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:06,160
good question um

00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:08,640
how you actually join a sig um so

00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:10,000
just like a finnos project um all of our

00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:13,200
six are represented

00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,359
um on github um so if you you want to

00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,880
join devops mutualization

00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:18,800
uh if you would like to join the

00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:21,280
regulation innovation sig

00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,880
um the inner source sig at the moment

00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,119
has just been contributed so

00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,960
it doesn't have um a repository on

00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:28,000
github yet within the fitness

00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,559
organization

00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,480
but that will be coming soon um but if

00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:35,839
you visit any of the sig

00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:37,680
um repos within the issues um of our

00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:41,520
replays and this also goes for

00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:44,319
finos projects as well when um

00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,720
project meetings are organized all of

00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:47,920
the

00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:51,040

graham when the

00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:01,440
repo for uh the inner soul sig has

00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,119
actually been created

00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,040
i'll make sure that that's emailed out

00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:40,880
the one thing that i will also say

00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,160
alongside watching the finnos community

00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,400
repository

00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:45,920
please also recognize the people around

00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,960
you within the finnos community who are

doing great work

00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:50,319
you know so that's a great way to raise

00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:53,280
an issue

00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:54,240
um which is you know kind of like a fun

00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,240
thing to do

00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,440
rather than actually raising an issue

00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:59,359
you know the term issue

00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:01,119
you know doesn't describe how issues are

00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:02,880
actually used in this context

00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,319
but it'll be really good to hear about

00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,559
you know all of the great work

00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:08,640
all of the great innovation how people

00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:12,880
are solving problems you know in in

00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:14,720
really kind of unique ways um and also

00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,319
as we've demonstrated through the

00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,599
community spotlight it doesn't have to

00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:19,520
be developers

00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:21,040
um who are being recognized you know we

00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,400
also have people

00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:24,160
from across lots of different

00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,599
disciplines inputting into finnos

00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:28,799

00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:30,880
other community activities so um for

00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:32,640

sure please see is that yeah it's adam

00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:54,480
um i wanted to ask what people's idea

00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,040
would be around maybe having more of an

00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,160
ad hoc

00:55:55,040 --> 00:56:01,200
way to speak to other finnos members

00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:02,000
um you know something more like an irc

00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,000
or a slack or

00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,079
a rocket chat or you know whatever the

00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,880
popular messaging services

00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:09,760
um today because i i quite liked the

00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,440
open store

00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,839
strategy forum having a place to just

00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:16,160
chat to people um when you've got free

00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:19,520
time so it's just a question

00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:24,480
about that that's

00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:24,480
that's a really good question um say

00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:28,079
i'm gonna answer this in a couple of

00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:30,319
ways and anybody else from within the

00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:31,359
finnos team feel free to come off new

00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:33,520
and also answer

00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:34,880
adam if feel free to put that question

00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:37,280
down in the finnos

00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:39,040
um community repo so we actually you

00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,559
know have that as something that's been

00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:43,680
aired from the community

00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:46,880
it'd be great to have that there yeah um

00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:47,359
but also from my experience um finos is

00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,319
unique

00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:52,319
because we're a regulated industry um

00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:53,839
and we also have members within the

00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:56,079
finnos community

00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:58,160
that don't necessarily have access to

00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:00,960
all of those types of communication

00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:03,280
channels and so we're within maybe the

00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:05,119
fintech community or people within the

00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:07,599
technology community

00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:08,400
where slack and you know other messaging

00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:12,079
systems

00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:14,000
are a lot easier to get um to get on and

00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:15,920
actually use and partake in

00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,119
within the banking community that is

00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,440
regulated both

00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:21,040
you know within you know the regulation

00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,760
of the actual industry

00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,160
and also other internal teams and you

00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,880
know

00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,760
approval around systems getting access

00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,960
to slack

00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:32,720
and um uh systems

00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,079
you know that allow information to be

00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:37,040
divulged in that way

00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:38,400
isn't quite so easy and so this is

00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:41,440
something that we are

00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:43,440
um looking to solve within um devops

00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,960
mutualization funny enough it's about

00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,440
finding that common

00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,160
area or space you know for people to be

00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:51,359
able to

00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:52,960
um have conversations but the one thing

00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:54,240
that i would recommend is using the

00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:57,839
community repo

00:57:54,240 --> 00:58:00,240
um because github is that kind of common

00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:02,400
area where people can get access to

00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:04,240
issues and also to projects

00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,680
and within those issues you can make

00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:08,960
comments so

00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:11,839
until we kind of evolve kind of like a

00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:13,359
a communication method you know that

00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:15,839
uses other mechanisms

00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:16,880
um around github i would actually say

00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:18,799
that um

00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,720
feel free to use you know the community

00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:22,000
repo for asking questions like the one

00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:24,000
that you asked and also

00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,160
the one that dan you asked and for

00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,960
people to you know socialize throughout

00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:30,160
the comments

00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:32,559
um that is my experience you know

00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:33,920
it's a great vantage point to get in

00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:36,799
contact with people

00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:38,160
but if um people within you know finos

00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:40,079
if you've got anything else that you

00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:43,119
would like to add to that answer

00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:44,400
um feel free to to come off an ad

00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:46,400
i think you're right james and just just

00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,839
to we we we

00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,280
do think it would be great to have you

00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:50,960
know more ways for that ad hoc

00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,480
communication and so we're

00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,000
continuing to look including with the

00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:55,599
resources of the linux foundation and

00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,040
exploring what you know what that where

00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:59,119
they've seen success is what we can do

00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:02,640
within again that regulated industry but

00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:03,200
it's a great question but if people

00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:06,000
within

00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,799
the banking community have also got any

00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,720
um

00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:11,520
you know answers to that question about

00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:13,839
how you can also communicate across

00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:16,000
external people outside of your you know

00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:18,000
banking internal banking community feel
