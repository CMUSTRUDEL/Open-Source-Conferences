yes thanks aaron and thanks everyone for

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,600
joining so my name is anthony vodka

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,640
i've been with rbc for 16 years

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,840
and over the last two years

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,159
uh along with the the team that i work

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,880
with

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,200
we've been on a mission to help change

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,040
uh

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:26,640
the culture of uh our company of rbc

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,880
and uh yeah it's we eventually started

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,119
up

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,320
uh the open source program office as

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,360
well but

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,479
uh before we could start our open source

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,880
program office

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,680
our our goal mission and we spent a year

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,920
doing it

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,200
together was building up our inner

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,640
source program

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,280
so a bit about

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,640
uh rbc just for those that don't know

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,040
we're in canada

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,799
uh where the cold usually it's blue i'd

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,280
say the pictures because it's colder

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,240
they say uh last year we made about 13.8

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,920
billion dollars

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,079
in revenue uh we are the largest uh

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,680
uh bank in canada and i would say

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,039
probably from a brand perspective

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,440
one of the bigger brands in in canada

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,400
we have five lines of business um we're

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,560
heavily

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,440
segregated investors in treasury

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,440
services

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,360
which operates all around the world by

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,160
insurance which primarily operates in

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,200
canada

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,720
wealth management which is very large in

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,640
uh in the u.s canada and in

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,000
certain jurisdictions around the world

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,959
our capital markets

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,040
uh business and our uh personal personal

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,879
commercial banking as well

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,440
uh 84 million number employees 34

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,480
countries

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,959
16 million clients globally so uh

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,040
i would say that like other companies

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,680
you know we try to do a lot we do a lot

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,959
of

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,440
athletic sponsorships we sponsor golf we

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,440
do

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,040
a lot of things and the reason why i go

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,480
through all of these things

00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,840
is because it really goes to show how

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,200
much of a siloed organization that rbc

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,480
is and

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,360
hopefully that resonates with a lot of

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,480
people uh being in a solid organization

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,879
gets really tough

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,680
especially when one person has a

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,840
question on

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,360
a team and they ask you know a senior

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,879
person because they're new here

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,040
they ask a manager who's been here for

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,200
like 16 years the manager's no

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,360
question so the manager asks another

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,120
peer that they worked with 10 years ago

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,720
that person is no longer technical so

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,480
they ask a person on their team

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,840
who their lead is who asks another

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,319
person who knows the answer

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,200
but that answer is in a different org so

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,840
then that goes

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,879
and you can see here information is

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,120
really tribal

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,560
uh it's very siloed and the worst part

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,120
is is when the second person has a

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,200
question

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,440
same question that does not get answered

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,360
life is not the greatest for that person

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,440
right at the bottom right hand corner

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,560
now multiply this by the 84

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,319
000 people in rbc multiply that by the

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,959
different jurisdictions different time

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,040
zones

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,159
different ways of communicating it's

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,519
very very

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:06,720
very messy and very hard at times

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,720
anthony um your slides are not up yet um

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,519
sorry about that let me just share i had

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,840
a really cool

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,840
thing with that all right with that

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,560
so i'll just really quickly show this is

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,800
the silent piece

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,320
where questions and answers come in you

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,120
multiply that by a large organization

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,440
and then

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,199
it's conway's law so accommodate law is

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,080
an organization that designs the system

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,000
will produce

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,360
a design whose structure is a copy of

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,240
the organization's communication

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,759
structure

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,240
so in simpler terms it really is about

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,280
the way your boss and boss and boss is

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,040
organized you're going to build your

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,199
systems that same way

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,199
and there's going to be no

00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:49,520
cross-collaboration so

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,120
a lot of teams have done false starts to

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,280
try to break those silos

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,240
and i wouldn't say that they're all been

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,240
successful

00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:01,280
i know at rbc um when how i got my job

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,320
is uh our senior executive

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,120
had asked a question on one of our

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,320
collaboration tools called jive and he

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,600
asked the question what are your pain

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,280
points

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,800
and a lot of them were around

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,960
environment and

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,639
uh as well as you know open source

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,520
community code sharing

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,080
collaboration tools community and a lot

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,720
of those

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,360
problems and pain points bubbled up to

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,360
him

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,400
so he made the conscientious effort to

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,960
say you know what

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,560
i want to hire someone that can solve

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,960
all these problems

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,639
and that's how i got my job so i've been

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,600
at the bank 16 years

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,000
14 prior we're in various different

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,759
roles

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,360
and then i got like i got i'd say i got

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,680
a cool lucky job

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,560
uh they hired me as a team of one just

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,240
myself

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,080
to help uh solve this and then um i got

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,639
lucky enough to start building a team uh

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,759
from the ground up of developers

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,560
who were truly passionate uh and

00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,039
and and solving uh cross-collaboration

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,160
and

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,840
eventually hired um a couple developers

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,440
and we hired a community manager

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,840
um i'll throw names out so richard gomez

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,000
and

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,000
samuel hack were two developers uh

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,400
community managers as well as elaine ko

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,280
and and kisha of broadway so we had a

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,319
lot of folks

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,639
uh join uh the fight and um

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,319
through that journey uh when i first

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:26,720
started i started on june 24

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:30,560
2018 that was my first day on the job um

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:33,360
first thing i did uh about a month after

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,000
was we went out drinking um because i

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,840
had no idea

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,440
how to build a community so i was

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,280
clueless so um

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,720
i like to go for drinks and you can see

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,440
here this is a picture from the actual

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,039
event

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,039
everyone drinking we just talked like

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,560
how do we solve

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,000
how do we solve all these side loads

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,120
like everyone's complaining that we

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,520
don't have a community

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,199
well how do we do it so our first

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,080
drinking event i i blogged it on our

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,680
internal site

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,360
i can't i won't share that with you guys

00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,199
now but if you guys really want to read

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,479
that blog yes reach out to me

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,280
uh so we want drinking and uh nothing

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,280
really happened

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,319
so uh um i eventually created a blog

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,880
post on this

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,800
in august and i and i uh i said the

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,160
times they are changing this blog post

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,440
was really about

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,120
um how do we when i talk to people about

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,639
this cultural change how do we share

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,120
more how do we collaborate more

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,639
i got a lot of resistance i'm saying

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,160
anthony people have tried this many

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,319
times it's always failed

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,080
um so i wrote a blog post about all the

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,199
top 10 things that people said why this

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,560
would fail and

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,840
uh rebuttal against it um so again i was

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,120
kind of at the drawing board i had no

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,479
idea what to do again

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,639
so i fall back on my common um

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,000
crutch which is let's go drinking again

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,000
so we weren't drinking two more

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,840
times um again i blogged those events

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,440
so people will be aware i figure if

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,240
people see enough free food and free

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,440
drinks

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,840
uh they'll join us so um and then

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,039
eventually decided that i should start

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,319
rewarding the people that actually

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,840
started showing up all the time and

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,280
started sharing so

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,759
um with little handy things uh

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,440
i made a uh a little a little award we

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,479
call the style buster award

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:15,520
basically it's uh three trophies with

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,160
us uh a steel rod built through it with

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,240
a star

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,440
on it it was uh built in my little

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,639
workshop here

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,240
um but now we give we built

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,080
that reward and now we give it on a

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,759
quarterly basis for

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,360
people who share and then want to

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,000
collaborate uh

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,399
it became a teaching thing but now it's

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,800
become

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,760
every quarter we get a video people get

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,399
uh actual

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,440
monetary reward out of it if it's a team

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,479
award

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:45,920
and it became a very popular thing so

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,800
i still didn't see enough uptick

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,000
so we went drinking again and i finally

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,160
pleaded with people

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,120
saying that i can't keep spending the

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,600
bank's money

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,200
without seeing results we really got to

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,680
get serious about this

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,640
and so we stopped drinking at bars and

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,320
we just got together

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,120
at the office this is obviously

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,880
pre-covered and we

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,399
kind of started this little thing called

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,839
dx warm and

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,680
uh swarm alec bees uh the team

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,120
that started all this like b so we kind

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,920
of went with that theme

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,800
and the theme there was just get

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,279
together

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,240
and um i said i will host the first

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,959
event

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,720
and i will invite the people that i

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,800
think are super cool and awesome

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,720
and i'll ask them to share their super

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,760
cool and awesome things

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,200
and about um i think about like seven or

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,920
eight people

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,839
within the hour stood up and told their

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,720
story of what people are sharing

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,760
and what they could reuse and that was a

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,760
super cool event

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,959
as you can see it was very well attended

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,320
and i told people

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:54,399
that my you know i i'll host this one

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,399
but i have one rule if we continue to do

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,440
this the one rule is is i can't host it

00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,680
again

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,360
um if i keep hosting the event then

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,360
basically

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,720
i'm gonna have all my friends always

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,160
present and talk and then i'm not going

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,760
to learn i'm kind of selfish i want to

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,360
learn from other people so

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,680
uh the one rule we have is you can't

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,240
host you cannot host twice

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,680
and we've been having uh we have six

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,079
events a year we do this every other

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,440
month

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,360
and then we also have something called

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,160
tech talks where it's a

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,800
longer form and it's a deep dive an hour

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,880
uh

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,800
it's usually a half an hour to 45 minute

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,000
deep talk with questions and answers

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,120
on various topics so every month there's

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,519
guaranteed at least

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,640
one event there's several other small

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,079
little events that you know in the

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,160
question and answers i can definitely

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:41,360
talk about that

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,680
um but then uh five months into the role

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,200
uh we did all these things and then i

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,560
presented my boss saying hey

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,320
thanks for hiring me and giving me a

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,839
chance uh

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,240
i'm a team of one right now um can i

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,079
present to you how my strategy works and

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,440
how we can take this forward

00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,440
so what i'm gonna the rest of the

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,680
presentation is actually

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,800
a copy and paste of the strategy

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,519
document that i gave to my boss

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,519
after trying all these things out and

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,959
asking him basically for more money so i

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,200
can hire people

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,000
uh and try to grow this out this inner

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,279
source program so

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,040
this is the first slide i talked to my

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,720
boss on so i said after five months you

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,839
know i presented this strategy so i said

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,279
i've done i've spoken um

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,040
on inner sources like 20 different

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:30,160
people and whatnot from

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,399
close friends and got some feedback uh

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,920
i've been using open source for the past

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,720
18 years at the time

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,079
um i didn't i failed to mention i i had

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,720
my own startup

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,680
back in the early 2000s where i built

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,680
software and

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,880
primarily my software was all based on

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,920
open source

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,279
uh i use a lot of open source products i

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,959
built a product that

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,040
uh i basically built a cms like a

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:55,360
wordpress before wordpress and

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,560
all those other like like uh sharepoint

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,560
were available

00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,720
then i eventually sold that to uh the

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,040
ontario uh government

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,120
uh but i it was primarily an open source

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,320
and i was a big advocate of it so

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,959
i have some experience there uh

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,560
at the time i was 15 years at rbc with

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,839
11 different jobs so i've done

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,959
everything from

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:20,000
uh development to quality assurance to

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,200
project management to department manager

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,839
i've done i've done a lot of different

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,320
roles at rbc so i kind of played many

00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,839
hats

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,839
in this and i kind of feel uh how others

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,519
feel so it was a great way for me to

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,720
step in and walk and mile in someone's

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,760
shoes

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,440
um and

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,519
that was my job so my job was inner

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,800
source so um i actually got a lot of

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,959
time thinking

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,160
uh on how to do this i i actually at the

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,079
time went to europe

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,760
for for two weeks i did a backpacking

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,399
trip and really did a lot of thinking

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,240
on how how i would want to what kind of

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,040
company would i want to work for

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,959
and and that's what i try to model um a

00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,560
lot of the actions that i do

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:03,200
um so and i had 30 minutes so i

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,959
presented him the strategy

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,600
so the two guiding principles that i

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:10,079
that i'd say are still the same today

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,320
for our team is that principle number

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:15,120
one it has to be grassroots

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,760
this cannot be from the top of the house

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,519
down

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,440
this has to be a push from

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,600
the folks and that they truly believe

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,959
inner source is the culture that they

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,880
want to work in

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,560
uh one of the biggest misnomers or

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,959
misconceptions of inner sources

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,680
it's a product or it's a it's a thing i

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,920
use

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,279
inner source is a culture and it's it's

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,040
it's something that is at the

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,519
grassroots of the the people on the

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,399
hands on keyboard they actually use

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,160
so um when i talked to my boss i told

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,600
this has to be a cultural change it's

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,040
nothing more than a pro it's not a

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,680
product it's a cultural change

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,360
it's from the people up and the second

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,040
thing is is we have to build a community

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,519
around this and obviously a community

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,120
needs

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:59,279
support a community needs um

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,480
the community needs uh sponsorship at

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,079
the top of the house

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,839
it needs uh funding to um

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,760
support the community like the events

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,000
that we do uh they all had

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,079
food they had a you know i think we had

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,880
uh like a vegetable tray with some

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,880
cookies

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,240
so people came in and coffee some people

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,800
came in they can you know have a quick

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,800
fight

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,920
they can listen and they can learn so i

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,240
definitely needed a

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,519
community vibe and feel but it had to be

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,360
supported at the top

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,120
and i and i promised that if we can get

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,560
that community and we do it grassroots

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,519
and let the people decide

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,079
how they want to push and drive this

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,240
change

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:37,199
this culture then the byproducts would

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:40,720
be things like reuse cost avoidance

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:42,959
etc uh and i made it clear that this is

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,160
you cannot lead with these two things

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,920
these byproducts

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,440
we have to leave with grassroots and it

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,079
has to be community based

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,720
and then those things will come it took

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,600
about

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,279
a good year to two years to actually get

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,680
these byproducts so it had

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,720
me you know my boss was patient with us

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,600
uh with the team

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,079
so uh that that's definitely a great

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,279
plus uh support

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:09,839
so when i presented him like

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,399
how do we do this and and promise him

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,199
like a vision of reuse and collaboration

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,920
and all these

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,360
wonderful things uh there's another

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,959
walls away i i

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,480
reread a book called crossing the chasm

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,360
uh so if you guys have read that book

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,120
yeah you know what this will look

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,720
familiar or any adoption curve

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,440
you'll know this is like a bell-shaped

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,079
curve where the first five phases

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,680
you first have people who are innovators

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,959
technology enthusiasts the people that

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,759
you don't even have to say a word and

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,399
they're already

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,199
doing the this cultural change that i

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,600
talk about that's

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,120
inner source the next is you have early

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,040
adopters people who

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,720
uh you have to spend about two seconds

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,839
with them and they'll get it

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,600
um these are people and employees that

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,959
want the culture they want to work like

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,000
this they want to change

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,279
i spent at the time 15 years you know

00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,560
now it's it's you know

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,440
17 16 17 years at rbc i'm one of these

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,440
people i want

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,279
to work in a place where if i have a

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,800
problem i can ask anyone and they'll

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,360
help me and if someone else has a

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,759
problem

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,639
i will help them it's just second nature

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,639
to me that's

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,920
that these are the people that you want

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,279
to target and

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,759
identify early on then in the book

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,880
it talks about this chasm this chasm

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,839
could take

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,360
months to years to never happening this

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,320
you can fall down this chasm and you can

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,519
just your program

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:32,320
can just die um this is the chasm that

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,759
is the hardest part to cross um and once

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,600
you cross that chasm though

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,199
then you can start looking and building

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,360
your community with early majority

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:43,920
the pragmatic people who um

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,040
basically want uh convenience and they

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,959
want to see

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,079
things that just make sense in to their

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,079
job they want to

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,320
go nine to five and come home and if it

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,680
makes sense then they'll adopt

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,199
then you have the late majority the

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,480
conservatives these are the people you

00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,440
know i would say that are

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,880
um a little more the risk adverse they

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,040
kind of don't want to change

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,880
um if they don't have to then you have

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,439
your laggers and skeptics

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,280
and if you group all these people these

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,720
are employees that want solution and

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,319
convenience

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,919
you're going to have a tougher time

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,280
getting these people because

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,079
you got to make life easy you got to

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,439
give them

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,160
monetary reward if if the people on the

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,839
left

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,199
you just have to like breathe and

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,199
they're already following

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,559
uh the culture these are the people

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,080
where you gotta you know you may have to

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,559
pay them more you have to

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,360
uh put this and part of your uh yearly

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,520
goals

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,120
uh you have to chase them you have to

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,640
make the easier so they can go home

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:43,039
earlier that's a big difference so

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,880
when i joined i would say in november

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:48,080
2018 we were definitely

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,520
in this phase of of our journey and i'll

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,160
show you at the end where

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,600
and how we progressed at the end of the

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,559
slide the presentation i put a little

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,760
bit of a uh

00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:00,799
a summary of of our journey

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,840
so i told my boss that when it comes to

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,000
employee experience

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,360
uh and you could read i can't i remember

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,559
the book that i got this from

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,320
but uh with any cultural change there's

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,480
three parts to it there's culture

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,640
there's technology in a workplace so i

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,679
broke the problem down into these three

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,960
segments

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,440
on how to build that inner source

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,679
culture so

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,640
i took them through my plan on how we do

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,000
all three

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,640
so culture um from talking to

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,360
friends talking to previous colleagues

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,080
um

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,280
talking to my boss and his peers we

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,559
crowdsourced

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,160
this um this definition of what we want

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,600
inner source to be at rbc

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,200
now at your companies they may be

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,919
different uh maybe

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,160
the same who knows but um it was a

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,840
culture we wanted a collaboration

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,240
we wanted a culture that communicates

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,000
openly about the challenges and ideas

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,000
we want a culture where the community is

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,320
energized by the challenges

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
we want to can do culture that is

00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,600
willing to give instead of take

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,280
we want a culture that is willing to

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,960
admit that it's not perfect

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,559
we wanted a culture that is looking to

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,799
grow and improve

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,919
now at our first big big event i

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,080
presented this

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,520
to uh all the people that attended you

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,840
can you saw there's over

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,440
150 people there i got in trouble for

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,840
the fire code for the record but

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,520
that was a goal my boss and i had was to

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,280
get in trouble

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,600
i presented this and then someone came

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,600
to me said anthony this looks like

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,520
like okay make it better like this is

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,559
the whole point of a community

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:33,200
so the designer came in and actually

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:35,039
uh redid this whole slide to make it

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,480
look like this

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,640
and that's where i got super excited i'm

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,320
like wow we had this cool thing

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,160
and this person's a designer came in and

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,640
just made it look better

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:47,679
and that if i can say has been the whole

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,520
theme of our inner source program at rbc

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,200
we've really started with something that

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,880
was crap and we've just been

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,559
building building building on top of

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,120
each other's ideas

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,600
and if you actually look at the previous

00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,440
one

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,039
um how this looked we actually also

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,600
changed the word so this actually always

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,039
has been

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,400
evolving and i've gone to the same

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,039
designer or they've actually shared the

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,520
content

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,840
we've actually updated the content as we

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,840
evolve

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:16,799
so then uh when it came to culture

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,240
uh there's a famous quote you can never

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,559
improve if you can't measure

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,440
so you really want to focus on measuring

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,240
our

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,200
um our productivity but the problem is

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,240
is that

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,880
i had i was by myself i had a a co-op

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,320
student

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,559
that was working with me one day a week

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,000
at the time who wasn't focused on this

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:37,600
so i was pretty much

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,600
flying solo so what i did was um

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,280
i told my boss listen we have all these

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,960
events here look look how many people

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,679
are in there i can't tell you

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,360
uh through statistics you know how many

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,799
people there are there i can't tell you

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,400
who's winning the awards and how he

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,520
recognized and sharing but if you give

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,320
me some time

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,520
i will actually um start trying to show

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,120
you measurements

00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,280
so i showed him this chart so wouldn't

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,679
this be cool if i can tell you

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,360
how many people are using libraries or

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,320
this is all fake data by the way this is

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,799
not real at all

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,600
i made it all up um wouldn't it be cool

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,840
if i can do this

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,200
i can do that i showed him i showed him

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,120
um

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,880
some cool stuff and then i said then

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,360
he's like anthony this is awesome i want

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,760
this

00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,120
so he actually let me hire one person so

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,760
his name is richard

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,520
um he was my co-op student for uh he

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:28,840
worked with me one day a week

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:30,159
and he came in starting in january of

00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,799
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,720
and uh he created some dashboards for us

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:38,000
so we're able to start measuring

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:40,559
um uh who's actually uh

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,919
uh contributing to uh different projects

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,880
and these are a bunch of projects that

00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,480
we have

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,320
i can show you live stuff later on if

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,200
the questions go there

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,960
um we started seeing like who's

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,159
collaborating on what so richard did a

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,080
great job to actually

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,960
put that you know for that vision of

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,679
like my crappy little powerpoint

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,320
enticement to actually real data that we

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,320
were tracking

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,600
so then we i talked i walked him through

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,559
um

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,080
some workplace uh changes so i saw like

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:13,200
we really need to start building

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,760
that culture around

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,120
um there it is so we need your blue

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,480
knight culture where people can work

00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,840
anywhere so we actually started doing

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,320
some more events so

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,400
we did a lot of like office hours we've

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,720
done uh we did a kids code camp

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,559
uh we do uh eventually hired someone to

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,240
help out with that

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,240
uh giving back to the community as you

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,440
can see the bottom part we

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,039
did more awards uh we have small little

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,480
lunch and learn sessions

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,960
we really started giving people the

00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,760
place to work and the time to work

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,720
so that was super important um as well

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,600
so i actually

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:50,080
uh before covet uh getting space to work

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,919
at in our company was very difficult

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,159
um you have to book a year in advance to

00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,679
get a space just like this so we

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,840
actually got priority on a lot of things

00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,320
which is really helpful

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,200
uh finally technology so we needed the

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,960
right tools

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,720
to do things um uh uh this is a this is

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,760
not an endorsement of tools

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:13,360
uh this is just tools that we've used

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,559
um i i don't wanna i'm not gonna endorse

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,720
anything that

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,159
uh that just making sure i don't get in

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,520
trouble with uh any companies or

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,960
anything like that

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:25,200
so we we focused on github i'd say

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,360
that's been uh the number one tool that

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,799
we started adopting right off the bat

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:34,960
um back in so i guess i've been here for

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:38,559
since like the early mid 2000s

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:41,600
since then when i joined we had probably

00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,480
five six seven different soft uh scm

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,600
tools

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,720
uh soft so uh

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:53,640
i'm not gonna harvest s subversion

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,960
uh so many different tools and in

00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,520
2015-1617

00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,600
there was a contest ever to consolidate

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,559
all those scms into one tool which is

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,760
github

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:06,000
and that has been i'd say uh

00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,520
the ground that's like you don't you

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,799
don't have github installed

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,400
or a tool like you know where you can

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,600
consolidate all your source code into

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,799
one spot

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,400
then like that's step one your

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,840
you can't collaborate on code if

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,520
everyone's turn the code in different

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,760
repositories

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,960
so table stakes right off the bat is you

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,440
need um

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,159
one place to work in i i personally like

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,279
github

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,360
i know that's kind of like an

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,919
endorsement but it's

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,120
my tool preference i think that you

00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,120
could do it with other tools i think

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,640
github just lends itself to be like the

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,720
more superior tool just where they are

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:42,080
in the marketplace

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,840
um against uh if if you're everyone's

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,200
sharing their code in one spot like

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,799
github

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,320
communication was just everywhere

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,320
there's so many ways to communicate

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,679
email is not very conducive to

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,279
uh talking live um i would say

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,960
again like i said it's not endorsement

00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:59,039
this is what i like because i'm used to

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:02,480
it i'm a creature of habit

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:05,279
i like slack i used it before rbc

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,760
and adopted it but we adopted it holy

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:10,640
and i was happy to see it i'm used to it

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,480
and it really became a bridge between

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,080
different organizations and

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,760
our developer community really rallied

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,640
around it and a lot of conversations

00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,600
happened there

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,640
um i would say it's very easy for me to

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,960
say hey everyone

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,960
i'm gonna be presenting five cool topics

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,279
i make an announcement and boom i get

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,200
people

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:29,039
joining me uh in the conversation so

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,640
it's been a really easy way

00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,080
if you can manage to get everyone

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,919
collaborating and talk

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,679
talking on like a real-time chat system

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,720
like slack

00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:42,000
it's gonna make your life a lot easier

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:45,120
next um as good as slack is

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,640
we wanted to uh really try to mine the

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,120
data that comes out of slack so we

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,559
actually

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:53,840
created a an internal stack overflow uh

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:55,679
we we built this uh in-house um

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,279
based on a couple open source projects

00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,480
we put it together we actually started

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,600
putting in very important information in

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,679
null pointer

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,039
um it's our internal stack overflow

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,400
we've tried to put

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,080
uh relevant information so when

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,559
developers get stuck on something

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,200
instead of waiting you know 24 hours for

00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,520
reply

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,200
you can search this uh this repository

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,440
for any useful information

00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,600
and that hopefully that helps people uh

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,279
resolve their problems

00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,440
another internal tool that was created

00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:26,080
was a learning lab it's like git labs

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,360
uh basically uh i mentioned earlier

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,760
about tribal knowledge

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,279
uh and then the culture of giving

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,640
instead of taking learning labs is

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,640
exactly that

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,000
people have started to actually put uh

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,200
learning materials

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,480
on in a very organized manner into

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,039
specific labs with

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,279
specific themes uh that are very hard

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:47,760
like how do i use vault at rbc

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,799
how do i use our openshift environment

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,240
and opc or

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,480
rbc how do i use you know any uh how do

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,120
i

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,159
do machine learning at rbc uh we put it

00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,960
together all these learning

00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,279
opportunities

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,640
for unlocking rbc specific tribal

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:03,440
knowledge

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,559
and finally um we needed a place to put

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,679
all of our artifacts

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:10,960
so uh we used sona types tool

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,919
um nexus is open nexus repository is

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,480
open source

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,039
um nexus iq another tool you can use for

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,159
scanning

00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:20,399
uh those are the key tools um that we

00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,799
eventually put up i wouldn't say day one

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:24,480
we needed all of these uh i kind of

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:27,039
watched you guys through the progression

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,480
of where we focused our efforts on uh

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,760
and there's more tools to come again i

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,559
can ask if there's questions in the end

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:35,679
i can always answer those then

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,880
so i'll kind of wrap up and this slide

00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,520
was uh

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,720
um a little summary slide of two of our

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,919
first year

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:46,159
so um at the end of the first year

00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,080
from zero because we never measured uh

00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,640
active projects we had about 70

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,279
active projects in our first year which

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,399
is pretty good

00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:57,840
um i tell you now

00:27:54,399 --> 00:28:00,000
uh when we first started an

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,120
org in inner source in our github

00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,320
repository

00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:06,480
we had like nothing it was like

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,080
we started from scratch ground up so we

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,640
get 70 pro it doesn't look like a large

00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,600
number but

00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,039
that was pretty active in seven in 30

00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,799
days that's pretty good

00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,159
we had 100 plus contributors that were

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,480
very active which was

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,159
hey we got people like i remember my

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,000
boss saying what's the number today

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,480
uh you know we're about 10 people being

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,240
active and you know 20 people 30 people

00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,960
we got to 100 it's like wow we got 100

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,960
people

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,039
actively working here that was a that

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,919
was a it's a small number but it was

00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,559
very very

00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,159
from zero to 100 is pretty uh you know

00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,960
exciting

00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,640
uh in the year we did about 25 events to

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,080
really rally the community

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,559
uh we had one community award and if you

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,559
look at

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,679
the whole entire year the amount of

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:51,200
unique people

00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:54,960
we landed on 297 unique people

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,960
and that's about one-third were active

00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,000
so about 300 people and about one-third

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,799
of them were active

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,760
uh every 30 days and again so you know i

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,440
i would work for

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,039
a couple days on a project and that's an

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,799
inner source then i would you know

00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,000
finish it then i would bring it into my

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,520
other project and then i would actually

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,320
use it internally on my other

00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,520
application

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,200
and then i would not be active for a

00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,080
couple days so we're totally not

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,520
expecting

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,080
all 300 people to be active 365 days of

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,440
the year

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,360
this is really like when you only go in

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,240
when you need it

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,440
so um this is a new slide that i did

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,000
just the other day

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,679
uh just as a little update uh for 2020

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,480
so that was that was year one

00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,120
this is year two year two active

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,799
projects

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,320
uh in the last 30 days when i did listen

00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:39,360
to these metrics we're at

00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,000
313 projects so you can see here we did

00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,520
a very

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:47,679
fairly big jump um active contributors

00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:51,600
uh it went from 100 to about 140

00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:54,799
uh so again a good uptick uh we again we

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,320
there's only 12 months a year so

00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:58,159
we still are doing the same amount of

00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,960
events that hasn't changed

00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,760
uh we have one community award so that

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,440
hasn't changed by

00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,200
the community the community and sharing

00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,320
events they've all gone

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,799
uh virtual now when cobit hit

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,760
uh our community manager elaine and

00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,640
keisha

00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,080
they didn't miss a beat they it they

00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,799
adapted very quickly

00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,080
and we shifted uh virtually very quickly

00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,679
and i would say

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,919
uh we actually have more people

00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,440
attending i'm not sure if it's

00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,440
the reason but we have more people

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,080
attending virtually than we did

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,559
physically in the past i'm not sure if

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,120
it's

00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:35,360
because we've becoming more popular or

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:38,080
if it's just easier i've no idea why

00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,559
but um we're actually our events are

00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,000
being more

00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:44,960
uh more uh more attended which is great

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,919
and finally uh unique contributors uh

00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,720
the year is not over

00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,480
our year a year end is uh october 31st

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,440
we have one more month but uh

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,640
right now we're at five uh 456 uh unique

00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,919
people

00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,200
in our uh in our teen org um the cool

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,320
thing here that i didn't

00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,159
mention um is this is just our

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,399
technology department uh

00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,600
if you look at and these are the goals

00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:10,640
that i put for

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:13,679
uh my cto but this number is actually

00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:15,600
about uh 670

00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,120
if you look at outside of our teen

00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,760
awards so the contribution is actually a

00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,840
lot higher

00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,760
if you look at outside of our organ i

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,240
should have updated that number

00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,440
right for the confusion so if i look at

00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,159
this adoption curve

00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,000
uh same thing if i said you know 2018

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:33,039
we're here

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,600
2019 i would say we were still trying to

00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,679
get

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,600
those enthusiasts and getting people

00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,559
excited and trying to find our

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,880
84 000 employees it's very hard to find

00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:43,760
uh

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,000
those hidden gems uh 2020 by the end of

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,679
this year i'm hoping we have a good

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,600
early adopters we have we know kind of

00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:52,480
what we're doing now

00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,399
2021 i'm hoping we can try to be you

00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,480
know trying to cross that chasm where

00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:58,159
we've made life easy for developers to

00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,760
reuse the collaborates

00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,919
and we can really really focus over the

00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,360
next few years to really get the early

00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,600
majority this is going to be

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,480
the hard part because people are going

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,559
to complain

00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,480
oh this is not working this is not easy

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,279
so there's me a lot of work to really

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,960
get those

00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:15,039
i really majority i don't plan to get

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,080
the late majority this is going to be a

00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,919
even a harder uh task um

00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,640
but yeah i would say the hardest part is

00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:26,000
crossing that chasm

00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:28,080
um so i'd like to share

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,279
a bit about the long-term vision of

00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,679
where we want to go

00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,480
so i always it's a for horizon approach

00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,039
i took

00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,720
inspiration from the linux foundation um

00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,559
they have a four horizon approach but

00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,559
it's a little different i tweaked it

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:44,399
um for me it's step one it's your base

00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,919
it's uh you can't start you don't start

00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,640
anywhere you need that inner source

00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,480
culture

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,320
you have to get people rallied working

00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,279
together and that's horizon

00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,039
that's horizon zero horizon one is

00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:56,080
eventually we'd like to start managing

00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,960
our open source supply

00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,919
chain a lot of our inner source projects

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,760
um

00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,679
have come from open source and we bring

00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,039
it in and then we reuse across the

00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,679
organization

00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,960
so examples are you know people are

00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,440
downloading angular

00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,120
i tell ghost great you're reusing

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,640
perfect

00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,399
uh there's another team that has

00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,840
downloaded angular but they put all the

00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,000
rbc style guidelines

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,960
they put accessibility use cases they

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,600
put all

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,039
the the color rbc's blue is blue we're

00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,519
very particular about that blue

00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:29,120
it's a royal blue so please make sure

00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,480
you use that we we're very particular

00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,519
about like your branding team

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:36,880
the logo you use so i tell people

00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:39,440
you can download angular sure

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,679
or you can download uh our our version

00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,200
of angular we put in inner source

00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,720
the one in the inner source has all this

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,559
work done you can go download the

00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,399
angular version the open source one but

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:51,039
make sure you do all that work

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,640
either or pick one i personally think

00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,760
the one that's an inner source has saved

00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,679
you a lot of time

00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,600
and we've seen with that little kind of

00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,440
you know mental map people like oh yeah

00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,720
that makes sense let's move let's move

00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,640
over here because

00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,640
inner source has the enterprise

00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,559
standards

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,079
um so what we want to do is we want to

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,760
manage that supply chain

00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,599
so all the open source that comes in we

00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,520
want to make sure a that uh it's been

00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,200
scanned and we try to resolve as many

00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,040
vulnerabilities as possible

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,440
as well as we want to be respectful to

00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,159
use the licenses as the author teams

00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,919
as they put in there if there's uh

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,960
requirements you know aaron's gonna love

00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:26,000
this if there's requirements that you

00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,839
need to attribute

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,679
we attribute it those requirements that

00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:31,760
we need to provide the source

00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,520
uh upstream we provide that source so

00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,919
that's our first horizon

00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,960
that's what we're working on right now

00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:38,320
horizon 2

00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,320
is we want to eventually start

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,480
contributing mindfully

00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,919
this is the point where we want to be

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,240
able to

00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:47,440
find a vulnerability fix it and then

00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,480
contribute back

00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:52,320
so that way we are in line lock and step

00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,520
with the open source project so if there

00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,599
is an enhancement

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,359
or another vulnerability that's fixed we

00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,599
would be able to quickly upgrade

00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:00,800
and move that over into our into our

00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,320
organization

00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,520
and finally uh horizon 3 is we want to

00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,480
be able to lead strategically we want to

00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,720
give back

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,800
to the community some very good projects

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,480
uh my one one that i want to give back

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,800
is the null pointer application

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,320
love to give that one back uh the the

00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,520
learning labs is also a great one to

00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,079
give back we have a lot of

00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,920
custom tools that we built that would i

00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:24,560
would love to give back but to me

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,400
we need to master uh horizon one two and

00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,280
three before we can do that

00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,119
so uh just wrapping up uh i would say

00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,839
the key takeaways in establishing that

00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,800
culture

00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:36,240
is you need a small team uh doesn't have

00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,280
to be a big team

00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:43,040
our team is very small between uh

00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:45,359
richard uh samuel elaine keisha

00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,960
a new person's joining lasalle we've

00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,320
gotten people that have dedicated their

00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,040
time and this there's a person named

00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,480
kirk

00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,920
uh all these people are joining this

00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,599
cause because they want to get involved

00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,280
and start changing the culture so

00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,040
start building that team rally around a

00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,000
small group of people and it really

00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,240
empower them

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,599
they need leadership support at the top

00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:05,359
to make it happen

00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,240
second is i'd say make it uh invite only

00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,599
at first

00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,920
so if you're trying to kick this thing

00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,720
off uh we did a lot of invite-only you

00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,760
have to know

00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:15,520
so those drinking events um if you know

00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,520
someone who knows someone sure come

00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,480
along but we didn't really advertise

00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,240
them well we said hey we're going

00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,079
drinking we're gonna talk about cool

00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,320
we're gonna geek out on tech stuff come

00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:27,040
along uh we really made it like

00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,400
you gotta know on the inside to actually

00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,760
attend these events

00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:34,079
um i remember richard the first uh who i

00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,040
eventually hired remember um talking to

00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,119
him and he's and i

00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,240
and and i remember asking he's asking i

00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,200
heard there's an event today i'm like

00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,040
yeah come along

00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,720
here's the details and he came along to

00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:46,320
the event so really make it

00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:47,520
uh uh exclusive at first uh it really

00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,960
makes it a club and then it'll

00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,680
eventually grow and people will just

00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,880
start like

00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,760
pounding into one getting involved uh

00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,119
the second

00:36:53,760 --> 00:37:00,320
third is is make uh discoverability easy

00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:03,760
um github is great because the searches

00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:06,000
is fantastic it's fast um we're

00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,040
we're always investing in the search uh

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,359
pieces of it

00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,240
i'd love to come back in and if aaron

00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,599
will have me

00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,680
talk more about this in the future but

00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,000
we're doing more things around search to

00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,960
make

00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,640
search easy so people can just find the

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,480
the projects they want to collaborate on

00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,400
they could find the projects that they

00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,720
could reuse

00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,720
next is i would say community community

00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,320
is one of the most important pieces

00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,720
have those events uh we have our culture

00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,359
we

00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,839
we remind ourselves at least once every

00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,400
month

00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:37,920
on those six uh those six key topics at

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,839
least within our own team

00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,599
um my favorite being is we need to be

00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:44,000
willing to give instead of take

00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,880
we this little team that we have we are

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
the models

00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,320
uh we have to uh lead by example so

00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,920
we're all community on our team

00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,760
and finally i think the most important

00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,160
is uh it's a lot of work

00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,520
so you gotta move the dial every single

00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,839
day you're going into the office you

00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,599
know

00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,960
we think about this every single day

00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:03,839
we're trying to do little things

00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,800
every single day to make a big impact so

00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:07,440
with that

00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,240
i'll thank you for listening and i'll

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,240
take any questions

00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,599
thank you so much anthony um i will get

00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,960
started with the first question

00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,680
so um you uh you talked about the sort

00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,720
of number of

00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:25,359
active projects active contributors um

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,960
how are you measuring what active is

00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,640
from an inner source perspective i

00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,640
assume it's not just that the people who

00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,480
started the repository are active in it

00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:36,000
what is it what does it mean to be

00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:39,040
active so to be active means

00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,359
in github they have made a

00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:43,280
commit to a piece of code they have

00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:45,359
either maybe changed the readme to find

00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,359
a spelling mistake and they fix that

00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:48,720
it is they created they found a bug and

00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:52,640
it created an issue

00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:55,359
so any activity on github is active and

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,480
and and people may say oh no they're

00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:56,880
they're creating an issue that's not

00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,560
really

00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,240
important that you shouldn't count that

00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,040
i'd say that's probably more important

00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,760
because

00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,560
uh testing is such an important part and

00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,000
if someone can

00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,599
test an application then create the

00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,320
issue and notify us or don't find out a

00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,480
developer

00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,839
then that developer now has saved time

00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,920
in testing his application

00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:15,280
found that that edge case and they can

00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,480
then fix it later on so

00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,880
any piece of uh contribution is we count

00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,599
as active

00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,000
great thank you what um what does it

00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:30,560
take

00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,560
to um like how does a repository become

00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,400
does somebody say i want to make my

00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,119
project an inner source project within

00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,960
rbc

00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:41,119
and then you know other people can find

00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,640
it that way like

00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,400
what's what's the difference between

00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,440
just a software project and an inner

00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,119
source project

00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,680
yeah so a great question so i'm gonna

00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:52,880
i'll just show you guys this one

00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:56,720
um so uh

00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:59,119
right now this is our um inner source

00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:02,240
project you have to see the screen so we

00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,240
have an overview here

00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,920
in the overview you create an issue

00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:10,640
and i create a new issue and i can

00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,280
either move a repository

00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,480
from a pub from a private place where no

00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,400
one knew what it was

00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,839
we got a lot of these or i can create a

00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,440
brand new project

00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:25,280
you click on one of these to get started

00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:27,040
um fill a little form

00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,880
tell me the name tell me the maintainers

00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,400
tell me the purpose

00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,000
then we'll have a little conversation

00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,520
hey this project's already duplicated

00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,720
there's something very similar to this

00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,520
why don't you try working with those

00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,359
people uh or hey this is a great idea

00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,119
um i and i'll create them the project so

00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,640
we actually have a little bit of a

00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:45,359
quote-unquote management of it just so

00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:48,079
that we can um we found that

00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:49,599
um people just created a project before

00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,040
searching to see someone else already

00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,599
done it so we try to really promote

00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,680
people

00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,680
to search before they just create

00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:00,079
got it so if i have something that uh

00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,200
that i'm working on currently but it's

00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,359
not in the inner source

00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,359
space i can i can ask to move that

00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:08,640
repository over and then it becomes

00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:10,640
visible to others who who go there

00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,400
exactly so our our way we've structured

00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,839
it is we have inner source

00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,839
commons as an org

00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:21,040
great um okay looks like we have a

00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,480
question from juji juji do you want to

00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,720
just go ahead and unmute yourself and

00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,720
ask

00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,880
sure yeah so my question is we are also

00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,680
trying to focus

00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,000
uh our initial efforts in our open

00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,040
source

00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,760
program office trying to establish the

00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,520
an inner source culture right but there

00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,480
are already many teams that are

00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,359
contributing to

00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,560
existing projects on an individual basis

00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:48,960
from their own accounts

00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,079
outside of work hours and there are some

00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,400
teams that want to

00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:54,480
open source their code and we are trying

00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,520
to manage all that the expectation of

00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,680
different

00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,040
teams while trying to establish an inner

00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:02,800
source program

00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:06,240
how did that journey goal for

00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:09,760
for your company uh did you

00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,680
push or did you not get involved with

00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,160
any of contribution

00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,760
or you tried to manage like a case by

00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,079
case

00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,000
or you establish the minimum like a

00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,760
framework in order to contribute

00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,359
while establishing their search program

00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,880
first

00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:29,440
so um i don't say we ignored but

00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,280
i would say i ignore any people that try

00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,119
to make contributions

00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,880
uh we still have people that make

00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:36,000
contributions that are not part of inner

00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,760
source

00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,040
that wasn't that was not our goal at the

00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,160
time

00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:44,640
our goal was to find

00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,760
projects that are highly uh

00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,599
collaborative

00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,800
for example the angular example that i

00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:50,000
gave you or another great one is

00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,359
security

00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,960
um so what we did was we tried to make

00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:57,440
we tried to download open source

00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,520
projects or create projects ourselves

00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,720
that would make life easier for

00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,400
developers so

00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,839
the best example i would say like our

00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,880
first big successful project was

00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:07,280
security

00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,920
no one likes to do security uh as a

00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,920
developer

00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,119
uh or i say very few they want to just

00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,119
make it work

00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,319
uh because it's usually hard and very

00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:15,839
very cumbersome and

00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:18,079
and people don't even know where to

00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,520
start so the first pro the first

00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:21,920
successful project and

00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:24,240
and richard who joined our team um this

00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:27,440
was his project was we created a

00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,640
java um security uh single scion uh

00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,560
module

00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,319
another person created one for node

00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,839
richard onto my team like hey

00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:35,599
we're not even using python but just

00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:37,520
create a python one because it sounds

00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:40,800
like people are excited about that

00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:42,640
so we created a lot of security um how

00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,920
to's and and people collaborated on

00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,640
those ones

00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,680
uh we ignored all the other ones that

00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,040
are you know people are making

00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,560
contributions outside

00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,560
i wouldn't focus on that because our

00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,760
mission was how do we get people to

00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,720
reuse things

00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,240
internally as you mature we're going to

00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,520
be eventually tackling those other ones

00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,200
but we didn't want to get we don't want

00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,319
to try to solve all the problems at once

00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,240
we focus just on

00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:08,160
let's build something that's reusable

00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:10,400
across the bank

00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,400
two

00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,520
other questions for anthony

00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:25,680
i have a question um so

00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,960
we've been looking at um trying to do

00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:30,000
inner source and encourage people to do

00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:31,920
it but some of the concern is um

00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,400
like administrative like time management

00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,079
and and uh making it an initiative for

00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,920
um like the managers and directors to

00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:40,240
allow their team to work on stuff that's

00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:43,359
collaborative it's not necessarily

00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:44,480
direct to their project um

00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:46,160
even though you know working on the

00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,440
security eventually helps their project

00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,640
if they're using that

00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,079
but sometimes that's like their free

00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,040
time that they want to work on is there

00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:52,960
any way that you've addressed

00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:55,280
uh this kind of administrative side of

00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:58,319
encouraging people to do it

00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:01,839
yeah that's uh so i alluded to the uh

00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:04,800
the times there i like music

00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:05,359
so i wrote an article just on that topic

00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,400
alone

00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:09,440
and um because i got i got tired of

00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,640
always answering

00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:14,640
that same questions i don't got time

00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,240
uh the way the first thing i did to

00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:20,319
address it

00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:23,440
excuse me was uh i wrote i got it

00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:24,960
sorry i just wanted to take some water

00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,960
uh the first thing i did was i wrote an

00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,880
article about it and addressing it and i

00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:31,280
said there's

00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,200
in the long run you're gonna save time

00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,760
and a hundred percent i agree that the

00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,079
first

00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,200
contributions are going to waste your

00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,520
time

00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,280
i'm not gonna argue that um and any

00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:44,079
other subsequent commits

00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,480
they are for sure going to uh take time

00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:49,760
you're not gonna reap the benefits

00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:52,800
but six months from now when

00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:54,319
there's an uh an enhancement that

00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,520
someone else needs and they upgrade your

00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:58,240
library to the newest

00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,640
olaf version you're not gonna have to do

00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,160
that

00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,000
because someone else will need that and

00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:05,440
i gave an example and

00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,520
uh the example was uh uh minor

00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,359
if you look at minor id connect it's a

00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:12,400
oauth library

00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:14,720
uh one person who built it had an

00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,400
upgrade there was an upgrade and uh the

00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,200
second person wanted to use it his name

00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,440
was hussein

00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,880
i got him to speak in front of a large

00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,400
audience and i said listen who's saying

00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,800
tell them the story

00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,920
so hussein basically downloaded this

00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,119
olaf product

00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:32,079
he used it uh there was an upgrade uh

00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,880
it broke his application he fixed it

00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:35,520
everyone else

00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:37,359
uh got the update and they eventually

00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:40,319
avoided an outage

00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:42,800
so in the beginning i had to tell that

00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:44,720
story that was my main story that i told

00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,480
every of every every week i told that

00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,560
story these three times

00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,599
um and after telling that story over and

00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,960
over again

00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:53,280
i didn't have to tell us i haven't told

00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,560
that story probably in the in a year and

00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,760
a half

00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,640
so you got to find a story that is like

00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,280
that

00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,240
and and get those people to speak up and

00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,839
i actually had the

00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,680
i can bring it up i had to commit that

00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:06,960
like hussein did

00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,040
and i said this is the commit that he

00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:12,560
did that saved um

00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,560
that saved everyone else time

00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,480
and you just find that good story and

00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,920
repeat that story as many times as you

00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,640
can

00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,640
awesome thank you

00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,559
it looks like we've got a question from

00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,680
richard richard you want to ask

00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:29,839
yourself any secrets

00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,119
source method tips in identifying

00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:33,119
potential advocates

00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:35,760
influencers of open source within an

00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,760
organization

00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:42,400
um

00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,400
so i would say

00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,640
for us because we didn't have metrics in

00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,760
the early days

00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,000
i would say slack was the secret sauce

00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,040
and

00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:56,079
and for us um because

00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:59,280
you can see who's talking on on slack

00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:00,000
you can see and talk to people and um i

00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,359
was

00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,440
because i was very familiar with

00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:06,079
slacking before joining this group

00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,520
i was very comfortable with it so um

00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:08,880
that to me in the beginning when you're

00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,040
first starting out

00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,720
uh you don't have everything at your

00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,359
disposal slack was

00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,839
for me the secret sauce and if you guys

00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,920
google

00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:20,000
i did this talk the talk i just did for

00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,440
you about a year ago yeah i did it in

00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,280
conjunction with slack

00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:26,079
because slack was such an important part

00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:29,680
of this project of this journey for us

00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:30,400
um now that we have slack uh so now that

00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,119
we have our

00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,319
our github is is vibrant and working

00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:36,640
really really well

00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:37,920
i would say now it's i just go on github

00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,160
look at the metrics that

00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,280
that might that the team that produces

00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,040
and i can see everyone who's

00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,880
contributing like like instantly

00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,839
but before i did before we even have

00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,839
that the secret sauce was

00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:49,839
slack

00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,200
and then i see another question from

00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,640
alex

00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,280
great presentation thank you for sharing

00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:01,359
your experience thank you given your

00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,960
reliance on open source would love to

00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:03,359
hear a bit about your thoughts related

00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,200
to

00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:07,119
development and management of your

00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,119
software building materials

00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:11,119
where is your focus today if you can

00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:12,960
share and where do you plan on expanding

00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:16,880
the process going forward

00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:19,440
so um the last uh item that i shared

00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:21,760
on the tools we used was uh nexus and

00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:26,000
sonotype so the sony type suite of tools

00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:27,839
that's been our focus um in 2020

00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,920
and i can see us we're going to be

00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:31,280
doubling down so we have one person

00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:34,079
working on that richard

00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,880
gomez on our team he's been focusing on

00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:37,119
that

00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,720
um a bit of you know supplementary side

00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:41,040
other folks have been helping out

00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,800
but in 2021 we're going to be doubling

00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,599
down like and get getting some more help

00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,079
on that like

00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:47,040
that i i can see that managing our

00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,520
building materials

00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,079
is going to be crucial for us now that

00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,720
we have

00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:54,720
our college culture like established and

00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:57,440
obviously we got to keep supporting and

00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:58,319
we cannot um shy a way of supporting the

00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,319
community

00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:01,599
uh but now that our team has grown we're

00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:05,119
gonna put more effort on

00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:06,800
on on nexus uh and or you may use our

00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:08,880
factory or whatever tool you use

00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,000
but that's where our focus is gonna be

00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,359
um

00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,720
we're partnering with our legal

00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:13,440
department and our in our cyber

00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,599
department

00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,520
so they are our stakeholders in building

00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:20,640
this this uh this capability

00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:23,760
across the organization as well

00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,880
and i can probably come back in in a few

00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,960
months and talk about how

00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,960
to

00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:34,240
great thank you i think that our own

00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:36,400
james mccloud has a question

00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,280
hi anthony um it's a pleasure to meet

00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,319
you um

00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:42,640
yeah so i had a question about how inner

00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:46,000
source within rbc actually works

00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:48,319
so are you a centralized team

00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,920
you know who looks after and maintains

00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:51,760
all of the inner source projects on

00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:54,880
behalf of rbc

00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,960
um or do you allow developers to have

00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:59,440
their own github profile and then

00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:01,119
you know form the repositories um take

00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,119
them into their projects

00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:06,160
and then contribute any fixes they may

00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:08,160
find into the upstream repository

00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:10,000
so really it's about you know do do

00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,040
engineers have control over those

00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,200
projects

00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,480
or if they need anything fixed do they

00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:17,520
then raise an issue

00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:19,839
you know back to the source team so

00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,800
in the beginning uh no one was

00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:24,240
collaborating

00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:26,160
um our i would say our um

00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:28,319
our visionaries are our our tech

00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:30,640
enthusiasts uh i also give a shout out

00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:32,160
to like aaron clark matthew clark

00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,920
uh though like those types of people at

00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:37,040
rbc those folks

00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,720
uh did not work for me directly um they

00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,920
were uh just developers and they had

00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:43,200
full control

00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:43,760
um our team with richard and myself we

00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,119
would put

00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,960
stuff into inner source and we'd have

00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:48,160
control of those ones but inner source

00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,359
was completely

00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:53,200
um uh distributed everyone

00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:56,000
manages their own repositories 100

00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:58,880
percent um

00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,359
we i would say now that it's grown we've

00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,040
managed

00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,240
less and less projects we have our own

00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,680
projects that we've always maintained

00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,440
but we are a small team

00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,960
and i kind of like it that way that by

00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,720
design we're very small

00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,240
because if someone comes to me and says

00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,640
hey anthony can you fix this project or

00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,880
this

00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:15,119
issue i'm like we're small we can't fix

00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,480
every project there's over 300 projects

00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:18,400
so it's kind of good that we're small

00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:20,480
because we can use that excuse

00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,000
uh what we do do is we do it now give

00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:25,040
more consulting services

00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,720
and for the very very mature projects

00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,800
uh we don't we actually don't want them

00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,240
to fork the projects we actually want

00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,720
them to

00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:34,160
create a you know a build materials we

00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:36,240
want them to create an artifact

00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,200
stored in nexus and have them download

00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,280
it through

00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:41,119
uh through the artifact management

00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,960
framework that we built out

00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:46,079
so that we do more of that consulting

00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:49,040
now than anything

00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:50,160
awesome thank you great thanks for the

00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,160
question

00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,280
thank you so much anthony um i think

00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,800
your experience

00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,720
um and all the work you've done on this

00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,319
is going to be immensely helpful to the

00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:00,079
others in our community who are getting

00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:01,839
started on their inner source program

00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:03,200
so it's really really helpful to have

00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:05,440
you share today

00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,559
um and yes we would love to have you

00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:09,599
back to talk about

00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:10,960
search and discoverability um uh once

00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:13,040
you're a little further down that road

00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:16,720
so thank you for

00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:18,960
