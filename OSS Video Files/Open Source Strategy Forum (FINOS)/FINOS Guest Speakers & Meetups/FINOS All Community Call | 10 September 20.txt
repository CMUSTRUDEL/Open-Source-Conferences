	FINOS All Community Call | 10 September 20

Wrap-up post & slides: https://www.finos.org/blog/finos-all-community-call-september-2020

During our Q3 “All Community Call” the FINOS team and community provided updates on the continued momentum and great progress across our projects. We've included some highlights below but be sure to check out the video replay to get all of the updates.

FINOS now has 21 active projects, including Waltz (contributed by Deutsche Bank), which became active last quarter. Our number of incubating projects has grown to 20 with the recent contributions of Data Hub from Citi, Morphir from Morgan Stanley and Glue from EPAM.

With our move to the Linux Foundation, FINOS has also introduced Special Interest Groups (SIGs). During its last meeting, the Board approved the creation of a Diversity and Inclusion SIG, which we agree is critical for our industry, community and foundation.

We're also looking at turning two other FINOS initiatives, namely DevOps Mutualization and Open Source FinReg into SIGs and will present these to the Board in October. 

We've now run 14 virtual meetups since we started in April. Couple this with the talks from our experienced and seasoned guest presenters in open source readiness meetings and you get a fantastic library of videos and podcasts.

Our Q3 focus projects are making great progress:

-DevOps Mutualization has identified topics of common interest and is holding its next session on "how banks are orchestrating DevOps and the 'glue' to create workflows".

-Alloy is on target to be open sourced within the next few weeks and has nearly completed the FX Options pilot.

-Morphir has been successfully contributed to FINOS and is looking for new contributors.

-DataHub and DataHelix are working together to building even more powerful solutions to generating synthetic data.

-Security Reference Data is moving ahead with development of a Security & Issuer ID mapping tool.

Consider how you can contribute to one of these or any other of our FINOS projects.

We're always looking for ways to make it easy for individuals to get involved with FINOS projects and for those already active to lead. Over the last few months we've made major changes to simplify our governance. Here are some resources and links you may want to keep handy.

FINOS Community GitHub repo holding all governance docs
Software Project and Standards Project default templates
Lifecycle stages including the addition of Formation
Special Interest Group overview and approved SIGs

If you are project maintainer or contributor, the FINOS team is continuously working to provide automation that can minimize overhead. Check out our Open Developer Platform  or check this cheatsheet for the 5 most useful features of ODP.

you an overview not only of the

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:37,200
projects that are going on in finals

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,320
right now especially

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,160
following the pattern that we

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,680
started in the last couple this is our

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,760
third community call

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,000
um we have consistently heard

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,440
positive feedback on having our focus

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,239
projects present

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,960
and so today you get it you know the

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,079
bulk of

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,920
today's call is going to be as usual on

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,120
you know the actual activity that is

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,760
going on in

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,799
in phoenix and you hit it directly from

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,799
our project leads

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,600
before we do that i just want to give

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,439
you a quick

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:18,479
update and try to keep it below

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,960
10 minutes i'm gonna just turn off my

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,000
notifications here sorry about that

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,840
um because i know

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,520
that there's a lot going on we certainly

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,400
feel it uh

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,759
as as the team and i want to make sure

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,159
that you have

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,079
the opportunity to jump in also some of

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,119
the initiatives that are maybe not yet

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,640
fully open source or in the formation

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,320
stage so this

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,159
moving forward will be a really

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,360
hopefully useful venue for you

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,320
to find ways to get engaged so we start

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,280
ourselves with the state of the

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,200
community

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,880
i'll give it to our director of

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,719
community james to run the

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,719
focus projects update section and then

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,159
you know we'll keep a few minutes at the

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,200
end to hey

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,799
show you um the new and simplified

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,240
governance that we put together

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,840
following this

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,560
programs as well as uh um

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,760
you know what support we provide

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,200
maintainers

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,200
i'm assuming there's many project

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,440
maintainers here

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,720
to enforce the governance you know our

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,959
goal is not

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,760
to create burden but to foster

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,520
innovation

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,959
in the community and so we want to make

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,840
sure that

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,400
you know we provide you tools to do so

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,040
um

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,599
and if we're good we should be able to

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,440
live some time for questions at the end

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,160
of course feel free to drop your

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,760
questions in the chat at any time

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,760
and we'll try to address them at the end

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,400
this deck will be shared so no need to

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,680
take too many screenshots but we put

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,480
together also

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,680
a couple of tips and call to actions for

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,519
you to get engaged

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,319
it is really a unique moment in our

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,640
history

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,360
as i hope you you'll see over the next

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,560
couple of slides

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:12,080
so getting started uh and again

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:16,239
hi everyone i'm so glad to see uh

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:19,200
you know such a full house um

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,519
we started the standard slides uh

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,280
actually we revamped it a little bit

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:28,400
uh we have uh uh

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:32,319
reached uh we have passed 40

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,360
41 now between incubating and active

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,239
projects

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,760
over the last quarter we have had the

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,159
two new active

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,040
two new incubating projects one project

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,280
became

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,840
became active uh we'll show you the

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,840
details in the next

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,840
slide

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,159
we are seeing actually also from a

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,280
membership standpoint

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,680
uh a strong momentum um

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,519
of course i think like pretty much any

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,000
business out there

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,200
you know the pandemic has impacted some

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,720
of the

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,720
you know competitions that we're having

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,360
with new uh members

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,400
or prospects of the foundation but we

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,519
expect

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,079
um you know we have a very strong

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,040
pipeline and we think by the end of the

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,079
year you'll see

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,079
some good interesting new logos here

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:30,880
before we jump into um

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:34,080
you know the the projects and the

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:37,919
initiatives i just wanted to

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:41,600
spend a second to acknowledge um

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:44,880
you know an important conversation that

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,639
a we've had at board level um

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,520
in the july board meeting which was the

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,240
first as the linux foundation

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,280
uh uh governing board under the linux

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,479
foundation

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,680
um but of course i'm sure has

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:03,120
you know uh touched many of you

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:06,720
um we recognize

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,400
that as much in financial services much

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,080
in open source communities

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,759
diversity and inclusion has been a

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,479
you know it's it's very much an open

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,520
issue and it's not

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:23,199
uh in any way something that we can just

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,960
nice to have so we've had a really deep

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,759
conversation with the board

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,479
um you know the whole final stem and the

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,039
board

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,160
uh it was very refreshing in terms of we

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,160
think we are

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,560
all on the same page in the need so we

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,280
immediately need to do something here

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,800
and so you know there's a couple of

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,720
things that i wanted to share with you

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,400
first and foremost again as you

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,199
participate to

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,199
our activities please take a second to

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,960
review our code of conduct

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:56,000
um it does ensure

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,479
it does uh you know

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,160
draw the guidelines to make sure that we

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,319
have a truly inclusive community

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,840
again open source doesn't mean

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,680
unfortunately in and of its own

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,600
um you know that everyone

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,800
has the same opportunities and so we got

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,759
to make sure that we

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,360
that we keep an eye on that and we you

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,080
know actively

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,000
create these opportunities um and as

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,400
usual remember that finn on the fingers

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,800
team

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,160
is responsible for enforcing the code of

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,720
contact so if you see

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,759
anything or if you experience anything

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,360
you can always reach

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:35,520
out to us confidentially um

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:38,479
the second point is you know in order to

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,960
impact change here there has to be a

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,919
giant

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,800
approach you know top down from our

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,039
board

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,639
but certainly there's only so much that

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,120
we can do as a board

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,720
um it needs to come from the community

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,639
as well and so

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,080
with the board we have approved our

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,240
first special interest group

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,120
on diversity and inclusion which is

00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,520
starting

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,120
uh leading up to action right now to

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,759
really help us define

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,720
strategic things that we can do beyond

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,919
the statement

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,639
beyond uh you know

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,599
putting putting something out there and

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,919
so

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,880
everyone is welcome to join please let

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,639
me alexander know if you'd like to join

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,639
you can expect concrete proposals and

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,479
strategies put in place

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,720
already by the end of this year and in

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,520
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,599
as far as the community goes again i

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:37,039
know this is an important topic for my

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:39,440
community and i would hope for everyone

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,440
of course we'll discuss with the same

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,160
more general strategies that we can

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,240
apply but

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,800
we are very much keen to hear your

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,319
thoughts um with the linux foundation we

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,919
have access to

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,479
you know very powerful mentorship

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:56,000
platform called community bridge

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:58,479
venueview uh was to put put themself

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,199
forward as a mentor

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,160
we could uh definitely create

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,759
opportunities

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,280
for minority of the represented

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,199
minorities so

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,400
i just wanted to make sure that this has

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,080
been

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,520
do you know that this has been top of

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:16,800
mind for us and we will continue

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:20,080
we i i expect you to

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,800
so sorry i expect you'll see concrete

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,800
in the next months

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,440
moving on again i wanted to keep it

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,879
under 10 minutes here

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:33,120
um there's been so much going on um i am

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:36,000
not going to be able to cover every

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,919
single item here in detail

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,919
but we're certainly seeing a strong

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,880
momentum in contributions of new

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,640
projects

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,880
um especially from financial

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,640
institutions which

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:51,519
you know it's been a long way

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,959
you know it's been a long road uh to get

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:57,200
there but i think we are

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:59,680
in uh uh you know in the right spot

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,640
data hub was contributed by city earlier

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,519
in the year

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,920
uh uh warfare is one of the latest

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,519
contributions it's a very exciting one

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,080
uh which we are actually announcing

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,839
tomorrow uh together with the

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,200
contribution from epham

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:17,839
um glue um we're actually announcing

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,440
by a press release and finally not only

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,519
we have new projects coming in the

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,640
projects maturing through the life cycle

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,440
so walls

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,120
who you know recently just recently

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,680
joined the foundation about six months

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,920
ago

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,519
has already reached active stage with

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,959
multiple

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:38,160
users and contributors to the project so

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,839
i'm very excited to see uh so much

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,680
activity and we're seeing

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,080
you know as you've seen the next slide

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,320
so much more in the pipeline

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,519
um a couple of words on the merger with

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,760
the linux condition

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,600
we actually have completed the merger

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,880
and we are officially part of the linux

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:58,240
foundation as of july 1st

00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:01,279
the transition has been i hope smooth

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,480
for you folks um it's definitely not

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,760
completed

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,760
um in terms of all the systems

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,040
but what we learned is that our

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,839
infrastructure and the left

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,160
infrastructure

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,040
very complementary and so we expect over

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,920
the next

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,160
six months or so to be able to complete

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:24,560
that

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:28,079
we launched ossf on 12-13 of november

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,519
this will be the first virtual ossf

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,279
and it's co-produced with the linux

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,240
foundation so it's very

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,279
exciting we have um some really great

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,360
speakers

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,880
uh make sure that you register today

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,160
there's no travel involved

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,760
uh i wish i could i could uh uh you know

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,600
shake all of your hands

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,200
uh but maybe it's gonna be for a for the

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,320
next edition

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:53,680
um again overall

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,519
the we are seeing capabilities uh

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,720
and you should consider capabilities

00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,160
like training

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,560
uh mentorship event management

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,920
meetup these are all capabilities that

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,000
we get

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,440
in a way for free as part of the linux

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,680
condition

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,399
membership so you know hopefully that

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,760
gets your traded juices going

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:19,200
um we have ramped up as you know our

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:21,360
virtual uh um engagement we now have

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:25,440
quarterly community calls we have

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:28,160
almost uh weekly meetups not bi-weekly

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,600
we also launched the podcast and would

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,240
love to

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,440
get your reading that's an easy way for

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,040
you to help

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:41,600
us grow the footprint of our

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:43,839
publications so we think

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,760
you know we set up several virtual

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,279
channels for the community interact we'd

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,440
love to hear from you if you have

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,120
additional ideas on how we you know can

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,320
complete this transition to

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,320
pretty much the new normal

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,800
and then you know we have so many other

00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,440
activities going on that i'm not gonna

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,839
go

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:06,639
into the detail of um i only wanna pick

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,320
um you know a couple of them um because

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,880
we'll hear about devops

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,000
uh in our focus projects but i want to

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,160
just speak on the first two of them

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,120
we have launched our first version of

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,279
the

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,639
finance landscape if you're familiar

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,360
with other projects in the linux

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,560
foundation

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:28,560
and you go to landscape.pinos.org

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:31,279
you'll see all the venus projects in a

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,279
landscape view

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,600
a technical if you want architectural

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,600
breakdown of where they sit

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:44,240
this is not the collaborative uh effort

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,000
it's all hosted on github if you think

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,120
your project should be listed there and

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,279
it's not

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,399
all it takes is a pull request if you

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,760
think we should be

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:56,880
expanding this to you know other

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:59,920
open efforts in the industry uh

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,160
we'd love your contributions back again

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,480
this gives us a whole lot of visibility

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,200
in the broader

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,440
linux foundation ecosystem as well it

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,480
starts to really plot

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,399
you know where the business can use

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,240
some of our projects which i think it's

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,279
really important in a community like

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,760
us where we sort of live leaving the

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,000
middle

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,880
and at the crossroads of sort of

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,079
technical and

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:28,800
business engagement

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,600
um so we'd love we'd love to hear uh

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,079
from you

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,600
and how we can improve and extend this

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,880
this is meant to become

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:40,240
you know the uh main entry point

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:42,399
for discovering our projects

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,079
um and then on a second sort of key

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,040
initiative that we've launched this

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,480
quarter

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,079
uh we have finally you know we've been

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,920
talking about

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:57,279
exploring how open source can

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,320
uh improve regulation i mean in the

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,079
spirit of

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,000
you know we collaborate on common

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:05,920
requirements we collaborate on items

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,560
that are non-competitive and

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,920
you know typically allow for cost

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,720
neutralization

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,079
well we've had some really strong

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,639
initial interest from

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:20,399
members and actually regulators

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,639
and so we are starting a special

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,600
interest group you'll hear much more

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,839
about it

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,040
we're doing a lot of campaigns we're

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,680
looking at

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,720
partnering with other organizations in

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,839
the meanwhile

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,240
if you'd like to learn more you can sign

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,440
up

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,360
in our open source impact page

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,880
or you can even join the conversation as

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,360
we're looking to form

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,680
a special interest group that is focused

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,839
on open source financial regulation

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,360
so just wanted to call these two out

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,160
because they are showing a lot of

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,279
potential

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:56,240
and if you have or are exposed

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,639
to you know regulatory implementations

00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,639
that

00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,160
might benefit from open source or open

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,160
standards please let us know

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:09,920
um again so much to cover

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,240
uh i'm not gonna be able to uh but

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,199
you can see that we have several

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,600
projects and

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,440
memberships and sort of this idea of

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,360
collaborating with other consortia

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,639
becoming the open source enabler for

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,600
other consortia

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,079
so we're really exploring so many ways

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,480
to

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:28,880
allow you you know to have opportunities

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:33,120
to collaborate and deliver value through

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:36,320
our projects not only

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,320
partnerships and new projects

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,079
but we're also looking at again the

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,759
infrastructure that is provided from the

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,680
linux foundation

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,839
we have a mentorship platform we have a

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:49,199
training platform these are all

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,160
areas that if not this year we can

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,199
certainly elaborate

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,160
next year to build you know even more

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,320
value and even

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,240
more potential support and acceleration

00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,680
for our projects

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:05,839
um we have so many projects

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,360
in the information stage um

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,880
we're likely gonna talk about them in

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,560
the next call once they are in the

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:14,240
foundation

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:16,959
and without before i

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,199
pass it to james i just wanted to call

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,199
out

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:26,800
you know folks there's so much going on

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:29,920
so much meat on the fire

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:32,959
and this is truly been

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:35,440
an unprecedented year for us and for

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:38,639
everyone of course but

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:41,199
we're now seeing again the banks

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,959
leaving the charge and being uh at the

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,360
forefront of our practice and so i think

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,720
that

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,959
is an important uh um

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,120
you know element for everyone and

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,120
hopefully encourages you to

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,399
get actively engaged in the foundation

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,680
if you're not

00:16:54,399 --> 00:17:00,959
um here there's a couple of you know

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:04,079
ideas that we discussed with the board

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:07,199
would be very functional all right

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:12,640
okay sydney do you mind

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,640
knitting whoever i'm hearing on the line

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:20,240
um this is gonna say these are

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:22,640
some areas where you know we identified

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,000
concrete actions the community can take

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,559
to help

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,919
uh venus achieve the goals that were set

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,120
for us this year

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:33,919
um you know and

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,799
we will circulate this that but i think

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,000
if you can

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,360
you know work on evangelism and

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,360
promoting your project

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,480
or generally open source in the industry

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:47,039
if you're not

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:50,160
a project maintainer right now um

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:52,320
you can refer projects to us or refer

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,360
people to join our community list that's

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:59,520
really about sending an email i'm

00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:01,440
very much happy to offer swag

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,679
we have pretty cool new swag where is

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,520
coming up with linux foundation plus

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,960
finos branding in there so

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,280
if you can prove you've sent three

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,440
people to our community list i'd be

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:15,200
happy to send swag

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:18,559
um an actually pretty cool one um

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,720
we have you know maintain open open

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,679
issues and tag them with good first

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,200
issue

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,120
and i don't know if you know but we have

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,840
an aggregator we aggregate

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,120
aggregate all pinots repositories and

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,120
good first dishes

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,120
and we try to funnel our new

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,640
contributors there so

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:39,200
by just tagging your issues with good

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:42,400
first issue and appropriate

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,480
you actually empower your project to

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,240
you know be seen in multiple places and

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,840
hopefully that creates a ram

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:52,320
on-ramp for your contributors and then

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,320
finally

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,280
you learn we'll talk more about it today

00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,559
but we are moving

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,400
most of our uh noon project specific

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,240
collaboration to our community

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,840
repository so make sure that you start

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,520
it and make sure that

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,799
you follow the issues that are going on

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,400
in there you'll see the many of the

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,760
activities we talk about today

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,200
are actually being discussed in github

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,919
issues transparently

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,919
in the community

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:25,039
and with that a little bit of a

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,679
typo here should have been q3 apologist

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,480
for that

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,280
but james you want to take it away yeah

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,760
absolutely

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,039
um welcome everybody um and i was just

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,440
going to say gab yeah we are

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,480
on q3 this year seems to be accelerating

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,400
through um

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,600
this is our third iteration of focus

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,720
projects

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,960
uh so q3

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,799
nice one thank you and so if you could

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,120
um just go on to the next slide that'd

00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,440
be

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,120
that'd be great so we have a slightly

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,000
different running order to this actual

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,480
slide

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,160
but this slide actually shows you um or

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,559
shows the community on the call

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,480
who our focus projects are and what

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,120
stage within the finnos life cycle they

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,240
are

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:07,280
so within formation for q3 we have alloy

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,400
and morphe and within incubating we have

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,360
data hub

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,200
data helix devops mutualization and

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,159
security reference data

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,679
um but because of um the way the um

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,559
because of time pressures and people

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,400
schedules

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,400
we're actually going to go straight in

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,880
with devops mutualization

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,960
by dave katz and then we'll go over to

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,360
rob underwood at finos

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,080
um for alloy and then i'll introduce

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,720
some the

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,480
the other famous projects thereafter so

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,120
if you can go on to the next slide we'll

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,559
go over

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,720
to dave james

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,280
uh can you hear me okay you're you're

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:47,600
coming through loud and clear dave

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:50,000
excellent okay yeah so uh about

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,039
three months ago we started discussing

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,200
kind of the

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,799
common problems we had with uh

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,840
delivering software at large

00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,200
uh regulated institutions and then at

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,240
some point through that process the

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,400
devops neutralization effort was born

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,000
and you know we've had a really good

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,039
conversation in the last two sessions

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,480
that we had

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,240
and agreed that we should be setting up

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,760
a special interest group and i think

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,880
you'll see links here to the

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,360
decisions that were made to do that and

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,000
at the same time try to figure out what

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,919
kinds of problems we are trying to solve

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,760
uh by ourselves that we could be doing

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,200
together uh you know that aren't really

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,400
a source of competitive advantage and

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,200
among them are

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,960
trying to you know continuously collect

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,480
evidence that regulators want to see

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,440
that we are demonstrating good software

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,640
practices so

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,039
anything in the software development

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,960
life cycle uh evidence of testing

00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,679
evidence of two or four eyes review of

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,480
things

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,760
uh and and so we're gonna looking

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,080
forward to a point where we can start to

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,400
share

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,840
some of those between ourselves and and

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,400
and just see all the approaches and how

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,480
we've

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,400
you know many of us have implemented our

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,760
own technology solutions to address

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,280
parts of those problems

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,200
uh you know we had we had a nice

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,280
representation at the last uh

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,320
the last two meetings second one uh you

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,159
know

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,360
morgan stanley city deutsche bank you

00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,559
can read it on the slide i don't need to

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,039
read it to you

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,080
and we had vendors on as well i do think

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,240
that we should

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,360
uh there's an opportunity to grow that

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,120
audience and

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,360
i'm looking forward to members of this

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,280
community nominating the right people to

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,280
join us on these calls because

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,640
really this is a great place for us to

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,400
enhance our productivity

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,960
and it's a very safe place for us to

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,080
collaborate on a very safe topic

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,159
so i think the next session we're going

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,000
to have is really uh you know one of the

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,159
things we kind of discussed was

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,520
what is the glue of you know that we

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,799
tend to need to put together all the

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,480
different tools that we use both

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,400
commercial and open source

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,320
um either glue them together to

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,159
orchestrate setting up a

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,600
well-controlled source control all the

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,799
way to deployment to production

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,559
or what is the extra name spacing that

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,480
we need to do to kind of keep a project

00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,039
life cycle or an asset life cycle in

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,280
place

00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,960
and then associate all of these uh

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,559
provisioning of various development

00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,360
tools and tool chains

00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,720
and just make sure that they're

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,640
associated with the project that has a

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,360
life cycle and roles and access control

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,400
and all that

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,240
so i kind of want to see if we can share

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,200
some of that because i know at least two

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,880
or three

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,240
uh you know financial institutions that

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,799
have something they've had to do on

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,559
their own

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,240
and it'll be really nice as we look at

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,280
graduating to the next generation of

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,039
their tool sets

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,120
to not have to do this on our own in

00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,640
parallel at multiple institutions

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,919
so that's a bit of an update if you're

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,440
interested there's plenty of links on

00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,440
this and on the overview slide that i

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:29,120
think was uh the previous slide that

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,960
james had and uh yeah there's my update

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,640
that's amazing dave thank you very much

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,559
and thank you for joining the call

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,000
um and with that i'd like to pass the

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:40,320
mic over to rob underwood

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,320
from finnos to talk us through alloy

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,000
great thank you uh can you move to the

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,520
next slide yep thanks

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,120
how are you so thank you to everybody

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,320
for being on the call today

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,559
um we'll just want to

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,640
echo what's been already shared tons of

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,880
good stuff happening right now

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,559
um so a few things i wanted to just

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,080
share about eloy i think

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:10,000
many people i'm probably aware but a lot

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:13,279
is a logical modeling tool and language

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,360
uh and uh workbench

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,840
uh that is being contributed by goldman

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,960
sachs um

00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:24,880
we've been running a pilot with

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:26,960
um uh about a half ton organizations

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,840
mostly finnos members for the better

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,120
half of

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:34,799
uh for most of this year um

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:38,400
and during that uh pilot we have been

00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,360
modeling uh fx options and commodity

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,279
reference data

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:47,200
um so specifically we have been

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:49,760
using um as a starting point the is the

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,760
cdm

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:57,840
uh extend um

00:24:53,679 --> 00:25:00,240
the fx option and um to propose

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,679
those changes back into the canonical

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,960
cdm

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:08,240
that's built in rosetta we

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,679
are we've also been working

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,360
there's a separate work stream that's

00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,440
been working on building commodity

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,880
reference data

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,480
and that is uh focus was focused first

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,480
and foremost on oil swaps so

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,799
that both those pilot work streams have

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,240
been are coming to an end now

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:28,080
and we are preparing to uh goldman in

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,880
particular is preparing to actually open

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:33,520
source the code in late september so

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,520
that's sort of the conclusion of the

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,200
or the fulfillment of the commitment

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,120
that goldman made on stage at our open

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,120
source strategy forum last november that

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:46,400
it would be open sourcing that code

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:46,400
so we're all really excited we have some

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,760
you'll be seeing more information about

00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:55,120
um office hours

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,000
the general meeting on october 15th and

00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,679
then we're going to have

00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,120
some developer focused recurring

00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,400
meetings that you'll see

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:05,360
some updates about um and then we have

00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,720
our uh you'll see some presentations

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,640
about a little coming up at

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,480
oh on october 29th and then also

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,320
the open source strategy forum itself on

00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,679
november 12th and 13th

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:20,400
um and then if you go to finnos.org

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,159
or below you can actually now go to not

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,880
only sign up for updates but actually to

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,120
request an

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,159
account on the shared instance so if

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:31,039
you'd like to get

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:34,080
a count on the employee platform

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:35,840
you can feel free to go there and you'll

00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,360
be able to get an account one of the

00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,200
things we'll be doing

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,400
over the course the next four to six

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,480
weeks is actually transitioning

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,120
which was just being used primarily by

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:50,720
the participants in the pilot

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,320
to a kind of a fully shared instance

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,279
that anyone in our community can request

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,799
an account

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:59,520
on and in turn use to both try out alloy

00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,960
and then also continue the shared

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,559
modeling activities that we've been

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,080
doing around fx options and commodity

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,799
reference data

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,080
if you any questions don't hesitate to

00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:11,520
reach out to

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:13,279
uh any of us um uh

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,559
you know i think you'll see a lot of uh

00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,840
good stuff i don't wanna take a ton of

00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,960
time on this i think we've talked about

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,520
a loyal a lot of

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,159
previous calls but uh you know really

00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,000
exciting

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,360
um i think the other thing that i would

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,039
just highlight is i think

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,399
another way to think about alloy is not

00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,159
only is something

00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,840
that's being contributed as open source

00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,880
and i know some of the banks have

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,840
already expressed

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,480
traffic launching their own instances of

00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,440
alloy

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,399
but also think of alloy as being a tool

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,080
that

00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:42,559
other finnos projects will be able to

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:46,799
use when they need to do their own

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,799
logical modeling and other types of

00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,640
activities

00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,360
that's a great point rob um that you

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,480
made here

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:57,279
i i think what we found was that alloy

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,159
and actually as aspinus hosting an

00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:01,760
instance

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:04,320
that is transparent and sort of neutral

00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,520
really help bridge some of the gaps and

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,399
bringing in

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,360
you know business folks directly into

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,679
the community

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,320
to solve problems regarding data

00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,840
modeling and interoperability

00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,840
you know in a common place which

00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,320
actually then flows back into

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,960
a gitlab repository so actually lends

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,039
itself to open source collaboration so i

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,320
i'm really excited to get to the point

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,320
of open sourcing and

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,320
you know shout out to the goldman team

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,960
and and also rob for all the amazing

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,960
work on this

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,679
i really would just

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,760
hours late hours that the golden

00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,520
engineering team has been putting into

00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,559
preparing has been really tremendous so

00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,840
thank you i know for

00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,159
the goldman team on the call but it's

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,799
been great and i also just did want to

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,480
call out

00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:59,600
um gitlab uh a fitness member who's

00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,399
been with us all along is built on top

00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,320
of git lab

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:03,919
um it uses git lab for the it's

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,159
underlying sdlc

00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,440
so thank you to the lab team for all of

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,240
their work on this

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,000
um and they'll do a special shout out as

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,600
well to yeah

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,279
they've been incredible partners through

00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,720
all this really really active

00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:20,720
really engaged um and also rignosis

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,600
which is the organization that maintains

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,360
the the canonical version of of the is

00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,000
the cdm and rosetta all those

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,360
organizations

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,360
have been phenomenal to work with and

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,120
super supportive of the entire effort

00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,960
as have all of the participants in the

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,600
pilot um which have been great it's been

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,880
a

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,320
i i the feedback i've heard and

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,640
what i've observed is that this this

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,159
six-month pilot of alloy fire

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,039
nursing has been a while six so thank

00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,039
you to everybody involved

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,559
thank you very much rob um i truly do

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,880
appreciate your update

00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,760
um and that takes us on nicely to more

00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,679
fair um

00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,360
with stephen from morgan stanley so

00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:03,120
stephen if you're on on the call

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:06,000
feel free to update us yeah hello hey

00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:08,240
thanks for uh having me here um yeah so

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,279
i'm happy to report that morpher has

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,760
been fully migrated over to finnoes

00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:15,039
um so amongst other things yes that

00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,720
means that it's now

00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:21,279
uh accessible through landscape and

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,880
uh you can find it there we also have

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,360
the links on the page

00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,720
uh just for a bit of review review

00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,840
morpher is

00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,360
uh a bit of complementary technology to

00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,480
what we just heard about in that it's

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,679
all about

00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,840
business logic modeling so more

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,440
provides a set of transparency and

00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,320
efficiency tools

00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,960
for users and developers uh so that they

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,880
can

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,720
separate the representation of their

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,720
business logic from

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,559
the implementation so that means that

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,039
we're we're separating the

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:55,039
what we're doing from how we're doing it

00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:58,480
and this has a range of uses

00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:59,279
a few uses that are of interest to this

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,840
group

00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:03,760
are things like sharing business logic

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,519
like regulatory rules or pricing

00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:08,399
calculations

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:10,880
these can be shared and then made to

00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:13,519
adapt onto existing systems which is

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,720
important for firms who

00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:19,279
you know doing a complete rewrite

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,240
to regulations is maybe not desirable

00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,320
it's it's

00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,559
more desirable to adapt the regulation

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,279
onto the existing systems

00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:29,600
we have things like application modeling

00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:31,360
which is defining a service in terms of

00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,519
pure business logic

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,240
and then automating the code that makes

00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:38,000
that business logic run on a particular

00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,679
platform of choice

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,440
so this is interesting in that it gives

00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,240
us an opportunity to automate

00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,120
enforcement

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,679
of various coding standards maybe

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,200
regulatory requirements

00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,840
things that we would normally ask our

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,720
developers to do we can then automate

00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:56,159
and ensure enforcement of those we have

00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,360
visualization tools

00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,080
which are tools to help users understand

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,000
the behavior

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,440
of an application so to give insight and

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,519
transparency

00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,519
into why an application is behaving the

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,120
way it is

00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,960
and so those are i think some of the

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,720
things that are particularly

00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:18,000
interesting to to our industry and to

00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:21,039
defend os members um

00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
we're particularly excited about the

00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,760
fact that

00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,120
you know we're joining an ecosystem and

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,760
that gives us an

00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:30,080
opportunity to look at the the

00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:33,679
collaboration between

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:36,480
projects like eloy the finreg initiative

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,919
uh many of the other projects infinious

00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,120
so that's an exciting

00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,960
prospect and then finally this is a

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,960
this is a major contribution for morgan

00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,760
stanley and i think it highlights

00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,240
a growing tent in in both morgan stanley

00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,360
and in

00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,840
and in the industry um

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,640
so yeah to wrap up i think now that

00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,440
we're

00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,559
we're completely you can find us on

00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,880
landscape

00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:03,519
or any of these direct links on the

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,519
presentation

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,799
thank you so much i just wanted to eco

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,279
how excited we are

00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:12,240
i think we're starting to see to your

00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:15,200
point

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,399
the projects sort of potentially

00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,440
building on each other

00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:22,720
to create you know uh um

00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,480
exponential value so i am really excited

00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,720
again for everyone we are announcing

00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,760
this contribution tomorrow

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:33,039
um so stay tuned that helped us help us

00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:35,360
uh spread the word uh and of course

00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,159
you know most importantly get engaged

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,200
this is

00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:41,360
this is a really cool project okay

00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,640
hey crab can i just add a thing i'm

00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,679
sorry i wanted to

00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,679
just highlight that um there is

00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,039
some some discussion already happening

00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,960
but there are some probably really

00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:53,120
interesting ways in which

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,320
morpher and alloy could be used in

00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,960
conjunction

00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,679
and i also wanted to highlight obviously

00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,120
more

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,799
being goldman sachs or fierce

00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,000
competitors in the marketplace

00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:07,200
but the way in which

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,280
both organizations sort of put forward

00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,960
morpher and alloy respectively and said

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,280
hey you know there may be some

00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,520
opportunities here maybe to work on

00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,280
um you know a shared intermediate

00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,599
representation or something like that

00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,720
it's it's a great example morpher

00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,679
andaloi

00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,359
of how different organizations are

00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,960
building off of the amount of

00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,560
each other and when we're now we're

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,480
finding projects that potentially could

00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,720
work together so i just really wanted to

00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,000
thank steven and dove and the rest of

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,200
the morgan stanley team it's just

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,599
the way that they sort of brought

00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,119
morpher to finnos and the way in which

00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,480
it sort of was done in conjunction with

00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,760
some of the stuff happening with the loy

00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,440
is just a great example of the

00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,040
collaboration that's happening

00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,800
within our community amongst

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,320
organizations that you know

00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,079
otherwise in the marketplace are

00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,200
competing together pretty soon

00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,679
competing against each other pretty

00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,679
seriously

00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,839
great point rob thank you

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,560
that's great thank you very much stephen

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,480
for your update um so gab if you can

00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,480
move on to the next slide

00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,880
and so this thumb brings me on to two

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,760
synthetic data projects that are both

00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,280
focused together um one being data hub

00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,359
and the other being data helix

00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,400
and i'd like to introduce you to andrew

00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,920
carr and

00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,920
the team who are going to take us

00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,440
through their update

00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,359
hello yeah so for those who don't know

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,920
me i'm andrew carr i work at scotlogic

00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,560
um

00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,160
so yeah i'm part of i guess i'm the

00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,040
technical lead for the data helix

00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,040
project

00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,680
and paul groves who i believe is also in

00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:36,000
the call from city is the tech lead for

00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:38,720
the data hub project

00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,680
and what we've done so i guess in the q3

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,320
update

00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,119
we have a virtual team who meet every

00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,880
monday

00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,800
and chat through i guess what we're

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,119
trying to do is unify

00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,320
uh the the vision for these projects to

00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,160
make sure because they

00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,640
they all kind of play in a similar space

00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,839
which is synthetic data generation

00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,680
and i think there's been a lot of

00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,480
interest in synthetic data generation

00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,960
certainly it's been a lot of

00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,359
conversations about it within thin offs

00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,280
in the last few months and it seems to

00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,160
be driven in part due to this move to

00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,599
the cloud

00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,920
so i think there's a lot more interest

00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,960
in how people can move to the cloud

00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,880
without

00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,079
using real data and i think synthetic

00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,240
data is one way

00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,440
to support that so i guess myself and

00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,440
paul and the team

00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,440
have been pulling in requirements from

00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,680
as many conversations as we

00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,680
can and we've got a bit of a flow

00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,880
diagram on the right which shows

00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:31,920
how we're producing our kind of

00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,800
uh our road map for the data hub and

00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,000
data helix

00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,839
but also synthetic data within finos

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,160
going forward and we're quite keen to

00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:41,920
chat to more of you about requirements

00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,920
and then given that we've had so many

00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,400
conversations really produce a

00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,280
a kind of road map of if if you know

00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,560
we're going to move forward with the

00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,200
data hub and the data helix

00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,240
how do we go forward on what's the best

00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,359
way to support

00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,920
all these requirements that are coming

00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:58,240
up and we're also quite keen to

00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,400
review the synergy with uh the other

00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,720
finos projects and i think particularly

00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,320
alloy and morpher because again they're

00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,760
in the data modeling space

00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,160
and it feels like there's a lot of

00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,800
synergy that could be had if we have

00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,320
common api points or common languages or

00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,680
ways we can communicate

00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,599
together and i guess

00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,880
paul if you're online is there anything

00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:23,839
you want to give an update

00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,839
specifically on the data hub itself

00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:30,160
hi andrew no i'm good so yes parrot

00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,160
cause i carry on really

00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,960
okay and uh also i guess joining that

00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,280
virtual team is also genesis

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,480
who have been uh bringing i guess the

00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,440
kind of neural network

00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,960
uh information and knowledge so if you

00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,760
guys are on do you guys want to give a

00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,200
quick

00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,200
shout out and update

00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,480
yeah we're really happy to be a part of

00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,920
this um

00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,880
traditionally synthetic data was

00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:57,760
generated in a parametric fashion

00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,720
however recent advancements in neural

00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,640
network design

00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,079
for example generative adversarial

00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,000
networks allow it to be

00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,760
built in a non-parametric way and uh

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,320
that's our kind of main contribution to

00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,320
this project

00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,480
so i guess that's yeah that's the update

00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,000
from us

00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,599
that's great angie thank you very much

00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,520
and i'd like to say thank you also to

00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,000
the ebs team who have put their their

00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,520
hand up

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,599
to to get involved they're kind of

00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,920
tracking the project and also that we've

00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,040
got

00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:27,040
um teams from within city who have also

00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:29,359
taken interest as well um and are

00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:33,280
tracking and thanks ben and harry from

00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:33,280
uh jensen of everything

00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,040
right there's a little bit of background

00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,200
noise so i don't know if um people are

00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,560
unmuted but if you put yourself back on

00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:47,599
you that would be brilliant

00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:51,280
um so moving on to our final update

00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:53,680
so this is um a great opportunity to

00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,960
introduce synthetic um sorry security

00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:58,000
reference data

00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:00,960
and celesh pandy from numuro

00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,040
i think um celeste got called away

00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,320
excuse me this is uh tasha from venice

00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:07,599
celeste got called away um uh on a

00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,520
meeting this morning and he was

00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:11,520
hoping to be joining right around now

00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,800
but i don't see him on a call so

00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,400
i'll go ahead and give the update for

00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,400
security reference data and if he he

00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,880
does join he can add anything in there

00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,240
um so i don't i this project has been

00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,920
around for a little while

00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:25,520
um and really it's the it was born from

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,359
the challenges within the industry about

00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:30,320
having many many different

00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,960
um identifiers largely for securities

00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,359
and then

00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,320
um and and also how that relates to

00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:36,320
issuer

00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,920
complicated problem lots of um lots of

00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,000
individual companies

00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,680
um you know banks financial institutions

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,160
in particular spend a lot of time

00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:46,160
doing mapping on their own so the idea

00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:48,079
was to look at how you can

00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,359
share that you know across the industry

00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:51,920
and um

00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:53,280
do that mapping once instead of

00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,560
repeatedly within individual

00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,400
organizations

00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:01,599
and so recently um in fact at a meeting

00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:05,359
in august they presented a new proposal

00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:07,040
to build a mapping tool um which really

00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:08,400
kind of enables the industry to come

00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,720
together and use

00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,480
an open mapping tool so that you don't

00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:15,760
again have to do that work individually

00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,720
um and it caters for covering lots of

00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,920
different types of

00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,440
identifiers for licenses where you know

00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,000
some information needs to be licensed

00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,119
and

00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,880
um and others is other data is open

00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:29,200
and so that that um that's been proposed

00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,000
uh

00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,200
there were quite a few new participants

00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,720
on the call which is great

00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,319
and the next steps are really to create

00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,280
the detailed project plan to find the

00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:39,680
workflow

00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,359
i'd make sure that use cases and user

00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,119
stories are covered so that

00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:44,560
what actually gets built does solve the

00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,319
industry challenge

00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:49,200
and so those are some of the specific

00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:50,400
actions or items coming up in the next

00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,280
coming week so

00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,480
we do definitely you know invite anyone

00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,240
who's interested in

00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,839
helping to solve this problem across the

00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:00,960
industry to to join

00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:02,720
um and you can email um that

00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,640
that email address which you know

00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:07,839
because it's meaningless

00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,640
to get involved or you know or uh or me

00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,960
or celeste

00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,680
um or itana directly as well if you have

00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,119
any questions

00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,960
and then the other the other thing i

00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:17,280
want to mention quickly is that

00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,880
um has been the security reference data

00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,480
project but given some of the work

00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,640
that's been happening in alloy given

00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:26,400
that reference data tends to be

00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:29,119
a big challenge kind of across the board

00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,200
the the group um has agreed that it

00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,839
makes sense to expand the scope so for

00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,680
example

00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:35,680
some work that was happening in alloy

00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,440
around currency reference data

00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,440
there's a kind of a natural home for it

00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,000
within reference data

00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,720
um to map out a currency object model

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,920
and then

00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:48,240
the specific actual data attributes for

00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,839
that model across all the currencies

00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:55,200
you know and maybe some of the um

00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:57,440
precious metals as well um so

00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,200
it's an active area please come get

00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,000
involved we'll be adding those work

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:04,319
streams

00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,160
um and i i guess i guess that's about it

00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:07,839
thank you very much tasha for um

00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,520
stepping in for celeste there that's

00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:11,119
very much appreciated and thank you

00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,160
everybody from our project teams for

00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,760
getting involved in

00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,079
your updates this afternoon and the

00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,480
tremendous effort it's going into

00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,480
all of the strengthening and building of

00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,160
your projects so thank you very much

00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,720
and so gab it's back to you after our

00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:27,359
focus project update thank you

00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,160
thank you folks sona eco james and

00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,800
thanks

00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,079
all the project leads were again putting

00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,200
so much effort

00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:38,319
um into not only their projects

00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:40,160
but really to as you

00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:41,440
as we've seen with alloy morphe that

00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,599
we're seeing with

00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,400
currency and commodity reference data

00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:48,319
merging into the reference data effort

00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,160
again it's not only the coding it's

00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:53,280
really the

00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,720
you know open approach that everyone in

00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,119
the community is taking and

00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,720
you know i know that it's been a really

00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:02,240
complicated year

00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:04,960
for many of us for probably everyone

00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,560
and so that you know i think has an

00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,400
additional

00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,000
you know it really was my heart so thank

00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,560
you so much folks we really

00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,079
really appreciate your contributions it

00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,079
wouldn't be possible without you

00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,520
on this note

00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:26,319
let's talk about governance now

00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:30,319
i just wanted to quickly

00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:33,359
walk you through what happened this year

00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:33,359
with their governance

00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:41,040
we earlier in the year realized

00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:43,920
that um we probably have gone

00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:45,599
a little bit overboard in terms of over

00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,480
governing and over engineering our

00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,880
community

00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,400
and so we wanted to make sure that we

00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:54,319
brought back the focus

00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:58,079
on allowing innovation to happen

00:43:54,319 --> 00:44:03,200
and have governance that is simplified

00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,200
flexible and really easy to understand

00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:09,520
with that we also took the occasion and

00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:12,079
the opportunity to harmonize as we move

00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,680
under the linux foundation while of

00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:16,880
course the goal had

00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,240
was always to keep our governance almost

00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,079
verbatim

00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,359
under this move there of course have

00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:24,000
been you know small

00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:25,839
changes and adaptations even just in

00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,880
verbiage

00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:31,040
or the name of our company that had to

00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,920
be modified during this process and then

00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:35,200
finally

00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,560
again our governance grew over five

00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,800
years and

00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,560
three iterations of females you know the

00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,640
symphony software foundation

00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,920
venus and then penis under the linux

00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:47,359
foundation

00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:50,960
and so you know we personally thought

00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:52,000
uh i knew that the fragmentation of our

00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,319
information

00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,920
was an additional complexity for

00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:58,640
newcomers in the community

00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,839
and so you'll see i'm not going to go

00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,560
through the process

00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:03,839
and sort of the paper trail that you see

00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:07,680
here

00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:10,800
but the end state is that now we

00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:14,079
have a consolidated simplified uh

00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:17,599
governance and i have you know five

00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:20,960
oops that's wrong wrongly folks

00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:23,280
apologies for that i have five things

00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,640
i'd like you to know there's of course

00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,200
more than that

00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,400
but i think these five items are really

00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,880
fundamental

00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,400
for whether you are a project maintainer

00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:35,520
or you are learning

00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:39,599
about venus i just

00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:42,480
want you to know these five things one

00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:44,319
all of our community governance and

00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,079
several of our corporate governance

00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:49,040
documents are now

00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:51,440
single sourced and stored in the phoenix

00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:54,560
community

00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,560
which is linked that it's

00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:03,040
i repeat github.communic start that

00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:06,160
repository because a lot of

00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:07,920
our uh uh new conversations early

00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,680
conversations as well as governance

00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,720
conversations are happening there so

00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,240
make sure that

00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,480
you know by starting the repository

00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:17,200
you'll get updates and you

00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,520
know can really proactively participate

00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,960
but

00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,280
if you go to that repository you'll find

00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,359
that

00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,119
all of our governance is in a single

00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:28,079
place starting from the corporate

00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:30,160
governance down to

00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,160
governance templates for standard

00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:35,680
projects software projects

00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,680
and special interest groups

00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,079
the goal here is not only to have a

00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:42,480
single source

00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:43,520
but also to allow anyone in the

00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,720
community really

00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:49,839
to not only help keep

00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:52,160
you know the governance in consistent

00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:54,160
you know if you find issues and fixes

00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:57,359
you can just raise it for requests

00:46:54,160 --> 00:47:00,880
but also proposing changes we wanted

00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:02,640
to go even more transparent in terms of

00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,319
again is there something that you want

00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:06,400
to change in the governance

00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:08,160
please raise it to request and then from

00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,680
there you know we can have a lively

00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:12,560
conversation and bring it to the right

00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,560
level of approval

00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:18,480
the second point was we introduced the

00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:21,200
concept of special interest groups

00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,680
it was a concept that didn't exist prior

00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,440
it's

00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:25,280
very common in open source communities

00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:28,240
and certainly the linux foundation

00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:30,079
and we've seen already very strong

00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:33,119
initial interests like the diversity

00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:35,040
inclusion special interest group the reg

00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,720
a special interest group that is forming

00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,880
potentially devops mutualization

00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:42,559
becoming a special interest group

00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:44,720
i wanna just qualify what those are

00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:46,160
you know over time especially as we're

00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,319
bringing together

00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,839
an industry that is relatively new to

00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:52,480
open source

00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:53,520
we realize that in some cases there is

00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,160
value

00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:59,280
in the conversation itself in bringing

00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:02,640
together peers from the industry

00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,200
even prior that a clear project or a

00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:06,400
clear

00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:08,480
standard is ready to be started

00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,000
uh one main example is certainly open

00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:13,200
source readiness where we

00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,800
you know major made major inroads in how

00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:18,559
firms can contribute

00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:21,119
uh the proof being this year we're

00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:22,079
coming from banks but it's not a

00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,000
software project

00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:25,920
it doesn't need the governance the

00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,640
heavyweight governance if you want or

00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,720
the

00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,160
uh infrastructure that a software

00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:32,960
project needs and so

00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:34,160
we now have this concept of special

00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,559
interest group

00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:38,160
that allows not only conversations to

00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:42,160
start to hopefully then

00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:44,400
become fully fledged projects but also

00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:46,960
it requires board approval and therefore

00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,079
it gives an opportunity for new ideas to

00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:51,040
be brought to the board

00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:52,160
and to gauge interest ahead of starting

00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:55,760
any new

00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:57,359
effort there and so on one hand we'd

00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,720
love to see more special interest group

00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,839
on the other hand we want to make sure

00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,160
that they're focused

00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:04,720
and actually deliver value to the whole

00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,720
foundation

00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,760
we had an individual membership concept

00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:12,079
in uh

00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:14,559
prior to april this is now referred to

00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:16,559
as the individual supporter program

00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:17,599
in our governance you can find all the

00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:19,280
details

00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:20,720
uh if you think you qualify you'd like

00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,839
to be considered

00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:25,760
um that is

00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:26,880
quasi membership if you want it

00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:30,160
definitely gives you

00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:31,680
most of the uh benefits of the

00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,440
membership if you're an individual

00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:36,720
contributor that is actually

00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:38,880
planning to contribute and advocate for

00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:41,359
finance in the next 12 months

00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:44,880
uh it does not give you an actual full

00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:44,880
member voting status

00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:53,680
as far as you know concern

00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:55,760
um and then i think this is

00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,960
one of the part that i'm most excited

00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:00,319
with

00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:03,040
we have simplified our governance

00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:04,720
to the point that it fits into a

00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:07,520
contributing rmd file

00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,240
and so you'll see in this new governance

00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,160
that we have

00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:12,079
a template that we provide for software

00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:14,640
projects and a template that we provide

00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:16,000
for standard projects and those can

00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:18,640
easily be

00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,240
simply added to your contributing rmd or

00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,160
your readme

00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:24,079
and just be always there front and

00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:27,839
center close to the code

00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:30,000
that they are and

00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:32,720
they ask the aspect that i think you

00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,760
might be interested in here is that

00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:38,800
we are allowing project teams

00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,200
to change their governance by a majority

00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,720
vote

00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:44,160
this is a major new item and a major

00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,640
element of flexibility

00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:48,240
we think each project needs that

00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,680
flexibility

00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,359
but of course we want to provide the

00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:53,200
sensible default that you don't need to

00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:55,280
change

00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,800
of course any changes to the governance

00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,599
will have to still comply

00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,280
with the overall venus policies like

00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:04,319
code of conduct

00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:07,680
antitrust conflict of interest

00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:10,400
and we'll be always there to help you

00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,440
validate if a governance proposal change

00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:15,920
proposed change

00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:17,599
is kosher and then finally

00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:20,079
you've heard us talking about formation

00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:22,480
now for a couple of quarters so we

00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:23,119
have introduced the formation life cycle

00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,200
stage

00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:26,720
it is an optional stage but we're seeing

00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:29,599
more and more projects

00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:31,599
you know needing to go to a phase of

00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:32,800
coalition building if you want before we

00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:35,280
get started

00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,559
and so that's the stage where you might

00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,280
not see the project

00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:41,200
yet fully open source alloy being an

00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,839
example or more fear in the previous

00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,079
quarter

00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:45,280
although again more fear was open search

00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:48,559
in and of itself

00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:51,040
before but we now have this

00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:51,680
form of concept in the life cycle and

00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:55,200
finally

00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:56,880
we have again formalized the concept of

00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:59,440
quarterly focus projects

00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,800
again if you go to this link you also

00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,200
can propose yourself

00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,160
your project as a focus project for the

00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,160
next quarter

00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,599
as you know the board on a quarterly

00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:10,079
basis selects

00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:10,960
five to six projects for us to provide

00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:16,240
extra help to

00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:18,319
as famous there's a couple of open items

00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:19,520
again uh they were i think we're gonna

00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:22,319
slow play

00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,880
uh technically we should go on and you

00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,800
know

00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,160
send pro requests to all the existing

00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:29,760
projects uh

00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,800
to uh formally adopt a new governance

00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,839
again

00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:35,119
we're not fast tracking this uh we'd

00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:36,880
love to hear from you

00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:38,880
first whether you're interested to take

00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,000
that or continue with the sort of old

00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:43,280
governance

00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,760
um so don't expect a whole lot of work

00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,599
there

00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,680
uh we're gonna be mostly reactive to

00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:49,280
your asks and then finally

00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:51,280
now that we remove programs we need to

00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,720
finalize the reporting process but for

00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,960
the time being

00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,559
in terms of board reporting like we've

00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:00,000
done in july we will

00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:02,160
ask focus projects to report

00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,400
and so those are the five or six

00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:08,480
projects that we bring up to the board

00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:11,520
on a quarterly basis um and with that

00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:14,880
i know we are almost at the end oops

00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:18,640
actually that was i'm missing a slide

00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,640
here folks

00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:29,839
just a sec um

00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:38,400
okay um we actually

00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:42,160
like it okay sorry folks

00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,680
that's what this line was um

00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:45,280
james if you don't mind i'll i'll just

00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:47,839
go through this since we are

00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,319
uh uh only two minutes want to make sure

00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:52,720
we

00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:52,720
we get through it uh if that's okay

00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:59,359
so um on one hand

00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:00,559
we we updated the governance but we want

00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:02,160
to make sure

00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:04,400
again especially if you're a finance

00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:08,000
maintainer and you're here on the line

00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:11,760
know that our goal is to always provide

00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,839
tools for you to be able to

00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,880
perform your responsibility as a

00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:18,000
maintainer

00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:19,040
in the least possible hoverhead kind of

00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,839
way

00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:23,599
and so you probably are familiar with

00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:26,800
our open developer platform

00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:27,280
if you are not go to odp.finance.org

00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,720
there is

00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:33,680
thorough documentation on the

00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,680
all the different

00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:39,760
tools and services that we provide to

00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:42,799
our projects and to our contributors

00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:45,280
but we wanted to extrapolate once again

00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:47,200
five of them that are key maintaining

00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,280
responsibilities which we think

00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,559
uh it was worth providing a cheat sheet

00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:53,839
for you uh

00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:55,839
for um so again i'm not gonna go

00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:56,880
through every single detail here because

00:54:55,839 --> 00:55:00,079
we are uh

00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:02,000
two minutes from the end but if you're

00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:06,240
looking to build and deploy

00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:07,280
your your uh project we have a whole

00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:10,880
cicd

00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:12,480
pipeline and our infra team able to help

00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,000
so don't don't feel like you're on your

00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:18,079
own we can help you

00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,079
set up your build the release process

00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:23,599
we've had consistently

00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:24,960
positive feedback on our documentation

00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:28,079
framework uh

00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:30,960
documentation is always something that

00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:33,200
especially hardcore developers you know

00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:36,480
tends to be a

00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:38,720
sometimes an afterthought well we

00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,799
have a whole framework that you can use

00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:43,040
to actually make sure that you start

00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:44,319
with documentation from the get-go that

00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,599
is other generated that is

00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:47,359
auto-published

00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:50,799
um so please take a look at our

00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:53,839
docusatis uh the disorders framework

00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:56,400
um because based primer

00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:57,280
um of course a big responsibility for

00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,920
maintainers

00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,559
is uh and you know venus has been

00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,640
helping

00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:07,839
there and will continue to but ideally

00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:09,760
the maintainers should run meetings

00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:12,160
when a project is actually holding

00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:15,359
meetings

00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:17,680
make sure that you review the refresh

00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:20,400
page that we put together on how to run

00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:21,119
good meetings or meeting procedures but

00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:25,040
also know

00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:28,319
that we provided a very i think simple

00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:30,960
to use uh meeting attendance tracker

00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:32,559
uh that's based on github uh and you can

00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:35,119
use github issues and that will

00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:40,079
automatically flow in our metrics and

00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:42,000
uh systems of record um

00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:44,000
security vulnerability issues you've

00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,799
heard from us over the last few months

00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,240
of course security in our industry is

00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:50,960
probably even more

00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:52,799
of an important item to make sure that

00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,720
all of our projects

00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:57,599
are on top of their security

00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:59,920
vulnerabilities

00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:00,720
so we have tools like white source that

00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:05,599
you can and

00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:09,040
should uh uh um uh um

00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:09,760
and should use uh again reach out to our

00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:13,440
infra team

00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:15,200
if you

00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,559
don't know where to start but this is a

00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,559
really good link

00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:20,280
for you to understand and related to it

00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:22,720
once you find

00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:24,480
vulnerabilities we have a full

00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:26,880
responsible disclosure policy

00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:28,960
please take a look at it of course there

00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,920
might be sensitive aspects there and so

00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:33,200
we want to make sure

00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:36,559
that you know we borrow that policy

00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:39,440
uh by and large from apache so very

00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:41,040
very established policy make sure that

00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:44,240
you get familiar with it

00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:46,160
and then finally you know

00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:48,000
if you're new to open source and you're

00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:50,480
looking to grow the maturity of a

00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,319
project we know and of course we help

00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:54,400
uh some females but we know it's not

00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:55,920
easy to grow

00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,680
from an open source project into a

00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,920
successful one

00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:01,200
that's where the project life cycle

00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:04,000
comes in if you

00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:05,280
get familiar with the incubating and

00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,799
active state

00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:11,040
that gives you an actual blueprint of

00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:13,280
you know what should you be targeting to

00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:16,400
in order to

00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:19,760
you know maximize the opportunity to to

00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:20,880
have a successful project out there um

00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,440

00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:24,000

00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,960
