Nick thank you James and I want to also

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,590
thank finist and everyone for for

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,500
organizing this never

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:21,510
one for coming out or virtually coming

00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:24,209
out to participate in this today so yeah

00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:28,860
I'm gonna talk to you all about FTC

00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:30,980
three the first real question is why FCC

00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:34,709
three why put these kinds of standards

00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:40,530
together so let's take a look at the

00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:44,940
world before FDC three sket developed as

00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:49,260
they always have and we always have more

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:52,530
than one app right and so if we want

00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,940
these apps to interoperate the way to do

00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,180
this in the past has been through

00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:00,450
creating proprietary bilateral protocols

00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:03,030
and api's or basically developers sit

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:06,329
down from different dev teams usually in

00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,860
different organizations and work out how

00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:13,829
they're gonna pass messages back and

00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:18,690
forth an optimization - this is an app

00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:22,230
may publish a its own API that it makes

00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:25,290
a bit more public so that a developer

00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:28,560
can discover that API read the

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:33,060
documentation and implement it within

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:36,170
their app in order to connect and this

00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:40,609
is a bit better but it still requires

00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:44,220
discovery by developers as well as

00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:47,130
coding to a number of different api's

00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:50,099
potentially as the number of apps that

00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:52,889
want to interoperate grows as they will

00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:58,680
so as you add more and more apps to the

00:03:52,889 --> 00:04:00,419
mix you just get an accumulation of you

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:05,849
know interconnectivity that has to be

00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:10,459
done all through different api's the

00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:14,940
world with FDC 3 is a bit different in

00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:16,769
this case all applications and

00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,870
application developers just need to

00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:21,780
speak one language they just need to

00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:25,919
write to the FTC three API and then once

00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:27,520
that's done level complexity for

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,979
interoperability is flat

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,310
and with each application that's added

00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:36,370
into the ecosystem there is not this

00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:42,580
sort of exponential growth in cost of

00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:45,190
making things interoperate also FTC 3

00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:48,520
works across any number of given

00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:52,990
technologies since it's just as standard

00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:56,169
and not a code library which means that

00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:58,840
today FTC 3 is in production on open

00:04:56,169 --> 00:05:01,240
Finn on charter Houston samba locally 42

00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:09,190
there's implementations in electron in

00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:13,150
Java and.net as well as chrome so how

00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:14,440
did we get here with this group some of

00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,889
you may know this but I'm just going to

00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:22,360
quickly go through a brief history of

00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:26,069
FDC 3 as an organization so we were

00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:29,949
founded in October of 2017 by open fin

00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:32,469
we had a slide deck and about 12 initial

00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:34,300
participants that were various

00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:35,349
technologists across the industry who

00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:39,789
are interested in this problem

00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:42,940
interoperability in May of 2018

00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:44,680
we are contributed into finis and at

00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,449
that point the organization had really

00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,560
grown and created structure around

00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:52,360
working groups on specific areas like

00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:59,039
context data and api's and app

00:05:52,360 --> 00:06:03,580
directories and then in the like q4 of

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:06,669
2019 we published the first FTC 3 100

00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:10,900
standard right and this was a big

00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:12,520
accomplishment and there were a huge

00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,590
number of organizations involved with

00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:21,610
that and then over the past year really

00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:23,590
in 2019 we saw that really grow in terms

00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,389
of the implementations are going to

00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:28,380
production and today we have fax and

00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:33,060
production this open fin glue 42

00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:37,930
JPMorgan chart IQ etc etc the list is

00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:40,849
pretty significant and where we are

00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:43,969
today is that we now have one one

00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:48,469
has just been ratified and it's really

00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:52,300
mutes this old capabilities of FTC three

00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:56,209
forts and efficiently I just want to

00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:58,580
acknowledge the breadth and depth the

00:06:56,209 --> 00:07:02,389
organizations that have participated in

00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:06,709
FTC three over the past two years plus

00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:08,990
and this is all the active and passive

00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:11,990
participants in FTC three by

00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:14,509
organization as well as the number of

00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:16,429
individuals that have actively

00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:18,860
contributed to creating the standard

00:07:16,429 --> 00:07:21,319
making it a reality and this isn't all

00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,179
of them but this is a you can see it's

00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:26,689
it's quite a group the people and

00:07:23,179 --> 00:07:34,279
organizations that have really made this

00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:38,089
happen so let's talk about one one so

00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:43,459
you can today go to the FTC 3d knows org

00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:48,610
site and see the one once back it is in

00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:53,089
the final days of being readied for

00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:55,999
official release and we are all very

00:07:53,089 --> 00:08:00,680
excited about it the three main areas

00:07:55,999 --> 00:08:05,019
that one one expands upon are in the

00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:08,389
addition of the channels API which

00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:12,019
addresses use cases like color linking

00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:13,909
as well as channels direct channels

00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:19,550
between different applications to

00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:24,099
publish data in a greatly expanded set

00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:26,929
of context data that can be used to past

00:08:24,099 --> 00:08:30,019
context information between applications

00:08:26,929 --> 00:08:33,310
as well as a number of improvements to

00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:35,930
the developer experience really based on

00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:38,539
real-world feedback that we've gotten

00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:43,550
since the 100 release as people have

00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:47,449
been doing implementations so this is

00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:50,939
the typescript interface for the desktop

00:08:47,449 --> 00:08:55,689
agent so for those of you that are not

00:08:50,939 --> 00:08:59,439
you know FTC three eeks the desktop

00:08:55,689 --> 00:09:02,170
agent is our terminology for any

00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:04,959
platform that it's implementing the FTC

00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:07,929
three API it's kind of a reference to

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:13,359
the user agent term which is a the

00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:15,579
abstract form of a browser as you can

00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:17,529
see on the bottom we have the additional

00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:21,040
channels api's that have been added to

00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:23,259
this to the FTC three api and you can

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,499
see that this is really a big expansion

00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:30,220
of the surface area of the API and this

00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:33,730
allows applications to do things like

00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:36,189
yet the system channels that would be

00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:40,149
made available by the platform the

00:09:36,189 --> 00:09:42,399
application is working with as well as

00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:46,089
to join one of those channels or to

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:51,790
leave the channel or even to get and/or

00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:55,360
create its own app level channel the

00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:57,759
channel object itself allows you to

00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:01,509
broadcast directly on to the channel as

00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:09,220
well as to listen to it and to get its

00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:11,739
current state as we expanded context

00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,419
data and these are the me and context

00:10:11,739 --> 00:10:18,249
data types of and added there are nine

00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:20,619
of them you can see that this allows you

00:10:18,249 --> 00:10:23,860
to do a lot more business specific

00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:28,089
things such as portfolios and positions

00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:30,579
as well as handle multiples of contexts

00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:32,769
like being able to handle an instrument

00:10:30,579 --> 00:10:35,949
list as opposed to a single instrument

00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:39,519
which but the original FDC three use

00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:41,709
cases were mostly focused on I just want

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,209
to point out that these were these

00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:47,649
standards were created in conjunction

00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:50,379
with the financial objects program in

00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:52,480
fin us as well and that was a really

00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:57,789
great example of cross program

00:10:52,480 --> 00:11:01,449
collaboration within Venice and finally

00:10:57,789 --> 00:11:03,940
we added a number of things to improve

00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:07,870
the developer experience in 1:1

00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:10,360
big part of this was the creation of

00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:13,830
reference sections for context and

00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:16,390
intents so before honestly one of the

00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:20,770
documentation was pretty sparse around

00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:27,370
these areas and so we've added a lot of

00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:29,230
sort of example and and and linking

00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,180
between things they can easily navigate

00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,470
through different contexts and intents

00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:37,060
and understand the connection between

00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:40,570
them as well as we've added features

00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:44,800
that came from real feedback so now you

00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:47,890
can when you listen to a you know when

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,350
you add a context listener to FDC 3 you

00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:53,350
can specify a specific type of context

00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:55,950
that you want to receive which was a big

00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:58,120
improvement for dev Aeronautics and

00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:00,430
we've also though they're not

00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:03,280
specifically part of on one there's been

00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:06,850
a real growth in chilling projects that

00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:09,850
have started up around FTC 3 to help

00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:12,790
support development one of those

00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:17,010
projects I'm going to demo now and that

00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:20,440
is the Chrome extension project that

00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:24,730
basically allows you to run the FTC 3

00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:26,440
api's in Chrome which is what I'm going

00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:29,980
to cut over to this is an open source

00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:34,120
project that currently is just in my

00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:39,150
github account but you can see it there

00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:44,320
and get it and play around with it so

00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:46,300
one of the first things that this Chrome

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,660
extension does and you can see that it's

00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:52,960
running because you get this icon in

00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:56,470
chrome that shows that you have the FTC

00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:59,500
3 agent running is that injects the FTC

00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:09,460
3 API into your chrome taps so if I

00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:12,610
inspect I can see I have

00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:15,190
to the FTC three API as a global and I

00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:18,700
can do things like let's say I want to

00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:21,670
call the find a tenth API or the V chart

00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:23,529
in ten this is now going to execute a

00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:27,790
search against my app directory and

00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:30,459
return a promise which will resolve with

00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:34,440
both the details about the intent as

00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:39,700
well as a list of applications that

00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:45,029
handle that intent I can also do things

00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:47,980
like get system channels and see all the

00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:51,190
standard channels or the color channels

00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:56,700
that this particular Desktop agent

00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:56,700
supports I could then use that to

00:13:57,029 --> 00:14:03,700
subscribe to a channel or to broadcast

00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:06,070
on the channel as well and I can do

00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,959
things like join a channel so this is

00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:10,420
kind of interesting if you look at this

00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:14,110
icon up here when I joined the red

00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:16,300
channel it's now showing me a badge a

00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:20,560
red badge showing that I'm now on the

00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:23,230
red Channel and I can broadcast a

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,120
context on to that channel so if I just

00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:27,730
call FTC three broadcast

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:35,560
it's now going to broadcast that onto

00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:39,610
the red Channel so I can see that by if

00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:43,120
I open my UI here I can now search

00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:45,430
against my app directory and I can open

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:50,529
up the channel manager which is an app

00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:53,380
that it's just a demonstration app that

00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:57,970
has been made available through this app

00:14:53,380 --> 00:15:02,110
directory now I can see all of my system

00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:04,150
channels and I can see that the red

00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:08,649
channel has the context that broadcasts

00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:10,959
onto it this also supports other actions

00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:13,390
I can use with an FTC three so for

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,459
example I can now find the intents and

00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:19,990
apps that are available for this

00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:21,500
particular context so if I want to let's

00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:24,130
say I want to view a chart

00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:32,090
and I can select the tradingview chart

00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:34,840
and I now have this chart loaded with

00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:38,180
the context that was provided there IPM

00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:43,630
what's also interesting is that I can

00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:51,770
now put this chart on to the red channel

00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:54,770
and if I change the context it's now

00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:57,110
going to reflect that here you can see

00:15:54,770 --> 00:16:00,110
that now the red channel context in my

00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:00,920
channel manager has been updated I want

00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:04,150
to copy that

00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:06,680
let's say for argument's sake and

00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:14,000
broadcast that over the orange Channel

00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:16,340
and now if I change this the red channel

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,770
here has changed to Apple and if I

00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:22,940
change now my chart to the orange

00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:26,870
channel which has Ivy Microsoft I will

00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:29,570
now pick up that context of my chart one

00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:38,390
other feature that you can see here

00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:40,070
channels is the creation of application

00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,670
channels so if I create a new channel

00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,980
here

00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:45,800
it's called foo this is called an

00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:48,140
application channel so this is not these

00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:50,210
are provided by the system the color

00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:54,230
ones but the this is a custom channel

00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:58,520
that just my application is created but

00:16:54,230 --> 00:17:02,480
other applications can also listen to it

00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:06,199
or participate in it so now my second

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:15,920
channel manager is also connected to foo

00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:19,550
and now if I update food and broadcast

00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:22,640
that my first application gets that

00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:25,579
update and I could you know keep doing

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:29,090
that broadcasting back and forth so you

00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:31,850
can see that the application for this

00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:33,980
kind of these kinds of channel API is

00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:36,090
pretty broad and there's a lot of

00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:39,270
different things you can do

00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:42,270
I'm just gonna cut over to a bit of a

00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:46,410
more financially specific demonstration

00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:49,170
of some of these features on the left

00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:54,470
you should see a grid that is actually

00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:57,720
coming from AG grid showing the S&P 500

00:17:54,470 --> 00:18:02,370
on the right you can see FactSet who has

00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:06,300
implemented FTC 3 and affects that chart

00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:09,420
so this grid is gonna let me do a number

00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:11,490
of different things with FTC 3 not just

00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:15,930
broadcasting context but also raising

00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:19,230
intense and discovering intent so first

00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:23,130
let's try raising an intent so right now

00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:25,410
I'm gonna raise an intent for 3m called

00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:28,890
view chart and what's gonna happen is

00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:33,270
that I've just said hey I'm interested

00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:46,350
in this in seeing a chart for this

00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:52,260
context and I will yes this rate rise

00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:54,720
raises up to my FTC 3 agent which will

00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:57,330
then look at both the app directory as

00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:01,440
well as applications that are connected

00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:03,900
to it live and see which ones can

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,770
support the view chart intent in this

00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:09,570
case this is actually my application

00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:12,480
instance on the right here my facts

00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:17,730
check my facts that chart my right your

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:20,940
left on and so if I choose this one it's

00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:27,350
going to send the new context of 3m over

00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:34,770
to that chart that's now showing IBM and

00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:39,360
I can also excuse me for example use

00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:40,980
this other feature to find intense for

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,370
this context which is something you saw

00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:47,429
before and in this case I want to look

00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:52,679
at a fact set price quote for 3m

00:19:47,429 --> 00:19:55,799
and you can see that that works quite

00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:57,599
nicely now these are not currently on

00:19:55,799 --> 00:20:00,149
the same channel so because I've just

00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:03,599
directed an intent directly at them so

00:20:00,149 --> 00:20:05,639
what I can also do is I could put these

00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:09,379
all on to the same channel let's say I'm

00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:09,379
going to put them onto the green Channel

00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:22,619
and now as I click through my list here

00:20:19,849 --> 00:20:25,349
these factset apps are going to update

00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:27,570
so I just move to you accenture let me

00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:31,080
can see that these have all updated with

00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:36,839
that context and you can see how this

00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:43,229
becomes a very powerful way of rapidly

00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:48,989
building really robust workflows between

00:20:43,229 --> 00:20:51,379
applications and so this is one of the

00:20:48,989 --> 00:20:57,419
reasons we are super super excited about

00:20:51,379 --> 00:20:59,999
FTC 3-1-1 and what it's going to do in

00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:04,609
terms of driving momentum forward around

00:20:59,999 --> 00:21:08,909
things like FTC 3 and interoperability

00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:11,070
so I'm going to cut back to just wrap up

00:21:08,909 --> 00:21:19,139
this demonstration then we can get into

00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:25,099
questions so one of the key themes for

00:21:19,139 --> 00:21:29,190
this series is open source in finance

00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:32,580
and in helping how we can help improve

00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:35,759
open source and finance I'm an enable it

00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:38,249
so I wanted just to wrap up by

00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:46,129
reflecting on some of the lessons we've

00:21:38,249 --> 00:21:46,129
learned through working on FCC 3 so

00:21:46,219 --> 00:21:54,289
these are I've kind of boiled it down to

00:21:49,339 --> 00:21:57,809
five steps that I think we can learn

00:21:54,289 --> 00:22:00,100
from and that we can apply to other open

00:21:57,809 --> 00:22:03,520
source projects so

00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:07,860
number one I call find a problem and

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:10,510
this is extremely important because

00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:13,570
open-source projects are like any other

00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:15,850
product you need to really solve a

00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:17,890
problem for people and there's open

00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:20,309
source problems and there's business

00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:22,870
problems that are better suited to you

00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:26,740
proprietary products but open source

00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:28,390
problems tend to not be shy and they are

00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,070
very in-your-face and they're widely

00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:36,539
distributed so these are things that

00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:36,539
people feel impelled to collaborate on

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:43,270
number two convince people to care

00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:46,390
successful open source projects are a

00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:48,220
long game and the need to address human

00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:51,970
problems as much as they dress

00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:54,250
technology problems so it's a slow

00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:56,770
process you need to be willing to as I

00:22:54,250 --> 00:23:01,890
say walk to Mordor to make these

00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:06,130
projects successful you need to ensure

00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:08,020
neutrality so important ways to do this

00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:09,880
is to be open source from the start and

00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:13,030
also to make sure that you have a

00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,380
balance and set of stakeholders that

00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:16,720
there there are many as many

00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:19,510
stakeholders they can bring to the table

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:23,409
as you can to keep that group diverse

00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:24,850
and and neutral this is extremely

00:23:23,409 --> 00:23:27,970
important and I think in finance

00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:30,520
especially where you have a lot of

00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:37,570
competitors sitting down to try to work

00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:39,370
on something together really critical is

00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:42,580
finding the least common denominator

00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:46,419
this was absolutely central with an FTC

00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:48,940
3 you need to keep the bar of adoption

00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:52,510
as low as possible you need to find what

00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:55,630
are the common things that everybody can

00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:58,179
agree on and not get concerned about the

00:23:55,630 --> 00:24:00,490
rest if you can't really get consensus

00:23:58,179 --> 00:24:04,270
on something it probably just means it's

00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:07,030
not ready yet to be part of the open

00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:09,850
source effort or in in the FTC three

00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:12,450
case the standards effort and then

00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:16,570
finally you need to iterate

00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:19,810
keep it simple always keep knocking on

00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:21,850
doors with people and you know work off

00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:24,340
of really world use cases as much as

00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:28,930
possible get something out there get

00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:33,990
feedback and then iterate on it so in

00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:37,120
conclusion I feel that FTC 3 has been

00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:39,490
successful because of the key values

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,770
that we've adopted and maintained within

00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:44,500
the script from the start and to me

00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:48,640
those boil down to that we were open

00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:51,430
source for inception we've been

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,590
collaborative by definition one of the

00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:57,690
C's within FTC 3 he stands for

00:24:53,590 --> 00:25:00,340
collaboration don't ask me which one and

00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:04,240
you know finally we're designed for

00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:08,050
adoption FTC 3 start small and lets you

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:10,180
come in at any level that you want and

00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:11,980
again these are very important for

00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:14,260
ensuring you can bring as wide a group

00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:18,160
as possible to the table and let people

00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:21,100
get involved so we've got I think I'm a

00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,990
little over time for talking I want to

00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:25,240
use the rest of the time possibly

00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:28,720
possible to answer some of your

00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:31,750
questions and I do want to also thank

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,170
everyone again as well as James and the

00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:36,970
finish team for putting this together so

00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:39,250
that's amazing Nick and thank you very

00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:42,190
much but before we actually go over to

00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:43,720
questions you may so the part the people

00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:46,510
who are attending pool today may have

00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:50,500
noticed that were actually picking two

00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:53,320
names out of the hat to receive two

00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,880
things t-shirts so one each and see

00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,740
behind the scenes Aaron has been working

00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,530
hard with his random number number

00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:03,040
generator and has selected registrant

00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:07,630
number 30 and register number 12 and so

00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:09,720
David Watkins and Mahesh Guru you'll

00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:12,430
both be receiving a finished tisha each

00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,470
as part of being on this webinar so

00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:16,210
thank you very much for being here and

00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:19,440
please wear them with pride when we get

00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:22,570
them over to you but in the meantime

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,340
does anybody have any questions that you

00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:27,970
would like to ask Nick

00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:30,779
as part of you know as part of his demo

00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:34,210
and also as part of his own presentation

00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:37,500
if we feel free to come off mutant and

00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:37,500
ask you a question

00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:48,279
Rico Eckstein from adaptive and I have a

00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:53,320
question for Nick Nick would what do you

00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:57,059
think will will make FTC three continue

00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:59,590
to be successful I think you know from

00:26:57,059 --> 00:27:02,409
looking at other open-source projects

00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:04,860
and you know as is quite hard work to

00:27:02,409 --> 00:27:09,669
make a project to create a community

00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:11,710
it's also relatively easy to for that

00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:15,159
community to lose momentum and and

00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:19,120
people to move on from it so what do you

00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:21,149
think will make it continually

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,620
irrelevant in the future

00:27:21,149 --> 00:27:27,549
yeah thanks Rico that's a really

00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:29,409
excellent question I'll try to just give

00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:34,029
some brief thoughts as we could talk

00:27:29,409 --> 00:27:37,330
about that all day probably so I think

00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:43,620
for FTC three in particular it's going

00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:49,480
to be about getting into more valuable

00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:53,399
business use cases so if you look at in

00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:57,159
stuff I demoed today it's it's really

00:27:53,399 --> 00:28:01,210
kind of nice and it creates a nice user

00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:04,480
experience but ultimately it doesn't

00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:05,860
solve critical business problems so one

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,370
of the things that we're really going to

00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:14,860
be focused on with FTC 3 in the future

00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:18,070
is looking at how do we get more

00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:21,909
involved with data and interoperability

00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:22,450
of data and that means when you raise an

00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:24,250
intent

00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,809
maybe you're raising an intent to an

00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:28,450
application but maybe you're also

00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:33,130
raising an intent to resolve a piece of

00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:36,419
data and that's I think going to be a

00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:40,230
critical thing for keeping FTC three

00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:44,669
to be homing in on relevant business

00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:45,840
cases for the community one other thing

00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:49,940
I think it's going to be really

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:53,970
important is creating much better

00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:55,889
tooling around adoption so one of the

00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:58,019
things that we have seen consistently is

00:28:55,889 --> 00:29:00,960
that people are really interested in FDC

00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:04,230
3 but they're not really sure where to

00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,789
start that was a big impetus behind the

00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:08,129
creation of the Chrome extension which

00:29:05,789 --> 00:29:11,940
is really just a way to give developers

00:29:08,129 --> 00:29:15,359
a very way to begin interacting with FTC

00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:18,679
3 and putting it together or things

00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:18,679
they've already built through the web

00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:24,509
right that's brilliant

00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,190
so I'm Nick I've got two questions here

00:29:24,509 --> 00:29:28,169
the first one's going to be from Mahesh

00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:32,340
and then the second is going to be from

00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:33,659
Sam if that's okay same said Mahesh do

00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:36,389
you want to come with me in our school

00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:38,490
question or would you like me to ask it

00:29:36,389 --> 00:29:43,030
on your behalf

00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:44,740
if it's alright I can ask just directly

00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:48,520
right no problem

00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:51,030
okay crate yeah so one thing I've seen

00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:55,780
is that you were able to stream the data

00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:59,620
and have that connection right but how

00:29:55,780 --> 00:30:00,880
did you get you know that resolution and

00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:04,390
be able to like broadcast that kind of

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,040
stuff very simplistically it's my quit

00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:07,540
like what I've kind of seen is that a

00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:10,270
lot of people have a challenge of how to

00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:12,400
use stream data and whether it's like

00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:15,420
just in the stock markets or whether it

00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,420
is for transactions

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,950
is this program like something that

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,930
helps developers get into this mindset

00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:29,380
or is this something that just for

00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:31,480
visualization okay so and I'm not sure

00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:34,360
which data you're talking about I was

00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:36,640
using some live applications in the demo

00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:40,330
but in terms of updating between

00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:43,090
channels that's done in this that's done

00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:46,510
within any FTC 3 implementation so if

00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:49,920
you look at the you know implementation

00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:53,170
like open fin they have their own

00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:56,080
service on the desktop that runs and

00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:57,850
manages the state of the connections and

00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:01,390
passes information back and forth

00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:03,910
between applications with the demo I

00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:05,320
just showed I'm doing the same thing I'm

00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:08,700
just doing it within a Chrome extension

00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:13,420
so there's an extension that's running

00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:17,010
the chrome tabs connect you that passes

00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:22,450
information between them in terms of

00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:26,080
streaming market data in that case you

00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:29,740
would you enable that through tc3 but

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,840
you would need something in your FDC 3

00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:37,570
implementation connecting to a back-end

00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:41,820
and that is providing that data to it

00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:41,820
right if that answers your question

00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:47,070
right say

00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:49,170
that's great and say Mahesh I hope that

00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:52,410
does because I actually want to move

00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:58,110
quickly able to Sam he has some question

00:31:52,410 --> 00:32:00,810
to ask a family able to to ask Ulis yeah

00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:05,450
can you hear me okay I can absolutely

00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:09,810
thank you it goes back Nick to the

00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:17,370
question of data acquisition and where

00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:19,500
the value is in FDC 3 I spent quite a

00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:22,140
lot of time talking to people in the

00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:25,770
commodities industry around decision

00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:29,580
support data so pre-trade pre OMS CMS

00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:32,970
data where they're trying to acquire and

00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:37,820
reconcile lots of non-conventional data

00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:41,970
sources so we saw in your demonstration

00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:45,920
to with a well understood naming

00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:51,690
conventions do you see an opportunity

00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:55,370
for data aggregation within FDC 3 ie

00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:59,820
small organizations coming in to

00:32:55,370 --> 00:33:01,430
aggregate in a choir data from primary

00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:04,800
applications

00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:06,240
there certainly seems to be value in the

00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,930
commodity market there are a lot of

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:12,960
corporate organization is trying to

00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:17,670
acquire very very disparate data sources

00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:25,560
now and I kind of sense there might be a

00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:27,960
place in the ecosystem for something in

00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:33,480
between the end user and the primary

00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:36,120
data quite sure what question I'm asking

00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,350
but it seems to me there's value in

00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:40,290
there somewhere but I don't quite

00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:44,280
understand where it is right yeah and I

00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:49,200
think that's a great question and if I

00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:53,940
can interpret I think that there's parts

00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:58,290
of that vision that FTC 3 can't address

00:33:53,940 --> 00:34:00,630
so if we're talking about a aggregation

00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:05,160
of large amounts of data where you're

00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:10,320
going to want to store it in you know on

00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:13,410
a server that's not something that FTC 3

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:20,610
is really focused on today but in terms

00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:25,830
of allowing a or enabling an application

00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:28,580
to expose data services through the

00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:32,610
client that is something that FTC 3

00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:37,890
absolutely could address so for example

00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:41,000
if I've got a 1 identifier I want to

00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:48,480
enhance it with additional information

00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:52,770
you could in FTC 3 allow a another data

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:55,580
provider to be able to make a kind of

00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:59,640
data service on the client that other

00:34:55,580 --> 00:35:01,860
applications could use to aggregate

00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:04,290
additional data that they would need to

00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:06,710
use to interoperate with other things

00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:10,500
for example that that is something that

00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:12,690
I'm very interested in seeing really

00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:16,790
getting realized in FTC 3 the EP is

00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:20,100
today would support it it's just that

00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:23,610
the kind of pattern hasn't been fully

00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:28,050
realized in any implementations at this

00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:31,500
point so this this idea so if you look

00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:33,720
back at things like web intents for

00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:36,960
example one of the ideas there was that

00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:41,640
a website could expose a service to do

00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:43,830
something like photo editing and so if I

00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:47,340
had a photo I could discover a photo

00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:49,860
editing service send my photo to that

00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:53,780
service edit it and then send the

00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:56,340
resulting image back to my original

00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:59,340
application doing something like that

00:35:56,340 --> 00:36:01,380
with a symbol where I could say hey I've

00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:05,820
got a symbol I want to get a quote for a

00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:07,560
very simple example I find a service

00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:10,740
that can give me a quote for that symbol

00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,910
I send my symbol over get the quote back

00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:14,369
and now can read

00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:17,730
use that data in my initial application

00:36:14,369 --> 00:36:26,579
would be a very powerful next place for

00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:29,280
a dc-3 to go to Thanks right so Nick um

00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:32,339
I would like to open a question up from

00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:35,369
Rob Underwood Rob if you would like to

00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:38,569
quickly open your mic and ask um Nick a

00:36:35,369 --> 00:36:40,440
question it's not a question although I

00:36:38,569 --> 00:36:41,670
appreciate that so I just wanted to

00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,910
quickly mention to the person who just

00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:46,470
asked them if you're interested in

00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:48,720
commodities data we have actually just

00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:50,789
this past two weeks stood up a new

00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:53,970
working group within the new alloy

00:36:50,789 --> 00:36:56,700
project the alloys modeling tool that

00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:58,410
was contributed by Goldman Sachs focused

00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:00,839
on commodities data specifically they're

00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:02,069
looking for said oil swaps so that's an

00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:04,349
area of interest to you

00:37:02,069 --> 00:37:06,150
feel free to follow up to me with me

00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:07,740
there's also our in our data

00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:09,480
technologies program within finis we

00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:11,520
have our security reference data project

00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,410
which looks at the broad swath of

00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,380
different types of reference data so of

00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:17,730
the shape of reference data or you know

00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:21,299
in this case you know commodities data

00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:23,069
including pre market or pre sale data is

00:37:21,299 --> 00:37:24,960
in interest to you there's two different

00:37:23,069 --> 00:37:26,339
groups within finis that are looking at

00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,869
that right now so feel free to follow up

00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:30,470
