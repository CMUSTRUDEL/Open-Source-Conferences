okay thank you very much so you put me

00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:11,820
in front of this awesome audience right

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,580
here once again my name is Peter Ivanov

00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:18,989
I'm a product manager at a company

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:22,590
called route 42 so I talked to some

00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:24,899
people before the talk and I guess most

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,570
of you are familiar with our product for

00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:30,390
those of you who are not we are in the

00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,940
application integration space the

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,760
interesting thing is that we are

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,190
integrating applications on the client

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,219
essentially if you are familiar with

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:44,660
companies like chart IQ or open film

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:47,730
we're pretty similar to them what we do

00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:49,710
what we focus on what our differentiator

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,079
is essentially is that we are focused on

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,870
the integration aspect not only on the

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:59,179
deployment now the topic of today's talk

00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:01,350
is about progressive web applications

00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:03,960
essentially not only progressive web

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,909
applications in general but how they

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,189
work on the desktop and why we think

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:11,329
that this is a big deal and possibly a

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:13,799
game-changer for our industry now I am

00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:15,509
quite conscious because I'm going to

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,250
make some bold claims here including

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:22,259
that progressive web apps are a big deal

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:25,170
and I do want to make a certain like

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,329
like to back my claims in in a manner to

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,149
see that we are not just wasting your

00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:32,310
time with false predictions because you

00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:33,899
know it's it's quite a big deal for us

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,840
so I do want to open up with an

00:01:33,899 --> 00:01:38,640
announcement that so far we are already

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,229
in the process of doing heavy

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,060
investments go forth to as a company by

00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:47,520
allocating significant amount of

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:51,780
development resources towards a brand

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:54,780
new open source PWA based version of goo

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,729
42 that's how much of a big deal with

00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,149
this for us essentially that's why we

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:03,689
are backing it with an open source

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:05,340
product based on that now just to gauge

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:10,710
the audience a little bit how many of

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:12,600
you know what PWA stands for cool how

00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:16,270
many of you have developed petaboys for

00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:18,580
the desktop oh good

00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:22,180
right now this means that you're

00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:24,010
probably going to enjoy the PWA crash

00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:27,910
course which I have prepared it's going

00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:31,240
to be short actually so pdaboy is a

00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:33,850
short acronym for progressive web

00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:36,250
applications Google coined this term and

00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:39,700
it's part of their web centric strategy

00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:42,070
essentially where they are trying to

00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,650
displace their competition in the

00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:48,790
application development space so what

00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:51,120
they come up with is like PWA is set of

00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:55,420
requirements which any web application

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:58,480
can implement and if you do that with

00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:01,600
your web application Google rewards you

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,030
with an additional opportunity and the

00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:07,390
browser actually you know actively urges

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:10,300
the user to install your existing web

00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:14,200
application on their desktop or on their

00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:17,230
mobile device and it essentially starts

00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:21,280
behaving like first-class desktop

00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:23,440
application like an application written

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,220
in dotnet or Java or something like that

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,230
now the initiative first started on

00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,800
their native platform on the Android

00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:32,320
device

00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,600
and let me show you how this actually

00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:39,010
this process works it's going to be a

00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:42,160
very short video so what you're seeing

00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,810
here is some enjoyed device it has

00:03:42,160 --> 00:04:02,790
loaded the progressive web application

00:03:43,810 --> 00:04:04,680
in the browser and now I assume that

00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,810
that those of you who have enjoyed

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,880
devices are familiar with with this

00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:11,220
interaction over here the way they

00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,380
described it sounds quite innocently

00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,440
like you can add this website to your

00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:19,470
home screen essentially it gets promoted

00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:21,600
to do an application status like one you

00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,160
can obtain from the App Store now that's

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,620
all fair and squared that's been

00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:29,640
available for quite a while the recent

00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:31,710
change they did this summer was that

00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,840
they brought this very same capability

00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:35,669
to the desktop I'm going to show you how

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,930
it works it's again a very short and

00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:43,790
enjoyable video so that Google Maps and

00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:56,010
on the here you can see by the way the

00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:58,590
capital of Bulgaria Sofia and so within

00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:00,780
three seconds and I would actually like

00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:06,240
to replay this again because it's it's

00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:09,000
quite interesting so within three

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,560
seconds what you see here it's hold it

00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,780
in the browser by the way this is edge

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:18,150
but chromium does the same thing as well

00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:20,520
now they share the same core I took

00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:24,930
Google Maps and now it's available as a

00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:27,210
native application on my desktop it's

00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,910
available in the Start menu it's also

00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:32,700
available on the desktop as as a

00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:36,780
shortcut actually I like the way they

00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:38,460
did the tear out so the the tab is no

00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,470
longer present in the browser now it's

00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,229
available in its own top-level window

00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:45,930
now this experience might seem familiar

00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:48,539
to you actually Google did not invent

00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:51,870
this on their own you can see this is as

00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:53,970
a progression of the concept which

00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,590
electron first brought to the desktop

00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:58,530
essentially you can host a web

00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:00,810
application on the on the desktop

00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:03,270
through and through a container now this

00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:05,130
has lots of advantages compared to

00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:08,220
electron first of all the installation

00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:12,390
process happens through the browser it's

00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:14,280
it shares the browser port it does not

00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:16,380
copy the chromium engine

00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,700
in the application itself it doesn't

00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,860
bundle it there

00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:24,810
you can think of it as a small shortcut

00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:27,090
actually because small size now I do

00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:29,700
urge you to try what I just showed you

00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:32,720
here on the desktop you look for the

00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:35,220
small plus sign in the address bar I

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,090
want to show you some great PWA

00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:41,450
applications first one is Google Maps

00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:43,230
themselves the one I just showed you

00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:46,380
another great one

00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:48,750
and people are like keep your Microsoft

00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:52,230
shop you're probably using coffee 365 as

00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:54,150
well the home screen of office 365 the

00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:55,770
one you're seeing down here is also a

00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:57,900
progressive to have application you can

00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:00,390
install it here and you can browse all

00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,640
the 365 applications from there as well

00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:06,030
it's quite engaging and useful

00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:09,540
it also offers great UX patterns so when

00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:11,070
once you load this page you see a file

00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:13,200
which was recently edited by my

00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:16,560
colleague so forth and so forth it's

00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,690
quite inspirational the next application

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,490
which was recently announced was Outlook

00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:23,010
so outlook is progressive web

00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:24,870
applications itself so you see that

00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:27,600
there is something which is like quite

00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:29,880
unthinkable here and can you imagine 10

00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,760
years ago Google introducing a new

00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,310
technology and Microsoft onboarding

00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,840
their properties on top of it now we are

00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,810
living in very interesting times don't

00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,610
you think so

00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:45,210
another application which was announced

00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:47,460
after I meant Oh slice is Google Drive

00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:50,610
itself it's also progressive web

00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:52,500
application now it's it's cool it's

00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,930
quite exciting you can see those ads

00:07:52,500 --> 00:08:00,000
they were great we're not Google and

00:07:54,930 --> 00:08:02,520
Microsoft unfortunately but what we

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,460
think well in the fintechs in the

00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:08,400
fintechs industry is that we can take

00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:10,740
advantage of this technology somehow now

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,650
let me show you what we are thinking of

00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:16,580
in the context of FinTech we're not

00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:20,789
dealing with Google Maps interleukin-2

00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:22,590
in Google in Google in group 42 we're

00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:25,169
dealing with desktops that look like

00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:28,199
this these are the traders desk so a

00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:30,289
fairly common use case we are facing

00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:34,469
with our prospects and customers is

00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:38,039
usually a bank has to deliver a set a

00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:41,700
multiple set of many pre-configured and

00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:43,950
integrated web applications to a remote

00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:46,589
desktop tour to remote client desktop

00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:48,029
now some of them are delivering those

00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:50,730
solutions to their internal

00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:53,029
infrastructure which is like very easy

00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:55,740
because you have the by now already from

00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:57,510
from the executives but some of them are

00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,639
also delivering them to other

00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,970
organizations they're transforming

00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:04,470
themselves into service providers now

00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:06,360
the only way you can do this currently

00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:08,610
if you want to deliver such set of a

00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:12,209
pre-configured applications is to use a

00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:14,880
container a container like before to for

00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:15,209
example open finish article fair and

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,029
square

00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:20,940
however the containers themselves need

00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:24,149
to be additionally installed on those

00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:26,070
external desktops and I assume that

00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:28,649
you're already catching the pain point

00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:30,480
here this installation may take a while

00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:33,329
because it needs to be approved by the

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,190
IT security department and the

00:09:33,329 --> 00:09:37,440
installation is just the first step the

00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,690
container itself also has to be scanned

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,699
for security issues so forth and so

00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:44,130
forth it also has to be updated to

00:09:41,699 --> 00:09:46,440
regular basis it's a problem that we

00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:48,779
would like to avoid if possible and it

00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:54,839
looks like with petaboys we might just

00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:56,490
be able to do that right so two months

00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:57,570
ago we decided to do a technical

00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,430
proof-of-concept

00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:01,260
initially and see what we can do and the

00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:04,290
results were really promising so we

00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:06,720
moved forward and I'm going to now try

00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:09,839
to squeeze in several months of

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,930
development into a few sentences so what

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,839
we did was that we took the existing

00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:19,410
core of our commercial product 242

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:22,920
desktop and we compiled it as a

00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:24,990
JavaScript module which we host it in

00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,510
the browser in running as a background

00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:29,339
thread some of you might be familiar

00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:32,490
with this term it's called serviceworker

00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:34,850
or a web worker doesn't really matter it

00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:38,699
runs off the main thread of the browser

00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:40,199
it also allows multiple applications to

00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:41,340
communicate to each other through it

00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:44,220
it's like a shared wrist

00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:48,650
available no Pompey no windows now we

00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:51,060
took that in addition to that we took

00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:54,210
the window management features available

00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:55,470
in the 42 desktop and reported them to

00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:57,540
the web environment

00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:59,940
it looks quite promising Heather and I'm

00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:06,000
really excited to show you how this

00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:08,910
actually looks in the context pwe now

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,490
that's a very very mint condition

00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:13,490
desktop looks like a virtual machine

00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:59,620
don't mind the pop-up this is not part

00:11:56,899 --> 00:11:59,620
of the presentation

00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:08,190
now what you just saw here is actually a

00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:10,770
fairly complicated example but these are

00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:12,420
the examples we are facing in the

00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:15,240
production environments where the liquid

00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:18,270
and it's fairly impressive at least to

00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:21,870
me because what I just saw was how you

00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:24,750
can take a web application running in

00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:27,240
the browser instantly promoted to the

00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:30,480
desktop kind of experience and not only

00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:33,270
that you can have it host additional web

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,940
applications in various frames top-level

00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:38,520
windows and on top of that integrate

00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:41,550
them in real time by exchanging data

00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:44,730
between the different shells your you

00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:46,290
have between the different applications

00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:48,780
we have over here just to clarify

00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:50,760
something what you see is not just a

00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:52,890
single web application these are

00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:55,290
actually multiple web applications

00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:58,260
developed independently if you're

00:13:55,290 --> 00:14:00,120
familiar with the term microphone dance

00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:02,970
this is exactly microphone data

00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,250
connection and these applications some

00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:06,840
of them might be existing web

00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,730
applications you'll have in you you know

00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,710
infrastructure some of them are might be

00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:15,180
something you're developing right now

00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:17,010
exchange data so exchanging the debt is

00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:19,770
possible in the bread web browser itself

00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:22,530
the great part here is that they are

00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:24,690
hosted in those little Kim windows where

00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:27,630
you're no longer burdened with the

00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:29,820
additional UI of the browser itself it's

00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:33,270
quite a native experience so quite

00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:36,630
excited these are actually just a few of

00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:39,990
the capabilities our new product is

00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:41,460
going to offer I'm getting to the point

00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:44,160
where shoot announced its name actually

00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:46,500
because referring it as a new product is

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:54,690
like a mouthful we're going to call it

00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:56,100
goo 42 court so to sum up anti-fur the

00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:58,350
missing slide here which is actually

00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,540
quite interesting but I'm going to stay

00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:02,190
here and I'm going to get the rest of

00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:06,760
the presentation over this picture

00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:11,470
sowho 42 core is a PWA oriented

00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:13,570
product similar to what you 42 desktop

00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:16,270
is offering right now its primary

00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:19,000
purpose is to integrate multiple web

00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:22,750
applications in a single coherent word

00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,610
work for the reason why we would need

00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,020
such kind of integration is because some

00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:28,060
of those applications you may have

00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:31,180
bought from third-party vendors some of

00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:33,580
them might be developed in-house and so

00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:36,370
on and so on it's going to be entirely

00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:39,040
browser-based it's going to live to be

00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:42,670
fully operational in all modern browsers

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,200
or no modern operating systems the part

00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,850
which are most excited about them

00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,280
actually this is the crux of my

00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:50,110
presentation is the good 42 core like I

00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:53,170
mentioned in the beginning is going to

00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:55,540
be completely open source and that's a

00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:57,550
very very bold step for us again it

00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:00,070
really resonates quite well with the

00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:03,220
previous presentation so over here and

00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm really happy that we managed to get

00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:10,660
an internal buy-in from our stakeholders

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:14,320
because we do believe that by making 140

00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:16,420
to poor open source we are going to do

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,700
the right thing for our existing

00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:23,520
customers also for the community in

00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:26,710
general it's obligatory to mention that

00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:29,200
go forth to core is going to support the

00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:32,800
existing fitness standards we're going

00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:35,200
to support the MDC 3 in there

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,660
we're also having very interesting

00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:40,240
conversations with James from Venus

00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:42,400
about the possibilities which such kind

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,170
of a platform will bring and this is

00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,450
really important they'll give you a one

00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:48,490
example why why we think that this will

00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:52,090
benefit the community and us as a

00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:54,400
company right now ABC 3 doesn't have an

00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:56,410
open-source reference implementation to

00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,600
test ABC 3 you have to obtain a

00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:00,730
commercial container you have to install

00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:04,030
to know desktop and so forth and so for

00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:06,730
having a web-based open source platform

00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:09,430
that supports a dc-3 will allow you to

00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:12,880
get up and running in a minute this is

00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:15,220
really important not only for the buyers

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,100
but for the sellers themselves they will

00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:19,049
be they will easily be able to test

00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,509
their implement

00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:23,549
they're a dc-3 implementation and

00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:25,559
further make and make sure that it

00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:28,079
actually works with zero hassle

00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:30,809
thank you the funny thing is that the

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:34,200
work the codename for our project was 42

00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:37,139
zoo but there were some implications

00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:41,039
around the name 420 codename for

00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:42,690
marijuana and so forth it didn't fly

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:46,100
well in the company after we realized

00:17:42,690 --> 00:18:16,379
that so yeah well that's it

00:17:46,100 --> 00:18:18,509
any questions actually we are not going

00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:20,220
to impose any restrictions on before to

00:18:18,509 --> 00:18:22,830
correct so we're not going to come up

00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:25,169
with some shady non-starter places at

00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:33,450
least that's what my see your promise to

00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:36,299
me so I think which I forgot to mention

00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:38,009
is when is this going to happen because

00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:40,619
this is just an announcement right now

00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:43,409
so good 42 core is currently developed

00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:47,879
in github we are about to flip the

00:18:43,409 --> 00:18:54,929
switch very soon probably a month from

00:18:47,879 --> 00:18:56,879
now so if you are excited about the

00:18:54,929 --> 00:18:58,350
project please let me know immediately

00:18:56,879 --> 00:19:00,480
after the presentation because I'm

00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:03,899
missing the last slide here which equals

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:06,149
the URL so we are looking for people who

00:19:03,899 --> 00:19:08,970
are interested in getting an early stage

00:19:06,149 --> 00:19:11,850
preview before we actually flip the

00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:14,759
switch because we are we want to discuss

00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:17,279
some things immediately right now about

00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:20,749
use cases in validating what our

00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:20,749
assumptions are for them

00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:34,679
so quite the other communities it's a

00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:38,010
big focus from James and so we did the

00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:40,470
open source bridges Bluebird and Reuters

00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:43,159
in a manner basically to cover back so

00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:53,789
just a movie uses that that's very much

00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:56,880
really great

00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:59,720
well mouse Road final round of applause

00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,720
