Title: Colin Eberhardt    Why I ðŸ–¤ open source    Edinburgh Open Source Fintech Meetup
Publication date: 2021-01-08
Playlist: FINOS Guest Speakers & Meetups
Description: 
	COLIN EBERHARDT // TECHNOLOGY DIRECTOR // SCOTT LOGIC
At work, Colin spends a lot of time talking about the commercial benefits of open source software, and more broadly the business benefit of engaging with the open source community. However, in this talk he shares a more personal viewpoint, talking about the reasons why he contributes to open source projects, and the benefits it brings to him as an individual.

The Edinburgh Open Source Fintech Meetup is organised in partnership by Scott Logic (https://www.scottlogic.com) and FINOS (https://www.finos.org).

You can join the group here to be the first to hear about future events: https://www.meetup.com/Edinburgh-Open-Source-Fintech-Meetup/

	00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:10,959
yeah so yeah we intro and I guess it's

00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:12,849
Claire pointed out we've got to our next

00:00:10,959 --> 00:00:14,469
meeting or all booked up with speakers

00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:16,900
and I guess a theme you're probably

00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:19,600
going to get used to is it sort of big

00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,730
banks talking about big things big

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,950
projects open source which is all very

00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,200
very interesting stuff I actually wanted

00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:29,380
this is our very first Meetup I thought

00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:31,690
I'd start really really small big banks

00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,860
big projects is my day job I don't

00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,660
really want to stand up and talk about

00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,219
my day job right now I want to talk

00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:39,339
about some of the more personal things

00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:42,039
that I do so for me open source has been

00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:44,710
just as much a personal endeavor as it

00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:47,350
has been a professional endeavor I guess

00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,420
it's led me to ask myself this somewhat

00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:51,519
rhetorical question why do I spend so

00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,690
much time working on on open source

00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:54,309
which is you know it's good to ask

00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:57,339
yourself questions every now and again

00:00:54,309 --> 00:00:59,170
and I sat and had to think about it it

00:00:57,339 --> 00:01:01,239
wasn't anywhere anywhere near as pretty

00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:04,750
as that it was just in my living room

00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:06,159
and I came up with it with a number of a

00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,299
number of really good points and I wrote

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,469
them down and there were there were

00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:10,119
seven of them which is always a nice

00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:13,750
number and I could just tell you those

00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:15,250
seven points but to be honest I found it

00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,140
more interesting thinking about my

00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,180
journey towards learning those seven

00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,469
things about open source so I'll show

00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,880
you let's share those seven points of

00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:23,350
view and you can write them down for

00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,539
yourself but I want to tell you a little

00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:27,640
bit more about my own personal journey

00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:30,700
and a common theme throughout all of it

00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,320
is about sharing of creations open

00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,240
source to my mind one of the most

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,280
fundamental things about it is it's the

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,630
sharing of things that you create so I

00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,350
want to talk to you a little bit about

00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:43,719
that so for me it started quite a few

00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:45,759
years ago with the discovery of

00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:48,670
computers and this was the very first

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,780
computer that I ever laid my hands on

00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:55,479
I'm going to ask you a question who

00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:56,710
knows what this it's a BBC I don't think

00:01:55,479 --> 00:02:02,890
you can tell whether it's now Arabi

00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:04,329
unless you lift the lid we've got some

00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:06,490
prop right all right okay

00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:09,100
yeah fair enough fair enough you've

00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:10,869
you've blown me away there so this this

00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,120
was a computer that was commissioned by

00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:16,390
the BBC as part of a computer literacy

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,610
project and it was a fantastic career

00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,290
and people of a certain generation will

00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:22,090
have remembered going to school and

00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,790
they're being computer rooms with with

00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:26,650
wall-to-wall BBC micro computers in a

00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:29,410
lovely cream that kind of faded to

00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,970
yellow over time I was lucky enough to

00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:34,660
have one of these things at home and

00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:37,420
also every week and now every month this

00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,220
would drop through our door through the

00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,050
through the post the the be bug magazine

00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:43,840
I don't know if anyone else here ever

00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:47,080
got be bug no ok it was at the time it

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,580
had a real kind of fanzine feel to it it

00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,690
didn't have a very high distribution now

00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:56,320
recently I found that someone has

00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,760
scanned all 100 or so copies of the B

00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,220
bug magazine and posted them on the

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,280
Internet which is pretty amazing and I

00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:06,459
vaguely remember writing a letter to be

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,290
bug magazine quite a few years ago and I

00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:10,600
thought I wonder if I can find it

00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:12,100
it took me a long time to find it

00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,630
because they haven't used OCR or

00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,450
anything these are image scans but I

00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:18,250
eventually found it I'm gonna read it

00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:20,709
I'm gonna read it out for you dear it

00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,959
starts dear sir because I was very well

00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:24,760
brought up and I can't see on my screen

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,430
it says I've beaten the high scoring

00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,260
Hedgehog my score was three thousand and

00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,540
eighty I liked your magazine because it

00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:34,750
has lots of good games Colin Everhart

00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:36,459
aged 8 yeah I was to be honest I was

00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,019
kind of hoping for something a little

00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:40,360
bit more insightful that would kind of

00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:40,959
points her future career in software but

00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,760
there you go

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,990
it was my scoring Hedgehog which was

00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:51,010
beaten but yeah

00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:52,870
yeah actually I was the heist I was top

00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,700
of the high scores in Missile Command

00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:58,810
for a number of months running and I'm

00:03:54,700 --> 00:04:01,420
gonna find those high school anyway much

00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,770
much more relevant a lot of the b-baka

00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,530
magazine looked like this

00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:07,840
it was source code and the reason why it

00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:09,910
was full of source code it's because at

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,220
this point in time this was the primary

00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:14,320
way for sharing your creations with a

00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,730
wide number of other people and yes you

00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,500
could have them on cassettes but to

00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,330
distribute to a significant number of

00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,850
people you distributed them as source

00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:24,640
codes so for me this was a very

00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:26,800
immediate experience of learning how

00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,440
computers work and and how to share your

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,330
creations

00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,100
after I grasped some of the basics of

00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:35,710
programming I moved on to my next

00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,840
computer and moved from self-discovery

00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:39,610
through to creativity so I'm gonna ask

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:47,350
the same question again who knows this

00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:49,690
one it's a Commodore Amiga a 500 and

00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:51,400
this was the first computer that I

00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:55,030
actually owned myself it was an amazing

00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:57,250
machine multitasking had 4096 colors and

00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:59,860
a weird kind of graphics mode called ham

00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:02,950
graphics we can go into details later on

00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,870
but the interesting thing about the

00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:06,310
maker computer especially in the Atari

00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,650
ST and if here are the other computers

00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:10,810
at the time is they fueled an incredible

00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:13,480
amount of creativity a lot of people

00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:16,510
with the Amiga and the Atari just wanted

00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,490
to make pretty things make funny sounds

00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:20,740
there was a lot of creativity and there

00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:23,800
was a lot of sharing of these creations

00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:25,330
through floppy disks in in public domain

00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,370
so as it says here public domain

00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:29,110
software is software that's been placed

00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,990
in the public domain it has absolutely

00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:34,720
no ownership copyright trademark or or

00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:36,640
patterns basically you created something

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,230
and you said here you go world you can

00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,000
do what you like with it and the stack

00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:42,610
of disks there is basically the

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,590
distribution mechanism I had a draw that

00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,000
was packed full of these things and to

00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:47,950
be honest public domain was a bit like

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,530
stamp collecting people wanted to get

00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:52,150
the whole collection of thread fish that

00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,820
was one of the public domain collections

00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:57,400
people wanted the whole collection

00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:58,870
funnily enough piracy of games was rife

00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,970
at that point in time people were

00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,860
copying like crazy

00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:04,510
I think mostly people are copying the

00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,040
games so they could get their funky demo

00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,750
on the front of it people weren't doing

00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,600
it to actually get the game it was a

00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:12,430
distribution mechanism for the demos and

00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,400
again you know I released some public

00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:17,320
domain software I couldn't actually find

00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,300
it this was it was called Doctor Strange

00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,250
music you know I was a teenager I don't

00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:23,080
know why I was doing that that the

00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:25,000
review says the vu meter and volume

00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:30,130
indicator is also very nice good discs

00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,510
great after that I I moved on to a

00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:34,810
different type of computing and my

00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:36,910
motivations changed to money at that

00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,770
point in time I I went to university and

00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,600
money was a bit scarce didn't have

00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:43,360
tuition fees those times in those times

00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:46,090
thankfully and I went there as the

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,530
universe as not the universe is the

00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:49,870
internet which is kind of the universe

00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:52,390
was really kicking off I had my own

00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:55,060
Geocities website and so on but I

00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:56,530
quickly realized like many other people

00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:59,020
that the Internet is an interesting

00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:01,120
platform for making money I didn't

00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:04,210
invent PayPal but I did have this

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,460
website and thanks to the wayback engine

00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:09,010
and at that point in time there was a

00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,810
thriving economy called shareware

00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:13,330
software you can see in there at the

00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:14,680
bottom I had a few free creations some

00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:16,540
of them were screen savers which were

00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,580
basically rewrites of the demos that I

00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:21,360
used to write on the Amiga another one

00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:23,950
was very popular within a little click

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,630
virtual juggle it was a 3d juggling

00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:27,520
simulation the world needs one of those

00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:30,340
and the top one was a thing called

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,520
mosaic magic and at that point in time

00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,630
photo mosaics were very very popular

00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,100
photographs that were composed of lots

00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:38,200
and lots of little photographs so I

00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,300
thought are right at all that allows

00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:43,000
people to create their own distribute it

00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:45,520
as shareware charge people 15 pounds for

00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,410
the unlock code and I was able to pay my

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,680
rent at university through this little

00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:52,870
creation until the guy who owned the

00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:56,610
pattern found out and then they met

00:07:52,870 --> 00:08:01,960
stuff I had no idea that was patentable

00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:04,030
as it progressed the next step in my

00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,120
sort of experience with sharing software

00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:09,580
was around sharing building blocks as is

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,830
the things that I created became bigger

00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,360
and potentially more significant I

00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,500
needed bigger building blocks to

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,300
construct them so

00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,760
again using the wayback engine this was

00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:22,240
one of the first websites I created back

00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:23,680
in 2006 I should probably tell you one

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,450
of my weird hobbies is I'm a bit of a

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,400
juggler which is why there's a bit of a

00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:29,020
juggling theme going on here but I

00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,930
created a website called the Internet

00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:36,190
juggling database all programmed in PHP

00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:38,050
and I had people volunteer to translate

00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:41,560
it into eleven different languages

00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:43,620
I had integration with news at the time

00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,360
came through I think would use net news

00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:48,850
some people may may remember that it was

00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,130
a a chat forum that was outside of the

00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:53,410
internet so I brought it into the World

00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,840
Wide Web and this is when I created my

00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:58,780
very first open-source projects so this

00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,040
was PHP headliner a PHP tool for

00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:02,230
integrating news net news

00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,450
this was PHP site translator that

00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:07,030
allowed me to farm out the translation

00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:10,390
of my website to a team of enthusiasts

00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:13,240
and whilst I didn't get a lot of people

00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:16,360
contributing code I did get quite a lot

00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,190
of people raising issues and and and

00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,370
feature requests this was my first

00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:24,370
experience of collaborating with a wider

00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:26,230
community following on from that this is

00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:28,780
the first collaborative project that I

00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:31,900
undertook this was a chap called Philip

00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:34,120
sue me who used to write blog posts and

00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:36,280
articles for a magazine that I also

00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,570
wrote for and we decided to team up and

00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,550
we created our first kind of

00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:41,560
collaborative open-source project it was

00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:43,990
quite exciting creating a project with

00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,370
someone that I never actually met and

00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:47,320
and funnily enough that's something

00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:53,020
that's repeated itself a number of times

00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:55,210
now since then I've become highly active

00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:56,020
in in github and I'm going to stop there

00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm not going to give you a blow-by-blow

00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,530
account of every project I'm even

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,400
involved with since then because we

00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:05,800
would literally be here all night but

00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:07,390
through through github github has now

00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,420
become personally for me my primary

00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:12,730
mechanism for sharing but the sim the

00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,290
same themes have emerged I've worked on

00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:16,120
open source projects with a number of

00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:18,460
people I've I've never met before

00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,680
I've open sourced my own projects and

00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:22,540
others have have contributed code

00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,780
contributed feedback and they've helped

00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,950
me to improve my own creations so I'm

00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,330
gonna go back to the original question

00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:30,220
again asking myself

00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:33,430
why do I spend so much of my time

00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:36,070
working on open source projects and I

00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:37,990
think through looking back at myself

00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:39,790
history with computing I'm able to

00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:41,890
better answer that and as I mentioned

00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:44,650
I've got sort of seven points I've

00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:47,500
boiled it down to a few key sort of

00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:51,160
facts from my personal perspective the

00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:54,430
first one is is very much my belief that

00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,530
software development is a craft and if

00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:58,450
you believe it to be engineering or art

00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:01,300
or otherwise I'll agree with you to a

00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:03,280
certain extent but for me for most it is

00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:06,910
a craft and the interesting thing about

00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:10,090
crosses people enjoy pursuing them and

00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:11,890
building skills for no other reason than

00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:13,540
the pursuit of the craft itself whether

00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:15,280
you talk to someone who's into painting

00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:18,630
or otherwise some people just do it

00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:21,580
because because it's fun others also

00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:23,170
have a lot of joy through sharing their

00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,730
creations as well and I think most

00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:27,490
people who are in software could can

00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:29,320
understand those two motivations sharing

00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:31,540
them you get that kind of warm fuzzy

00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:34,390
feeling of someone else using your code

00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:35,770
sharing your creation so with that in

00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:39,640
mind here are some of the things that I

00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:42,640
I believe really make me enjoy working

00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:45,400
with open-source software the first one

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:48,160
is it it keeps my skills fresh these

00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:50,290
days I spend quite a lot of my day job

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,670
in meetings I'm not gonna be rude about

00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:54,310
that because some of the people I spend

00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:56,020
meetings with I'm in this room so I

00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:57,670
won't be rude about that but I do spend

00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,800
a lot of time in meetings a good thing

00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:02,410
about open source is it gives me the

00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:06,460
opportunity to practice what I believe

00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:09,490
to be my craft and I can maybe in

00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:12,040
between meetings or on an evening I find

00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:13,930
a reality-tv a great when the kids are

00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,370
watching I'm a celebrity get me out of

00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:17,410
here or whatever else I can write some

00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:20,800
code it's it's cool I get a bit of peace

00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:23,850
it also encourages me to expand my skill

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,170
set as well if I'm doing something

00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:28,180
open-source I can pick whatever

00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:30,070
technology I want so if I want to pick

00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:34,000
something new and shiny yeah why not

00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:36,070
I'll go ahead and do that next up it

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,460
teaches me about people this this really

00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:41,110
is an interesting one and as I mentioned

00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,100
I've worked on open source projects with

00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:43,860
a number of people I've

00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,300
I've worked with people before

00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:48,910
videoconferencing was was around so we

00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,630
communicated via email or back in the

00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:52,930
day it was things like

00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:55,210
ICQ and yahoo chat and so on and it

00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:57,250
teaches you a lot about how to interact

00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:59,500
with different people it teaches you to

00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:01,930
to be respectful of differences of

00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:04,500
opinion it teaches you to understand

00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:07,660
language barriers and social differences

00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,610
and also I guess on a flip side it

00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:11,920
teaches you to focus on the important

00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:13,900
things and by that I mean not code

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,430
formatting that's that's not important

00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,650
there are much more important things

00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:19,110
than some of the trivialities that

00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:23,740
sometimes get in the way of

00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:25,480
collaboration and on a similar note it

00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:29,320
makes me a better communicator and what

00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:32,230
I mean by this is I've I've experienced

00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,910
trying to contribute to other people's

00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:36,340
projects and what you sit very soon

00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:38,590
realizes most open-source projects are

00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:40,780
run by people who don't have as much

00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:43,000
time as they would really like to spend

00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:45,820
on that project so what that means is if

00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,350
you want to to join that community if

00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,390
you want to make a contribution you have

00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:52,030
to communicate very very clearly and

00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:54,670
concisely why am i proposing this change

00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:56,260
why why is this an issue what benefits

00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:58,300
will it bring because I can guarantee

00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:01,810
you if you don't clearly communicate

00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:03,700
yourself they'll not have time to enter

00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:05,530
into a dialogue so it does really teach

00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,450
you to communicate better and that gets

00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:10,840
you a long way towards collaborating

00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:12,430
with other people again this is probably

00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,740
an obvious one it makes me a better

00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:16,330
developer and yeah I can see some of you

00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,950
in the room are doing exactly what I do

00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,610
at this point in time you're going what

00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:22,030
language is that

00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:23,350
yes it is PHP and I'm I'm not gonna have

00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:26,260
any shame in that because I guess

00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:28,090
another thing that as a tangent one

00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:30,340
things it's taught me is is don't be

00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:32,350
snobby about technology as well I think

00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:34,270
that's a very very slippery slope I

00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,890
don't use PHP these days and I must

00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:37,840
admit I might joke about it sometimes

00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:41,580
but I should probably remind myself that

00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:45,400
I learnt a lot when I was writing PHP in

00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:46,690
2006 and yet it certainly makes you a

00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,700
better developer if you're doing

00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:50,950
something an open-source obviously your

00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,750
code is in the open and what that does

00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:55,720
is that really focuses your attention

00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:57,699
you think a little bit more about design

00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,589
and tests and documentation if

00:14:57,699 --> 00:15:01,779
potentially the world of the Internet

00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:03,250
and everyone's eyes can be on your code

00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:04,959
I'm not saying they will be but there's

00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:08,980
the potential there you think twice

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:11,079
about about what you're doing it makes

00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:12,970
my own creations better now this I think

00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:15,399
is is probably what most people believe

00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:17,709
to be the primary promise of open source

00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:20,980
if you create something puts it out in

00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:22,839
the open then loads of other people can

00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,970
come along and contribute and make your

00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:27,819
creation better as a bit of a reality

00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:29,709
check you've got to actually have really

00:15:27,819 --> 00:15:31,839
quite popular open source project to

00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:35,350
have a significant investment of other

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:38,410
people's time but it does happen in my

00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:40,899
own experience I tend to get a lot more

00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:43,509
people contributing thoughts and ideas

00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:45,370
and and bugs and issues to my open

00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:47,620
source projects and again that's a

00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:50,079
reminder that contributions are not all

00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,759
just code there's a lot more you can do

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,529
to contribute to a project than write

00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,209
some code and that again that makes it

00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:57,839
quite accessible to all kinds of

00:15:55,209 --> 00:16:03,059
different people and so on that note

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:05,949
don't be afraid to invite feedback

00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:08,589
invite contributions and also on the

00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:10,990
flip side provide feedback to to others

00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:13,720
actually just just the other day I was

00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:15,850
using and this is a bit of a tangent I'm

00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,040
I'm quite into webassembly at the moment

00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,420
which is a fairly new technology and I'm

00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,980
trying out some of the new tools and

00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,500
there was a guy trying to persuade me to

00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,689
use his his testing tool and the same

00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,610
well I used this other testing tool but

00:16:25,689 --> 00:16:29,500
why should I use your one is oh oh well

00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:31,000
mine actually it compiles to assembly

00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,709
script so you don't have to do this

00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,779
compilation process I went oh that's

00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:36,519
really cool why didn't you say that on

00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:37,899
the readme if you'd have said that on

00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:40,240
the readme I might have I might have

00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:42,339
actually used it and again my feedback

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,750
to him was you've got to clearly state

00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:45,970
what your project does because it's

00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:49,000
really cool and you know that links

00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:50,949
quite a few of these themes together the

00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,500
next one is it teaches me the value of

00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:56,139
small things I'm very much a believer in

00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:58,240
the value of small things because with

00:16:56,139 --> 00:17:00,250
open-source these small benefits can be

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:04,149
multiplicative and I'm glad I managed to

00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:06,819
say that one thing that that you often

00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:09,029
find yourself doing is as a developer is

00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:11,589
is wasting time

00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:13,750
sometimes we spend far too long just

00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:16,059
trying to get a thing to work that

00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:17,740
should work and then we go back and we

00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:19,839
look at the instructions and go over

00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:21,760
that was misleading I'm on Windows they

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,589
wrote it for Mac or or it's just plain

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,390
wrong and at that point in time you can

00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:27,730
just you know you fix the problem for

00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:29,679
yourself you can move on and and and go

00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:31,840
about your your job but if you spend

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,360
another five minutes you can go back and

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,820
fix the documentation or fix the example

00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,890
and you'll save someone else an hour and

00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:41,049
someone else an hour and someone else an

00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:44,980
hour and it kind of snowballs so

00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:47,860
whenever I see an issue or a problem no

00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:49,690
matter how small I'll definitely go back

00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:51,130
in and change it even if it's just a

00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:53,620
one-liner and a piece of documentation

00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:57,760
because small small things do have a big

00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:59,590
impact and then this is a final one I

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,390
must admit this is a little bit of an

00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:04,120
odd one it makes me better at marketing

00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:05,200
and you wouldn't generally expect that

00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,950
when you're talking about writing

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:12,940
open-source code but what I have found

00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:15,460
is with with sites like github the the

00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:17,350
internet and with so many people working

00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:20,860
on projects is it it can be a real

00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:22,750
struggle to get yours noticed and if you

00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:24,490
want to create a successful open source

00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,890
project you have to invest the effort

00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:28,929
into marketing it and I certainly don't

00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:31,270
mean flashy websites

00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:34,149
jazzy spinny graphics or anything like

00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:36,700
that it's it's real marketing is about

00:18:34,149 --> 00:18:38,679
explaining why you created it what

00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,649
problem it solves what benefits it

00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:43,809
brings people quite often forget that

00:18:41,649 --> 00:18:46,120
like they don't they think that everyone

00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:48,309
else's context is the same as theirs and

00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,260
they'll instantly recognize the value in

00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:54,399
what they've created that won't happen

00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:56,320
you have to explain yourself so yeah

00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:58,090
that's that's my kind of seven reasons

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,450
why I love open-source and spend

00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:04,570
probably far too much time working on

00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:07,270
open-source projects hopefully that's

00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:08,770
inspired you to get involved either by

00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:11,110
maybe open sourcing some of your

00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:13,480
creations or collaborating and other

00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:15,789
open-source projects or just as a as a

00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,340
little reminder to to make those small

00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:19,529
changes those small contribute

00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:22,600
contributions that make things better

00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:25,030
okay maybe it's maybe it's a career

00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:27,130
- to practice your craft because as I

00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:29,049
said it you know it I believe software

00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:30,190
development is a craft and I can have an

00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:31,960
argument about the people with the

00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:34,289
people who think it's science over a

00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,850
beer if you've got any questions

00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:39,010
observations or simply want to maybe

00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:42,190
share some of your your reasons for

00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:44,950
loving open-source then then please do

00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:52,420
thank you very much

00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:52,420
