	COLIN EBERHARDT // TECHNOLOGY DIRECTOR // SCOTT LOGIC
At work, Colin spends a lot of time talking about the commercial benefits of open source software, and more broadly the business benefit of engaging with the open source community. However, in this talk he shares a more personal viewpoint, talking about the reasons why he contributes to open source projects, and the benefits it brings to him as an individual.

The Edinburgh Open Source Fintech Meetup is organised in partnership by Scott Logic (https://www.scottlogic.com) and FINOS (https://www.finos.org).
