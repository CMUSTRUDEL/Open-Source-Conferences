Publication date: 2021-01-08
Playlist: FINOS Guest Speakers & Meetups
Description: 
	JONATHAN HAGGARTY // HEAD OF OPEN BANKING TECHNOLOGY // NATWEST GROUP
In the space of two years, NatWest has gone from having 0 APIs to serving 10s of millions of hits every month, thanks to the 100s of software development companies that can now integrate with them. The scale of achievement is matched by the scale of the challenge involved in getting there – Jonathan and his team had to enable ten brands, influence the wider ecosystem, and encourage parts of the bank to change their ingrained mindsets.

In this webinar, Jonathan shares insights into the challenges faced both by technical teams and the wider business – and how his team led NatWest Group’s move from operating a closed shop to building an API Platform on common standards for the wider fintech community.

The Open Source in Fintech Event Series is organised in partnership by Scott Logic (https://www.scottlogic.com) and FINOS (https://www.finos.org).

Before the COVID-19 crisis, the events took place at meetups in Edinburgh and London, and they will again – when it is safe to do so!
