Title: Jonathan Haggarty    Open Banking, Our Journey    Open Source in Fintech Event Series
Publication date: 2021-01-08
Playlist: FINOS Guest Speakers & Meetups
Description: 
	JONATHAN HAGGARTY // HEAD OF OPEN BANKING TECHNOLOGY // NATWEST GROUP
In the space of two years, NatWest has gone from having 0 APIs to serving 10s of millions of hits every month, thanks to the 100s of software development companies that can now integrate with them. The scale of achievement is matched by the scale of the challenge involved in getting there – Jonathan and his team had to enable ten brands, influence the wider ecosystem, and encourage parts of the bank to change their ingrained mindsets.

In this webinar, Jonathan shares insights into the challenges faced both by technical teams and the wider business – and how his team led NatWest Group’s move from operating a closed shop to building an API Platform on common standards for the wider fintech community.

The Open Source in Fintech Event Series is organised in partnership by Scott Logic (https://www.scottlogic.com) and FINOS (https://www.finos.org).

Before the COVID-19 crisis, the events took place at meetups in Edinburgh and London, and they will again – when it is safe to do so! 

You can join the groups here to be the first to hear about future events and webinars:

good afternoon everyone and thank you

for joining us for our second online

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,840
open source FinTech meetup where today

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:16,039
I'm delighted to be joined by Jonathon

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,779
Haggerty head of open banking at NatWest

00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:21,449
we actually booked Jonathan to speaker

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:23,039
our Edinburgh meter back in March which

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:25,800
was the first event that we had to

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,589
cancel because of Cove at 19 but I guess

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,480
one of the upsides of this situation

00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:32,940
that we find ourselves in is that we're

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,829
able to share Jonathan's talk with so

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,410
many more of you now that we're not

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,600
bound by geographical restrictions that

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,070
being said I'll be very happy we can

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,680
when we can meet you all

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,829
face to face once again as soon as

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,690
circumstances allow so let me tell you a

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:52,109
bit about the meetups before we get

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:54,179
started the open source FinTech meter is

00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:56,850
developed in partnership between fin us

and Scott logic usually run in London

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,230
and Edinburgh with the aim of building a

00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:04,500
healthy engineering open source

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:07,020
community in the UK we cover a wide

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,790
variety of topics in our meetups so if

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,009
there's a particular topic or theme that

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,470
you'd like us to cover or you have an

00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:15,150
idea for a talk please do give us your

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:19,110

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:21,149
we're a short survey will appear if

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,860
you'd like to ask a question pop it into

00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:25,229
the question box and we'll take as many

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,270
as we can at the end and if you'd like a

00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:30,600

these in the handouts section so without

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,070
further ado let me introduce you to

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:36,810
today's speaker Jonathan has been

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,670
working at NatWest for the last seven

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,280
years and has spent three of those

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,979
leading their open banking and API

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,649
initiatives prior to that he spent a

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:49,039
long time chasing pixel perfection at

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:51,180
the likes of UBS and Morgan Stanley

00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:53,700
building everything from trading

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,280
platforms to video walls

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,560
he lived in Glasgow with his wife Nikki

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,780
who works as a horse vet three young

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,409
children and a large cat called Frank

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:06,090
and I do hope he makes an appearance and

00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:08,340
Jonathan is a software developer at

00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,280
heart and builds his teams around people

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,019
with a similar outlook and mindset so

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,850
over to you Jonathan

00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:19,120
I softened

00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:23,470
they're going to take part on the cheese

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,270
even if as and finally only um I mean I

00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:28,000
must admit it does feel a wee bit like

00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,770
the tech equivalent of for the Eagle and

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,260
then spend a disproportionate amount of

00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:33,700
time figuring oh you put some sort of

00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,610
Easter day good object in the background

00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,720
but thankfully and yeah the when we went

00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,880
through and people are gonna have to

00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:43,030
settle from our youngest silence

00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,380
interview bedroom and some of the more

00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:47,250
additional children's posters of him

00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:50,080
caught on the wall available through 80

00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,180
and so first day and I've been working

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,730
in that waste for the last seven eight

00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,900
years roughly in a variety of roles but

00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,520
the thing I'm here to talk about today

00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,890
has what I've been working on for

00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,470
roughly the last day and a half it guys

00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:04,330
not banking become the probably 30

00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:07,330
minutes or so and want to leave some

00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:08,740
time for questions at the end so I'm

00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,840
going to use that time to try and help

00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:13,390
people understand the Weber though often

00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,830
banking means to NatWest given the

00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,540
frankly means why all the different

00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:19,270
things to different people and that and

00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:21,820
the self could probably be a minute

00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:25,000
webinar I'll talk with a wee bit about

00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,800
where we started and try and growing

00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,390
people and in terms of where they may be

00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,220
on on that journey

00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,710
I'll talk we were a very painful

00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:34,690
evolution and where we've got to and

00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:36,940
we're heading to and hopefully through

00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:40,810
that you know I can provide some cement

00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:42,940
steps insights that help people maybe

00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:45,670
avoid some of the challenges and

00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:50,050
mistakes that we made and comment join

00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:53,830
us on that journey as well and so just

00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:56,230
clear sent me a rough year where people

00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:57,700
were joining us from and it's a really

00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,470
broad spectrum so we've got a lot of

00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,190
people in the UK but we've even got

00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:04,390
quite a few people join them from the US

00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,580
we've even got some people join them

00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:07,800
from Europe and Africa as well so I

00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,660
thought the first thing that would be

00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,520
valuable related to step back a bit and

00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:17,020
to get people I guess the thousand meter

00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:20,440
view of all of mankind Eze and where we

00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:22,300
have been and where we are today really

00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,710
and then we can get into the the who and

00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,710
some of the challenges around that

00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:32,790
so food really simple I'm often banking

00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:34,830
as where we as a bank shared api's other

00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:37,470
companies it software development

00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:39,900
companies and financial services consume

00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:42,780
in order to build propositions for both

00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:45,050
our customers and ultimately their

00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,960
customers as well

00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:50,240
in terms of often banks as a concept

00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,030
when the concepts of Shaving data it's

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:58,310
been around for four decades really and

00:04:52,030 --> 00:05:00,800
various forms so you've shared bank file

00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:03,409
downloads with my money management

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,650
platforms you know that's nightly

00:05:03,409 --> 00:05:09,740
negative data uploaded via FTP to run

00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:11,840
the file stores we've created features

00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:14,180
and saved our customer platforms for

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,389
them to download Excel spreadsheets

00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:21,919
filled transactions etc for them to V

00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:23,690
upload and turn into other platforms and

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,569
more recently and you know things like

00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:29,780
screen scraping have allowed people to

00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:31,550
openly share their data and with third

00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:34,009
party propositions o

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:37,729
Commonwealth fees for tools and barriers

00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:39,650
to entry and hopefully and you guys will

00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:45,289
see your bank Ennis has removed and

00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:47,449
really really Lord so the modern

00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:49,069
incarnation of open banking from at

00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:53,419
least the NatWest perspective really

00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:58,000
started at the end of 2016 early 2017

00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:58,000
and you know would be

00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,510
honest for me to tell people that you

00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:05,520
know started really off the back of some

00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:07,650
some research of the competition and

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,380
Markets Authority that the UK market and

00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:13,640
basically found and that they thought

00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:16,860
the general financial market could be

00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:19,260
what a negative and more competitive for

00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,930
for everyday Joe Bloggs on the street

00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,520
and the thing that they they really

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:26,900
kicked off off the back of that was

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,670
Yuki's the Yuki's can average enough

00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,890
Vulcan banking I think the thing that

00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:33,720
you know I'd like to stress is really

00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:35,790
you know as we've gone on that journey

00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,890
we see it much more than something that

00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:40,800
we we have to do it's something that has

00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:42,570
no really are I might even say I called

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,480
from the organization and I thought the

00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:50,640
paradigm shift and for us as a bank and

00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:52,650
also to take organization back in 2016

00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,450
you know everything that we developed

00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:57,360
for customers was developed at the base

00:06:54,450 --> 00:07:00,260
of Mount West so really our ability to

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,880
get stuff into our customers hands was

00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:05,210
predicated on how quickly we as an

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:09,330
organization could don't own features

00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:12,000
quickly we could listen to customers and

00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:14,640
how you we could you know have above up

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,570
on failure both how we prioritize those

00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:20,670
things internally moving them to 2017

00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:24,030
and we've got some really simple stuff

00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:27,030
and I think almost almost all really

00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:28,650
simple were it was a great test for for

00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,760
banks in that ways generally just to

00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:32,700
really prove that we could actually

00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,110
deliver and things into production for

00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:38,400
use by people that aren't aren't

00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:39,960
ourselves so that's the API is like what

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,480
products there's the bank or for in

00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:45,180
terms of color accounts where there are

00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:48,180
ATMs winner or branches water all

00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:51,930
Canaries etc saw nothing that was wasn't

00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:54,210
a Glee and want engine bucket

00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,830
king of big tall when to the kind of

00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,220
space that we were we were into the more

00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:00,910
generally

00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:03,340
we moved into the rest of 2017 so the

00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:06,640
last nine months we introduced the

00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:09,400
concept of customer and we have to

00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,330
deliver a whole keep of API is for aut

00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,640
customer base

00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:14,970
I just think of people from planet

00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:17,560
internet waste as an organization we are

00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:19,410
banking brands we have lots of different

00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:23,020
brands share of different customer types

00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:24,910
in different locations you know for the

00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,470
technologists you know the main

00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:28,960
technologists on on the way you

00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:31,090
understand that creates a lot of complex

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,599
in terms of the underlying systems that

00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:36,610
we used to terrible customers and the

00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:39,250
teams that ultimately on on those

00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:42,460
systems but for the first 11 II we were

00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:46,550
focused on the UK so now rest Royal Bank

00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:49,160
of Scotland and austere bank north

00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:50,480
just for clarity nose API is where

00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,030
things like you know what accounts of

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,890
customers go up or the balances or the

00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:56,960
transactions on the accounts and really

00:08:54,890 --> 00:09:01,960
some fairly simple functionality to

00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,960
kick-off and domestic faster payments

00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:11,889
so after burden that ecosystem was gear

00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:13,990
enough to help people use API so I'll

00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:16,600
talk about though her that ecosystems

00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:19,209
formed in a minute but the great thing

00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,560
was as as we were building people were

00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:23,500
building up interesting getting this

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:27,490
stuff used so that when we then come

00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:29,439
together stuff live on January 13th 2018

00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:32,199
they really closed everyone's hearts

00:09:29,439 --> 00:09:36,430
healer and down west and we had some

00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:41,740
instant and consumption time mark

00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:45,459
Thornton 2018-2019 we had to grow the

00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:47,740
API said we went from just and UK brands

00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:51,160
to encompass all over digital grounds as

00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:52,660
part of some wider and EU legislation so

00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,810
expand the node things like Southern

00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:58,089
Ireland or its customers Adam in call

00:09:55,810 --> 00:10:01,389
and some of our international brands etc

00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:03,879
again really add into the complexity of

00:10:01,389 --> 00:10:07,720
how we and that I've heard these these

00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:09,970
api's equally and they had to add more

00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,800
products so you know the first

00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:13,660
implementation was restricted to a small

00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,600
set of products current accounts only

00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:18,939
but as we expand do and we added more

00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,920
and more products what and what features

00:10:18,939 --> 00:10:23,380
except from the thing I think there's

00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,380
probably an important for people to

00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:27,790
understand there's as we've done that

00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,470
you know the guy part of the in general

00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:32,680
he's helped us hide that complexity for

00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:35,069
customers but it was by no means a

00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,689
simple easy task and took some fairly

00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:39,819
actually in efforts inside the bank to

00:10:37,689 --> 00:10:42,870
really make that happen in a fairly

00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:42,870
short period of time

00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:50,150
and so we look at ecosystem and I

00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:53,060
thought given the the kind of content of

00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:55,580
the series it would be great to compare

00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:57,770
all from banking to open source early

00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:00,200
but more generally because really they

00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:03,310
share a lot of the same principles you

00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:07,040
know at the heart of bulton banking the

00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:10,270
goal was shared value and value for

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:13,250
others a bank value for our customers

00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:16,880
value for people that consume the api's

00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:20,600
are building propositions for our

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:22,250
customers and if you like it open source

00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,650
I guess they you know I needs a few

00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:28,540
things to be successful so has to have

00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:30,440
the concept of community and part of the

00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:33,440
ecosystem that we brought together in

00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:36,890
the UK really brought that to life

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,590
we had people Beldon and the API is not

00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:41,630
on just ourselves and people that want

00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:43,310
to consume that stuff and sometimes as

00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:46,430
those people actually overlapped and

00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:48,670
then we had influencers and the

00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:51,920
ecosystem Israel in the form of

00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:53,240
regulators and fermentation entities and

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,020
industry experience I wanted to

00:11:53,240 --> 00:12:00,350
contribute to how that's really too

00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:02,210
cheap you don't mean cards on the table

00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:04,610
it's not it's not a truly open source

00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:06,950
and model because clearly people can't

00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:09,470
contribute our own implementation in

00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:12,550
terms of codes what it can do is

00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:15,050
contribute in terms of standards the

00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:17,300
types of features that the reason this

00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:20,090
you should be building and work with us

00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:28,850
to work through those issues and really

00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:30,980
move the world forward so if we have a

00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:33,410
look at our I start pointing against

00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:35,210
seven the thing that that a lot of

00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:37,520
people come back to is you know we as a

00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:39,500
bank of EPI genome we as technologists

00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,750
have been building api's for four years

00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,190
and I think when we started we thought

00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,710
we would have a fairly decent

00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:47,270
springboard and because a lot of these

00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:49,310
functions actually exist and say in the

00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:52,700
bank you know we've got mobile apps

00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:56,150
we've got when these platforms that show

00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,850
people data therefore you know we we

00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,370
must have a

00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:00,750
guys point trips and been absolutely

00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:04,440
candid when we went around the

00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:06,449
organization and you know people then

00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,720
say yeah you know we've going to be I've

00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:11,459
been building them for four years and

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,649
when we asked to reuse them I'm suddenly

00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:15,810
the tone of the conversation changed

00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:18,000
about you know people would say well you

00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:20,850
know they're trying to API is a davon

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,759
Lymon boat for our very specific use

00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:25,500
case which to some extent I would have

00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:28,279
to debate whether those things are truly

00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:30,209
a be is the really byproducts of

00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:34,620
propositions that we have a we use a

00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:36,060
bank and I've chosen to so some of the

00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,550
things that I've got here are really

00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:40,380
closed on your organizational maturity

00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:43,529
and whether or not you've got the right

00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:46,230
kick balance in your organization to the

00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:49,620
kind of start to open up and share that

00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:50,819
sort of functionality and so you don't

00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,579
have a look around it do you have

00:13:50,819 --> 00:13:55,740
documentation and which is a great

00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:57,269
indicator of you know are people open to

00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,120
three years and you know the short

00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:02,149
answer is you know we hunt had plenty

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:06,259
and we had almost an an overwhelming

00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:09,810
amount in various forms you know weren't

00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:12,300
exhale PowerPoint people documented

00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:14,250
stuff and faithfully every form you can

00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,339
find we had plenty of west doors from

00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:19,230
the Kent nineties and noughties when

00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:19,529
soap and XML was there was the other

00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:24,620
thing

00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:26,790
and my personal favorite was always the

00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:29,759
conference documentation you would find

00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:31,560
and you know you would follow through to

00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:33,779
our point and inevitably would be

00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,050
slightly wrong and but you had the

00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:38,880
cannabis table at the bottom which was

00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:40,769
please please update this documentation

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,730
of you actually call which I thought and

00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:43,730
I always have a good chocolate

00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,320
you know ii think there's probably worth

00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:53,170
having a look at you know do you have

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,360
any API gateways in your organization

00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:58,000
and you know gateway agains of any

00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:02,140
nebulous terrible but there are things

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,940
that allow you to expose functionality

00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:09,700
from your organization and a consistent

00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:11,680
way again though we had a lot a lot of

00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:14,100
products in this face we had you know

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,810
everything from from Apache and inject

00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:21,750
through to products like you know IBM's

00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:25,540
dated power C years layer 7 product and

00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:28,480
you know you name it and we had it and

00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:31,300
the challenge I think with a lot of

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,120
these products was the M to get access

00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,560
to them you know you had to contact take

00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,780
your work teams in the bank they would

00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:40,470
be cold you know things like the metal

00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:43,330
we're a team and for the Gabri team and

00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:45,640
the way that you spoke to these teams

00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:49,030
was you know your but we met like

00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:51,640
praying humble honest um you know you

00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:52,930
created some work somewhere and you

00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,550
asked for some things and then at some

00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:58,720
point they materialized in some form

00:15:54,550 --> 00:16:00,040
whether that was media and sex once or

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,890
cave and we she never wanted and

00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,840
intended is slowly secondary and

00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:07,930
productive really difficult to gain when

00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:10,150
people realize and backlogs and actually

00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:12,460
get stuff though then the third thing

00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:15,580
that's worth having a look at is you

00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:18,880
know what washer and security setup in

00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:21,160
the bank are you gear doc - really mmm

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,530
create new API can in 710 to the market

00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,820
and again we would actually slightly

00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:28,270
further here than the current fitness

00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:29,950
space we had done a lot with them modern

00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:32,710
security products in recent years

00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:34,180
so although we hadn't maybe embrace some

00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:38,200
of the API concepts in those products

00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:39,700
link or each with education and they

00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:43,720
were they in really close to bell gone

00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:45,790
on top of and soul oh no I'm the answer

00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,910
to you know doing happy be ice was

00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:52,870
really not not really and we had cave

00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:55,600
bags fill of random parts and to some

00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:58,390
extent it fit we been about a wee bit

00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,649
like kind of episode of scrappy couch we

00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:02,389
turned up and you had all this stuff and

00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:04,159
you don't crack on and figure out how

00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:06,709
you can you can hang together some EP is

00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:09,159
that we can we can put to market and

00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:11,949
I'll apologize turned on and on Yuki

00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:15,279
Westerner is a fair-sized not our

00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:15,279
programmer Yuri

00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:22,640
so left INSERM threatened watch a

00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:26,300
picture of me thank the problem in June

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:29,030
and 2017 I'm quite finding that I'm not

00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:31,760
actually entirely convinced it looks

00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:34,010
much different today I haven't you know

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,750
unless I you know feel like I'm

00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,970
constantly falling forward I tend to

00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,340
feel me but uneasy about the progress

00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:41,630
we're making

00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,610
and I think tomorrow if you clear a

00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:45,559
bench and I've got three very young

00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:48,230
children for you know the two-year-old

00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:51,010
no one you know and some somewhat lost

00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:53,780
ability to differentiate and chaos from

00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:56,179
from from normality which you know by

00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:58,040
the way is an incredible scale to to

00:17:56,179 --> 00:18:02,059
have when when you're having to belt him

00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:03,440
in big corporate organizations you've

00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:06,870
tried to work your way through some of

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,610
the quixote exists internally

00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:12,270
I've seen some of these points and as we

00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:16,140
talked about some of the things that we

00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:18,510
look forward to Satan organization you

00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,580
know when we've started to look at any

00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:23,340
more complex api's you know we realized

00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:27,420
that we were firmly in the realm of

00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:29,490
opinion which is you know an okay place

00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:33,170
to be in some scenarios when you have

00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:38,400
the time and and mental thinking space

00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:40,260
to be and figured out how to move you

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,920
know our wage spectrum of views and to

00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:46,500
to clarity but we had and you know just

00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,790
over six months which which in some

00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,400
companies you know if you worked in

00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:51,990
smaller companies that's probably a long

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,580
day when you're working big banks that

00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:56,010
that feels like a fairly insignificant

00:18:53,580 --> 00:19:02,190
amount of time but at least and then

00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:04,559
back and then back then and you know as

00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:06,510
we were kind of embark on this journey

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,160
we really realized that we didn't just

00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:10,110
have attained slash its face into here

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,980
and you know was one of culture as well

00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:15,179
people people fundamentally and couldn't

00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,830
get our head around the fact that we

00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:19,530
were going to be exposing stuff to our

00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:21,179
market and that we weren't in control of

00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:23,400
we weren't in control of what people

00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:24,660
would go lonk offer and to some extent

00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,960
we weren't really in control of how

00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:29,850
people would use it and so it took a lot

00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,960
of convincing can draw cajoling people

00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:33,179
over the course of a number of months

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,000
and even even years to try and change

00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:38,250
that culture

00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,670
anthe and we had to build across the

00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:43,590
spectrum of systems spectrum team so

00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:46,410
spectrum of products it was just really

00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:48,059
um you know why the complaints still

00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:54,540
trying to get their stuff delivered and

00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:56,429
in any reasonable period of time the

00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:59,490
other thing this this worth mention

00:19:56,429 --> 00:20:01,760
actually is and it wasn't only a product

00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,420
and system exposure problem it was are

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,250
actually there's a lot of modern

00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:08,070
standards here that we have to build and

00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:10,710
just to meet these api is usable and you

00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:13,740
know the concept of customer can say the

00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:15,570
concept of customer management porting

00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,050
the concept of staff management portals

00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:18,690
et cetera

00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:19,410
he's went small undertakings or things

00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:28,029
that

00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:31,359
line rings and suggestin soon

00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:33,279
I can brief you into how you me and we

00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:35,320
went though implemented this

00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:39,399
implementing this at least and the first

00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:41,859
today we put some common standards then

00:20:39,399 --> 00:20:44,710
that everyone could benefit from there

00:20:41,859 --> 00:20:47,349
things like security and standing up at

00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:48,940
the end point and very protection

00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:52,869
understands and customers and consumers

00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:55,659
are you had to you don't put a lot of

00:20:52,869 --> 00:20:58,059
Micra services life to really abstract

00:20:55,659 --> 00:21:00,309
and orchestrate the multiple underlying

00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:02,589
systems that we have in the bank and

00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:04,839
even the multiple customer bases that we

00:21:02,589 --> 00:21:08,710
have you know our API is are are

00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:11,379
obsessed them and customer agnostic so

00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:14,469
you can use them to speak to all sorts

00:21:11,379 --> 00:21:18,070
and my isn't that complexity is really

00:21:14,469 --> 00:21:21,219
quite big difficult probably also works

00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:23,769
in our first implementation and you know

00:21:21,219 --> 00:21:26,409
we really had to put our nose to the the

00:21:23,769 --> 00:21:30,239
grinder to some extent and a lot of the

00:21:26,409 --> 00:21:30,239
products we we use

00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,530
they were called up something had access

00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,090
to in the bank we couldn't afford it

00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:37,039
really able to market and use bleeding

00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:40,580
edge and just from the team skills that

00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:45,650
that we had and a change isn't always

00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:50,059
easy right we had to really you know

00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:51,799
push me I've got a lot of friends to

00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,059
getting their stuff to getting the stuff

00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:55,130
over those lists the first destination

00:21:53,059 --> 00:22:00,770
and I'll hopefully cheer with you guys

00:21:55,130 --> 00:22:04,900
whoever hold on that and so first kind

00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:07,460
of I guess and this is a barbell and

00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,990
two-point Phillies so I hope this call

00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:11,990
back when I was training for some

00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:14,840
mannequins all you it's weed no no open

00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:16,789
towards the dog Jensen I had it was from

00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,280
our own podcast they were speaking about

00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:21,200
a mental health running group and the

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,700
manfro of the running group was really

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,669
that you know you should be able to run

00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:27,740
and talk because exercise is a great way

00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:30,200
of getting people to release endorphins

00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:32,630
which is a great way to to get people to

00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,669
speak to one another so the point was

00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:37,000
that the people in the group shouldn't

00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:39,169
feel compelled to keep up with everyone

00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,590
and what I would say is that if you're

00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:44,870
gonna implement massive change and up in

00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:46,450
corporate organization you need Pacers

00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:49,039
you need people that are going to break

00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:51,350
organization organizational norms I

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:53,659
wouldn't push technical barriers to get

00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:54,140
stuff done but they're going to do that

00:22:53,659 --> 00:22:56,960
in a weenie

00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:59,200
and that doesn't kind of burn the

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,039
organization's owner or burn bridges I

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:05,240
think the important thing to recognize

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:08,419
is that actually and you have to use

00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,980
those people to reach into the bank to

00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:14,900
bring people on that journey with you

00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:16,640
and really to to you know steer near

00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,450
horizon so that they think they can keep

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,450
pace with you

00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:23,510
other table people if you know run in

00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:24,919
and you spend to the finish and that's

00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:25,640
all happens your friend behind he's got

00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:27,770
the car keys

00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:30,320
and you know you're not want to get in

00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:31,850
the car any quicker therefore you've

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,460
really watts but remain sit and figure

00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:37,360
out what what's important and how to to

00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:37,360
get people on that journey

00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:44,210
and we've evolved a lot in those three

00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:46,040
years so we've really gone as I said

00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:48,110
from the pinion and on these skill sets

00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:50,510
to bringing in new products to the bank

00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:52,450
to try and remove some of the pain and

00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:55,760
manual effort for building these api's

00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:58,100
so the talk and

00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,350
fairly familiar to some people and what

00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:02,420
all the things that we used to do and

00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:04,070
each of those things represented a

00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:07,850
separate handoff rate you had to speak

00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:09,410
to the DNS team or the firewall team or

00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:12,890
you had to speak to the security team to

00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:14,480
get certificates provisioned or and you

00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:17,480
know that that kind of number of

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:20,600
handoffs was was really large and our

00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,580
ability to automate that stuff was

00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:28,460
really small so the timeline was

00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:31,610
naturally for you right long what we did

00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:33,590
was we you know push push the actual

00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:35,240
delivery in 2018 we've started to look

00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:37,670
at some modern products so we brought in

00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:40,610
a product called Google Apogee and and

00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:43,070
with that we've really started to to

00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:45,740
Rhian power our developers to give them

00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:47,810
the ability to automate all the things

00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:50,210
that you see on top such that we can

00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:52,250
start to get new things live and in a

00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:56,000
matter of days and weeks rather than a

00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:59,000
matter of and once and that's really

00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,130
been key for taking us to the next level

00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,200
so not just implement and the things

00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:04,970
that you know are part of the mandatory

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,710
space but are starting to implement

00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:12,770
things that we think start to push the

00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:16,130
boundaries and people people one so some

00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:18,380
of the technical artifacts I guess we've

00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:19,940
we felt as part of that journey and I've

00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:21,530
been a bit deliberately working on the

00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:25,310
displays so that people can take it away

00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:28,150
and reflect on it and are things like is

00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:31,460
scalable and and automatable evaluate me

00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:33,730
as I see it just makes it much easier to

00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:36,530
get in points life and connect into

00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:39,020
various parts of your organization if

00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:43,030
that stuff is as simple and the barrier

00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:45,500
to uses as long as it possibly be from a

00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:47,930
realist perspective and for those that

00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:51,080
old from banking a fundamental part of

00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:53,480
it as the contact consent um actually

00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:56,030
there's lots of use cases through the

00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:57,770
bank where we want to use those api's

00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:59,780
and ask for containing in slightly

00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:02,030
different ways so for example if they're

00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:04,070
a bank customer and ask the room

00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:06,800
customers for consent tax and access

00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:07,910
their data when we you know have on

00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,590
board lead them and you know they've

00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:13,779
taken care with us

00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:16,159
seems a bit unusual somewhere for

00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:18,650
community to be centered around so we

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:22,250
have an API developer portal and Bankura

00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:25,279
DICOM somewhere where we allowed to fade

00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:26,510
that heat content into and his tangos on

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,549
we're looking to add more and more

00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:30,950
features to try and drive community and

00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:32,960
drive and developers both inside

00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:35,900
organization and I would say the

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:40,240
organisation there and really important

00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:42,710
I think is when you have an epi channel

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,750
when someone's are consuming your API

00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:47,390
and it's something that we spoke about

00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:50,179
when I was at UBS and as you've got to

00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:53,470
have the concept of wallet share sort of

00:26:50,179 --> 00:26:55,610
that consumer and can use one API

00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:56,870
actually make sure that you can see

00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:58,250
everything else you've built and make

00:26:56,870 --> 00:27:00,260
sure that it's possible for those people

00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:07,039
to to use those things and a simple and

00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:08,929
quick way and sort of say things kind of

00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,250
I guess better something that I said

00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:11,740
there and back in the day when I was at

00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:14,899
Morgan Stanley

00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:16,279
Jumma I tell you as an intern which is

00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:18,649
really around how you implement change

00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:21,320
and mass organizations and traders you

00:27:18,649 --> 00:27:22,850
can't wait for the machine to to catch

00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:26,360
up with you you've got to cut through

00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:29,059
some of the some of the organizational

00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:32,899
junk and you know five minutes elapsed

00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:34,130
on the phone as then you don't just and

00:27:32,899 --> 00:27:36,409
then infinitely valuing use if you're

00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:38,960
tight universities errors of emails and

00:27:36,409 --> 00:27:42,740
IMS and tickets et cetera it's not added

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,360
a quote but the the CIO back then I

00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:46,940
think he makes W to the actually John

00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:49,610
John sax and used to come and speak 10

00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:53,690
turns and speak to dr. your placements

00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:55,159
and grads and basically was the if you

00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:56,990
ever need to know something or you want

00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:58,909
to understand something bare then the

00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:01,539
default should be backup of fallen and

00:27:58,909 --> 00:28:01,539
speak to someone

00:28:02,269 --> 00:28:08,659
so in our we know we've really a sweet

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,399
spot I think and you know strapline

00:28:08,659 --> 00:28:13,190
years that innovation happens at the

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:16,059
speed of the ecosystem so we're no

00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:20,830
longer dependent on

00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:23,179
rbsp no monopoly of ideas or our skills

00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:24,769
ecosystem itself is building great

00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:26,359
propositions for our customers which

00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:28,849
we're really you know happy our

00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:29,979
customers can embrace and use make their

00:28:28,849 --> 00:28:32,719
life easier

00:28:29,979 --> 00:28:35,509
we don't fermented that across you know

00:28:32,719 --> 00:28:38,299
Leslie some of our brands here and just

00:28:35,509 --> 00:28:40,479
finally cherry picked a few of the third

00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:44,139
parties that are starting to really use

00:28:40,479 --> 00:28:47,539
open bank and hangar for various things

00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:49,389
could Anderson stats and for people in

00:28:47,539 --> 00:28:52,759
the room if you're wondering about

00:28:49,389 --> 00:28:55,459
Boston youth we we have a very sexy API

00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:58,489
is life pair blonde and we then top 10

00:28:55,459 --> 00:29:01,849
brands live football and the partisan

00:28:58,489 --> 00:29:03,499
and is marriage with metal and which

00:29:01,849 --> 00:29:05,829
totals you know hundreds of definitely

00:29:03,499 --> 00:29:09,169
important we take into account and

00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:11,539
variations and brands we've had almost a

00:29:09,169 --> 00:29:14,570
million customers use propositions that

00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:17,419
uses ap is a trans latest about 80

00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:19,129
million plus epi has a month but have a

00:29:17,419 --> 00:29:22,489
great relationship with the ecosystem

00:29:19,129 --> 00:29:24,950
and the TPP's regulate both and raises

00:29:22,489 --> 00:29:30,169
techies weathers to discuss problems

00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:32,119
feature requests Union about 120 third

00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:35,719
parties registered with that West group

00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:38,359
is all and building a variety of things

00:29:35,719 --> 00:29:43,029
for our customers and hasn't seen name

00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:43,029
name bands life and cost estate

00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:48,300
the last couple slides and we'll take

00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,300
some questions or tears up a few you

00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:54,720
want and one thing we learned early on

00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:57,150
was really to inspect what we expect so

00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,730
when we are building API is and we've

00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:02,610
done things like build our own and

00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:06,060
third-party resources on AWS and when we

00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:09,570
put stuff live and we always add that

00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:10,980
functionality to and you know we call

00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:13,350
our heartbeat and really try and test

00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:15,750
the stuff and production for real and

00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:17,400
people talk about you know dog fits I'm

00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:20,070
always praying that he'll be back weird

00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:23,790
cuz I don't know why easy dog fit weight

00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:25,380
friendly beer you don't watch

00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:28,590
the enemy test and use the things that

00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:31,020
you provide and we've also got plans to

00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:33,060
start doing things like sending a little

00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:36,720
fake lord and production and to try and

00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:40,380
and you know use the crystal ball to see

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,330
issues before we we have because you

00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,770
know when you interact with third

00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:46,860
parties and companies don't say you

00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:50,220
don't get on it's great to have some

00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:52,670
common ground to use and explore and and

00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,670
talk about

00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:57,860
finally you know where whether that

00:30:55,850 --> 00:31:01,520
where the T canals as an organization

00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:04,010
and I think put it into context in 2016

00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:06,559
we spent a large men that are you

00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:09,950
convincing people that we should spend

00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:11,779
on that's the work we spend an even

00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:14,570
larger amount of time doing the plumbing

00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:16,789
to to get the basic rate and by that I

00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:20,230
literally mean getting balanced these

00:31:16,789 --> 00:31:22,789
transactions codes that people have got

00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:24,649
we spend a fraction of the time on the

00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:28,880
actual cost man I do that we were trying

00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:31,279
to prove and and then because all the

00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,750
process created a lot of artifacts we

00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:35,960
spent a fair amount are you trying to

00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:38,299
ship those bespoke bet some pcs towards

00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:42,049
a production environment if you compare

00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:43,880
and contrast that to 2020 and you know

00:31:42,049 --> 00:31:45,500
we spend almost no time then they're

00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:48,950
convinced and plumbing park because it

00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:50,750
exists through the api's we get to spend

00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:52,909
an awful lot of time on a necessity on

00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:55,970
the customer ID and watch the value that

00:31:52,909 --> 00:31:58,330
we're trying to to realize and again

00:31:55,970 --> 00:32:01,760
because their stuff is production and

00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:04,070
production already it's live it's tested

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,779
et cetera actually in the ship and is

00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:09,020
really just the shipping of the customer

00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:14,390
idea and not everything that that shows

00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:16,549
area and that is pretty much a thing if

00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:19,940
the pebble water winter and my hope my

00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:22,460
guys region accent has and hasn't been

00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:24,440
too hard to keep pace with I'm sure and

00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:27,950
clearly or share the record and people

00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:30,440
can go back through and clear 50% speed

00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:32,600
and by whole people dressed in them and

00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:36,559
they picked up some useful things that

00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:37,159
may help them on their journey that was

00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,960
brilliant

00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:41,419
thank you so much Jonathan that was a

00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,100
really fascinating insight into the

00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:45,110
journey that you and the team have been

00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:47,000
on over the last few years and if they

00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:48,860
can if you can understand my Yorkshire

00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,149
drawl then they can understand your

00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:54,890
glory defects and I'm sure just a quick

00:32:53,149 --> 00:32:57,529
heads-up about a couple of webinars that

00:32:54,890 --> 00:33:00,380
are coming up from Scott logic and

00:32:57,529 --> 00:33:02,419
finish so there's one next week that you

00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,990
might be interested in there's mark

00:33:02,419 --> 00:33:05,389
Joe's

00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:07,000
technical principle at Scott logic doing

00:33:05,389 --> 00:33:08,890
a webinar on building

00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,780
top applications with open fin and

00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:14,200
there's a link on there if you want to

00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:16,240
register and then there's another one

00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,220
there that's coming up from from finish

00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,440
finished data hub in a enabling

00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:22,480
synthetic data generation in financial

00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,490
services so just give them a follow on

00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,830
LinkedIn for more notifications about

00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:29,500
those so I can see some questions coming

00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:30,970
in we've got about another 10 minutes so

00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:33,640
do get your questions in if you've got

00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:38,020
any fur for Johnny so let's have a look

00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:41,260
at what's coming so far so I've got one

00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:43,450
here saying hi Alex bunch from Scottish

00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:47,350
government here likely to start using

00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:49,960
the NatWest RBS API in the coming 12

00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:53,140
months you mentioned value for the brand

00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:54,940
/ bank how does the value you are hoping

00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:59,070
to get from corporate customers

00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:59,070
materialized through the API

00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:08,900
so so gifted a few and definite elements

00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:10,610
to that so the first is you know the one

00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,080
the one that allows you to I think we as

00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:14,870
a bank realized that we don't have a

00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:17,390
monopoly on on great ideas or great

00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:19,370
features it once though for customers so

00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:23,420
from a pure customer perspective you

00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:25,880
know we're delighted that other enemies

00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:27,820
of players in the market can can bring

00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:34,400
things to life for those customers

00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:37,220
equally you know as as customers use and

00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,660
the guys that we provide you know we

00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:41,870
want to deepen their relationship with

00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:44,270
the bank we want them to do um you know

00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:46,670
make more payments through us we want

00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:51,080
them to depend on us as our as a partner

00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:53,990
that they can they can they can really

00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:55,640
get what they want gone I mean the only

00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:59,360
way to do that is really to talk about

00:34:55,640 --> 00:35:02,240
that connectivity and not be shy and and

00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:04,930
doing that um you know going forward

00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:08,120
from a commercial perspective we do have

00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:09,890
ambitions and things in play where we're

00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:14,690
trying to work with and commercial

00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:18,050
partners and probate and API use that

00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:21,050
are over and above and some of the your

00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:23,510
banking ones a usual combined kanizsa

00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:25,300
command it is opposed to par today ie

00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:28,160
things that they would be well into

00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:30,590
Department on to add customer value and

00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:33,500
you know as part of that process we as a

00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:35,020
bank exploring how we can get value from

00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:37,660
that as well whether it be through

00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:40,940
selling selling more products the people

00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:45,670
are charging people for api's you know

00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:45,670
we're quite early in that that journey

00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:49,619
great stuff so another one for you here

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,990
what one thing would you have done

00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:54,829
differently of this if you were on this

00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:54,829
journey again

00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:03,520
you know why I really struggled to see

00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,840
how I'm gonna give you a really tough

00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:08,320
answer here but I would really struggle

00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:11,950
to do much definitely I've worked on

00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,400
some fairly intense projects Ammar my

00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:13,840
kid here

00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,670
and I'm sure there's a few people in the

00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:18,820
light know what fun things like Morgan

00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:22,120
Stanley matrix and UBS knew and and the

00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:25,360
links and we had a great time building

00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:27,610
this stuff and affiliates you know the

00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:30,580
old ball away in the office him after

00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:33,880
dark to get things over the way I was to

00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:35,970
change one thing

00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,970
and

00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:47,109
maybe to get further into the

00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:47,890
organization and bring people further

00:36:47,109 --> 00:36:49,540
along the journey

00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:51,369
I think his part the National

00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:54,579
implementation we were so mano focused

00:36:51,369 --> 00:36:56,290
on on meeting the dates one of the

00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:58,869
things that we we perhaps nest was

00:36:56,290 --> 00:37:00,609
actually when we get to the level enough

00:36:58,869 --> 00:37:02,589
stuff there's not a lot of value for

00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:05,200
propositions that the ecosystem are

00:37:02,589 --> 00:37:08,829
providing but there's massive value for

00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:11,470
the bank to build on this stuff and I

00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:13,390
think in and how you see actually even

00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:16,030
more propositions up and save the bank

00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:17,890
and with them allowing this to be three

00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:20,650
or six months in front of perhaps where

00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:22,810
we are now bar and as I say you know

00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:25,320
we've we've had a great bunch of

00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:27,880
engineers across the bank lien and

00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:31,530
helpers deliver lesson and so on so if

00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,530
y'all didn't we changed after the world

00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:34,460
right here's another one for you

00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:36,260
Jonathan

00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:38,570
so what was the biggest challenge you

00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:40,850
faced when integrating the bank's core

00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:46,040
banking systems with the externally

00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:49,950
exposed api's that's a good question so

00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:51,790
when there were a few few challenges or

00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:56,180
[Music]

00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:59,270
just array my few offer gets one was the

00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:04,550
way that the bank's core systems work as

00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:07,280
they are and highly tunes and people

00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:11,630
tend to understand the peaks and troughs

00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:15,290
of three years which allows people to to

00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:18,050
do capacity planning and actually when

00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:20,330
you look at the API market and you can

00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:22,940
do API usage with customer present or

00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:26,450
you can do API usage without customer

00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:28,460
present so trying to to help people in

00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:31,040
those those teams understand that we're

00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:32,930
moving from a mortal where as our mobile

00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,580
app but are in the banking platform on

00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:38,630
our banking platform that's when L for

00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:40,190
Denise he's ap ice to one where actually

00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:43,210
we don't really know who's going to be

00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:45,770
hitting these ap ice and what we do know

00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:48,020
will be not much when they do quite

00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:51,920
frankly you know we we aren't privy to

00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:53,750
what people build with the stuff and we

00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,190
do know who connectors and power from

00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:57,590
the users of stuff etcetera but we are

00:38:55,190 --> 00:39:00,110
in Grant Park proposition development

00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:03,200
and that was a really really difficult

00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:07,370
conversation just to bend spend people's

00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:10,340
headphones and click equally as I see

00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:14,530
and you know just been really candid we

00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:19,160
are big organization that has a lot of

00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:20,780
old mainframe tape systems and we've got

00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:24,560
a variety of ways that we connect them

00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:26,750
to those systems over the years and one

00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:31,610
thing that we had to really toss a coin

00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:33,410
on more than once was do we and push

00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:35,870
through ratite can connect to these

00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:38,360
systems using some yes key technology

00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:40,340
that we have in the bank and what would

00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:42,110
it be quicker to more than ecstasy

00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:43,900
ketamine flame to get some of this

00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:46,420
information think

00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:49,539
you know impressively we managed to stay

00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:51,039
true to what we wanted to do and resolve

00:39:49,539 --> 00:39:54,490
from technical there on that journey and

00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:57,690
equally I think we we made the idol the

00:39:54,490 --> 00:40:00,309
station in the room when really timer or

00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:02,049
team wasn't on her seat in order to do

00:40:00,309 --> 00:40:04,420
that to humility that we were thankful

00:40:02,049 --> 00:40:05,980
there in that space for him you know

00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:09,069
where I would always recover than that

00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:11,369
and trying to find ways to to draw down

00:40:09,069 --> 00:40:11,369
on him

00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:17,290
great here's another one for you are you

00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:19,660
totally using layer 7 for your ap eyes

00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:25,940
do you have any plan to use open source

00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:29,700
technologies like k-8 sto linkers etc

00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:32,970
yeah we've got mechs at the bank we use

00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:34,680
some see a layer of certain products and

00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:36,540
position them in the okay management

00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:40,170
platform to some extent where as I see

00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:43,859
well in the process of rolling out at

00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:46,410
Google Apogee and as part of our kind of

00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:49,680
micro services state in terms of you

00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:52,380
know kubernetes and sto et cetera what

00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,869
in the middle of moving to and some

00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:57,359
internal and hybrid cloud capability I

00:40:54,869 --> 00:41:02,119
feel at least and and cover to play

00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:05,490
foundry and spring boot et cetera

00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:09,030
so really the main focus is on moving to

00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:10,650
that and but I think you know as far

00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:11,970
that evolution will start to naturally

00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:14,750
look at some of those some of those

00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:17,700
technologies that have been mentioned

00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:19,710
great stuff so another one here what

00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:22,100
challenges have you faced doing it in

00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,100
the cloud

00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:30,780
and more organizational challenges that

00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:32,250
infant to pose with you mean again when

00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:35,910
the works in either a bank could have

00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:39,060
been corporate would recognize that you

00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:41,070
know closes are closed as I want that

00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:43,170
that strange different emotions and

00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:46,200
different people depending on what part

00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:49,440
of the bank you then you know those

00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:53,070
hesitancy in and reticence to use the

00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:55,110
stock and continue to depend on the

00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:56,880
status quo if you want and you know I

00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:59,670
think it's not too grating or just some

00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,500
great engineers to to push that status

00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:04,200
cool and and take people on a journey

00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:06,450
towards where we ultimately to be and I

00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:09,090
think you know we we would definitely

00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:13,010
recognize we want to be using both cloud

00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:13,010
and cloud like capability and

00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:21,569
yeah I mean

00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:24,809
it's just really about getting people on

00:42:21,569 --> 00:42:26,910
that journey wafers and and frankly not

00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:29,819
always using things that are weird

00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:34,039
they're really sharp bleeding-edge side

00:42:29,819 --> 00:42:37,079
of of the technology spectrum using and

00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:40,890
recognizing the and can something to be

00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:42,299
easier our organization to to you know

00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:45,930
pick the things that we know will both

00:42:42,299 --> 00:42:48,809
movers forward but also and we won't

00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:50,880
spend months or longer knowing that I

00:42:48,809 --> 00:42:53,730
just debates about whether or not the

00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,710
right thing to do faith in that sweet

00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:57,750
spot and and taking people on the

00:42:55,710 --> 00:43:01,260
journey towards or as friends that's

00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:05,069
important right I think we've got time

00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:07,440
for one more question so it's thanks for

00:43:05,069 --> 00:43:09,660
their fast and fantastic insights Johnny

00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,420
in terms of staying ahead of the curve

00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:14,309
and bringing teams on that journey how

00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:19,230
do you ensure everyone has the time and

00:43:14,309 --> 00:43:21,150
motivation to continually learn great

00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:25,500
question actually and then you know I

00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:28,349
mean RBS sorry not that we're Steven I'm

00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:32,339
still using old lingo and that waste as

00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:34,829
an organization has a few core core

00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:37,710
values and principles one of the things

00:43:34,829 --> 00:43:40,079
that our CEOs as introduced as the the

00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:43,440
concept of making sure that we are a

00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:45,900
learning organization and and one thing

00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,579
that comes through not not only just in

00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:49,920
technology about across the organization

00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:53,279
as a whole is the you know we expect

00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:56,789
people to to take time out of their days

00:43:53,279 --> 00:44:00,180
weeks once finally to come for things

00:43:56,789 --> 00:44:02,190
like this for example and to to gain

00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:05,369
some insight and you know we're actively

00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:07,259
appreciating ways to to move us closer

00:44:05,369 --> 00:44:09,630
toward being a learning learning

00:44:07,259 --> 00:44:16,079
organization one that reflects and one

00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:17,819
that place to be open and and and be

00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,210
open to new concepts eating noises et

00:44:17,819 --> 00:44:20,670
cetera

00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:23,009
and so it's really that's a culture

00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:25,079
thing you know it's I'm sure some of my

00:44:23,009 --> 00:44:27,019
team will be on this call and I can't

00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:31,650
stress enough the

00:44:27,019 --> 00:44:32,220
I will give them the right air cover for

00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:34,140
them to take

00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:36,599
a move of the Lebanon Puritan cloud

00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:39,090
comes to to learn a new skill to going

00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:40,980
up the wall of course I'm going to do

00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:43,109
that on a when i frank the regular basis

00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:45,690
and embed that into there but all

00:44:43,109 --> 00:44:48,920
routines and start to me cabot saloons

00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:48,920
around learning new things

00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:54,710
thanks for that and a we're bang on time

00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:56,780
to finish it so all that's left for me

00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:59,240
to say is thank you so much for that

00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:00,980
Johnathan really appreciate it we got

00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:04,040
there in the end even though we're three

00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:08,350
months beyond the originally scheduled

00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:08,350
date for this so much appreciated

00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,520
the beer and Peter I know that's what

00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:15,560
we're missing isn't it we definitely owe

00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:18,410
you one so and thank you to everybody

00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:22,870
for joining us and we hope we see you on

00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:22,870
