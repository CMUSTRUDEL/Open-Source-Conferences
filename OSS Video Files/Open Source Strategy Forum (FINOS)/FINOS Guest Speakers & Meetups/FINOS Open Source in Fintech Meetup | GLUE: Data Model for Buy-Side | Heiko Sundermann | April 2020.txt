you now if that's okay thanks for the

00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:01,170
introduction James yes so upon blue

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,670
developing the unified data model for

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,130
the buy-side that's the topic today so

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,890
let me start with the following just

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,929
good practices to introduce ourselves I

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,650
think I personally was introduced nicely

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:15,870
by James maybe just one thing to me I'm

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,569
I joined a pan tuna half years ago after

00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:21,629
having spent most of my life at buy-side

00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:25,709
firms the likes of EBS and Deutsche Bank

00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:27,420
and now I'm heading our hacen wealth

00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:29,730
management value proposition for them

00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:34,290
for everybody that doesn't know young

00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:36,209
and the company that not a lot of people

00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:40,049
have heard for if you're not in the

00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:44,989
industry really it is where we were

00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:48,690
founded 1993 we're quite large so we are

00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:52,010
now hitting over 30,000 engineers

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:55,709
designers consultants and we're totaling

00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:58,739
35,000 employees worldwide we've have a

00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:01,560
nice growth story behind us we've been

00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:07,530
growing 35 I think it's 36 consecutive

00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:09,530
quarters now by more than 20% let's see

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:13,639
whether we can make it the next quarter

00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:16,439
since covetous as is also hitting us but

00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:20,669
so far fingers crossed so it went well

00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:22,829
and maybe before I do lots of marketing

00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:25,260
around EPM and just one thing so

00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:28,199
financial service it's really our our

00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,060
strong point in focus area 23% of our

00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:32,549
revenues come from financial services

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:35,489
and within financial services I think

00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:37,980
it's fair to say that acid and wealth

00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:41,190
management is the strongest the

00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:44,879
strongest stuff vertical and maybe also

00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:47,699
the most mature vertical of ours in

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:51,260
terms of assets IP and thought

00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:51,260
leadership that we have invested in

00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:55,740
giving the content

00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,760
stephannie so EEPROM traditionally

00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:01,050
always was a very very active

00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:05,030
contributor to open source frameworks

00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:08,550
over of the Linux Foundation we

00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:11,250
traditionally contributed a lot to the

00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:14,460
traditional tech open source frameworks

00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:18,020
out there we're very proud that we are

00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:20,940
at ranked number 14 if you look at it up

00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:23,490
in terms of contributor to open source

00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:27,090
and that is and with that we're probably

00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:29,520
the only services company up there with

00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:32,910
likes of Google Red Hat IBM and that's

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:36,510
because of the usual suspects now I

00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:39,480
think that is the lead over on to us and

00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:44,670
wealth management and to our wave

00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:45,900
platform so before I start let me let me

00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,970
give you a little bit of business

00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,280
background on what is wave and what is

00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:54,930
glue and what is view in the context of

00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:56,370
wave so wave is our response to an

00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,550
industry challenge that we're seeing

00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:04,410
across the board on buy-side firms which

00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:06,180
is mainly driven by digitalization

00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,520
requirements because the buy-side firms

00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,350
believe that they need to catch up in

00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,900
the digital space and I think that's

00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:15,690
rightfully rightfully so I think we saw

00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:17,850
under investments in the space still

00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:22,170
even after seven years in the

00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:24,150
digitalization story we I said firms are

00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:27,780
struggling with regulation that's also

00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:30,410
nothing new but the but the key

00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:33,510
challenge that we're seeing currently is

00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:41,160
driven by both ends regulation and and

00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:43,350
changing client needs which to market

00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,720
their fee base and wildly models so the

00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:47,040
industry is moving away from

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,500
transactional models into fee based

00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,780
advising models and obviously it's

00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,510
difficult to to sell the story to the

00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:56,100
client please just give me a percentage

00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:59,070
of you put four of your money that I'm

00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,570
managing without actually demonstrating

00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:02,550
a true value that you that you're

00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:04,260
bringing to them and one of the these

00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:06,090
values that we've seen and one of the

00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,759
client demands that is most important

00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,219
there

00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:11,949
is that Klein's really demand tailored

00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:13,449
investment services and what we mean

00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:15,520
with that is tailored investment

00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:18,120
services is not your freedom to choose

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,770
an asset allocation or a model portfolio

00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,770
and then maybe add a whitelist

00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:26,520
restriction or a blacklist restriction

00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:29,919
the clients really demand transparent

00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,629
tailored strategy or transparent

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,539
management of their tailored strategy

00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:36,330
and the tailored strategy involves a

00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:41,770
free selected point on the risk return

00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:43,809
profile of the portfolio and obviously a

00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:46,330
freely freely selectable asset

00:06:43,809 --> 00:06:48,219
allocation model typical client

00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:51,819
restrictions in terms of black lists and

00:06:48,219 --> 00:06:54,069
buy lists issue a concentration or issue

00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:58,330
of restrictions and so on and so on and

00:06:54,069 --> 00:07:01,180
even more kinds are whilst their value

00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:03,520
the input of the CIO of the bicyclic

00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:06,490
firms so the chief investment officer

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,990
they do come with their own capital

00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:10,629
market assumptions and that's another

00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:13,930
thing how can we enable clients to

00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:15,819
actually bring in their biases and and

00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:17,709
still have a consistent process to

00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:20,610
manage their portfolio according to the

00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:22,930
strategy agreed on

00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:24,790
if that is the business challenge

00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:26,650
different the next question is well how

00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:29,050
do I do this effectively how do can I

00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:31,270
scale this right so line leaders

00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,460
understood that's clear they want these

00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:35,880
tailored services but how can i as a

00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:39,310
eyesight firm effectively manage

00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:41,980
potentially millions of portfolios with

00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:45,060
an own with an specific strategy behind

00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:47,770
every portfolio obviously it's not and

00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:50,290
it's not a response to this challenge to

00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:52,090
pair the client advisor / client

00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:56,020
portfolio because that is obviously a

00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:58,270
not a scalable business model we what

00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:00,130
we've been seeing working with the big

00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:04,110
asset and wealth managers of this world

00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:07,240
is unlike the UBS's credits versus

00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:10,840
Vanguard's fidelity's and so on we see

00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:13,930
that these guys are actually they want

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,370
to move to a more industrialized way of

00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:17,380
managing the portfolio and how a

00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:20,640
philosophy to the industrialization

00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:23,170
there is these companies need to embrace

00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:26,500
portfolio risk space advisory approaches

00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:28,630
and that is the underlying the

00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:32,320
underlying philosophy behind the

00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:34,780
platform that we built upon wave we saw

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,880
we saw the the efforts and the amounts

00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,800
of investment needed that our clients to

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,390
actually get to a complete front aback

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,510
industrialized process based on

00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:47,170
portfolio risk calculations and we saw

00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:48,910
that these investments easily added up

00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:52,140
to double-digit if not three-digit

00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:55,930
million million investment levels and

00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:58,540
our conviction was that obviously these

00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:01,510
kinds of investment levels can't be put

00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:04,480
to the table from tier 23 asset managers

00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:06,820
or wealth managers and wave is the

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,430
solution for for this line segment to

00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:12,900
bring them up to speed quickly and what

00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:15,730
we built there is quite a few components

00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:17,500
spanning the CIM the entire investment

00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:20,230
management value chain and what you see

00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:22,750
here is our business the architecture

00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:24,580
model for the industry and the color

00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:27,070
coding actually that you see here is

00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:30,370
everything that has this like green

00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:33,279
shading behind our individual business

00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:38,470
modules that epon has invested in or

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:40,180
partnered with FinTech companies that

00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:43,899
are part of the current state of the

00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:46,180
ecosystem so each of these business

00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:48,610
capabilities is exposing them their

00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:52,329
value or their capabilities via a nice

00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:53,889
very nice API and as you as you are all

00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:55,809
coming from the industry you're aware

00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:58,959
that that's another big push in the

00:09:55,809 --> 00:10:01,360
industry as face moving to more flexible

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:04,240
or back-end architectures or enterprise

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,029
architectures and API and the API

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,559
architecture is very is a hot topic with

00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:11,410
with many of the firm's that we're

00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:13,329
seeing now the the problem that comes

00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:15,279
with this and now finally I'm leading

00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:17,740
over to to the key topic of this

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:20,920
presentation the problem that comes with

00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:24,670
this while API architectures are good

00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:26,290
and and definitely the right response it

00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:28,180
doesn't mean that it really brings down

00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:30,720
your investment levels or the the

00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:34,480
efforts for integrating various modules

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,860
we saw with our clients that many of

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,290
them are adopting best-of-breed

00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:43,540
approaches and thinking that they can

00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:47,800
they can scan the marketing in the

00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:49,959
context and then just stitch together a

00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,790
value chain proposal as you see it here

00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:54,189
from the from the business capability

00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:56,199
side by leveraging all these individual

00:10:54,189 --> 00:10:59,379
modules because hey most of them have

00:10:56,199 --> 00:11:00,939
built architectures based on api's but

00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:03,129
that's that's only part of the story

00:11:00,939 --> 00:11:06,069
right the integration cost remain in

00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:08,470
many cases because I'm often referring

00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:11,649
to it one API towards Chinese the other

00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:13,389
one talks Italian and then you still

00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:14,829
need an integration layer to actually

00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:18,069
make them talk to each other in the

00:11:14,829 --> 00:11:19,870
right language and at that time so we

00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:21,939
have the same challenge when we built

00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:25,420
this when we build this ecosystem of

00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:26,980
components and we soon realized

00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,790
especially when we wanted to partner

00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,910
with fintechs

00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:33,540
that we need is that we need to come to

00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:35,649
a common agreement of a of a common

00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:38,410
semantic layer that's for the backbone

00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:42,730
and this common semantic layer is what

00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:46,000
we call upon bloom glue actually is it's

00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:48,040
it's a it's a data integration layer

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,800
it's a couple of things right number one

00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:53,140
it is it is this common semantic layer

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,580
so it's a common conceptual entity model

00:11:53,140 --> 00:12:00,250
for the by site for the buy-side firms

00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:03,450
it is we actually implemented this

00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:06,550
conceptual entity model in a

00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:10,510
transactional entity relationship model

00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:14,670
and we then we have concrete examples or

00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:14,670
behalf concrete implementations with

00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:20,230
transactional entity relationship models

00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:24,910
below and on top of that we have various

00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:27,880
analytical modules where we at epa used

00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:30,640
apache ignite that's obviously really

00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:33,460
technology agnostic on that layer but

00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:35,500
the whole purpose was we saw these

00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:38,980
requirements in those digitalization

00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:42,070
initiatives and we saw the amount of

00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:44,530
effort going in there and then some of

00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:47,650
these initiatives while they're provided

00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:50,620
the the business value via their API so

00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:52,900
they didn't really were they didn't

00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,940
we're adhering to the performance

00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,800
requirements that you would see the

00:12:54,940 --> 00:13:01,740
clients are expecting when they're using

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:04,510
self-service self-service analytics or

00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:06,820
self-service stress testing and some of

00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:08,890
their portfolios so that was a nother

00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:11,890
focus apart from building this common

00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:14,440
semantic layer the other focus is how

00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:16,750
can we how can we build this or

00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:20,320
implement this so that it really adheres

00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:21,730
to this to these weak performance

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,670
requirements that we're seeing and that

00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:28,750
means we need to be able to calculate

00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:31,570
risk or your performance in such seconds

00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:33,100
rather than 10 minutes as it currently

00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:37,690
takes with many of the core banking

00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:39,220
systems so what we but when we looked at

00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:42,040
when we looked at this entity model

00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:45,400
obviously we were covering them we're

00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:48,370
covering the the key entities that we

00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:51,400
needed for our for for our purposes for

00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:54,320
our to support our business capabilities

00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:58,200
that I and I showed you earlier

00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:02,750
what we when we thought about let's

00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:05,940
let's move our open source DNA also to

00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:09,030
those domain solutions like wave before

00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:11,550
what would make sense to to add as a

00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:14,370
first contribution we've been reaching

00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:16,410
out to finish and ask them is within

00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:21,060
also with the community be interested in

00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:23,160
in a buy side project or in a project

00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,200
for the buy side and and the first

00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,030
logical component that we were trying to

00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,470
open source or that way that we want to

00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:31,680
test with the community whether that

00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:37,800
makes sense is to contribute a Pam Lu a

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:39,660
zone as a model and and maybe hopefully

00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,330
with the help of the community extended

00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:45,260
further covering more entities that mean

00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:45,260
than we currently do

00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:50,310
the generic concepts that we that

00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,020
obviously you need to model that you

00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:54,570
need to bring in apart from the actual

00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:58,020
business business rationale are the

00:14:54,570 --> 00:15:00,330
business concepts you need to in the

00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:02,640
buy-side firms you need to uncover a

00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:06,350
couple of other other bits like in a non

00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:08,790
functional area for example PII absorb

00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:13,200
data secrecy and personal information

00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:15,000
secrecy is is a core topic where we in

00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,010
where we thought about various

00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,990
approaches to how can we really ensure

00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:21,060
this you need to understand that our

00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:24,840
clients are often the offshore private

00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:27,410
banks as well so about data privacy and

00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:30,480
data secrecy is a hot topic there and

00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:32,970
obviously these these GDP are related

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,580
topics and PII regulation topics are

00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:38,820
deeply in built into the 1 million when

00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:42,150
we actually started modeling the epen

00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:44,910
blue data model other topics I mean that

00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:47,820
is really generic one language support I

00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:49,800
think that comes that is honestly I mean

00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:53,880
also 9 language support what's modeled

00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:54,960
in from the beginning this one makes

00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,150
this one is a little bit more

00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:00,440
interesting that is like when we've been

00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:03,600
working with the various buy-side firms

00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:05,400
one thing that is a key driver behind

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,490
our investment management philosophy is

00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:10,440
obviously how their CIO models his

00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:12,300
capital market assumptions and how he

00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,130
brings that across to the to the

00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:17,460
portfolio management side of things and

00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:19,590
that's results in that we need to deal

00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:22,680
with multiple asset classification

00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:24,780
models and and we saw that this

00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,640
flexibility is needed so we with our

00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:28,740
response to that is what we call

00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,600
hierarchical object breakdown structures

00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:35,220
which is actually bringing the

00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:37,560
flexibility onto to at the runtime and

00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:42,510
new classifications to your instrument

00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:46,950
data and or or app new classifications

00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:51,030
like ESG in ESP investment topics to

00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:52,560
your in investment universe and and with

00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:54,060
these hierarchical object breakdown

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,920
structures we actually really very

00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:58,390
flexible in terms of how to model that

00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:01,000
it could be we actually cook

00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:03,820
open on how many hierarchy levels you

00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,319
want to employ and also how broad the

00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:10,170
hierarchy then really is

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:12,060
so there and I'm hoping by the way I'm

00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:14,040
rushing through this I'm James I'm

00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,930
hoping that if there are questions

00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,390
coming from the community please route

00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:23,160
them directly to me otherwise I'll

00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:25,230
rattle through and alkenes so thank you

00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,520
very much for inviting questions from

00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:28,410
the community say yeah

00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,690
while stone Heiko actually mentions that

00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:33,210
if people do have questions feel free to

00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:35,820
put them into the chat and then I can

00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:38,100
relay them on during the Q&A and also

00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:39,870
height in the bottom right I'm not sure

00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,490
whether you've got a notification is

00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:44,820
showing on your screen but we've got um

00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:47,750
a great box there we go fixed

00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:51,750
thank you very much I just killed it

00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:53,610
thank you that's perfect so obviously in

00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:56,040
this in this brief session right we

00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:58,050
can't go over all the details of the

00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:00,180
model I think what we are what we really

00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:03,120
want to get from the community is number

00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:05,550
one we are aware that FEMA so far was

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,970
very strong on the on the sell side so

00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:12,420
we saw many projects related to trading

00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:15,690
platforms instrument data management and

00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:18,300
the likes what we have with this

00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:20,700
presentation and giving you this is

00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:23,070
wider overview of what wave is we really

00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:25,530
wanted to test the appetite of the

00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:27,480
community to see whether whether it

00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:31,260
really makes sense to place a buy side

00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:33,630
project on the origin promoted by side

00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:36,300
project by Athena's while they are very

00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:38,070
very happily open sourcing and we we

00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:40,560
truly want to want to get the feedback

00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:42,540
from the community obviously we don't

00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,110
want to to run the projects all by

00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,390
ourselves

00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:47,010
we're really hoping for active community

00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:50,040
involvement and nothing for us that is

00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:52,350
the key purpose of this presentation to

00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:56,960
test the appetite of the community to to

00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:59,610
run by side projects a little bit

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,560
high-level overview about the the main

00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:04,950
the key domain objects that we're

00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:07,890
dealing with and for supporting this

00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:10,200
value chain that I showed earlier and

00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:11,490
this is obviously it's actually more

00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,500
than a hundred thousand feeds

00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:15,590
perspective and it's just giving you a

00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,280
very very very high level entity

00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:20,130
overview

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:23,280
and that is obviously covering the whole

00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:25,550
business partners section if you're

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,350
working at my site forums you probably

00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:30,120
that's a hot topic like with many of our

00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:33,510
clients many of our clients are now

00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:36,600
trying to move away from from portfolio

00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:38,760
centric to Papa centric approaches our

00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,550
model is actually a very partner centric

00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,980
one and I'll do to that in the next

00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:47,100
slide on what we actually mean with plan

00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:48,360
eccentric the whole portfolio construct

00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,430
is obviously in there financial

00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:53,970
accounting with all the complexities

00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:55,620
that come with this one instrument data

00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:57,960
management as I mentioned is an

00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:00,120
important one because it is the driver

00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,160
of how to manage your investment

00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,780
universe how they how the see il is

00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,300
actually transporting this capital

00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,740
market assumptions used and we need to

00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,960
have the flexibility in there to

00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:12,270
actually and provide a standard model

00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:15,660
that with this flex fell enough to to

00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:18,530
cover the various real-life industry

00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:21,900
models that we're seeing them and then

00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:25,410
another strong point and another thing

00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:27,000
which is of probably extremely important

00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:30,320
in the whole concert so a concept of

00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,460
wave as our approach to how to model

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,070
investment policy statements or the

00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:39,780
actual investment strategy and how to

00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:42,480
run the how to detect tracking errors of

00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:45,780
a portfolio that is drifting and alert

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,030
the advisor and the client about about

00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:50,160
those drifts and this is not only

00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:53,910
portfolio drifts in terms of risk return

00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:57,210
profile that is also drifts that would

00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:59,100
lead to breaking some of the other

00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:02,280
investment policies that the client and

00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:04,920
that mosaic read on heed and issue a

00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:08,280
concentration policy period currency

00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:10,680
concentration overview policy either

00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,240
whitelist be the blacklist and and many

00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:15,990
other rules and we have a very flexible

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:19,050
affects of model to a rules to the

00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:20,540
existing and to the existing rule

00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:24,450
domains that we're having but also

00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:27,680
allowing companies to add completely new

00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,680
rules that we haven't thought about

00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:35,660
business partner model so as I mentioned

00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:38,720
business partner especially for wealth

00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:40,550
managers is is a beast in its own right

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,960
because the relationships that we

00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:46,690
typically see the types of relationships

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,520
that we're seeing in the industry are

00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:51,170
enormously complex and if you're working

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,600
on the wealth management side I don't

00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:55,070
need to educate you there and but if

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,650
you're coming from asset management then

00:21:55,070 --> 00:22:01,370
you're probably not as not as if not as

00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:05,470
familiar with this but the complexity of

00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:07,760
the relationships which is also driving

00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:12,170
regulatory requirements and regular

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:15,320
regulatory rules is is enormous and I

00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:16,940
think we've been tackling many of these

00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,640
problems we saw them in real life

00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:22,130
we actually distilled the it is dilled

00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:25,460
all of all our learnings into how to

00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:27,170
best model this dispersal model we also

00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:30,470
have tested that with various core

00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:32,030
banking providers and not only whether

00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:34,070
that's whether they they can live with

00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:36,020
this model but also how to extract data

00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:38,390
from the metro system and core banking's

00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:40,490
into our model so we do have standard

00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:43,250
connectors also as part of wave that

00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:45,830
would get this data out into the into

00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:47,750
our person model the types of

00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:49,640
relationships that we need to manage and

00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:52,130
just to give you a quick real live over

00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,840
here I mean obviously legal entities

00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:56,290
such as single person relationships

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:59,780
that's a non brainer no-brainer

00:22:56,290 --> 00:23:01,990
it really gets quickly complicated if

00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:06,890
you have complex trust relationships

00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:09,050
multi person relationships and how to

00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:12,050
manage them and also how to manage the

00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:14,030
bank response to them so who's who's in

00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:17,540
contact with which part of this partner

00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:20,360
structure from the bank's side and you

00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:23,450
can who's allowed to see what and from

00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:26,200
the regulatory perspective how can we

00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:26,200
test for example

00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:32,670
personal risks by exposure to certain

00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:35,070
come to country companies or being

00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:36,750
indirectly exposed to a politically

00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:40,370
exposed person by being in the same

00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:40,370
company and so on and so on

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,940
strategy and maybe and I know as I said

00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:48,770
right conscience of time I would love to

00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:50,630
deep dive into these topics but I

00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:53,710
actually want to drive out I'm from this

00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:57,230
is test interests as I mentioned but

00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:59,600
choose two final sentences on strategy

00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:01,190
because that is the base of our

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,550
investment philosophy that we are

00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:06,890
employing in wave typically what you see

00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:09,050
out there are and that is true for many

00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:11,180
many asset managers wealth managers or

00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:13,700
even Robo advisors out there most of

00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:17,090
them define a strategy as an asset

00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:18,800
allocation and their asset allocation

00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:21,080
being at the center of the strategy

00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:24,740
definition of how to manage a portfolio

00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:27,560
for the clients I think we're clearly

00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:29,930
moving away from this in wave we

00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:32,180
actually try to introduce a completely a

00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:35,210
much more modern as in our thinking way

00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:36,680
to defining investment strategies and

00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:39,200
with it together with the client and

00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:41,420
that is now our thinking and investment

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:46,690
strategy is mainly risk return profile

00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:51,770
of the portfolio and an asset allocation

00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:53,570
is really the derivative of this of this

00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:55,430
risk return profile that the client has

00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:59,450
selected and this risk return profile

00:24:55,430 --> 00:25:01,700
might even might even take two into

00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:03,110
account as I mentioned earlier client

00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:06,290
specifically capital market assumptions

00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:07,940
so in our models and asset allocations

00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:11,240
really just nothing else but another

00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:15,200
restriction you can give the model takes

00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:17,570
in as allocation bandwidth on asset

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,780
class level and but for us it's really

00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:25,250
nothing else than for example in stem

00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:28,310
situation area or or currency currency

00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:31,220
exposure area that remodel as

00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:36,090
restrictions in nowadays

00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:37,710
so to wrap up so we're we're obviously

00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:39,360
passionate around what we're doing we're

00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:41,310
really believing that with wave we're

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,500
bringing in a couple of truly

00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:46,560
groundbreaking new capabilities to our

00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:48,660
clients we marketing them as software

00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,010
accelerator so we're not taking licenses

00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:52,790
and we're we're actually planning to

00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:56,190
open source quite some of them in future

00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:59,070
as a starting point we really looked at

00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:01,110
let's really bring their foundation to

00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:03,840
the community which is this common

00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:06,030
entity model because we see that this is

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,400
one of the bits where companies are

00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:10,470
currently struggling because it forms

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,480
the basis of their digitalization or

00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:14,559
platform auditing and modernization

00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,389
strategies

00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:19,070
with this I think I would like to I

00:26:17,389 --> 00:26:22,759
would like to open it up to any

00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:24,440
questions or ideas or feedback in terms

00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:29,539
of whether that's interesting from the

00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:32,929
community at all please please be open

00:26:29,539 --> 00:26:35,899
and I'm here for questions absolutely

00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:37,999
thank you very much hi Kay so we don't

00:26:35,899 --> 00:26:40,419
have anything directly in the chat which

00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:43,489
means that I'm more than happy to invite

00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:56,749
anybody to come off meat and maybe ask

00:26:43,489 --> 00:26:57,979
the question directly yes hi this is

00:26:56,749 --> 00:27:00,460
Tasha Olson from finis

00:26:57,979 --> 00:27:02,929
thank you there was a great presentation

00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:07,330
really interesting I was just wondering

00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:10,429
is is this largely is the idea that the

00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:12,729
buy-side uses this internally for their

00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:16,879
their modeling in their paul or in their

00:27:12,729 --> 00:27:20,419
processes or can it also be used to pass

00:27:16,879 --> 00:27:22,509
information between asset managers and

00:27:20,419 --> 00:27:25,070
their clients or between asset managers

00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:29,599
themselves for example you know passing

00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:31,429
a portfolio it's really interesting that

00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:33,950
they mentioned this because funnily I

00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:35,570
just as part of this famous presentation

00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:38,119
actually it already gave us a leech and

00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:40,580
I had a conversation with with a CEO of

00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:42,429
an asset manager in a pack today and he

00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:48,440
asked me more or less the same question

00:27:42,429 --> 00:27:50,869
so obviously yes we would love to

00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:53,029
obviously we would love to be waived to

00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:54,889
be the industry standards right and that

00:27:53,029 --> 00:28:00,019
the industry standards would then also

00:27:54,889 --> 00:28:03,469
fuel cross company communication and so

00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:05,119
on it's a little bit we're not

00:28:03,469 --> 00:28:07,099
power-monger enough I think that needs

00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:09,499
to be decided by the industry itself or

00:28:07,099 --> 00:28:11,570
by biphenyls maybe Pinos can help to

00:28:09,499 --> 00:28:13,759
actually drive the standardization bit

00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:18,440
but yes it is it would actually help a

00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:20,570
lot in an API strategies and an API

00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:23,419
monetization strategies for the industry

00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:26,419
what we're seeing is really many of our

00:28:23,419 --> 00:28:27,720
clients are not only trying to employ

00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:29,850
new architectures to

00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,490
to be more flexible and do rapid

00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:33,750
application development on the end but

00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:35,879
they're really looking at when we're

00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:38,879
building business capabilities and

00:28:35,879 --> 00:28:40,320
exposing them as API these API eyes are

00:28:38,879 --> 00:28:43,139
not only driving their internal

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:47,250
processes and internal gooeys but they

00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:51,570
want to open that or for b2b scenarios

00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:54,210
and offer their services directly to

00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:55,710
other asset managers or to use them as

00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:58,080
communication as a means of

00:28:55,710 --> 00:29:00,720
communication for example passing human

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:04,399
passing at dimensions passing portfolios

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:11,850
back and forth between asset managers

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:14,759
thank you very much for that Tasha so

00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:16,799
we've got a couple of minutes left which

00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:18,779
means that we can make me take one or

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:21,029
two more questions

00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:24,049
so only mine the heiko has given the

00:29:21,029 --> 00:29:27,419
presentation to understand the wider

00:29:24,049 --> 00:29:31,169
open-source appetite for EPM to

00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:32,759
contribute glue to open source so if

00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:36,870
there's any feedback you know from

00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:39,240
people who are attending today regarding

00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:42,090
you know the value of heap and glue and

00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:48,570
bring feel free to if your feedback on

00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:50,370
this cool James if they want to get in

00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:51,659
touch offline what's the best way to do

00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:59,820
that do we want to put an email address

00:29:51,659 --> 00:30:01,620
or absolutely so there are a couple of

00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:03,960
ways in which we can get in contact with

00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:08,100
people so you I can give my email

00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:09,990
addressing chat averin will also say

00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:12,899
errand or gristle and finis will also be

00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:14,940
putting hi Kay's presentation on

00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:17,639
LinkedIn and so maybe you can ask your

00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:20,159
question in the comments on LinkedIn and

00:30:17,639 --> 00:30:21,990
then also after the presentation I can

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,210
get in contact with you if you want to

00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:27,809
you know get in contact in some other

00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:30,389
way we do have your details and if I may

00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:32,759
add right I mean obviously talking about

00:30:30,389 --> 00:30:35,820
data and entity models is a pretty dry

00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:38,040
topic and so if there's appetite in this

00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:41,070
in general about

00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:43,620
investment management ecosystems and as

00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:45,930
I said Lewis just the basis for this

00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:48,240
ecosystem that reveal that upon if

00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:49,740
there's interest in other examples there

00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,390
and if there's interfere if their

00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:54,360
community believes that makes sense to

00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:57,150
open source other of our modules very

00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:59,400
happy to you to give actually more

00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:01,410
likely demos of running software with

00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,540
Greece and and more talking about the

00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:06,510
business concepts behind it so please

00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:09,990
feel free to reach out I'm happy to take

00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:12,090
questions offline and again reiterating

00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:14,970
what we're really interested in is their

00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:17,040
appetite is there are there we believe

00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:18,420
it would be great to have a an open

00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:21,120
source projects around this but

00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:23,190
obviously must be we need to really

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:29,520
engage the wider community and you need

00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:32,280
