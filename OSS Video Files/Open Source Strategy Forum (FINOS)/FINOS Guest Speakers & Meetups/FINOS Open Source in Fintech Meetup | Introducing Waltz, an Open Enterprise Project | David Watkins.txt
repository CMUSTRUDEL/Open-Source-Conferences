00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,640
the history of waltz what waltzer is

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,120
what walt is uh the uses that we've we

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,360
we've found for it in deutsche bank and

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,280
elsewhere and then we'll also be talking

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,120
a little bit about how to get involved

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,319
how to get started with waltz

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,640
how to make contributions etc

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,000
so without further ado let's talk uh

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,440
just introduce the team a little bit

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,640
more so uh mark do you want to quickly

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,879
pop off mute and

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,560
say a few words about yourself and

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,599
anything you've worked on that you

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,280
particularly want to highlight

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,720
yeah thank you david uh my name is mike

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,319
rurio uh lead functional

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,080
business analyst on the underwater

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,680
program within uh within deutsche bank

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,760
based in singapore

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,159
um i guess i've been in the team for

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,080
four years and had a variety of roles

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,000
across the financial services

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,360
from a walter perspective i think the

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,239
piece i'm pretty much proud of has been

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,360
working on the

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,120
application release controls and really

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,040
uh putting some teeth behind some of

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,840
these the data completeness

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,200
and data cores that we have within the

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,200
application

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,280
okay okay cam thank you mark uh so i'm

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,599
cameron saleem i'm i'm a developer i've

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,640
been

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:45,680
for around 12 years focusing on ui

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,080
and back-end development um

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,519
so my passion is in ui development and

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,920
completely proud of

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,080
the world's visualizations that display

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,560
data and and make it easy to consume

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,400
my recent work has been developing the

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,840
open source software component build out

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,840
involves and visualizing

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,200
software usage and dependencies and also

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,560
vulnerabilities in goals

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,200
okay i'm dave uh i'm a solutions

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,200
architect

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,320
at deutsche bank and i started the

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,959
project a few years ago

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,959
on jessica

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,800
hi i'm jeff i'm a junior developer on

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,520
the waltz team i

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,120
joined deutsche bank back in july 2018

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,360
and i've been a member

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,960
since march last year uh one of the

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,360
things i'm most proud of

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,639
is the favorites uh feature that we've

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,639
recently worked on

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,199
and customizing the home page to make it

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,199
more personal

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:46,160
okay thanks everyone um so

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,440
quick background uh waltz uh we can kind

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,720
of classify it as an enterprise

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,160
information system

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,919
it's not really an enterprise

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,360
architecture system uh when you

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,040
talk about enterprise architecture

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,960
people are thinking you know big

00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,400
diagrams uml diagrams whatever

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,240
thinking about frameworks such as togaf

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,160
uh waltz is more about trying to bring

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,240
in disparate sources of data

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,360
and should combine those and present a

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,720
view of

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,639
what we tend to be called like the

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,039
technology landscape within an

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,400
organization uh you'll see that in a

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,600
minute when we go into the demos and

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,560
talk a little bit more about the feature

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,560
set

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,720
it's about six years old it started as a

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,919
pure open source project so before i

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,639
joined the bank

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,680
it was started as an open source project

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,240
um

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,919
so it's uh always it's open source

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,400
through and through

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,199
uh throughout its life cycle or through

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,400
the jump

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,639
through most of those six years it's had

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,080
active development typically around

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,280
three to four devs and one

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,479
one or two business analysts so if you

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,639
look at the github

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,720
stats uh you'll see that it's been

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,000
pretty much consistently worked on

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,800
for those six years uh one of the things

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,600
that we're very

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,840
excited about is uh earlier in the year

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,120
we started transitioning to finos

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,759
uh so we went into one of their

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,120
incubating projects and we've recently

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,280
through the help of james and others in

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,039
the finals team sort of graduated into a

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,360
fully activated project which we're very

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:12,639
excited about

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:16,080
um deutsche bank is obviously a main

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,720
consumer main user of waltz however we

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,960
are seeing

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,000
interest and there's act and there's

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,319
usage in other

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,039
areas and our network markets have come

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,720
out and

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,720
uh they're publicly supporting it been

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,639
publicly doing commits

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,360
uh and there's other institutions which

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,080
are beginning to uh to evaluate waltz

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,520
um hopefully as we've transitioned waltz

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,960
to finnos and

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,360
people can see the commitment that

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,360
deutsche bank is making to to waltz

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:47,520
uh then this will help garner further

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:50,639
attention uh in using waltz

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:53,919
okay so where does walt's fit in

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,000
um basically walt is a kind of a

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,960
reaction to some of the

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,800
uh perceived limitations of some of the

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,360
uh architecture tools that we have been

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,000
using

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,720
uh previously um so one of the things

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,800
that we saw

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,199
or we quite often see is architecture

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,840
tools kind of get used by architects

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,880
and not many other people really have

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,360
visibility

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,000
of that sort of domain which leads to

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,680
you know we get

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,840
lots of incomplete data sets you know

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,520
there'll be a program of work which goes

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,840
and collects a whole bunch of data

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,880
it then starts going stale it's only for

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,520
part of the bank

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,440
or part of the organization uh or you

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,800
know the methodology used to collect

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,520
and collate the data is pretty much ad

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,720
hoc

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,360
so walter's approach has been basically

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,880
kind of

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,560
that around a little bit and say well

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,800
actually rather than it being

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,560
a the architecture groups uh

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,000
function to populate this sort of

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,080
repository of information

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,240
let's open the uh let's open the

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,840
the doors and get the data capture

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,960
coming in from the users from their

00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,199
developers

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,720
within the organization it's kind of

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,919
taking an open source approach in a way

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,960
we're taking like a collaborative

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,360
mini-ized

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,479
uh model where you know the more people

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,639
who are feeding data

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,240
in uh the more likely it is the more

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,120
pressure it is for a bit to correct

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,800
and also unearths uh some discrepancies

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,240
so if you've got a flow and someone says

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,599
this flow exists someone else says it

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,960
doesn't exist

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,639
uh quite often there might be some

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,080
touring and throwing but usually it

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,280
leads to a better understanding of the

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,120
organization

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,720
the other thing that we're finding very

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,479
powerful about walt

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,160
is basically using it as a tool to

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,120
promote standardization within the

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,200
organization

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,399
you know so we are actively promoting

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,159
common taxonomies

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,159
so we're trying to describe processes in

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,519
the same way functions in the same way

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:44,240
and applying that across the bank

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,839
um looking forward we hope to sort of uh

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,279
accelerate that as more people start

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,440
using walls

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,720
the daughter perhaps looking at so doing

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,800
uh cross

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:57,360
interbank uh standardization which

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,160
there has been some interest uh talked

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,160
to other bank

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,560
in the past about uh going down this

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,560
avenue

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:11,440
um i'll do a demo of once

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:14,399
uh okay so waltz

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,399
um so

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,560
from the front page of waltz we can see

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,600
betterly we get a little a i'll be we

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,600
can see

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,920
uh get access to all the applications so

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,480
we can search for applications by name

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,839
we can look at recently used ones uh

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,120
we've got this thing here the

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:33,440
uh the recently updated application so

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,720
you can keep on top of your portfolio

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,399
which is the thing that jeff mentioned

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,360
she was instrumental in building this

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,360
out

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,560
um so we look at it very quickly an

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,640
application

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,800
this is just using sample data set hence

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,800
all the names are animals

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,880
and things we can see we've got basic

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,279
information about an application

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,720
who owns it in terms of the organization

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,720
we have a whole bunch of different

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,839
facets of data that we capture

00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,080
things around uh bookmarks uh change

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,959
initiatives that is linked to

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,640
data flows you can have diagrams uh

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,839
showing how the data is

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,839
flowing to the system we have statistics

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,440
we have all the people who work on the

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,519
thing what kind of

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,040
features from those standardized

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,360
taxonomies i mentioned

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,040
are being used uh mark's going to talk a

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,800
little bit more about how those features

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,279
used to derive sort of business value in

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,760
a minute i wanted to touch on one of the

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,320
the other features which is surveys uh

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,680
so

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,880
quite often we are using waltz to go out

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,440
and do

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,360
uh sort of fire drills or to do sort of

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,519
systematic data capture

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,959
and we can say okay fire out a survey

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,680
which you can configure and define

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,279
yourself

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,560
and send it out to all applications

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,519
which exhibit the following

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,279
characteristics

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,360
so send it to all applications which

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,200
belong to this part of the bank

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,600
which are involved in settlements and

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,800
you can then send out a more detailed

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,440
um questionnaire to

00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:01,120
to to solicit data which isn't doesn't

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,200
fit within the waltz data model

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,160
um with that i mean that's a very very

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,680
quick handover

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,200
there's lots of documentation and things

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,320
to look at but i'm going to hand over to

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,519
mark very quickly

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,079
and he's going to talk a little bit more

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,920
about the group of waltz

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,839
mark over to you thank thank you very

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,480
much yeah thanks very much perfect okay

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,079
yeah so i guess

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,760
the one one of these things within

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,519
deutsche bank obviously has been um

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,200
we've been adopted for over four years

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,279
now uh we've currently got over 15

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,040
000 users across the bank um and this

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,000
sort of translates to around two and a

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,040
half thousand

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,040
um user-driven um data changes

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,160
um one of one of the things just echoing

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,920
what david said earlier is

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,360
with with people being able to see the

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,959
information and being able to actually

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,000
look at it and and really get under the

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,440
skin of it

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,120
it motivates people to actually look at

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,320
it rather than it's been hidden away

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,760
with a couple of people that have got

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,640
access to it so it really does help

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,040
drive adoption

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,600
um so that definitely helps with the

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,600
next day

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,800
okay so i guess one of one of the key

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,240
things within waltz has been the uh

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,079
around has been the flows in the lineage

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,160
piece which i'll demonstrate in a second

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,120
um this really helps us to be able to

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,800
look at the and

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,959
look at the advise around the regulatory

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,880
and the audit pieces um that we have

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,399
obviously being able to show the

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,079
regulators will be able to show

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,600
um something with an audit where the

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,519
data has come where it's gone

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,800
um this is obviously you know really

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,240
helpful especially if we look at

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,160
some of the regulation we have across

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,680
across the industry to look at things

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:26,240
such as dfs 504 bcbs

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,720
um things like gdpr all those kind of

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,720
things where

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,079
the regulators are looking for lineage

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,680
and i can understand what's happening in

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,800
the data how the application's involved

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,600
in that kind of thing so that could be

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,040
used around

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,079
around that piece um i guess as i said

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,160
earlier so the the

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,160
the release level controls again this

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,600
really gives us more of a

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,959
more of a view and a control around

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,920
what's happening across our architecture

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,760
estate so

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,120
historically you know many organizations

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,320
really struggle to

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,600
you know look at the data and look at

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,240
what's actually moving across their

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,839
estate

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,279
by having data standards and looking at

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,959
them across

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,720
that application level this again gives

00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,200
us gives us another piece to actually

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,639
really

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,320
uh understand what's happening and have

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,480
some faith in

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,839
what's been documented by the architects

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,839
and by the application owners

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,800
and so um one thing i think david just

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,800
touched on which i will in a moment

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,480
so one thing we within the with having

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,120
an enterprise wide taxonomies

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,360
and standardized enterprise functional

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,279
taxonomies gives us the ability to uh

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,639
look at our app rationalization so again

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,200
we look at this for things like road

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,959
maps

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,079
and again it gives us that view to you

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,279
know things like the cost saving

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,240
initiatives to understand where there's

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,639
duplication

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,000
and just understand and ask questions it

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,079
just provides that lens which obviously

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,279
provides senior management a lot of uh

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:41,199
interesting conversations

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,199
and to redrive those kind of pieces

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,160
okay so as dave david mentioned earlier

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,920
and server surveys really are

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,800
that can be used for ad hoc sort of fire

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,760
drills that we can have across the

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,440
organization

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,199
but can also be used to support things

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,000
like your records management like legal

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,440
holds

00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,440
and especially things like architecture

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,519
governance to understand how projects

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,519
and programs aligned uh by architects

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,880
and program directors that kind of thing

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,800
and obviously walter can help within

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,399
that and again we could use waltz to

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,279
look at things like cloud migration to

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,760
understand

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,720
what the plan is and and how we wanted

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,240
to support that and

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,240
understand whether people could be ready

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,519
or not that's what some of the other

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,519
things that we can do within servers

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,720
and then as i mentioned earlier the

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,079
documents in the roadmaps

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,600
looking at your sort of business

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,399
functions and sort of looking at from an

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,399
application

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,160
lens and saying how is this going to

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,160
roll up in the future how do we see how

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,000
do we see our estate moving

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,279
now i will try again to see if i can

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,839
share my screen and i'll

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:45,839
run through a very quick demo and just

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:45,839
give me two seconds

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,440
okay let's see where this works this

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,440
time

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,839
okay dave can you see the screen

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,120
yeah quite the same okay okay uh watch a

00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,800
little bit better so um

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,399
as i will show you this is your typical

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,839
view of an application

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,279
a couple of things i wanted to call out

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,639
is we have the functionality to be able

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,800
to look at attestations

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,639
and again what this can help show us is

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,399
somebody has gone in and tested out the

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,480
the logical flow so the point-to-point

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,160
flows are correct and obviously you can

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,920
see you know when it was done and who

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,680
did it and those kind of pieces

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,240
um i'll talk again around the data flows

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,800
again one of the really uh interesting

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,639
pieces and

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,480
pieces that excite all the people across

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,120
uh across the world

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,959
uh user base is being able to look very

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,519
easily around what applications moving

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,519
across the

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,360
state where it's going to and the sort

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,279
of information that's moving

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,839
again this gives us that transparency

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,759
that regulates an audit

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,959
like rather than hidden away in excel

00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,959
spreadsheets or

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,160
powerpoints or access databases it's

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,000
very clean and

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,759
gives a clean representation to to show

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,040
you what's moving across

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,800
and again especially when you can then

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,079
relate to your applications to

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,320
things like your business functions to

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,480
say what are your applications doing

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,839
uh maybe your products and again in this

00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,680
case the regulation

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,880
um and the one one great thing that

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,000
waltz does

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,759
which probably isn't pulled out enough

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,199
is obviously all this information is

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,480
really useful on an application

00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,680
application basis

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,199
but when you start rolling into

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,680
different levels of the organization or

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,040
by

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,279
different levels of management obviously

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,360
it becomes a far more powerful tool

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,839
okay uh on that note cameron i'll move

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,839
across to you

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,120
thank you mark um everyone so i'm just

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,360
going to talk briefly about

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,880
the uh challenges that we've faced uh

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,480
developing uh open source software

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,240
within about um

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,480
principally one of the most difficult

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,600
things is pushing the actual code out

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:41,680
of the internal network um and

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,680
i'll just share my screen briefly

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:49,040
so obviously as you know there's the the

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,079
the spinoffs master we've booked the uh

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,920
fisher bank

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,839
repo as well we don't actually actually

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,800
commit to this because

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,000
all our day-to-day development is done

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,880
on

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,399
on an internal repository and this goes

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,240
through a full rise review process as

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,600
well as a data leakage check

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:10,720
before it goes out to the to the public

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:14,400
uh repository um and in this way we

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:16,480
kind of manage our risk and ensure that

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,240
corporate security concerns are kind of

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,000
valid

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,760
when these when these branches or our

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,640
code changes make it out they their

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,199
first branches

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,400
uh within our repo and then through the

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,600
normal process you could create a full

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,760
request

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,840
for the finos milestone and that will

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,600
get reviewed as

00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,799
possible so that's how you essentially

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,039
get started and

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,919
we found is the easiest way to to start

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:42,640
committing

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:45,600
um whilst being a uh

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,280
a tool it requires a lot of data to kind

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,400
of make the best of it

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:54,000
centering around people

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,000
organizational units applications

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,440
applications and

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,559
sorry excuse me um but in order to kind

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,679
of populate that data that we found the

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,480
most effective way

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,760
to do an etl to um and populate that

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,760
directly into the database

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,039
uh whilst they are editing screens in

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,440
waltz these are

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,559
usually adult things like bookmarks and

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,160
data flows

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:23,200
but never intended for bulk uh insertion

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,760
so we actually developed a our own

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,720
scheduling framework which runs on a

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,160
lively basis built

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:33,280
on ports and this

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,640
is built on custom java code which

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,039
allows us to

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,000
scan data from various disparate sources

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:41,760
uh

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,440
massage it into the form of the waltz

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,960
needs and then push directly into the

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,400
database and this has worked really

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,120
really well for us because

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,160
we source data from other databases uh

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,440
web services

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,120
uh csv files

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,840
anything really that you can access to

00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,840
the java code

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,559
and the most common data sets that you

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,039
you typically need to get started

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,600
are application data organizational

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,799
units

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:11,520
people and then

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,120
logical flows and physical flows are

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,640
direct

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,840
follow on from those um the other thing

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,880
that we have

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:23,520
deeply have difficulty with in in

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,520
dealing with

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,400
is dealing with bespoke requirements

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,960
that you you find inside of a

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,400
enterprise and then also trying to fit

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,880
those for the general use case that

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,240
waltz

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,600
uh the world's um caters for which it

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,160
being an optional product

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,039
and some of these things can be kind of

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,559
standardized through

00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,400
terminology and having the standardized

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:47,760
work for standardized roles

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,640
uh due to kind of

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,520
provide a common theme in other cases

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,200
what these taxonomies that

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,200
mark we're showing where you can

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,679
actually soft code a lot

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,120
the the hierarchy that we have and then

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,960
provide ratings from them

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:08,159
um we also have cases where we need

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,720
to present data from wolves in in

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,480
slightly different ways reporting

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,480
reporting to different

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,520
parts of the business or even to

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,880
regulators

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,280
and in that case the database is

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,640
available to query

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:25,760
and use bi tools like tableau or

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:28,320
click view to to then combine that

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,200
database with other data pieces of data

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,799
to define

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:36,480
random reporting and and

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:38,320
present the data in interesting ways um

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,640
i'm going to pass it on to jess who will

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:44,799
talk more about how we get started

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,799
with waltz from a coding perspective

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,240
thanks so dave is actually going to be

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,320
my mouse clicker today

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,880
so dave if you could load up the main

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,559
github page that would be great

00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,159
but i thought today i could spend some

00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,799
time talking about how to get involved

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,520
and how

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,760
to contribute towards world you can see

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,200
here on our overview of the project we

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,720
have a variety of different modules

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,960
which some of which represent

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,400
sort of a layer architecture so we have

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,320
for example walt's web

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,520
which contains all the end points our

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,600
world data which

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,880
has all our down methods and this sort

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,480
of breakup of the project makes it

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,000
really easy to navigate around and know

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,679
where you're looking for

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,280
also from someone who's also being new

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,280
to the team what i found particularly

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,039
useful was the waltz common folder

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,960
so this contains a lot of our reusable

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,200
codes so utilities methods so

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,720
for example if we wanted to work with

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,080
sets we can go in here find our set

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,159
utilities class

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,919
and there's a lot of already pre-written

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,880
code there which makes it more standard

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,640
across the whole

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,200
project and it's just really helpful if

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:46,000
it's something you want to look for

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,280
um another thing or another feature of

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,760
waltz and how we work

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,200
is our ability to stick to naming

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,559
conventions and this makes it

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,720
also really easy to find what we're

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,440
looking for for example if we wanted to

00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,200
find

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,480
the application overview if dave could

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,480
just search for a file

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,520
it is as simple as that application view

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,720
or application

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,960
overview depending on which component

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,880
you want to look for and again a lot of

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,600
our main views have dynamic sections

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,360
beneath

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,039
these can be shared across different

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,640
pages but if we want to search for a

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,760
specific section we just go to

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,400
the dynamic section definition file

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,600
and here we'll see a breakdown of all of

00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,080
these

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,080
the individual ids for each one and the

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,080
name of the file

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,320
that we can search for for example if we

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,120
look at take the top one the app section

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,559
you can see that has an id of one and

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,520
you would simply search the file app

00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,200
section

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,720
that's very consistent across the code

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,080
base

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,320
if we could just go back to the main

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,720
overview of waltz again dave we can also

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,520
see

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,400
a folder for our documentation we call

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,240
it docs

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,600
and inside this you'll have an overview

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,960
of all our features

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,039
you'll have an overview of some of our

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,840
designs and some of our development

00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,480
practices

00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,919
so this is really helpful so not only by

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,000
contributing code or reviewing

00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:01,280
pull requests you can also help faults

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,480
and contribute towards vaults by

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,320
giving feedback on our designs or

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,720
feedback on our existing features so

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,000
if we just take a look at some of these

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,440
perhaps in the design section

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,360
you can see some of the later changes

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,960
we've implemented for example

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,799
on the home page and you can see some

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,000
sort of mock-ups um so it's really a

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,679
great way to sort of get a feel for

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,559
what's coming and give us some feedback

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,559
on those features

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,559
we could also uh look into features in

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,000
more detail when we get round to

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,200
thinking about development we tend to

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,120
create an issue

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,200
so if you can go into the development

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,159
folder inside of docs dave

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,760
we will see our issue management readme

00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,159
and this gives a description of how we

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,840
tend to use issues through github to

00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,640
help our development practice

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,159
so each issue when it's created uh is

00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,400
assigned to

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,840
a milestone and for each release we have

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,000
an individual milestone

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,720
and then in the current release we'll

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,720
have three milestones for work that is

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,720
uh to do work is that work in progress

00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,200
and work is that already done

00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,919
and we also utilize the label features

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,360
so if you're

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,960
new and want to get involved in waltz

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,159
quite often would look for a label which

00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,880
is a small change

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,919
or a good first issue because these tend

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,240
to be straightforward

00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,440
easy to implement changes um whereas if

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,799
you're looking for something sort of

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,760
what's coming next in walter you might

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,640
want to look for something that's

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,240
noteworthy

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,440
these tend to be issues you want to flag

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,320
or something that other people might

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,559
want to know about

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,559
a big change to the code there

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,640
perfect so if we just take a look at the

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,039
individual issues and david you could

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,200
sort by the number of comments on those

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,559
we can see a really great example of how

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,640
we've had feedback

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,960
an end user and implemented that in the

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,400
code this would go by most commented the

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,320
top one there

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,320
should be the docker sample installer

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,159
waltz we can see here someone called

00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,880
albert lee's come back with some

00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,919
enhancements to this issue and then

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,799
other members of the team have gone

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,799
through

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,320
uh responded to these changes and then

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,919
very helpfully they at the end of this

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,760
has created a screencast

00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,520
um which you may develop available to

00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,200
talk through the latest feature

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,559
so i'm just going to show you how we can

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,400
find these screencasts

00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,679
um they're relatively new so we've only

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,200
got a few at the moment but dave if you

00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:08,240
go back to the code

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:11,840
and then to works.finos.org and then

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,360
to the blog tab you'll see a screencast

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,440
of some of the latest features also

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,360
things about like how to get started

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,960
um as well so that's really helpful for

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,520
people just looking at the projects for

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,880
the first time

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,640
that's kind of the main things i wanted

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,799
to touch on today but it might also be

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,320
worth mentioning a few of the

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,320
pieces of future functionality that's

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,039
coming up so one of the things we're

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,480
looking to

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,080
into at the moment is things called

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,960
conditional surveys so i know they've

00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,279
touched on surveys

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,080
earlier at the moment it's a simple list

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,520
of questions

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,960
some of which are mandatory and

00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,480
hopefully in the next few releases we're

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,600
looking to make this a lot more tailored

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,279
a lot more flexible

00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,200
by introducing some predicates to

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,080
questions which describe whether or not

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,919
they should be shown

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,679
either based on answers to previous

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,279
questions in the survey or

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,440
features of your application itself for

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,480
example if it's retiring

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,360
so i just want to open that up to the

00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,720
rest of the team if there's anything

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,320
else they want to talk about

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,760
um into future features or hand back to

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,600
her

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,039
on the next segment i think there's one

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,039
of the thanks

00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,120
jess just just wanted to quickly mention

00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,159
some of the sort of the themes for the

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,080
future

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,360
um so as just mentioned you know one of

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,600
the things that we've found has been

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:21,120
very successful is the surveys

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:23,200
um but also we are increasingly moving

00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,320
uh future state uh views of

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,760
organizations

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,600
so we're taking all of the data that

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,360
waltz has uh currently

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,480
or historically it's been very much

00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:34,880
around uh current state so how does the

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,400
technology landscape look right now uh

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,159
but we've been adding in more and more

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,840
future state stuff so we've been adding

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,720
in road map support

00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,200
uh and you know architectural governance

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,200
showing

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,960
how flows will change over time what

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,880
apps are being commissioned which ones

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,240
are going to be decommissioned

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,480
uh etc that's something that's gonna

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,520
undergo if development we've got

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,159
basically funding

00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,960
and plans uh through to next year

00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,279
sometime

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,159
to keep building those sorts of features

00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,320
out

00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,600
um so there's gonna be a lot of work in

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,559
that other area

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,720
plus we're also just cons consistently

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:13,679
reviewing you know ease of use

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,400
uh and also just the comprehension of

00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,000
the data

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,840
it's quite a large co uh body of data

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,240
that people

00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,919
uh can sift through so we're always

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,279
looking at where to present things

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,080
better i think cam mentioned at the

00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,840
beginning

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,440
you know we are very interested in you

00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,039
know looking at visualizations to help

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,880
people stay on top of

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,880
uh the data setting waltz and how it's

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:38,640
changing

00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,880
that's my timer uh that's pretty much

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,320
everything i think we wanted to cover

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,440
from a presentation

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:48,320
point of view yeah james i think we're

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:51,200
ready to move into the q a of

00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,760
absolutely so thank you for setting a

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,520
timer

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,039
um i think you better go and check the

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,159
cake that's in the oven

00:27:55,039 --> 00:28:00,720
um i hope it's not burning um

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,200
okay so before we actually go to the q a

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,679
um

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,679
i'd like to actually uh just reveal the

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,880
winners of the finnos t-shirts as i said

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,360
at the beginning

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,279
of the meet-up so i'm pleased to

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,559
announce that the first t-shirt winner

00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:15,120
is adam jones

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:17,200
um from code think and the second

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,000
t-shirt winner is james bennett from

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,320
delight

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,640
so the finals team will be in contact

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,440
with you for your um shipping details

00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,440
thank you very much um so for the people

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,480
who are on the point

00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:33,600
um no problem no problem whatsoever

00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,919
um feel free to put your questions um in

00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,159
the fit not in the webex chat

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,520
um but in the meantime i do have a

00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,600
question from kevin

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,679
um so thank you kevin for asking this

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,960
about 15 minutes ago

00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,520
and the the question is say this is kind

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,360
of like

00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,720
an open source solution stroke

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,760
alternative to what

00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,279
the libra is doing so david i don't know

00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,080
if you're able to pick up on that

00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,480
whether there's

00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,080
any you know proprietary alternatives or

00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,760
proprietary software

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,200
that waltz is actually providing

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,320
functionality as an

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,080
alternative okay yeah so calibre is

00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,360
actually something we use extensively in

00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:13,120
the bank as well

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,559
uh so calibre we use quite often for

00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,120
doing some of the more sort of formal

00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:20,159
taxonomy management which we then import

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:22,720
into waltz um

00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,919
so quite often things like the data

00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,360
taxonomy

00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,440
so each of the flows we didn't really

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,240
show it in the demo but the flows can be

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,080
marked

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,000
uh can be tagged with the type of data

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,640
that they contain you know is it risk

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,080
data is it position data etc

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,880
um so that actual registry of data types

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,960
is held by um

00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,640
calibra it also does things such as you

00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,760
know storing

00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,919
um a register of authority sources

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,520
so who should be supplying that data

00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,600
waltz then consumes that

00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,960
and there's some authority statements

00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,600
within waltz

00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,159
um so you can then grade those data

00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,799
flows

00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,320
and say well this flow is authoritative

00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,360
because it's getting settlement data

00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,360
from a

00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,200
proper settlement system whereas this

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,279
one is not authoritative because it's

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,559
getting it from some other system

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:13,600
um so we do sit beside calibra uh there

00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,570
is a little overlap

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,880
uh in terms of like the um

00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:18,480
[Music]

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,399
uh some of the feature set in terms of

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,520
the taxonomy management etc

00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:25,279
but we found that really calibra is kind

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,840
of more of a specialist tool

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:29,679
and walt's is niche is usually when it

00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,960
comes to socializing that data out to

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,880
the wider enterprise

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,640
and also combining it with other data

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:39,039
sets as we got a bit more flexibility uh

00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,320
with how we go about visualizing things

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,520
which is some of the stuff that we've

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,200
had problems

00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:47,440
uh with calibra brilliant

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,960
absolutely kevin says thank you in chat

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,159
so thank you kevin for answering that

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,360
and thank you david for

00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,480
um for answering um we have another

00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,000
question from richard

00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:00,000
um he's just um text

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,480
can you share this internally with your

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,679
company and externally with suppliers

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,679
service providers etc for shared systems

00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,679
this seems focused on internal staff at

00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:14,159
the moment

00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:14,159
um i'm not quite sure i mean the

00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,480
the date the security model is

00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:20,000
relatively open so

00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,640
i think there probably may be some

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,919
issues with allowing

00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:28,960
uh third parties

00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:32,320
direct access into a waltz install we

00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:35,120
are consistently well we are uh

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,159
more and more security controls as time

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,080
goes by

00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,880
um so that's something that may change

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,919
but at the moment it is predominantly

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,080
inward looking although we do track

00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,279
for instance on physical flows on the

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,399
flow information

00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:51,519
we do flows obviously going out uh to

00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,440
third parties

00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,960
you know so we've got either actors

00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,960
which are things like

00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,120
uh chief risk officers or we have actors

00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:03,200
which are external institutions

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:06,640
such as the bank of england um

00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:08,399
but yes um i think we'd have to discuss

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,440
a bit more about the use case of

00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,440
uh airing

00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:17,279
with uh external parties

00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,159
so richard um feel free to raise an

00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,159
issue um

00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:22,000
on the water project in github and maybe

00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,480
we can continue the conversation there

00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,480
that's a good idea um so we have two

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,760
more questions and we're kind of running

00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,440
out of time so we'll um

00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,360
maybe answer these two just very quick

00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,600
so uh the first is from

00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,799
lee what is the state of user

00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,880
documentation i

00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:39,039
use a manual how do we get started

00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,720
configuring it getting data into a new

00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,720
instance

00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,559
okay that's something that's in common

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,060
with a lot of open source projects is

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:49,440
is missing or not missing but uh is um

00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:52,000
[Music]

00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,840
needs attention we have a fair bit of

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,279
documentation around the feature set

00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,760
what we don't really have at the moment

00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:00,880
is a really smooth getting started guy

00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,200
there are some on the screencasts which

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,960
is

00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,399
technology getting started here how to

00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,480
get it up and running

00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,760
uh but we do need to provide some more

00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,519
information about you know getting the

00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,880
data sets in some of the stuff that cam

00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,279
was mentioning about

00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,559
you know writing the uh you know

00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,559
bringing in

00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,600
data sets around organizational units

00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,279
etc

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,519
we do have some documentation within

00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:24,559
deutsche bank that's currently being

00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:27,200
evaluated and being checked for ip

00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,799
issues i'm hoping that those will form

00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,880
the the sort of the bedrock

00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,559
of the documentation system in the very

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,559
near future

00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:36,320
that's awesome and um if you are

00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:37,039
somebody who would like to get involved

00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,600
in

00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:41,679
helping the team with documentation um

00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,360
open source isn't just for developers

00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,519
so if you're somebody who likes to write

00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,960
documentation um feel free to get

00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,080
involved with the team and maybe help

00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,559
out

00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,000
um and this is um from james so our

00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,840
final question

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,679
thanks for the presentation team what

00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,519
kind of challenges did you face with

00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,600
getting users at deutsche bank to use

00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:01,039
waltz presumably this supersedes

00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:04,840
existing technology

00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:06,880
catalogues stroke taxonomy taxonomy

00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:10,720
repositories

00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:12,480
um yes i mean waltz we kind of grew

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,079
initially sort of organically you know

00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,359
grew out of uh we work in the group

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,879
architecture team

00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,800
and we started starting the elements for

00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:20,240
ourselves and then we started people

00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,159
started using it and it's grown

00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,320
organically that way

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,520
getting people on board hasn't been too

00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,240
much of a challenge

00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:30,960
unless we're running up against a kind

00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,399
of an incumbent in that sort of area

00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,240
so there's certain areas of the bank

00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:37,520
which might use tools such as

00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,639
planning i.t they tend to be pockets uh

00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,079
within the bank

00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,000
and for those we've been looking at you

00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,679
know doing enhanced integration

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,359
and then talking longer term about

00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,000
whether or not it's viable for them to

00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:49,359
move

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,119
on to walt's full scale uh with regards

00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,960
to taxonomy management there's not an

00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:55,919
awful lot out there

00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,720
in use in the bank which is uh dealing

00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:59,599
with that

00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:01,119
um apart from calibra which we've

00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,839
already integrating with

00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,680
and around things like flows then we're

00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:08,960
already doing some work with

00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:11,040
uh tools like solid artists uh so

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,320
solid artists perhaps feeds off walls

00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,480
while whilst we provide

00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,079
kind of the macro view the high level

00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,760
view of flows in the bank

00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,440
and then solid data will go in and

00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,800
perhaps provide the the real

00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:26,720
low level detail view um and that's

00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,240
sort of active on uh development and

00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,560
we'll be working on that in the coming

00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:33,599
months that's brilliant

00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,280
so with that i'd like to draw this

00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,280
virtual meet up to a close

00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,640
and say thank you to everybody he's

00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,359
attended today

00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,560
um so uh please feel free to go to

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,920
finnos.org

00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,839
where you'll be able to see up and

00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,560
coming events um

00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:50,800
and also um other you know bigger events

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:53,119
like um the open source strategy forum

00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,800
and you know other um online virtual

00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:57,280
conferences that um
