	00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:07,639
my company is Miller software bestowing

00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:09,590
a muscle bra we've been operating the

00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:11,930
footprint source software for about 20

00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:14,599
years and financial systems logistics

00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:16,640
systems create shaking systems so I'm

00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:18,789
just here to share some of my experience

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,310
with you about open source software and

00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:24,439
also basically sale as some of the best

00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,300
open source software on the market that

00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:29,239
perhaps you would consider using in

00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:32,809
financial systems so just a few thoughts

00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:36,260
about like about like the the previous

00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:42,410
presenter on why will involve little

00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:44,870
open source personally its long-running

00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:47,360
conversations I mean I did a lot of work

00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:49,670
probably like most of you subcontracting

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,670
going around various institutions banks

00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:54,470
etc and when you were with your your

00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,900
work colleagues you know in the minute

00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:58,370
project ends or attain the conversations

00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,690
in this well but that tends not to

00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,040
happen we open source software

00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,050
you know these projects can be

00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,489
long-running projects particularly if

00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:06,110
you're involved in you know the Apache

00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:07,819
open source projects it can be running

00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:10,429
for years and years and the people

00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:12,530
involved are hugely passionate they'll

00:01:10,429 --> 00:01:14,390
drift end or drift back out those

00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,890
projects but you know the conversations

00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,289
will keep running and I've got people

00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:21,170
that are still keeping contact and open

00:01:18,289 --> 00:01:22,429
source from 20 years ago and it's great

00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,560
because they're they bought their

00:01:22,429 --> 00:01:26,119
experiences about what my experiences

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,659
and we tend to share share based

00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:31,670
practice the market access is actually

00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:33,139
quite interesting you know you you could

00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,759
be in the middle of our an Apache open

00:01:33,139 --> 00:01:36,350
source projects you know minding your

00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:38,090
own business and then suddenly you'll

00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:39,409
get a call from from a huge company you

00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,840
know you're added a feature which which

00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:43,219
is critical to their needs and they

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,020
would like a little bit support around

00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:47,840
it so that kind of thing happened to me

00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,880
escape but I was involved on all app

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,130
online analytical process and

00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,469
application which is open source and

00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:56,119
skate we're using it for doing the other

00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:58,009
analysis that the telephony analysis

00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:01,159
this is long before makers off bought

00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:02,859
them and they picked up asked for

00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:04,849
support and an American company that

00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:06,709
commercialized that software called

00:02:04,849 --> 00:02:08,030
Pentaho they asked us to be their

00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:10,280
partner in the UK and we were the

00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:13,160
longest longest runners longest-running

00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,440
Pentaho partner in the UK and that opens

00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,420
so many doors for us and people with

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,580
people in the pins out

00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:20,920
munity and people who were using that

00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,810
all up engine so you know it can open

00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,849
open doors open sources know they're

00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:27,250
better and worse quit have quite a

00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:30,160
mature financial market you know you try

00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:32,140
and sell financial software into the

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,630
Umbra market it's quite tough you know

00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:36,940
our hats off to the Scott logic for

00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:38,670
actually but actually doing that you

00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:41,440
might find it easier you know

00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:43,540
commercializing or supporting one of the

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,920
existing open source packages which the

00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,110
financial institutions are actually

00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,370
using but are very short and skills on

00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,140
know you could provide training around

00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:52,360
that you could provide adaptations are

00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,250
doing that and that gets you that gets

00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:58,269
you through the door which you may find

00:02:54,250 --> 00:03:00,760
quite quite difficult as a start-up so

00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:02,739
again no previous speaker chorus or

00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,239
learning from peers many pinyon involved

00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:05,680
in some of the big open source projects

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,850
you you're picking up fantastic

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,390
experience from some of the top

00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:11,530
developers in the world I hope you use

00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:14,769
test-driven development how it used

00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,930
partner and the build that skill how to

00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:18,700
have to build the software using the

00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,650
latest technology as well so you're

00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,739
picking all that up in the open-source

00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:25,090
community so the close interesting

00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:27,040
you've all comes from a vironment and

00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:29,140
environment we were started off doing

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,760
you know machine cooled and moved to

00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,489
languages then it was application

00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,620
servers and they were moving in a cloud

00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:37,690
environment you may think what's the

00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,910
relevance of open source when you're

00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:42,130
dealing with people like Amazon Cloud

00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:44,709
when you're dealing with Google we are

00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:45,640
dealing with with may make us off well

00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:47,440
you look at some of these technologies

00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,579
maybe in an Amazon part I mean you look

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,190
at some of these technologies like

00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:53,620
Amazon Athena well Amazon Athena is

00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,420
based on in Prestel which is an open

00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:58,690
source project which Facebook open

00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:00,069
sourced and Amazon I've adapted it for

00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:02,590
their stack but if you're a weird of

00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:04,120
Prestel before before armors and then

00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,950
you know you've got a head start the

00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,709
market you know work with us with this

00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:13,620
kit similarly another big database

00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:13,620
software produced by Amazon is Amazon

00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:18,729
what was a deer beasts offer their name

00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:20,380
escapes me but it's obvious Olympus cos

00:04:18,729 --> 00:04:22,510
you know and push crystal very very

00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:25,390
common open source open source software

00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:26,530
so you'll find a lot of that a lot of

00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:29,890
these stacks and all these regular

00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:31,700
organizations are commercial

00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,860
adaptations of open source projects

00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:36,560
because the license free and they can

00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,880
they can steal them oh so it give it

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,310
gives you a route into the into the

00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,870
internals of the CRO the cloud in

00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:44,060
creative integration is really one of

00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:47,660
the new marketplaces for business

00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:51,290
software companies banks are moving

00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:53,180
their their data and take load they're

00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:54,680
moving into detail X and the cloud or

00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:57,050
moving it into D a weird houses in a

00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,060
cloud I think but a closed providers

00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,400
Lakey double yes and I actually open up

00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,410
marketplaces so you could never tap

00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,250
these businesses and there they are

00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:09,800
previously but you could actually build

00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:12,230
applications that run in these and these

00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,300
marketplaces and have them running in

00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:17,600
corporate applications a corporate

00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:20,000
environments and your obvious are trust

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,620
this you do and get your software and

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,840
you know and if they can see it via

00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:26,120
open-source that's a it's an easier way

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,590
of moving newer applications into the

00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,390
market and also if you if you're

00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:31,070
building on top you open source you know

00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:32,510
you're not starting from scratch you

00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,710
know you're you you're near that you

00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:35,420
need or the finishing line if you're

00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:37,490
building your applications on on quality

00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:39,950
open source open source software and

00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,450
just say just finally on you know open

00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:44,660
sources the key is it encourages

00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:47,420
cooperation and that's key in Edinburgh

00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:49,760
and and James James touched on that if

00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,960
you're involved in finance you can see

00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,100
the millions opposed that have been

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:58,040
spent on IR fs9 on my feet to on GDP are

00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:00,260
all the buzz words every single bank and

00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,730
institution is spending millions of

00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,500
pounds meeting is meeting this

00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,880
regulation and it's forcing the smaller

00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,590
players they because they you know they

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,540
can't afford to vote it from scratch and

00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:11,960
there's very little you know cooperation

00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:13,760
around that software and if the the

00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,740
financial open-source community can

00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,240
create a market around are where these

00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,220
ideas are shared because it's not core

00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,840
business you know a lot less regulated

00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,130
reporting they all just have to do it

00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,010
you know it's not it's not cool business

00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:27,320
if ferno's can actually create a market

00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,910
around that then it gives yourselves you

00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:33,200
know an opportunity now flew into that

00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:35,150
market so open source for me as a key so

00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,150
I'm going to introduce a technology

00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:40,760
stack here again it's not on one stack

00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:42,920
Linux Pentaho kettle Apache druid Apache

00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,280
superset Allegro I'm gonna touch the

00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,200
more brief

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,240
because as a flash talk I'm gonna whiz

00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,770
through it and hopefully take some pics

00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,260
on creations at the end it's built

00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,820
around a payment processing system just

00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,500
to make it interesting but all I'm

00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,840
trying to do is get you to try and

00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,419
investigate these open-source projects

00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,340
ourselves and hopefully use them in your

00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:05,540
in your work environment so we'll start

00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:07,400
off this is a with Pentaho date and

00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,810
aggression it's a Swiss Army knife or

00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,470
moving deer around your organization's

00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:16,400
in a no cloud any no adab sees it does

00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:18,169
template driven ETL and there's a others

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,720
I start up and plug in the rich plug-in

00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:21,830
marketplace which you can develop

00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,620
applications for and there's a huge

00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:26,350
active open source community which have

00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:29,090
some great meetings in the continent so

00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm going to demo with that we're gonna

00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:35,270
have a look at Apache super set this is

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,940
basically an open source - boarding and

00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:39,650
reporting analytics framework which

00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,960
hopefully you know you'll you'll pick up

00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:44,030
an ad or can start using it for perhaps

00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,030
operational analysis and your and your

00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:50,020
environments and in and then move on for

00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:53,810
doing perhaps regulated reporting with

00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:55,790
Apache druid as well but a rule of enemy

00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,210
I've ever used coulombís de basis in the

00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:59,090
past

00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:03,289
- basically big fat spreadsheets which

00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:05,479
allow you to pivot dia I actually drew

00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:07,490
it as a pivot table and steroid some you

00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:10,970
know allow you to pivot terabytes

00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:14,330
petabytes of data at monster scale it's

00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:16,880
free it's open source allows you to have

00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:19,130
my SQL access and there's a rest

00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,539
interface too as well it's fantastic at

00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,500
things like stream and analytics if

00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:23,300
you're buildin

00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,400
Financial API is and you wonder what the

00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,979
full of the or through your API is as

00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,600
stake that the enter into into druid

00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:31,490
it will compress it or do pre

00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,940
aggregations on it and the performance

00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:38,240
will be absolutely phenomenal use cases

00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:41,419
for Apache druid telemetry application

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:49,130
monitoring quality a server soup so it

00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:52,540
just jump back yeah funnel analysis uses

00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:55,060
patterns AP tests and content target and

00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:56,420
user segmentation and marketing

00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,519
conversion

00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:00,649
creates exact says all that stuff is

00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:02,450
great what we're working on is anomaly

00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:04,399
detection you pump this and pump your

00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:06,230
data through druid there's another

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,260
open-source technologies called share

00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:11,420
lock and it will look because druids

00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,850
focused on time-series analytics it'll

00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:16,040
look at peaks and troughs of your data

00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:17,630
over time and then you can set up a

00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,279
layer so it will come back to you and

00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:20,750
say there's something wrong in that we

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,240
even go and go and have a look at that

00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:25,760
data yeah so there's all sorts of clever

00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,649
stuff and a bit like pin sawa there's

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,750
also a plug-in an environment for it so

00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:31,339
you can build plug-ins for druids so

00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,139
Jude make me you know money

00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:35,570
well one of the financial institutions

00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:37,850
in Edinburgh will pick up druid and you

00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:39,470
may have some fancy plugins which you

00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:42,500
think are appropriate to the banking

00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,760
market it was a much easier sale to get

00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,139
those onto the into the druid

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,070
infrastructure and then you can support

00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:50,980
that further from the bank I'm going to

00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:53,630
show you I a nice really nice

00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:57,139
open-source package which is built by

00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:58,699
our publish company called Allegro and

00:09:57,139 --> 00:10:00,949
that gives you the visual visual

00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:03,589
PivotTable aspects of druid again

00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:05,300
because it's a druid I'll do analysis at

00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:08,750
massive scale although easy to drill

00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:10,339
down to the raw level transactions and

00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,470
you can do all sorts of smart tame

00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:14,329
cheaters now analytics I appreciate your

00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:16,640
time there's a staffing I'm gonna show

00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:21,110
you about the live demo come out with

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:24,230
that and sure Kevin come on so I'm just

00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:26,750
going to try and pick up on cattle in

00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:32,600
anyway familiar with cattle or using any

00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:34,910
other ETL tools nope right ETL was

00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,410
extract and transfer load so this could

00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:38,510
be your you know your your operational

00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:40,880
system or it could be Apache Kafka

00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:42,620
queues so you could have your you know

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,819
your your your raw data flowing through

00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:47,050
here but what we're essentially try and

00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:52,250
do at the end is produce a text file of

00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:54,769
all the information that we need for

00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:56,630
payment processing so we're building a

00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:57,980
payment processing system but obviously

00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:01,699
we can't show your live payment

00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:05,300
processing data but this little piece of

00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:08,240
ETA will allow you to to build dummy

00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:10,279
dummy tasty for for payment processing

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,810
I'll just show you a couple steps these

00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:15,439
these are so plugins that I was telling

00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:18,019
you about so this will generate random

00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:19,970
credit-card numbers for example so we're

00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:22,220
going to we're going to generate random

00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:24,410
visa numbers generate random MasterCard

00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:28,100
numbers and then the top line generates

00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:30,829
actual payments as we go through it can

00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,269
be a if you generate random D it can be

00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:35,540
quite boredom and you try and visualize

00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:38,029
it so we either ZAR a programmatic step

00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:40,220
here and there's all sorts of fancy

00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:43,670
maths going on here to get graphs which

00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:45,379
are showing some curves etc so yet you

00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:47,899
can use that this is one small

00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:49,790
application area of kale just to

00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:56,480
generate some payment dear so this is a

00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:58,160
fail hit cancel this is the application

00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,910
that we are using to open source

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,129
application

00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:02,899
this is apache license this is what

00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:06,100
we're using to generate the the payments

00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:12,040
dear so that ends up in Giroud I can

00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:17,480
come out here jump to the the website

00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:18,860
druid has a as an intra fees so a web

00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,769
interface here it's just running on a

00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:24,170
port of one of our Amazon servers so we

00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:26,540
go to data sources you can see we've got

00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:30,050
a variety of sources in here this is a

00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:33,620
cube flat file we're going to use if we

00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:38,059
just go to the SQL we can just generate

00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:43,040
some fancy SQL statement to show you the

00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:47,930
data that was coming over to this is

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:53,149
coming at kale too and was enriched to

00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:59,649
keep you there we go if you run this

00:12:53,149 --> 00:13:04,220
this is the data set something wrong oh

00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:05,899
it's just test just testing you see a

00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,790
few deliberate mistakes in here make

00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:10,579
sure you're all watching right so that's

00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:13,069
the data that was in the kettle ETL tool

00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:16,129
and that's no we're sitting up and say

00:13:13,069 --> 00:13:17,329
druid so we can actually query that the

00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,189
great thing about one of the great

00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:20,360
things a bit druid it's gone ask SQL

00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:22,759
antitheism it's also got a rest

00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,870
interface as well so if you're building

00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:25,970
dashboards

00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:27,680
or in top of a rest interface and you've

00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:30,530
got reports which are using a scale on a

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,180
face the figures will tie up Oh which is

00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,710
not always the case if you've got

00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:36,700
different information in different

00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:39,440
places yeah so this is the Andrew it

00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:42,560
very quickly jump to super set the built

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:45,500
a dashboard in super set five hours ago

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,560
and that's going to generally so whole

00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:50,540
nation these look super set this is

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,520
generally a dashboard based on you know

00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:54,380
number of transactions this year number

00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:57,020
of transactions this month some sort of

00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:59,900
cool KPI you can see some really nice

00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:01,760
graphs and here monthly transactions I

00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,290
my yearly comparison you can see some

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:07,810
differences here between this year and

00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:11,030
last year there's a table showing

00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:12,920
payment systems and the numbers that of

00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:14,810
cards state series which are authorized

00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,210
refund the refused this is showing the

00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:19,490
floor from two businesses two different

00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:23,810
payment gateways yeah they sort of

00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:25,700
filtering into fees at the top here yeah

00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:27,620
that's that's showing a different

00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,660
companies that were mocked up the

00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:32,450
payment D against but you can build all

00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:34,250
out that's three errors actually took

00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:36,230
about an hour what about developers this

00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:38,060
afternoon but that's sure the core in

00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:40,220
the dashboard it you can build with free

00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:41,660
and open source software and see what

00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,100
this is all on a URL you can you can

00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:46,190
distribute that around your range your

00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:48,050
organization really quite nice there

00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:50,780
last piece of technology I'm just going

00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:54,080
to show you is the same dealer and and

00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:55,880
say Tornillo now if you've used Excel

00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,160
pivot tables you'll get the idea he's

00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,570
stuff a whole world idea and to enter a

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,250
white table then you can slice and dice

00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,870
it probably exhale is that you're

00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:06,440
limited to about a million records if

00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:08,840
you turn illa up to druid there's no

00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,940
limit either to the number of rules that

00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,700
you'd like to process or to the width so

00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:16,750
what banks do a lot of profile and

00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:19,460
whether it's credit profile analysis or

00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:21,020
just just customer profile analysis and

00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:24,080
you could get you know you can get

00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:26,720
hundreds of profile points per customer

00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:28,910
and as these stretcho the capabilities

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,880
of modern databases start to peer off

00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:35,870
not-not-not saw with druid so please

00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,980
choose our sample cube so you can see

00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,490
here you've got really nice

00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,779
PMON

00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:40,820
statement interface you've got your

00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:46,610
dimensions here you've got your measures

00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:48,290
here just screw up and then you've got a

00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:50,390
nice sort of space and base interface

00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:53,270
the default isn't that interesting so

00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:56,720
we'll just take transaction ticket rates

00:15:53,270 --> 00:16:03,110
off take the boats off take the action

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:06,050
count off and then we'll try actually

00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:18,589
limpets right throwing in the payment

00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:23,050
type female status alright so got a nice

00:16:18,589 --> 00:16:25,820
table here payments and if we pool over

00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:28,580
that's just showing that the latest D if

00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:30,760
we flip that over and just sure right we

00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:34,089
won't just be see a year's rough idea

00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,089
hey okay

00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:46,550
not too interesting if we switch that to

00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:49,810
adding in the time and then perhaps

00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:49,810
switch it over to a graph

00:16:53,160 --> 00:17:01,389
so we're we're graphing transaction

00:16:56,019 --> 00:17:04,510
count over over the split dimensions

00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:06,730
which is peanuts status yeah I named

00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:11,589
have got a nice sort of filters over on

00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:13,630
the right hand side so we've never had

00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:15,250
to program any of this yeah we just

00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:17,140
basically point at the fact table and

00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:19,029
drew it it reverse the engineers what

00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,649
the dimensions are very engineers what

00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:23,500
the measures are and then all of a

00:17:20,649 --> 00:17:26,020
sudden you can create a are at massive

00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:29,620
scale yeah so that's that's that's

00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:32,020
that's the beauty of utilizing tools

00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:34,539
like Tornillo turner was up on github

00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:36,070
you can download you can download and

00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:39,340
get up and running in minutes it's even

00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:41,710
got like an unknown druid test framework

00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,690
which which can use with it okay

00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:45,130
appreciate that was a whistle-stop

00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:47,260
through i think my famous problem more

00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:50,919

there was any any for that day like any

00:17:50,919 --> 00:18:09,820
questions no super says oh you use SQL

00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:12,399
base and those are a graphical we are

00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:17,279
building your SQL statements up there so

00:18:12,399 --> 00:18:19,480
that's basically it any more questions

00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:25,869
